Center for Strategic & International Studies: Tech Crisis With ChinaTargeted News ServiceAugust 8, 2020 Saturday 8:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1344 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Center for Strategic and International Studies issued the following critical questions by James Andrew Lewis, senior vice president and director of Technology Policy Program:* * *Chinese tech companies have fallen under the hammer of the Trump administration. Huawei, ZTE, Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, Hikvision, and others all face sanctions and other measures intended to keep them out of the U.S. market and damage their global standing. These U.S. actions extend the growing restriction on tech transfer to China and might create a "tech rupture" between the two countries, but this was inevitable.Q1: Why is the United States doing this?A1: The United States is taking action against an aggressive and unconventional challenge from China. China's leaders want to replace the international order set up after 1945 with one that is China-centric and led by China. According to the FBI and government agencies in Europe, Australia, and Japan, China is engaged in a massive espionage campaign against the United States and other Western countries to steal technology and give Chinese companies an economic advantage; it has started a global influence campaign to persuade the world of China's technological prowess and inevitable rise; and it is home to the world's largest domestic surveillance system, which relies on information technologies and apps to monitor Chinese citizens. China may be trying to extend this domestic surveillance system globally. These three activities all pose national security risks to the United States and friendly countries.China has made very few concessions in the "trade war," and U.S. companies face considerable obstacles to doing business in China. Facebook, for example, is not allowed to compete in China. The Chinese government dislikes the idea of reciprocity in the treatment of foreign firms and, until recently, has been able to get away with unequal treatment. U.S. firms have been willing to put up with this because of the pull of China's vast market, but the overall effect has been to damage the American economy and those of Europe and Japan. Many companies argue that the financial benefits of doing business in China still outweigh the risks, but the Trump administration has taken a sledgehammer to this idea when it comes to Chinese tech companies. In China, if the government asks for help with spying or propaganda, Chinese companies are obligated to cooperate and have no appeal or recourse. This legal requirement is a cause of concern for the United States and makes it suspicious of any Chinese tech.Q2: What is the effect of recent actions?A2: The recent actions are bold and showy but have mixed effect. The biggest damage is probably to Chinese tech companies' "brand," since the United States has now publicly painted them as untrustworthy. Huawei and ZTE have been banned from the U.S. market, and a few other countries have taken similar steps. Chinese company ByteDance is being pressed to sell its subsidiary TikTok, which has a huge presence in the United States. Social network WeChat has a much smaller presence and is used mainly by Chinese resident in the United States; the effect on the company will be small, especially as the administration seems to have excepted Tencent's investment in the U.S. video game industry. Banning TikTok and WeChat from app stores will hurt China, but Apple will also be hurt if it cannot sell WeChat from its App Store. This may only accelerate China's effort to eliminate Apple from its domestic tech market.Clean Network, an initiative announced by Secretary of State Pompeo this week, does not (yet) have the force of law. Some of its measures, such as calling on U.S. companies to avoid Chinese cloud service providers or undersea cable companies, make sense. These are well-known avenues for spying. Others, such as the confusing ban on apps, only show the administration is still wrestling with how to deal with the new digital economy and are symbolic more of American displeasure than actual restrictions. It is an effort to keep TikTok from simply moving offshore and continuing to service the U.S. market. It presents an interesting regulatory problem--how do national rules catch a foreign-sourced, globally available app? The administration's solution, banning the user agreement that is part of any download, could be challenged in court and companies might be able to find a workaround. Other initiatives, such as the "Blue Dot Network," which grew out of a G20 effort calling for the use of safe, certified technologies have more international support.The economic effects are mixed. Chinese companies are not leaders in cloud service market and being cut out of the U.S. market, the world's biggest, does real harm. Huawei and ZTE are struggling, but Chinese government subsidies will keep at least Huawei in business until it can recover. TikTok is a global company, and while the United States was its most valuable market, it will continue to be profitable (as long as more countries don't follow India and ban it entirely). Measures to restrict Chinese access to U.S. financial markets will do immediate harm but will lead to a further dilution of American dominance of global finance as Chinese companies move to list and trade outside the United States.Q3: Can China retaliate?A3: The Chinese government is very sensitive to perceived slights and will need to take some action in response. Its options are more limited than many will admit. It will look to punish U.S. companies, but it will avoid punishing those upon which it is still dependent (like the semiconductor industry). Its previous restrictions limit its options--U.S. social media companies don't operate in China, and China still depends on U.S. chips and software. And repeated efforts by the Chinese government to force Chinese companies and government agencies to buy only Chinese software (in complete contradiction to China's World Trade Organization commitments) have failed because its business software is still not world class. It will look for those areas of trade with the United States where it can ban without harming China's interests, such as agriculture, consumer goods, and entertainment. It will accelerate its investments and espionage to make China technological independent.Q4: How will the rest of the world react?A4: The general statement heard in other countries is a desire to avoid being caught in the middle of the clash of two giants. Security partners will impose some complementary measures. A few countries will take advantage of the opening created by U.S. actions to expand sales in China. Distrust of China is growing globally--actions in Hong Kong, the domestic surveillance system, and other Chinese actions have raised suspicions in many countries, and many governments are increasingly concerned about China's predatory economic and trade policies. This does not immediately translate into support for U.S. actions--with a few exceptions (such as 5G), the administration has done a bad job of bringing allies and others along to share its views and take action, and a certain erraticism in implementation can be off-putting. The United States has had the opportunity to build shared opposition to China's aggressive behavior, but it has not taken it. Most countries will try and stay out of the way, look for business opportunities while reducing supply chain dependence on China, and be a little more suspicious of Chinese tech. Much will depend on how far the United States pushes a new economic and tech bifurcation, and how much it works to bring other countries along to share its views and actions.James Andrew Lewis is a senior vice president and director of the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.[Category: Political]Contact: H.

Clandestine labs, neglect and thousands of deaths: Alarm grows over China's little cooperation to stem the rise of fentanyl epidemicCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 17, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 3359 wordsBody"Since 2013, China has been the main source of fentanyl flooding the U.S. illicit drug market, fueling the deadliest drug epidemic in the country's history." After long denying this stark reality, there is growing international pressure on the Xi Jinping regime to increase control measures to prevent fentanyl smuggling, one of the deadliest and most epidemic drugs also suffered by the populations of Canada and Europe.There's no doubt about it anymore. The Asian giant is the great one responsible for this humanitarian drama that counts by hundreds of thousands its victims. In recent years the Communist Party of China (PCC) seems to have looked the other way, as thousands of underground labs, power-linked pharmaceutical companies, and even families, were dealing with the powerful narcotic. You didn't need a Pablo Escobar or a Chapo Guzmán. Nor loaded aircraft taking off from irregular runways. These pills arrived from China by public or private mail – US Mail, FedEx or UPS – to the homes of their consumers; without any kind of prescription. In small doses, these shipments are impossible for the authorities to track. The payment method is also difficult to follow: addicts use bitcoins as currency.It was only in mid-2019, and after major diplomatic efforts by the United States, China agreed to ban the production, sale and export of all fentanyl-class drugs. "The question now is whether and how effectively China will implement this new regulation, both in terms of finished fentanyl and the large quantities of fentanyl precursors sent to Mexico," the Brookings Institution argues in a recent report entitled "Fentanyl and Geopolitics: Control of China's Opioid Supply."In dialogue with Infobae, Vanda Felbab-Brown, an organized crime specialist and report director, explained that one of the main factors to be analyzed is whether China will have "the ability and willingness" to respect the new regulations. Trade tensions between the two countries, a priori, mean that it will not be easy to have close cooperation on the part of Beijing."One of the reasons China cooperated in rating fentanyl among drugs like cocaine was to find an area where it could cooperate with the Trump administration. This was particularly in the context of the trade war. And I think China hoped that, as a result of anti-narcotics cooperation, relations would improve, that trade war would come to an end. That hasn't happened," Felbab-Brown said.The senior member of the Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence in the Foreign Policy program of the Brookings Institute also detailed the different smuggling routes of fentanyl and the growing role of Mexican drug cartels, such as Jalisco Nueva Generación and Sinaloa.Although this opioid epidemic is mainly affecting the United States and Canada, he also warned that Europe should not be neglected: "In Europe there is a sense that fentanyl is an American problem. This is unwise. There is already fentanyl emerging on the continent.""The law enforcement challenge in China remains immense, due to the large number of existing and potential illicit producers and suppliers, with hundreds of thousands of legal chemical or pharmaceutical facilities that easily serve as sources of diversion. New clandestine installations may also emerge. The level of inspection and surveillance capacity in China is very insufficient for the scope of the necessary repression measures",underlines the report.-The report highlights China's lack of controls in the face of the advance of the opioid epidemic in recent years. Clandestine labs, pharmaceutical companies that act negligently... what analysis do they make of this situation, and how was the role of the United States in pressuring Beijing to change its regulations? -The crisis in the United States went through three phases. It was started by pharmaceutical companies that appropriated the entire regulatory system, to over prescribe drugs like oxycontin, and make many people addicted to opiates. Later, when the consequences were known and how addicted opiates such as oxycontin are, drug prescriptions were reduced, but the highest number of opiate prescriptions was in 2015. Many people became addicted, and went to the illegal heroin drug market, made of opiates that are produced in Mexico; secondly, in 2013 there was the great revolution of synthetic opiates, such as fentanyl, which began to arrive from China. That drastically changed the nature of the opioid epidemic. Even before fentanyl. It was an epidemic that expanded enormously, growing in a very significant number of people who became addicted. But after fentanyl it becomes hugely deadly because the synthetic opiate is very potent and extremely easy to overdosify, particularly if users do not know exactly the percentage of fentanyl versus heroin in the mixture they are using. And because fentanyl is so potent, it also means that there are small amounts that will supply a very large market. To supply the whole U.S. market for one year, several trucks are needed. But for fentanyl we are talking about a much smaller percentage of the drug that has to be smuggled. The main producer of legal fentanyl is China. Fentanyl is a drug produced legally because it is an opiate, used to suppress pain, and is used in surgeries. It is now used for Covid, before patients have a respirator placed, to tolerate the insertion of the respirator. But China also spearheaded a very significant illegal production of fentanyl and fentanyl smuggling across the United States. The report tells how the U.S. government has tried to work with China to suppress fentanyl supply. From the Obama administration to the Trump administration the first step was to persuade China to start regulating fentanyl in the same way that cocaine is regulated. A special license is required for factories to produce the drug. In the absence of the license, it would be illegal to produce it, and also a special license to sell or export it, as in the United States. It took nearly seven years of work, from the Obama administration to the beginning of the Trump administration, to persuade China to adopt that regulation. China finally did it in April last year. And the big question now that China changed regulation, so that the drug is regulated in the same way as in the United States, is whether China will have the will and the ability to apply regulation.-That regulation became in force in May 2019. Just over a year ago. How was the implementation of it? Did you see any changes and greater cooperation on the part of China?-It is difficult to draw a conclusion by the Covid, which interrupted all legal or illegal logistical changes. What we've seen from May last year to December is that China made an effort to stop the shipment of fentanyl to the United States. China's government installed a detection system in Chinese postal services and required people toidentify who they are, send the package revealing information, and that the information was received in advance by the United States authorities. And we actually saw a significant decrease in fentanyl smuggling by mail. But fentanyl is smuggled into other means, such as precursor agents. And what is happening a lot now is that both fully manufactured fentanyl, prepared fentanyl, as well as precursor agents, are shipped to Mexico and then in Mexico are processed in fentanyl or diluted, and then transported to the United States. The last year was a record year, with 72,000 overdoses. The vast majority of which are by fentanyl or fentanyl mixed with cocaine or methamphetamine, which is the other dimension that has evolved. Law enforcement is a major challenge for China. Although China is an authoritarian company that has hugely strong controls, like any authoritarian government that has enormous control over society, it used to have hundreds of thousands of pharmaceutical facilities or companies that produced either drugs or agricultural chemicals, chemicals, all of which can be screens for drug deviations such as fentanyls for illegal production and smuggling. But China has only 2, 000 inspectors. So you can't go far to implement all sorts of much stricter regulatory measures. The second dimension is whether China has the will to do so. In the report I mention what can be learned from other areas of regulation. How China has handled its tobacco regulation and how its regulation on wildlife is handled. In addition, I noted that the most extensive case of Chinese cooperation in terms of anti-narcotics efforts with another country is primarily with Australia, to prevent the smuggling of methamphetamine produced in China to Australia. China often denies that there is any problem of any kind. The government denies that there is eventually strong domestic international pressure to implement some regulation. Right now, we are in a very difficult situation of relations between the United States and China, with all sorts of sanctions.-How can this growing trade tension between the United States and China affect?-Certainly, it is not useful. What we have from other cases, such as China's cooperation with methamphetamine with Australia or Myanmar, is that geopolitical interests are not aligned with the application of regulation. China will not allow the implementation of the regulation of Trump's geopolitical interests. In other words, geopolitical considerations would be more important. Part of the reason China cooperated in rating fentanyl as drugs like cocaine was to find an area where it could cooperate with the Trump administration. This was particularly in the context of the trade war. And I think China hoped that, as a result of anti-narcotics cooperation, relations would improve, that trade war would come to an end. That hasn't happened. And indeed, tensions have intensified after China took control of Hong Kong. The Trump administration and Congress have issued sanctions against Chinese government officials, related to the Uighurs crackdown, and the Muslim population in western China, where the government has placed them almost in concentration camps, so the United States has issued sanctions on that. And in many other areas like Taiwan, relations are at a very low point, the lowest point in decades. In my opinion, that does not create an environment conducive to cooperation. However, there are still ways to work with China and there are compensatory factors. An important compensatory factor is that China is very proud of its rolein the fight against narcotics. For years he has positioned himself as head of anti-narcotics police in East Asia. At the United Nations, it has opposed the legalization of cannabis; he has advocated for very strong anti-drug policies and has established important cooperation with countries such as Thailand and others in East Asia. Despite President Rodrigo Duterte's brutal policies in the Philippines, a very terrible drug policy, China has cooperated by building prisons for drug users. Thus, China has a very strong sense of identity and understands its role as a drug cop. There is an important element because fentanyl will become more prevalent in Europe as well, it is already emerging there. It is an important element to work with China to try to induce the country to mount a strong law enforcement despite tensions with the United States. But it's an open question.-You argued, and in the report it is also mentioned, that China tends to deny the problems. Something similar to what happened to the coronavirus, which led Beijing to be in the focus of controversy. However, when these problems begin to affect China itself, coupled with international pressure, is the first efforts of the authorities only being there. The main example is methamphetamine, which led to close cooperation with Australia. Can something similar happen to fentanyl?-The public narrative in China is that fentanyl is an American problem. That stems from the decline of the United States, that its capitalist part and the fact that it is too free or liberal society leads people to use drugs. So media framing, which are often state-controlled means, is first and for all the denial that there is a significant problem and significant supply outside China. Many Chinese don't really understand the role fentanyl plays in driving the epidemic in the United States. Despite this, China has taken some steps, strengthened the application of post office facilities, and changed regulation. My expectation is that China will continue to enforce the law. Much of the motivation to cooperate was linked to the desire to see the end of the trade war, and see a substantial improvement in relations. And that's not happening now. Covid is another dimension in which the Trump administration repeatedly blames China. There were a number of accusations. The Trump administration claimed without any evidence that the virus was made in a lab, then the Chinese government and the Chinese state media accused the United States that it was a military-made virus. Both accusations are false, they only show hostility. All of this is a very pernicious context for motivating China to enforce the law. The other big dimension is that China has long had problems with opiates focused on organic opiates, such as heroin, which comes mainly from Myanmar. China has had no addictions to synthetic opiates, even though there is a lot of fentanyl produced abroad. So the question is whether China's traffickers will ever start selling opioids to domestic users. And if that happens, the number of overdoses starts to increase in China itself, then China, of course, would probably be much more motivated to have a more diligent application to save Chinese lives.-Are there estimates of how much money the smuggling of this drug generates?-I have not seen any overall estimates. But one of the reasons why the drug is stored in large quantities by traffickers and distributors is because it is extremely profitable. The profits are very, very high. If you think aboutcocaine, the reason cocaine is relatively expensive compared to something like coffee or tea is by law enforcement that takes place between production and delivery to users. So the cost of cocaine is really the cost of law enforcement. If there were no repression measures, a bag of cocaine would cost as much as a large bag of tea or coffee. Because opioids are produced and powerful, and because they don't have to be smuggled in the same way as cocaine, involving ground armies and violence, they can be smuggled even through post offices, it is also smuggled by cargo... The benefits are very, very high. The main feature of synthetic opiates is that they are hugely potent, have very high gains and are very small. The benefits are very substantial.(Marcelo Gifted)-How do cartels operate in fentanyl trafficking? -In China there really are no cartels. At least until last year's regulation, many of the merchants, the traffickers, were literally mothers or fathers, were families, wives and husbands, or men and their children, who sell a lot of fentanyl and send them to the United States. It's a very small, very decentralized operation. There is no Pablo Escobar or a Chapo Guzmán, no such characters, no violence. It involves very few individuals, often middle class. We'll see if regulation and law enforcement will change the profile. Essentially the drugs are loaded, if they are not sent through a post office, sent by cargo ships, loaded into Chinese ports, and sent to Mexico. And in Mexico, that's where the cartels come on the scene. At first, it was the Jalisco New Generation cartel, which pioneered the fentanyl several years ago. That's no surprise because that cartel has a long history of producing methamphetamines and sending it and trafficking it to the United States. They have a lot of experience and knowledge with synthetic drugs, their shipping, and established practices. They were the first to move. For a while it was an opportunity to have a combination of U.S. and Mexican law enforcement to prioritize and go after Jalisco Nueva Generación and crush them. It is the most aggressive, violent and brutal cartel in Mexico. But law enforcement did not focus on the cartel, and soon its biggest rival, the Sinaloa cartel, which used to be led by the Chapo, also switched to fentanyl. Then these two cartels came to dominate the supply of fentanyl to the United States. Many small groups in Mexico have moved to fentanyl smuggling as well, or to the smuggling of synthetic opiates. So they may also be smuggling oxicontine or producing fake oxicontine pills that can be labeled as oxy, but actually add a combination of fentanyl and some other substances. There are now many more actors involved in Mexico, and that makes law enforcement much more difficult and challenging.-Beyond the United States, how is the international community acting in the face of the advancement of this drug? Previously you referred to how the arrival of fentanyl is emerging in Europe. Are there efforts on the part of the European Union to halt the progress of this epidemic?-Yes, there is cooperation, but the market is still very concentrated in the United States and Canada. In Europe you have the feeling that fentanyl is an American problem. I don't think this is necessarily prudent, I don't think there's a lack ofcooperation, but in many European countries there is a sense that fentanyl is not going to reach Europe, that it will not start to be a problem or a significant danger on the continent. There's already fentanyl emerging there. That too has been interrupted by the Covid. Just as shipments of supplies from China to the United States have been disrupted, the number of flows to Europe is lower. So what's happening this year in Europe is not a good indication. My expectation is that fentanyl will become a stronger problem. But I should also point out that there are some interesting markets in Europe where fentanyl has long been established, the most prominent and significant is Estonia, where the vast majority of its use of opiates and, in fact, most of the drug use, leaving aside cannabis, is fentanyl.-Many specialists believe that China is using fentanyl to conduct a "chemical war". What do you think about this? And after what he exposed about the opioid epidemic and the role of Beijing, can the Asian giant be considered the greatest threat to the United States?"I don't think China is consciously mounting a narcotics war in the United States. This is not the first time in international relations that such accusations have been made. During the Vietnam War many American soldiers in Vietnam became addicted to heroin and there were accusations that the Soviet Union was helping to handle that. Later, in the 1980s, when Soviet soldiers occupied Afghanistan, there were many accusations, many of them became addicted to heroin, which also occurred in Afghanistan, and there were counter charges that the United States was encouraging addiction among Russian soldiers. In recent years the United States has fought the Taliban in Afghanistan, where there is a tremendous amount of drug production. A lot of it goes to Russia and a little to America. The Russian government would often say this part of the war against the Russian people that the United States is trying to get the Russian population to become addicted and sick. I don't think any of this is right. It should also be noted that China is not the only source of fentanyl supply to the United States or Mexico. India, which the United States is trying to build a strategic partnership, is also an important and growing supply of fentanyl. In addition, fentanyl can be dispersed to other countries, it can easily be produced in South Africa, Indonesia, Thailand, Nigeria... countries that have fairly important pharmaceutical industries.The Brookings Institution's reportMORE ON THIS TOPIC:Fentanyl, the other epidemic that is advancing from China and cannot be eradicatedA Harvard doctor warns that "drastic" measures are needed to stem fentanyl deaths, the other epidemic China exported to the worldLoad-Date: August 18, 2020End of Document

CSIS: From Competition to Confrontation With China - Major Shift in U.S. PolicyTargeted News ServiceAugust 4, 2020 Tuesday 9:17 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3123 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Center for Strategic and International Studies issued the following commentary by Chair in Strategy Anthony H. Cordesman:Over a period of a little more than a month, the U.S. has gone from a mixture of competition and cooperation with China to direct confrontation. This confrontation has also focused largely on the civil level - more specifically on ideology, economics, industrial espionage, cyberattacks on civil networks and databases, and disinformation campaigns.Top Administration officials have given five major speeches which assert that China can no longer be treated as a state evolving towards a more liberal power that will pursue security and economic objectives on terms the U.S. and other states can accept. These speeches assert that China has become an authoritarian state that is driven by a Communist ideology, is seeking to become the world's dominant power, and is using methods of competition that are illegal and violate international norms.Secretary of State Pompeo made this clear in the last - and most definitive - of these five speeches by stating that,... we have to admit a hard truth. We must admit a hard truth that should guide us in the years and decades to come, that if we want to have a free 21st century, and not the Chinese century of which Xi Jinping dreams, the old paradigm of blind engagement with China simply won't get it done. We must not continue it and we must not return to it.... We opened our arms to Chinese citizens, only to see the Chinese Communist Party exploit our free and open society. China sent propagandists into our press conferences, our research centers, our high-schools, our colleges, and even into our PTA meetings...We marginalized our friends in Taiwan, which later blossomed into a vigorous democracy...We gave the Chinese Communist Party and the regime itself special economic treatment, only to see the CCP insist on silence over its human rights abuses as the price of admission for Western companies entering China.... we have to keep in mind that the CCP regime is a Marxist-Leninist regime. General Secretary Xi Jinping is a true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology. It's this ideology, it's this ideology that informs his decades-long desire for global hegemony of Chinese communism. America can no longer ignore the fundamental political and ideological differences between our countries, just as the CCP has never ignored them.... the only way to truly change communist China is to act not on the basis of what Chinese leaders say, but how they behave. And you can see American policy responding to this conclusion. President Reagan said that he dealt with the Soviet Union on the basis of "trust but verify." When it comes to the CCP, I say we must distrust and verify.... We, the freedom-loving nations of the world, must induce China to change, just as President Nixon wanted. We must induce China to change in more creative and assertive ways, because Beijing's actions threaten our people and our prosperity.... We must start by changing how our people and our partners perceive the Chinese Communist Party. We have to tell the truth. We can't treat this incarnation of China as a normal country, just like any other.The previous speeches each addressed key areas of Chinese competition that the speaker felt violated international norms and legitimate forms of competition, and in doing so, threatened the U.S. and its allies. Each made it clear that China had evolved into an increasing threat.This analysis provides the key excerpts from each speech. It traces the full set of arguments advanced by the top officials of the United States government. It highlights each of the specific examples which cite Chinese behavior that threaten the U.S. and other states - and also serves as a reference for what could be the most important shifts in U.S. policy towards China and its relations with the United States and the world since President Nixon's opening to China in 1971-1972.At the same time, the analysis that follows shows these speeches raise five critical issues for U.S. politics, strategy, and action in dealing with China:1. Is this view of China correct, and does it offer the best option for dealing with China in the future?2. Is this view of China one that has bipartisan support in the U.S. and will endure beyond the coming election?3. The current U.S. national strategy addresses both China and Russia as major competitors, as well as far less serious threats from nations like Iran and North Korea. What is the U.S. position on Russia?4. What changes are required in U.S. strategy and to what extent can the U.S. create global support for its position?5. How does the U.S. build domestic and international support for such a position and show that its stance is valid?In each case, it is clear that these speeches raise critical challenges, but they do not provide workable answers to any of these questions.Five Key Speeches That Change U.S. Policy from Competition to ConfrontationSenior Administration officials - ranging from the Director of the FBI to the Secretary of State - have given four speeches and statements that have charged China with actively violating and undermining international values and competing on illegal terms - singling out Chairman Xi Jinping - who has served as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) since 2012, and President of the People's Republic of China (PRC) since 2013.* National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien, "The Chinese Communist Party's Ideology and Global Ambitions," Speech, Arizona Commerce Authority, Phoenix, Arizona, June 26, 2020, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/chinese-communist-partys-ideology-global-ambitions/* FBI Director Christopher Wray, "The Threat Posed by the Chinese Government and the Chinese Communist Party to the Economic and National Security of the United States," Speech, Hudson Institute, Washington D.C., July 7, 2020,https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/the-threat-posed-by-the-chinese-government-and-the-chinese-communist-party-to-the-economic-and-national-security-of-the-united-states* Attorney General William Barr, "Remarks on China Policy," Speech, General R.

The equivalent of a fifth speech was added in the form of a statement that dealt with Chinese claims in the South China Sea, Taiwan, and Japan - made at a time when Chinese and U.S. military activity in the region had reached near record heights.* Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, Statement on "U.S. Position on Maritime Claims in the South China Sea," U.S. State Department, July 13, 2020, https://www.state.gov/u-s-position-on-maritime-claims-in the-south-china-sea/.[Text omitted]View speeches at https://www.csis.org/analysis/competition-confrontation-china-major-shift-us-policyThe Current U.S. National Strategy addresses both China and Russia as Major Competitors. What Should the U.S. position Towards Russia Now Be?All of these speeches target China without addressing Russia. However, the new U.S. national strategy adopted in 2017 made Russia an equal threat to China. The U.S. is still debating the extent to which Russia has targeted U.S. elections - and Russia has conducted other disinformation, gray area, and hybrid operations hostile to the United States, as well as begun a major nuclear and missile modernization program.The potential importance of this mission was made all too clear after Secretary Pompeo gave his final speech on China. Other statements by a senior Administration official warned that the coming U.S. election was being targeted with disinformation campaigns conducted by China, Russia, and Iran. The National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) Director, William Evanina, issued a press release on July 24, 2020, stating that "Election security remains a top priority for the Intelligence Community." This release is available from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, (https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/item/2135-statement-by-ncsc-director-william-evanina-100-days-until-election-2020). It was relatively short, but it addressed a critical aspect of both Russian and Chinese behavior,"Today, we see our adversaries seeking to compromise the private communications of U.S. political campaigns, candidates and other political targets. Our adversaries also seek to compromise our election infrastructure, and we continue to monitor malicious cyber actors trying to gain access to U.S. state and federal networks, including those responsible for managing elections. However, the diversity of election systems among the states, multiple checks and redundancies in those systems, and post-election auditing all make it extraordinarily difficult for foreign adversaries to broadly disrupt or change vote tallies without detection.In addition, foreign nations continue to use influence measures in social and traditional media in an effort to sway U.S. voters' preferences and perspectives, to shift U.S. policies, to increase discord and to undermine confidence in our democratic process. The coronavirus pandemic and recent protests, for instance, continue to serve as fodder for foreign influence and disinformation efforts in America.At this time, we're primarily concerned with China, Russia and Iran -- although other nation states and non-state actors could also do harm to our electoral process. Our insights and judgments will evolve as the election season progresses."Russia may fall far short of China as an emerging economic power, but it is still a massive nuclear power and poses a major threat to NATO. Its disinformation campaigns as well as its gray zone and hybrid operations pose an ongoing threat to the U.S. and many allies; and its activities in Libya, Syria, and the Ukraine show this threat is both operational and serious. The U.S. cannot focus on China at the expense of Russia or other commitments without carefully assessing the consequences and making major revisions to its overall strategy. The timing will also be awkward because the U.S. must simultaneously deal with the economic impact of the Coronavirus and formulating the FY2021 budget request.What Changes are Required in U.S. Strategy and to What Extent Can the U.S. Create Global Support for Its position?Identifying major challenges is very different from offering credible ways to deal with them. The speeches summarized in this analysis indict China's leadership, government, economy and civil sector, and military claims without suggesting any clear strategy for countering the problems they highlight or negotiating some settlement or new relationship with China. They are yet another demonstration of the fact that the U.S. government seems incapable on understanding that a real-world strategy requires a practical course of action, an actual plan to implement it, and the resources required to execute it.China (and Russia) are not simply a "whole of government" problem, they need a "whole of government solution." It is not clear that the speeches just described clearly recognize the extent to which this really requires planning, resources, and implementation.How Does the U.S. Build Support for a New Approach to Dealing with China's Position, and Show That Its Stance Is Valid?One key problem the U.S. faces is illustrated by the examples of Chinese conduct in the various speeches. Many have never been given the same level of official attention or visibility before. The U.S, has provided detailed official assessments of Chinese military power, but it has never attempted to establish an adequate open source set of reports and evidence to make the full case for the arguments advanced in each speech. These is no ongoing set of official reports that provide detailed chronologies and evidence to the points about China's methods of economic competition, information warfare, and other largely civil activities - particularly as they apply to Chinese (or Russian) actions in all countries that the U.S. needs to influence.This is a broader problem within the U.S. government. The U.S. does not attempt to counter malign forms of information warfare by fully and consistently communicating the facts in the many areas where only the government can gather the necessary data. For example, it now no longer provides an annual assessment of statistical patterns in terrorism - the last issue of its only report on Russian military power was in 2017 - it fails to properly update the CIA World Factbook, it fails to require its major combatant commands to issue meaningful strategy documents and assessments, it provides almost no real strategy justification for its budget requests, and it has effectively given up its effort to produce a workable assessment of the World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers (WMEAT).There are exceptions like Chinese Military Power, but the U.S. does an appallingly bad job of using declassified information to counter the information warfare and disinformation activities of countries like China and Russia. It has steadily cut back on such reporting over the years, relied heavily on topical short-term public affairs efforts, and now needs to develop a whole new stream of reporting.Many of the areas involved in assessing China's methods of competing and actions are ones where there is little open source reporting that is not ideological or highly politicized, and where gross over-classification is the rule rather than the exception. A narrow focus on the cost of reports adds to the problem because they are perhaps the cheapest weapon available. Competing in these areas means credible transparency - an art form where the U.S. is sadly lacking.Transitioning from Competition to Civil-Military Confrontation with China without Having a Clear Strategy or Addressing RussiaThere are two other aspects of these speeches that should be a subject of deep concern if the U.S. is to act on its words, and gain international support:First, they indict China's leadership, government, economy and civil sector, and military claims without suggesting any clear strategy for either countering the problems they highlight or negotiating some settlement or new relationship with China.Second, the U.S. must acknowledge that its approach to China is not isolated to its bilateral relationship, but it is also facing the same problems with Russia and even Iran. Instead, the following considerations are needed when creating a strategy:- China is expanding its influence efforts to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressuring political figures it views as an opposition to China's interests, and countering criticism of China. Beijing recognizes its efforts might affect the presidential race.- Russia's persistent objective is to weaken the United States and diminish the U.S. global role. Using a range of efforts, including internet trolls and other proxies, Russia continues to spread disinformation in the U.S. that is designed to undermine confidence in our democratic process and denigrate what it sees as an anti-Russian "establishment" in America.- Iran seeks to undermine U.S. democratic institutions and divide the country in the coming months of the elections. Iran's efforts center around online influence, such as spreading disinformation on social media and recirculating anti-U.S. content.In regards to Russia, if one considers Evanina's statement in the context of the fact there still is no final report on the accuracy of the FBI's investigation in Russia's role in the 2016 election, reports on Russian nuclear and space warfare developments, or reports on Russia's role in British and other foreign disinformation campaigns, it is clear that the failure to address Russia is a critical omission. This is particularly true given the fact that the new National Security Strategy that the U.S. adopted in 2017, the new National Defense Strategy that the U.S. adopted in 2018, and both the defense budget submissions and the annual threat assessments by the Director of National Intelligence from 2012 to the present have all focused on Russia as well as China.This is also imperative as Russia is still sustaining the fighting in the Ukraine; putting steady pressure on NATO, particularly in Russia's border areas; testing anti-satellite systems in space; executing a major nuclear and missile program; developing long-range hypersonic pression strike systems; carrying out gray area and hybrid operations in Syria and Libya; and playing a major role in trying to shape world petroleum prices.For additional Burke Chair studies see:* U.S. Competition with China and Russia: The Crisis-Driven Need to Change U.S. Strategy, is available for download here (https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/200615_Gray_Zone.pdf).* Chronology of Possible Chinese Gray Area and Hybrid Warfare Operations and is available for download here (https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/200702_Burke_Chair_Chinese_Chronology.pdf).* Chronology of Possible Russian Gray Area and Hybrid Warfare Operations and is available for download here (https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/200702_Burke_Chair_Russian_Chronology.pdf).* China and the U.S.: Cooperation, Competition, and or Conflict: Full Report, October 1, 2019, is available for download here (https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/191001_China_Grand_Strategy.pdf).* * *Anthony H.

WECHAT IS A TRAP FOR CHINA'S DIASPORAStates News ServiceAugust 14, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1248 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:On August 6, President Donald Trump released two executive orders barring US transactions with the Chinese tech companies ByteDance, which owns TikTok, and Tencent, the owner of WeChat, related to those services.It is unclear what exactly the bans will entail, but a ban on WeChat will likely create significant disruptions for communications and business transactions between people in China and the United States and possibly the rest of the world. That has caused concern and upsetwith good reason. Yet while the political motivation behind Trump's ban and its free speech implications are reasons for concern, the threat WeChat poses should also be taken seriously. WeChat isn't just a tool for many users; it's a trap.With monthly active users of over 1.2 billion worldwide, WeChat is a super-app that combines the functions of social media, messaging, financial services, travel, food delivery, ride-hailing, and other apps. It is so convenient that for people in China it is as unimaginable not to have WeChat as not to have a smartphone.That's partially a result of good programming and partially of deliberate policy. The Chinese government shuts out foreign tech companies, puts up a Great Firewall to block websites that don't comply with its censorship regime, and penalizes people who try to circumvent it. At the same time, it nurtures a handful of domestic platforms like WeChat that censor and surveil their users on its behalf and hand over user data to the government when so-called sensitive information is discovered. Authorities also directly embed cybersecurity police units in major internet companies.WeChat has thus become a complete digital ecosystem where people in China lead their entire digital lives, and they are trapped in its controlled information environment without meaningful choice.Anyone outside the country who wants to connect with people in China has to use what is available in China and thus also gets sucked into the Chinese government's machinery of censorship and surveillance. International WeChat users are estimated at between 100 million and 200 million; there are an average of 19 million daily active users in the United States. A recent study by Citizen Lab showed that WeChat surveils its users outside China to build up the database it uses to censor China-registered accounts. As international users are governed by terms of service and privacy policies of Singapore, it is unclear whether WeChat shares this information with the Chinese government. But it is essential to remember that all Chinese companies are subject to government control.Those free speech implications don't just apply inside China.The centrality of WeChat in information acquisition and communication among the Chinese diaspora, especially first-generation immigrants from China, should be a source of real concern elsewhere.Over the past couple of years, I've been interviewing members of the Chinese diaspora around the world on the Chinese government's activities undermining human rights abroad. A reoccurring problem I run into is that some of my sources only wanted to use WeChat to communicate, mainly because they had not installed any other messaging apps.For sure, some immigrants also have WhatsApp, and some use Telegram. But everyone has WeChat, so, naturally, people congregate on WeChat. The pull of WeChat is so strong that communication among first-generation Chinese immigrants is often exclusively done via the app.Chinese law requires internet companies to store internet logs and relevant data for at least six months to assist law enforcement. WeChat's own privacy policy notes that it may need to "retain, disclose and use" user information in response to requests from the government. Hence, the Chinese government canif it wantsknow a lot about the people who have left China, down to things like who is meeting whom, at what time, and where. And because WeChat is a payment app as well, it can see to whom they send money or from whom they get it or even who pays for dinner.WeChat is also where many members of the Chinese diaspora obtain information, including about the countries they immigrated to. A survey of Mandarin speakers in Australia found that 60 percent of those polled identified WeChat as their primary source of news and information, while only 23 percent said they regularly accessed news from mainstream Australian media such as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the Sydney Morning Herald.Some of the most popular publications catering to the diaspora originated on WeChat. In order to attract readership, traditional Chinese-language media outlets now also publish through WeChat. In this sense, news produced by a local Chinese-language outlet in New York goes through censors in Beijing before it reaches the Chinese-speaking community in New York.People often ask me why Chinese immigrants still primarily read news from WeChat when other sources of informationuncensored by the Chinese governmentare readily available. First, it is the power of habit. We all consume information from channels that we are used to. Then there is the shared way of speaking and writing and common cultural and historical experiences that bind people who grow up in China.Perhaps somewhat unique to mainland Chinese, growing up in an environment where information control is all encompassing, you are told that criticism of the Chinese government is the result of malicious intent by "foreign forces," and hearing news and ideas contrary to what you were taught and believed in a one-party state can be jarring and can take a long time to get accustomed to.The impact of living online in WeChat's ecosystem means that people outside China are subjected to the same censorship and propaganda, which shapes their worldview in ways more amenable to the Chinese government. Even people who only use WeChat to communicate with people in China are generally aware of its censorship and surveillance capabilities and may self-censor, even unconsciously. The effects can be insidious, as I remember firsthand from my own youth in China. The government's censorship rules are never clear, and enforcement is consistent. Nobody knows where the red line is. So to play it safe, you try to stay far away from sensitive issues. When you can't talk about something, you gradually learn to avoid thinking about it in the first place. After self-censorship becomes a deeply ingrained behavior, shifting to live in a free environment doesn't mean you can immediately shake off old habits. It can take a lifetime.The US government should address WeChat's specific threats to the human rights of people on its soil in a proportionate, transparent, and lawful manner that respects the right to freedom of expression. To mitigate WeChat's harm, for example, the US government should invest in open-source technologies that can enable people in China to more easily circumvent censorship and provide other channels of communication. The US government should also support independent Chinese-language media so Chinese-speaking people can have a variety of choices for uncensored news and information. But most fundamentally, the United States should strengthen its own data protection laws. If all companies were required to practice data minimization for all users in the United States, the risk of it being harvested by any actors, foreign or domestic, would be greatly reduced.Load-Date: August 15, 2020End of Document

Chinese Stocks Era May 'TikTok' Down For American Investors As U.S.-China Rift GrowsInvestor's Business DailyAugust 12, 2020Copyright 2020 Investor's Business Daily, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: NEWSLength: 2724 wordsByline: JED GRAHAMBodyhttps://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/A1MAIN-tradewar1-080720.jpgThe fractured U.S.-China relationship is about to hit home for American investors, as trade and technology conflicts widen into a capital war.Chinese stocks led the market lower last Friday as President Donald Trump took dead aim at two Chinese mobile apps. Trump issued an orderbanning Tencent's WeChat messaging app and ByteDance's TikTok video platform in the U.S. within 45 days, if they remain under Chinese control. A day earlier, the White House fired a broader warning shot, signaling it wants to kick China stocks off U.S. exchanges in 2022 — one year earlier than required under a recent Senate bill — if they don't comply with accounting transparency standards.That could spell the end of an era in which U.S. investors have been able to pick and choose among the best Chinese stocks, providing easy access to China's e-commerce boom and rising consumer economy.A pivotal sign of this dawning era came from China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba last month. The company decided the spin out of its Ant Group financial unit, among the most anticipated IPOs of recent years, will list in Shanghai and Hong Kong, snubbing U.S. investors and the New York Stock Exchange.Chinese Stock Delisting Threat Has LoopholeU.S.-China tensions are rising against the backdrop of the Trump administration's 2-1/2-year-old trade war and the Chinese government's blunt-force retraction of autonomy from Hong Kong. In addition, doubts continue to grow about the intent behind China's long-term effort to foster more open, international markets.Wall Street seems to be holding out hope that U.S.-China relations will remain poised in a tense balance — probably the best-case scenario — rather than devolve into a more disruptive and damaging conflict.The two sides confirmed this week that trade negotiators will meet to discuss progress on the phase-one China trade deal signed in January. Beijing has said it will stick by the terms, even as it threatens to retaliate for the U.S. actions against TikTok.Meanwhile, an analysis by former U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission chair Roger Robinson finds that the Trump administration plan to delist Chinese stocks from U.S. exchanges includes "an invented, preferential workaround."Chinese law precludes Chinese firms from providing documents to overseas regulators. To get around Beijing's refusal to let the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board review the work of Chinese auditors, the Trump administration would permit Chinese firms to engage a U.S. accounting firm to do the job.This would create "the unverifiable possibility of Chinese companies generating 'two sets of books,' one for Chinese auditing firms to share with its government and a second ginned up to be used by an American auditing firm," an analysis from Robinson's Prague Security Studies Institute argues.The Trump administration proposal requires adoption by the Securities and Exchange Commission.Why This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top StocksTikTok Falls Victim To Distrust Of ChinaThe administration's or-else threat to ban the two social media platforms underscores the U.S. government's expanding effort to manage perceived security threats presented by China stocks and companies. And the financial fallout may not stop there.Recent events suggest the phase-one trade deal signed by the U.S. and China in January simply papered over irreconcilable differences and fundamental mistrust.Trump's ultimatum to ByteDance — to sell its TikTok social media business in the U.S. to Microsoft or face a ban — makes clear that Washington doesn't trust Beijing with Americans' personal data.The move against TikTok comes as the Trump administration finalizes another ban. That restriction prevents federal contractors from using technology provided by Huawei, ZTE, Hikvision and other firms. The U.S. alleges the contractors pose cybersecurity threats, and that they are subject to influence from the Chinese government.Chinese Stocks: A $1 Trillion Exodus?U.S. policymakers are asking a logical follow-up question: If Chinese firms can't be trusted with our data, should we trust them with our money? Will they use our capital to develop technology with military applications?U.S. resident holdings of Chinese equities and bonds (mostly equities) have doubled since President Trump's election, from $110 billion to $218 billion, U.S. Treasury Department data shows."That's money that matters," Derek Scissors, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, told IBD. "That's money we're giving to China that can end up supporting the People's Liberation Army or support continued repression of basic rights."A broadly supported Senate bill, passed in May, would require Chinese companies to meet accounting transparency standards or else lose their U.S. listings within three years. If signed into law, it could lead to an exodus out of U.S. markets by about 170 Chinese stocks worth well over $1 trillion. Passage in the House appears likely. Yet the Trump administration policy announced Thursday, while potentially accelerating the delisting of Chinese stocks, includes a loophole likely to ease compliance.The Delisting Escape Hatch For China StocksIn June, Chinese gaming leader NetEase and e-commerce giant JD.com launched new Hong Kong listings that may serve as escape hatches in the event that their U.S. listings become endangered.In that context, it's hardly surprising that Ant, operator of leading Chinese electronic payment platform Alipay, said in July that it will go public in China, not the U.S.Moreover, Ant isn't the first hot Chinese IPO to spurn U.S. capital markets this year, just the most famous. Future Chinese public offerings will almost certainly follow the same path.Alibaba Group Holdings amplified the trend last November when it added a Hong Kong listing to its NYSE listing. Lawmakers and the Trump administration were already discussing transparency regulations. Alibaba's Hong Kong listing also signaled that China's financial markets had matured. Superstar Chinese technology companies no longer depended on U.S. markets to tap global investors.U.S.-China Tensions Spiral After Trade DealHow did U.S.-China tensions erode so soon after the Trump administration's long-sought trade deal on Jan. 15?In March, Trump blamed China for concealing its coronavirus outbreak and, essentially, foisting the pandemic on the rest of the world. Beijing in May moved to exert control over Hong Kong, drawing up new national security legislation.In response, Trump removed Hong Kong's special trade status under U.S. law. Next came China's eviction from its Houston consulate amid U.S. charges of espionage. China followed suit, kicking the U.S. out of its consulate in the city of Chengdu.Get the latest news on China-based stocks trading in the U.S.Finally, Trump moved to force the sale of TikTok's American business, escalating the U.S.-China conflict to another level. China's state media warned that Beijing will retaliate."China will by no means accept the 'theft' of a Chinese technology company, and it has plenty of ways to respond if the administration carries out its planned smash and grab," a China Daily op-ed said Aug. 2.Are Chinese Stocks Being Singled Out?At the moment, it's a stretch to say that American investors are pawns in a burgeoning U.S.-China capital war. The Senate legislation and Trump policy imperiling Chinese stock listings in the U.S. generally seek to hold Chinese companies to the same disclosure standards as everyone else.In 2013, the U.S.-based Public Company Accounting Oversight Board agreed to let Chinese companies access U.S. capital markets without fully meeting required levels of disclosure and transparency. That paved the way for a big crop of Chinese IPOs like Alibaba stock and JD.com.From 2013 through 2019, Chinese firms raised $48 billion through 113 new offerings. Yet the PCAOB says China hasn't held up its end of the deal, leaving regulators unable to protect investors from fraudulent accounting.Luckin Coffee FraudExposure of fraudulent financial reports by Luckin Coffee in April added to motivation for the Senate to take up the Chinese stock listing legislation, which was first proposed in 2019. Now the once-hot Chinese stock has been delisted, unrelated to the Senate bill."Alibaba and many other Chinese ADRs (American depositary receipts) that successfully launched here and traded here have been able to come here under more relaxed regulations," Kathleen Smith, chairman of Renaissance Capital, told IBD. "The SEC rules should be changed to put Chinese firms on an equal footing," she said, noting that the laxity hurt Luckin investors.The Senate bill also would require Chinese companies to prove they are neither owned nor controlled by a foreign government. If the PCAOB was unable to audit or otherwise confirm for three straight years that a Chinese company was not under such control, the issue would be forced to delist from U.S. markets.How To Buy Chinese Stocks In The FutureFew observers expect China to submit to accounting transparency rules it sees as impinging its sovereignty. If Chinese stocks lose their U.S. listings, American investors will still have ways to buy Chinese internet and technology stocks via mutual funds and ETFs, Smith says. But opening an account in Hong Kong and buying shares in Hong Kong dollars "is an institutional thing to do," not for individuals.Smith expects the Renaissance International IPO ETF to add Ant shares shortly after the IPO. The fund includes other recent hot Chinese IPOs that passed on a U.S. listing, including food-delivery app Meituan-Dianping and smartphone maker Xaomi.Other China-focused ETFs, such as KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF and Global X MSCI China Financials ETF, could also provide U.S. investors access to Ant. The high potential rewards from buying individual Chinese stocks and IPOs as they break into buy zones may be lost. However, buying a portfolio of Chinese growth companies will likely be possible. The Renaissance International IPO ETF, which trades like a stock, cleared a cup-with-handle buy point May 18 and has since raced ahead more than 25%.James Oberweis, president of Oberweis Asset Management, sees permitting Chinese firms to evade SEC compliance as "tarnishing our brand" of investor protection.Yet delisting Chinese stocks won't really punish or deny capital to China. U.S. investors will find other ways to gain exposure to China's growth sectors, he says."It probably helps us in terms of (attracting) assets," said Oberweis, who comanages his firm's China Opportunity Fund, which scored a 34% gain this year through June.Join IBD Live To Learn Top Chart-Reading And Trading Techniques From The ProsU.S.-China Capital War: Yuan Vs. DollarOne thing is clear: China has no desire to keep U.S. capital out of the country, Oberweis says. "China has been going the other way," deepening its capital markets and encouraging inflows of foreign capital.Shifting Chinese stock trading from New York to Hong Kong or Shanghai could further those efforts.The end goal, Oberweis believes, is "creating a competing reserve currency," with China's yuan achieving a stature that rivals the U.S. dollar.On Wednesday, the yuan hit a five-month high vs. the dollar, rising to 6.94 per dollar. The dollar has come under pressure lately as a summer wave of coronavirus cases foiled hopes for a V-shape economic rebound. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 0.5% on Tuesday, near a record low, amid expectations for a more drawn-out recovery and massive federal deficits.China faces high hurdles in trying to turn its currency into a global safe-haven. Yet influential voices warn that the dollar's untouchable status isn't bulletproof.The first step toward a reserve currency being dethroned "is when a country debases its currency," Ray Dalio, founder of hedge fund behemoth Bridgewater Associates, wrote recently. While he sees stimulus measures as necessary, he also sees them contributing to the process of debasement in the U.S.Dalio's fear is that the U.S. will continue to be "our own worst enemy," while engaging in a capital war with China."If you say by law 'Don't invest in China,' or even possibly withholding the payment of bonds that the United States owes payment on in China — these things are possibilities, and they have big implications, such as for the value of the dollar," he told Fox News July 26.Defaulting on the U.S. debt seems far-fetched. However, a ban on investing in China may not be.U.S. Restricts Pension Investment In ChinaUnder pressure, the federal Thrift Savings Plan in May scrapped a planned shift of funds into an international index that includes Chinese stocks. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., was among those applauding the decision. "It's reckless to prop up companies that threaten U.S. interests and values," she said at the time.Shaheen added that it would be "particularly egregious" to direct federal employees' retirement funds into Chinese stocks.Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has index fund providers like MSCI in his sights. Last month, Rubio asked the President's Working Group on Financial Markets to address the increasing funding of China companies via index funds. "Index providers are linking U.S. retail investors' fate to China's economic and industrial ambitions," he warned.Is Alibaba Group Stock A Buy as U.S.-China Tension Rises?One group of China hard-liners is known as the Committee on the Present Danger: China. The group, which includes hedge fund manager Kyle Bass, has called for the Trump administration to close off the China A-shares market to index funds. A-shares stocks are those trading on the Shanghai or Shenzen exchanges and only in Chinese currency. B-Share stocks can trade in foreign currencies, such as the dollar.China has made A-share stocks available to institutional investors since 2003. U.S. investors can trade in A-share Chinese stocks through funds including the Morgan Stanley China A Share Fund and iShares MSCI China A ETF.But index fund providers often include Chinese companies without examining "potential corporate national security and human rights abuses," Bass' group said in a statement last month.The Cost Of A U.S.-China Capital WarWhat will China do if the U.S. takes more steps to ban investment in Chinese equities and bonds? China's focused efforts to attract foreign capital suggest that Beijing may make the U.S. pay a price. If only to discourage other countries from following America's example.Perhaps the most obvious target of Chinese retaliation would be the U.S. financial companies that have lined up to gain entry to China's huge financial services market. "If foreign firms can increase their shares in these market sectors, they stand to generate large profits," wrote Nicholas Lardy and Tianlei Huang, scholars at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.They note that PayPal in 2019 became the first foreign company to provide electronic payment services in China. It gained access via its acquisition of China-based GoPay. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and American Express are among other U.S. financial firms recently permitted access to Chinese financial services markets without being limited to a minority ownership stake.Lardy and Huang wrote in a July analysis that keeping the Thrift Savings Plan from investing in China would have no effect, amounting to just $4.5 billion in withheld funds. Chinese stocks have a listed value of about $13 trillion, they say.Despite a two-year trade war and initial shots fired in the U.S.-China capital war, "China's integration into global financial markets continues apace," they wrote.Bottom line: If the U.S. and China really begin to decouple, global markets might be in for a severe jolt.Please follow Jed Graham on Twitter @IBD_JGraham for coverage of financial markets and economic policy.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Alibaba-Backed Shipper Nears Buy Point Ahead Of EarningsIBD Stock Of The Day: Adobe Is In Buy Zone From Bullish ReboundTesla Stock Split Makes Trading Options EasierStart Building Your Watchlist Now: Find Top Stocks In Leaderboard TodayCatch The Next Big Winning Stock With MarketSmithIBD Live: A New Tool For Daily Stock Market AnalysisLoad-Date: August 14, 2020End of Document

Tension worsens: China denounced US government 'bad intentions'CE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 8, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 617 wordsBodyChina denounced the "barbaric and rude" sanctions imposed by the United States on the Hong Kong authorities in the wake of Beijing's recent measures to increase its control of that semi-autonomous territory, in a new chapter of escalating tensions between the two powers. "The bad intentions of American politicians have come to light,"he said.In Washington's toughest decision on Hong Kong since Beijing imposed a strict security law in that territory, the Treasury announced the freezing of any U.S. assets by chief executive, Carrie Lam, as well as 10 other senior officials.China reacted vigorously on Saturday, calling sanctions "barbaric and rude.""American politicians' bad intentions to support people who are anti-Chinese and to sow disorder in Hong Kong have come to light,"the Chinese government's hong Kong liaison office said in a statement.Shortly before, the excolony's Secretary of Commerce, Edward Yau, had labeled them "wild, disproportionate and unreasonable."The measure also penalizes any U.S. financial transaction with the 11 officers in question, including Hong Kong Police Commissioner Chris Tang and Luo Huining, director of the Liaison Office, a Beijing leg at the international financial center.After being placed on the American blacklist, Luo said, "I did what I had to do for the country and Gonh Kong and added, "I don't have a penny in foreign assets."The head of U.S. diplomacy, Mike Pompeo, noted that"the measures send a clear message that the actions of the Hong Kong authorities are unacceptable."In addition, he said the law, considered by activists to be a legal weapon to silence dissenting voices, violated China's promises before the UK returned the colony in 1997.U.S. sanctions are a response to China's adoption in late June of a security law imposed in Hong Kong,following massive, and sometimes destructive, pro-democracy protests last year.Since then, the authorities have delayed the elections, arguing the coronavirus crisis and, according to Beijing, issued arrest warrants against six pro-democracy activists in exile.The new offensive against China comes after Donald Trump on Thursday set up significant restrictions in the United States against TikTok short video and WeChat messaging apps.By decree, Trump gave Americans 45 days, until mid-September, to stop doing business with those platforms.The president cited national security risks to justify the measures, which also called into question the U.S. operations of WeChat's parent company, Tencent, a powerful player in the video game industry and one of the world's richest companies.China reacted by denouncing "arbitrary political manipulation and repression" by the United States, according to Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wengbin.The new restrictions sank Tencent's shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange, which collapsed 10% before ending with a 5.04% drop, erasing nearly $50 billion from its capitalization.Trump's decree states that TikTok could be used by China to track down U.S. federal employees, put together files on people to blackmail them, and conduct corporate espionage.TikTok, which has repeatedly denied sharingdata with the Chinese government, said it was "shocked" by the decree "issued without due process."The application owned by China-based ByteDance promised to seek "all available solutions" to ensure that the law is enforced and threatened to take legal action.While TikTok has exceeded the threshold of 2 billion downloads worldwide, WeChat is a messaging, social media and electronic payment platform that reports having more than 1 billion users.Washington has also clashed with Chinese giant Huawei, which it accuses of being a Beijing spy tool.Load-Date: August 9, 2020End of Document

We'll get to that later.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning, Isaias is moving up the East coast with heavy wind and rain. It was downgraded early this morning to a tropical storm, but not right before hitting the Carolina coast as a category one hurricane.

Pacer's ETF Distributor President Sean O'Hara and Walser Wealth Management President Rebecca Walser.Rebecca, let's kick it off with you, investors are keeping a close eye on a potential sale of TikTok to Microsoft this morning. President Trump set a September 15 deadline for the deal.How do you see it Rebecca? Does this have implications beyond just TikTok and Microsoft?REBECCA WALSER, PRESIDENT OF WALSER WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Absolutely, and I - - I just loved that piece that, Maria, that you just did. It's kind of ironic that China is saying a smash and grab when that's what we've been saying for quite a while about their Chinese espionage of U.S. tech and data.But anyways, I want to quickly say, Maria, this is a great opportunity for Microsoft and I think it's being really underestimated. You know, Microsoft, as you know, has tried many times to get into the social media game or to the consumer data gathering game and hasn't had much success with a lot of their endeavors, and this is a way for them to get 32 plus million -- 14 -- you know -- lots of users, over 30 percent now are -- only 30 percent are teenagers, so you've got about 14 or 15 total U.S. users of July -- as of July this past month and a lot of them are adults.And so, if you look at Microsoft's opportunity here, from a teenage perspective, just to focus on them for one second, Maria, what you see is Google and Alphabet has been so successful in getting teenagers to basically use Google Docs and Google Gmail through schools that they're not even using Microsoft products and this is a great way for Microsoft to get into that's space at a very young age.BARTIROMO: Yes, and they've got the complimentary Xbox, so they've got young people there as well.WALSER: Yes.BARTIROMO: Look, broader market this morning pointed to slight losses at the open. Sean, you say August is typically a volatile month for the markets. Is it the pandemic? Is that what's changed things?SEAN O'HARA, PRESIDENT OF PACER ETFs DISTRIBUTORS: No, I mean, I think -- good morning Maria, first off, congratulations on your anniversary. What a great accomplishment. Here's to many, many, many more years. So look --BARTIROMO: Thank you so much Sean.O'HARA: -- this market today -- this market today just can't be analyzed through the eyes of -- or lens of history or patterns or conventional wisdom. This market's being driven by one thing and one thing only in the short-run and that is the rate of change in terms of how fast we're going to reopen and whether or not the cases are going up or down with regard to COVID. That's going to be the narrative in the next 30 to 60 days that will drive this market.We'll have Disney later on today that will report. They'll probably report a loss, but they're a great example as a barometer for the market. They're business depends on people feeling comfortable going out and being involved with big groups of people. That's what's going on with the economy and that's going to drive it.Two more things will come into play, one is potentially the -- you know -- a reemergence of the quote, unquote, China trade issues, as we get more aggressive with them on certain issues. And then eventually the presidential election cycle will start to move forward.It's been so nonexistent in this whole run-up and eventually the market will have to take a look at that and try to decide whether or not we'll have a change and whether there'll be a increase in taxation or an increase in regulation or we'll continue with the policies that the current administration has in place, which have been very, very favorable to the market.BARTIROMO: Well, you said Microsoft is going to be an important one for the broader markets too, right? It's a barometer?O'HARA: Yes, I mean all of the big tech names are obviously driving this market. You know, they're all sort of tailor made for what's going on. The part of the big tech names that I don't think gets enough attention today is the cloud piece of it.You know, more and more and more computing instances are moving to the cloud. There's a big war going on between the big three, Amazon, Google and Microsoft on the cloud side, and those parts of their business are very, very profitable.BARTIROMO: Yes.O'HARA: The margins are so high. And so, looking forward that's one of the potential areas where Microsoft could be a big winner in this game.BARTIROMO: All right, tech, of course, is on a tear. The Nasdaq closed at yet another record high yesterday as technology stocks soar at the coronavirus pandemic. Joel, what about that?I mean, Apple, one of the composite strongest performers, that the company surged 5 percent, now at a market cap of $1.92 trillion, putting it very close to being the first company every to reach $2 trillion in market value, Joel. Where do you see tech going next?JOEL SHULMAN, ERSHARES CEO: Well, if -- first of all, congrats again on your 25 years, it's an extraordinary accomplishment and we've all enjoyed watching you these past years.When we think about tech --BARTIROMO: Thank you for that Joel.SHULMAN: When we think about tech and we think about, you know, the big four, big five dominating the S&P 500, it's really a tale of two markets. We've had basically the tech up, Amazon's leading the group, the biggest group by 68 percent, but it's more just -- it's more than just Amazon, Microsoft and Apple.We've got Twilio, Datadog, CrowdStrike, Cloudflare. When we've got over 25 entrepreneurial companies that average more than 97 percent year-to-date.This is a broad based move, most of it's being focused on, you know, the big three, the big five with banks, but it's much more than just those guys.Now when we think about tech, I think there's more room to run and we've seen, you know, many companies that have suffered in this COVID era, but many -- it's been two markets, right, we've had the healthcare and tech who have really dominated in the U.S. and they've really led all markets.But I think eyes now are shifting off-shore and we're thinking -- we're seeing, for example, even though most of the non-U.S. markets are down 10 to 15 percent year-to-date, a lot of people may not realize that last month China, Brazil, other markets were up over 10 percent and you have other markets in Europe, like Germany and Israel and so forth, Sweden, they're up 5 percent.So, the markets are starting to shift a little bit. We've seen funds flows moving in the last few weeks from U.S. large-cap -- I'm sorry, U.S. large- cap to off-shore non-U.S.And so, I think tech in the U.S. is going to continue to dominate. We're going to see the cloud companies, you know, dominate and we're going to see a lot of movement in I think the next few weeks to off-shore and I think all eyes are going to be on the election coming up and -- and -- and focusing on, you know, continued growth prior to November.BARTIROMO: Yes, we've got a lot of catalysts on the horizon, that's for sure, with the election and the earnings period. Joel Shulman, Sean O'Hara and Rebecca Walser, great to see you this morning for Word on Wall Street. Thank you so much everybody.Coming up, next up, next AFL CIO President Richard Trumka is here on what President Trump is doing to protect American workers. How do the unions see it?And then Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar will join me on the Administration's plan to help rural communities as the country battles the coronavirus.In the 8:00 am hour don't miss Allianz Chief Economic Advisor Mohamed El- Erian on markets and investing today. He also will weigh in on the latest stimulus in Washington.And Trump 2020 Presidential Campaign National Press Secretary Hogan Gidley on mail-in voting concerns.And then, marking 25 years, we're taking a look back at some of my proudest moments as I remember my debut at the New York Stock Exchange 25-years-ago this morning. Don't want to miss that.You're watching "Mornings With Maria" live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. President Trump signed an executive order to ensure that the Federal Government will hire American workers. It bars federal agencies from replacing American citizens or green card holders with foreign workers.Joining me right now is the president of AFL CIO Union, Richard Trumka. Richard, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.RICHARD TRUMKA, AFL CIO UNION PRESIDENT: Thanks Maria, thanks for having me on.BARTIROMO: This executive order by the president, good idea? What do you think?TRUMKA: Well look, it's a good idea, we'll take the increase scrutiny, but it doesn't fix the problem, because as you noted, not only does it protect American workers, it protects green card holders.Green card holders are foreign workers. They generally come in under the visa program at a lower wage rate and pull the wages down for everybody else. So, it misses the point, it doesn't fix the real problem. That's going to take legislative action, and unfortunately for workers Mitch McConnell hasn't shown much interest in doing things that help American workers.BARTIROMO: The -- the president has been talking about the supply chains moving from China and firing up the manufacturing base in the United States, he's been talking about that quite a bit. Is this an opportunity?TRUMKA: Is what an opportunity? To fix this right now? Well, we have an opportunity, but it's going to take a --BARTIROMO: No, an opportunity for -- no, no, no, Richard, an opportunity for American workers, given the fact that what the Administration is trying to do is fire up the manufacturing base here by getting companies to move their supply chains out of China and into the United States.TRUMKA: That's a good thing for American workers, unfortunately Maria, his policies don't match his rhetoric. When he passed the last tax bill, that tax bill actually incentivized people to outsource jobs not bring them in. And so, we have to change that as well.There's a number of things that we have to do, not just talk about it, but we need the actual policy to do it and he's come up short on the policy side to make those things a reality.BARTIROMO: What have you heard from Joe Biden in terms of this issue?TRUMKA: About keeping America in jobs here? He wants to make sure that American jobs stay here, he's working with us on that. He had an industrial program to create jobs, an infrastructure program to help create jobs here at home. And so, we'll work with him to make sure that happens.Joe -- Joe's a working guy. I mean, he came out of the working class, he understands us. He came out of Pennsylvania, he understands what we're about. He understands us, he's been to our union halls. He's been on our picket lines.He actually understands what we're all about and we feel comfortable that he's going to protect American jobs and work with us on all the different policy issues that need to be taken care of, not just a single policy, it will take a number of policy things to make sure American jobs are here and American manufacturing prospers and thrives again. And we're all for --BARTIROMO: Well -- well, let me -- let me push back on that -- let me push back on that, because what did Joe Biden do under the administration when he was with President Obama for the unions? I mean, you know, President Trump, this has been his number one issue, jobs.TRUMKA: Yes, but he's lost a lot. If you look at where he's at right now, doesn't matter, you can say it's about the pandemic, but he's lost jobs, we've lost manufacturing jobs, we've lost mining jobs, we've lost every set of jobs out there.So, what I said is he talks about it, but his policy doesn't match it to make it happen. That's what we have to do, line up the words and policy --BARTIROMO: Well, it actually did happen -- it -- no, it actually did. Now, that's not true. That's actually not true, Richard. It actually did happen before the pandemic. We had probably the best job situation in a generation. We had an unemployment rate of 3.5 percent. So everything you're saying is actually missing the market, because right before the -- the -- the coronavirus --TRUMKA: Well -- well Maria -- Maria --BARTIROMO: -- hit, we actually did have the best economy and jobs market anybody had every seen. So, I have to push back on that because it's just simply not true.TRUMKA: Please do. Please do, but let me push back on what you're saying. The jobs being created weren't manufacturing jobs, they weren't mining jobs, they were service jobs that paid lower wages. Yes, we had jobs, but we need to raise the wages of those jobs. That's why the growing -- that's why there's growing inequality in this country.BARTIROMO: Wages were going up. No, wages were going up.TRUMKA: Every year inequality has gotten worse in this country because wages aren't going up properly.BARTIROMO: No, that's not true.TRUMKA: It is true.BARTIROMO: Inequality was narrowing -- the -- no, no, it's not. I have the statistics of the statistics.TRUMKA: Well first all --BARTIROMO: Inequality actually began to narrow in the year before -- in the year before the coronavirus. We have to call this out. We've been talking about this, before the coronavirus this was one of the main issues that we discusses on this program. The fact that inequality was actually narrowing and that is what happened. That's what took place before the coronavirus.So, the president's policies have been all about jobs and economic growth. And that was certainly playing out before the coronavirus. There's -- there's just no doubt about it.Let me bring in Jon Hilsenrath here. John, go ahead.JON HILSENRATH, SENIOR WRITER FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Hi Mr. Trumka. I -- I want to turn the conversation to the role of unions in getting rid of bad apples among the ranks.We saw the George Floyd case though very much in a minority in the George Floyd case, we saw that there could be bad apples in the police force. We've seen in -- in -- in the ranks of teachers that sometimes there are bad teachers and it's hard to get rid of bad teachers.Do the unions play a role in protecting bad apples and does that need to change at all?TRUMKA: Well first of all, you can get rid of bad actors, if you're seeing it, whether they're police officers or whether they're teachers. You just have to give them the proper due process and you wouldn't want anybody to be denied due process I'm sure.We work with our employers to -- to increase the quality of education and now we're working with the police force so that we can change the culture of those police forces to make sure that they meet the needs of the community.We want to have public safety as defined by our communities and make sure our police officers are protected and our communities are protected, so we're working with both. That's the role of the union. We can do it better than anybody else, because we have -- we are the best stable (ph) to make cultural change.BARTIROMO: So, do -- do you think you are going to have the same opportunities regardless of who's in the White House in the next election, Richard?TRUMKA: No, I think whoever's in the White House makes a lot. Look -- look, Maria, this president has been the worst on working people when it comes to policies. He took overtime away from 3.5 million people, he took a safety standard away from beryllium and silica and coal dust in the coalmines. All of those things have an affect on working people's health and safety.The bill that he's put forth right now has nothing for worker health and safety in it. There must be protection for those essential workers and he's not showing any proclivity to give us that. When he ordered the meat packing plant back to work immediately without any health and safety plan, he showed us that he thought we were expendable, that's unacceptable.BARTIROMO: Lot -- lot of politics here I think. Richard, it's good to see you this morning, thank you so much. Richard Trumka. We will be right back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Signed, sealed and leased, Facebook betting big on New York City, signing a blockbuster deal to leave the massive and historic Farley Building in Manhattan, leasing this building.Dagen, is this a huge win for the real estate market?MCDOWELL: It's going to be a big win New York City, but I want to point out, that is a digital rendering of the old post office, the Farley Building, which is directly across the street from the Madison Square Garden, because I walk by there every day and it is hell on earth. It is dangerous around that area, the road on the backside of that building on 9th Avenue has pot holes the size of Rhode Island.It is impossible to drive down. It is a massive construction zone, so yay for Facebook, but this city has a long way to go, cleaning up. Again, the shootings this year so far have topped all the shootings from 2019, crime, filth, danger, you name it.Hopefully, if you have more employees come in, maybe they don't bring their blue voting tendencies with them and vote in somebody who can actually run this city for the better.BARTIROMO: Yes. And that -- that area, I used to work right there when I was working at CNN, because CNN used to be at Penn Plaza.MCDOWELL: I remember that.BARTIROMO: A block away from that -- from -- from -- from that Farley Building, and you know, it's such a gorgeous building. It is interesting that Facebook that would choose this building, it's historic and -- and beautiful, and such a huge amount of space.Many of Facebook's employees doing their jobs remotely, with the option to work from home forever. So, this new deal raises the question, when is Facebook bringing employees back to the office, you know?John, what doo you think?HILSENRATH: Well, you know, I want to echo what -- what Dagen said about safety, not just in New York, but all over the country. We just ran a story that -- that I wrote yesterday about how homicide is rising at double-digit rates across the country, 24 percent so far this year in cities all over the landscape.You know, if cities are going to flourish, in particular New York is the countries biggest city, they have to get the -- they have to restore public safety and for a lot of reasons public safety is under -- is in jeopardy right now. So -- so, I mean, that's a real issue and it needs more attention. And like I say, it's happening all over the country and almost every city that we looked at.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: Can I add something to that John?BARTIROMO: I'll -- I'll tell you, Dagen, when -- yes.MCDOWELL: No, go ahead Maria, what were you going to ask me?BARTIROMO: When -- when you and I started talking about this a couple of years ago, we -- we brought it to our viewers attention, the fact that we knew that all of these criminals would be going to be getting off and getting on the -- and be returning to the streets. We didn't even expect it to be as bad as it is today. And we -- we called it, that it would be bad, but this is even worse than I expected, I have to say.MCDOWELL: Yes, and to -- to John's point, what John covered in that -- that journal article is about how shootings and homicides have spiked but other types of violent crime like rape have not and it -- that is -- that is unique to the pandemic in many ways, where people are stuck at home, they're not going -- they're not going out, rapes are not happening, burglary, breaking and entering not happening, but it's gangs that are taking over the streets.But what -- the reason that I get so angry about New York City is because this has been years in the making. It is bail reform, it's the cops being told by the city council and the district attorney that you are not going to enforce quality of life crimes. It is a mayor who is useless, who has turned his back on police officers, thereby turning his back on all of the people of New York City.So, when I get angry about New York, I'm angry for our co-worker who was attacked and robbed on the way to work in the last two weeks. I'm angry that I have to basically duck and run every time I walk out of my building coming to work.So, there are a lot of issues, but you know what, these progressive leaders, these left wing liberals who have driven these cities into hell holes, they do bear a great deal of the responsibility.BARTIROMO: Yes, so what does Mayor De Blasio do, he gets his paint brush with a group and they start paint Black Lives Matter on 5th Avenue. How does that help what's going on?Where you going to jump in here Lou?LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH: Yes, I was going to say, I mean I don't want to diminish your personal experiences because these are real problems, but isn't it now, this is the kind of move that makes things change, the progressive, a company run by progressives, we know there's been conservative bias there I mean through and through. Now them being in the center of this, doesn't that bring attention to the problems that you --JON HILSENRATH, SENIOR WRITER, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL": And (INAUDIBLE) one last point.BASENESE: You have all brought about so -- so early in the process.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a good point. All right --DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Not if they can blame Trump. Not if they can blame Trump, because that's what's going on.HILSENRATH: Hey -- hey, guys, I just want to throw --BARTIROMO: Yes.HILSENRATH: I want to throw in one point just to even out this conversation.Yes, many -- most American cities are run by Democrats. But when we looked at the data, cities with Republican mayors are also seeing homicides rise. It's a complicated issue.MCDOWELL: I made that distinction.HILSENRATH: All I want to say is, it's not -- it's not just politics. Politics, I'm sure, having something to do with it, but there's more going on. If you look at a city like Jacksonville or Omaha or Tulsa, they also have homicide rising in double digit rates. And I just -- I just think that it's a big issue and it needs to be looked at expansively. Politics might have something to do with it, but it's not the whole story.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: Don't let them off the hook.BARTIROMO: All right, that's fair enough.MCDOWELL: Don't -- Jon, I made that distinction -- I made that distinction between what the pandemic has caused --HILSENRATH: Right.MCDOWELL: And the horrors wrought on the people of cities like Chicago under left wing leadership and New York City under left wing leadership. I'm angry because I live here and we're being trampled on and ignored and harassed and we are victims of crime every single day.BARTIROMO: I mean, Dagen, San Francisco as well.MCDOWELL: Right.BARTIROMO: And, you know, you do have policies --HILSENRATH: Well, hold on a second, (INAUDIBLE) --BARTIROMO: Sanctuary city policies, open border policies and you have to consider the policies of some of these cities that are run by Democrats.HILSENRATH: Jacksonville has more murders than San Francisco and Seattle combined.BARTIROMO: We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Expanding telehealth services. President Trump signed executive orders to improve access to doctors amid the coronavirus pandemic.Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The order builds upon a series of actions we've all taken to make telehealth available to all. We ensured that Medicare covers telehealth visits at no additional cost. That's no additional cost and copayments can be waived for telehealth services. We are working very hard also on prescription drug prices.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.Mr. Secretary, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining me.ALEX AZAR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY: Good morning, Maria. Good to be with you.BARTIROMO: Well, great idea on telehealth services. Obviously we need it given this shutdown. Tell us if you believe that this is as effective as meeting with a doctor.AZAR: Well, absolutely it's as effective in many circumstances. Now, there will be times where you need to go in and see the doctor, but this unleashes a whole new way of delivering care in America that brings us really into the 21st century. You know, as part of President Trump's historic response to the coronavirus, he ordered me and the Department of Health and Human Services to unshackle healthcare from so many of the artificial regulatory barriers that had stood in the way of better care, lower cost and more choice for people. And telemedicine is one of those area.You know now, as part of the coronavirus response, from your home you can connect with your doctor, your hospital. You can get so many services delivered, so much diagnosis to take place. Prescription to happen from there. And what he's ordered is that as much of that as we can do by regulation to keep that going even after the coronavirus.BARTIROMO: How do doctors feel about this? Are they looking at a decline in revenue and is that causing them to do anything different? I mean I know that some doctors are readily available and are, you know, agreeable to do things on the phone and certainly to be in touch on text and e-mails, but not everybody. So how does one reach the doctor and what do the doctors have to say about this?AZAR: Well, I've been traveling all around the country. I've met with hospitals and doctors and patients and telehealth has just, in a few short months, become so embedded in the work flow of how we deliver healthcare. I think if somebody tried to unwind the clock, they'd face a revolution at this point.Patients find it more convenient. Doctors are finding it convenient. You know, the key is, they can get paid now for those services.BARTIROMO: Yes.AZAR: So whether it's the phone call, the Skype or the FaceTime, that's a critical difference.We're going to have to have Congress step up to the plate, though, because there are still in statute many artificial restrictions that have kept healthcare from developing into a modern system. But, you know, we went from 14,000 Medicare telehealth visits a week to 1.7 million a week by the end of April.BARTIROMO: Wow.AZAR: So this is something that our seniors and the rest of us are not going to want to give back.BARTIROMO: That's terrific.All right, I want to ask you about this supply chain concerns from China. But before I go there, Secretary, what can you tell us about the coronavirus in terms of these worries over spikes. Where are we right now in terms of this -- in terms of this virus? Are you expecting a second spike in the fall?AZAR: I don't really think it's useful to talk about second waves or that kind of thing. Was we're seeing is emerging outbreaks and effective tactics that can actually get -- get those -- get at those outbreaks. If we all do our part, if we wear face coverings, practice social distancing, use good personal hygiene, avoid scenarios, situations where we can't do those things, like overcrowded bars or overcrowded indoor restaurants and household gatherings of too many people, if we all do our part, we can remain open, but turn around these infection rates.We've seen it in Phoenix. We've seen it in other communities. And now the majority of our states are in -- in a plateau or declining position, but we still have to be very vigilant, all of us, and we have to look for early signs of outbreaks and tackle them right away across the country.BARTIROMO: So it leads me to the question about masks. "The Wall Street Journal" is reporting the FDA's effort to shore up supplies has resulted in masks coming into the country of varying quality.Secretary, some states have stopped using some of these masks because the FDA sparked confusion about which Chinese masks can be trusted.So, what should we think when we've got all of these foreign masks coming in and maybe the ones from China can't be trusted.AZAR: Well, I think that's actually an example of the flexibility and regulatory nimbleness that Commissioner Hahn has brought to the FDA. You know, this is -- this actually dates back to March when we were in the throes of the outbreak there in New York and Connecticut and New Jersey and facing shortages of supplies of N-95 masks. And what the FDA said was these KN-95 masks, which come from China, it set up alternative regulatory pathways for them to come into the country, including if it was a reputable operator, if the product was approved in reputable countries, other than China, or if there was independent data validation behind it.What we found, though, was that on inspection some of the manufacturers were not reliable and they had not actually gotten that independent test verification. FDA quickly removed those products from the market.So I think it just shows that FDA has, under President Trump's direction, been very nimble, very adaptable to meet this unprecedented pandemic.BARTIROMO: This -- this whole worry about getting things from China that we need so much, whether it's prescription drugs and 70 percent of the active ingredients in our prescription drugs made in China, or this mask issue, how long do you expect it to take to start firing up our supply chains in the U.S. so that we could actually produce some of these things here and we don't have to be reliant on Chinese goods?AZAR: Yes. So, Maria, in terms of personal protective equipment, the president's used the Defense Production Act and we're already scaling up domestic manufacturing capability, domestic raw ingredient, active ingredient capabilities for those.In terms of pharmaceuticals, you know, we had a really historic announcement last week where we're going to be standing up the Kodak facility there in Rochester, New York, of active -- of active ingredient manufacturer. We're going to really work with our world leading biopharmaceutical industry to onshore more generic manufacturing, more active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing.And a lot of that's going to be possible, as you know, Maria, thanks to the president's historic tax reforms that got rid of the confiscatory taxes the United States had that forced drug companies really to manufacture in other countries. Now that the president has fixed that, we can onshore capital investment, onshore jobs. And we've seen that across the pharma industry. It will take some time, but the president's committing to onshoring the pharmaceutical and PPE manufacturing as really part of our core strategic capabilities.BARTIROMO: Yes. It's a really important point. We've been talking about that as well.So, Secretary, when looking at the spread of coronavirus, task force coordinator Deborah Birx is warning that it is extraordinarily widespread and that rural areas need to take precautions. Tell me about the issues in rural areas. How concerned are you about where the virus is headed? We've been talking about crowded big cities, and now we're hearing that people who have left the cities and are in the country are also contracting this virus.AZAR: Yes, I do think it's important that everybody be vigilant. I -- you know, since so much of the outbreak initially was focused in the New York metro area and even some of the recent outbreaks have -- we tend to talk about big metro areas like a Phoenix or a Miami or a Dallas or Houston. But it's misleading to -- to -- to think that it is contained just in those areas. People travel into areas. They go on vacation. They come back to rural communities. And we have so much asymptomatic spreading of disease, I think the message is for all of us, it doesn't matter if you're in a small town in -- in rural America, wear face coverings, practice social distancing --BARTIROMO: Yes.AZAR: Use good personal hygiene. Don't go into bar settings that are overcrowded where you're not going to be able to do these things. Don't have family gatherings of large number of people at your house because these are the tools we have as individuals to keep our country open --BARTIROMO: Yes.AZAR: To allow us to be back to work, back to school, back to healthcare, back to worship.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean --AZAR: And we if don't, you end up with shutdowns.BARTIROMO: It just -- it just sounds like we're going to be living with this for a while.Secretary, several companies, of course, have been tapped to aid the White House in terms of the Operation Warp Speed. Will the U.S. be ready to distribute once a vaccine is approved?AZAR: Oh, absolutely. We'll harness the existing CDC systems of distribution for vaccine, the commercial systems of distribution and, of course, we're bringing the entire logistics capabilities of the Defense Department to bear and the unique partnership of Operation Warp Speed. So, absolutely.But, you know, Maria, you -- we were talking a bit about the steps that we as individuals can take here with the -- with the current outbreak that's we're seeing. But, you know, just -- we're just months away from tremendous promise here in terms of therapeutics and vaccines.BARTIROMO: Yes.AZAR: You know, we already have Remdesivir, steroids, convalescent plasma thanks to the president's leadership.BARTIROMO: Yes. All right.AZAR: We have monoclonal antibodies that should come in the next several months.BARTIROMO: It's true. Secretary --AZAR: We've got a contract for 70,000 to 300,000 doses just from Regeneron by the end of September, early fall.BARTIROMO: Yes. Thank you.AZAR: So, so many advances that we -- should have us all very optimistic about the months ahead.BARTIROMO: Secretary, we'll leave it on that optimistic note. Thank you, Secretary Alex Azar.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Bottom lines taking a hit. Many public companies seeing declines this quarter but not Akamai Technologies. The cloud services and cyber security providers latest earnings and revenue beating expectations with more people working from home and utilizing e-commerce due the coronavirus.Joining me right now is the CEO of Akamai, Tom Leighton.And, Tom, it's great to have you this morning. Welcome back. Good to see you.What has this shutdown done for business? Tell us the impact that Akamai has been seeing in the six -- three to six months.TOM LEIGHTON, CEO, AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES: Akamai's business has been very strong because we support a lot of the major websites, commerce companies, video companies, you know, work from home kinds of companies that are being used a lot right now. Pretty much everybody relies on the Internet for everything and Akamai helps make the Internet be fast, reliable and secure.BARTIROMO: And cloud computing has also been a big part of your business. Tell me about that given that we're seeing that part of technology also rise pretty substantially from a business standpoint, is cloud computing part of it?LEIGHTON: A big part of it. In fact, most everything we do involves computing at the edge of the cloud, close to the end user, so the end user can buy what they want really quickly, can get a great quality video experience and can be really productive working from home.BARTIROMO: Tom, I know that another business that you support is TikTok. So I want to get your thoughts on what's going on this morning in terms of this battle to acquire TikTok that Microsoft is under.Stay with us. We'll take a short break and then I'll get your thoughts on TikTok when we come back.Tom Leighton is with us this morning, the CEO of Akamai.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.And we are talking with Akamai CEO Tom Leighton this morning.And, Tom, I want to get your take on really how well positioned Akamai is in this environment, leveraged to some of the major trends happening in consumer and enterprise technology, in particular growth in online gaming, namely video moving online. What's your take on the TikTok situation given the fact that the president is threatening, look, if a deal is not done soon with Microsoft he's going to ban it from the United States.LEIGHTON: Well, I think a deal could make a lot of sense and, you know, it could provide, you know, value to both companies and help resolve whatever regulatory issues there may be.BARTIROMO: And you talked on the conference call about one of the reasons for the third quarter guidance was this uncertainty around TikTok, as well as other issues.How significant is this to your business?LEIGHTON: Well, in India, as you know, there were several dozen apps that were banned and, as a result of that, you know, we'll be receiving $15 million less revenue per quarter. And that was factored into our guidance. I think the impact, if something were to happen in the U.S. like that is far, far less as we said on the call. And, actually, you know, we're optimistic that things can be worked out and that could provide some upside.BARTIROMO: Your global service footprint positions you inside 1,400 networks, 120 different countries. Are there trends you can share with us during the summertime? Do things slow down in the summertime in terms of streaming and these things that, obviously, drive your business?LEIGHTON: Yes, generally the summer season is a little bit lighter in traffic. Of course traffic grows a lot every year and is even, you know, more growth this year. But summer is a light season. I think people are outside. You know, school is not in session and so there's a little bit less usage in the summer than the rest of the year.BARTIROMO: So tell us, Tom, where the growth comes from, let's call it the next three years at Akamai. A lot of analysts out there expecting you to continue to gain global market share and, obviously, your stock price has been performing that way. Where is the growth coming from at Akamai going forward?LEIGHTON: Yes, we are continuing to gain share and that is an important driver for growth. I think the really exciting growth potential is in our security business. It's now running at over $1 billion a year and growing at 28 percent. And the demand there is stronger than ever. You know, one of the interesting, you know, and unfortunate things about the pandemic is the rate of attacks have gone way up, just exploded as, you know, threat actors are trying to take advantage of the distraction of -- by the -- caused by the pandemic and people working from home and their vulnerabilities, and so that's creating a lot of demand for our security services and we're making lots of investment to stay ahead of the threat actors and protect the world's major enterprises.BARTIROMO: Yes. And the bad actors are China and Russia, I guess, largely speaking.Tom, it's great to have you this morning. Thank you, sir.Tom Leighton joining us from Akamai.We'll be right back.Load-Date: August 4, 2020End of Document

Great to see everybody this morning. Welcome.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS HOST: Good morning.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Big day today, we have a lot coming up. First, some of the top stories that we are watching.Isaias has been downgraded to a tropical storm but not before battering the Carolina Coast as a Category-1 hurricane. Isaias made landfall last night near Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina. Strong winds, rain knocked out power to thousands of customers last night. The system also sparking a series of house fires, forcing dozens out of their homes. Isaias expected to churn up the East Coast, slamming coastal areas with heavy downpours and strong winds later today.Democrats and White House officials calling the latest round of talks on a COVID-19 relief bill productive, but there are apparently still some differences to work out. President Trump says he is ready to act on his own if necessary, by using executive orders to freeze evictions and suspend collection of the payroll tax.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, 45TH US PRESIDENT: They want to bail out cities and states that have done a bad job over a long period of time, nothing to do with coronavirus. They're not interested in unemployment, but I'm going to stop it because I'll do it myself if I have to. I have a lot of powers with respect to executive orders.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Sources tell Fox News that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is not confident that they could move a COVID-19 stimulus bill through this week.Well, teachers, parents and students taking to the streets and cities across the country, protesting plans - protesting against plans to reopen schools, while the COVID-19 pandemic is still surging in parts of the country. This is some of the hardest hit states like Florida, California, Texas, are seeing declining numbers of cases and hospitalizations.The White House announcing that random COVID-19 testing is now mandatory for all staff in the executive office of The President.President Trump is backing Microsoft's move to acquire TikTok but he warns that the company faces a U.S. ban if a deal is not reached by September 15th. The President also says that the U.S. should get a cut from this deal because without the United States, it does not have anything. The Trump Administration accusing TikTok, which is based in China, of sharing data with the Chinese government. Overnight, China slammed the potential sale as a "smash and grab" by the United States.Time now for business first. Futures pointed to a lower opening this morning ahead of trading. As you can see, market is down fractionally, stocks ended higher yesterday on the session. The NASDAQ in fact closing at yet another record high, as technology stocks once again soared amidst the coronavirus pandemic shutdown as the digital economy deepens. As you see, the NASDAQ was up 1.5 %.Apple, one of the composite's strongest performers, the company surged 5%, reaching a market cap of $1.92 trillion, put it very close to being the first company ever to reach $2 trillion in market value.Joining me to right now is Potomac Wealth Advisors' President and Founder, Mark Avallone. Good to see you, Mark. Thank you so much for being here.MARK AVALLONE, PRESIDENT & FOUNDER, POTOMAC WEALTH ADVISORS: Good to be here.BARTIROMO: What in your view is behind this move for Apple?AVALLONE: Well, Apple's in a lot of the right places. It has a great product. It has a growing consumer base. Every time, a seven, eight, nine, ten year-old gets a phone these days, it looks like it's an Apple. They connect with their friends and then they're in the ecosystem for decades. And the present value of those cash flows is exactly why Warren Buffet became a huge investor in the company.It's also benefiting from a stay-at-home, work-from-home, and it has also got great management and it seems to be navigating these difficult waters with China, sourcing a lot there relatively inexpensively, but staying out of some of the political squabbles that we're talking about today. It's just hitting all the right notes. And no, I don't think it's overvalued because these valuations are based on cash flows.This is very different than the tech bubble, we're starting to hear analogies to the tech bubble. That's when, and you were covering that. You mentioned earlier you were there, but back in the tech bubble days, there were no cash flows and there were no profits. Very different story right now for our great tech companies.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's really interesting because we had just thrown fundamentals out the window. We were looking at how many clicks to a website and that was really boosting market values in that space. Look, let's talk about the potential sale of TikTok this morning to Microsoft. President Trump setting a September 15th deadline for a deal. The President weighed (ph) in yesterday, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I don't mind if whether it's Microsoft or somebody else, a big company, a secure company, very American company buy it. It's probably easier to buy the whole thing than to buy 30% of it because they say, "How do you do 30%? Who's going to get the name?" The name is hot. The brand is hot. The United States should be reimbursed or it should be paid a substantial amount of money because without the United States, they don't have anything(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Let's bring in Lou Basenese on that. Lou, your reaction to what's happening here on TikTok?LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER & CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH: Look, I think it needs to be somebody else, not Microsoft. Microsoft is an unholy matrimony for TikTok, there is no overlap in what they do. And if you go back to when CEO Satya Nadella came on in 2014, he said Microsoft is going to be all about a mobility and platform company, about productivity and TikTok detracts from productivity. So if you look at the demographic, the majority of users on TikTok are foreign users. They're also in the 16 to 24 age demographic. It makes absolutely no sense.I think if Microsoft moves ahead and they're obviously serious, because it's becoming the headlines, this could be a legacy destroyer. Satya could go from the savior to the sinner at Microsoft. I really think it makes more sense for a company like Facebook. They've done a strong job of incorporating other popular social networks, but obviously that is a proposal that would never fly in Congress right now with all the tech regulation being thrown around.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, they do have the Xbox and that is another acquisition that - they've done a couple of acquisitions actually bringing in young people. Mark Avallone, your reaction to what's taking place, TikTok obviously hot with young people. Microsoft wants to own these 100 million users.AVALLONE: Well, I think it's about the data. Data is the new oil and with a hundred million users, Microsoft's going to be sitting on a treasure trove if it gets that. I agree that there's not some immediate synergy, but Satya Nadella has been a great CEO. Somehow, if he could link this into to the Xbox or - and expand the users of that console, I don't really know exactly where but maybe the smart folks at Microsoft have a grander plan.But as of right now, they're an enterprise company. They're a cloud company and even the Surface Tablet which has been very popular, it has been in the business side, not in the personal consumer side. So there is a gap with TikTok, but this management has proven it can execute. I'm going to give them a pass and say they have a good strategy and they know how to leverage or monetize this investment.BARTIROMO: And do you think that the U.S. will end up getting a slice of this? Getting a cut? You heard what The President said, without the U.S. being the deal maker here, you would not get done.AVALLONE: Well, at the first sound of it, I don't like when the U.S. government starts to meddle in private affairs, but this actually is a legal tactic. CFIUS is allowed to collect revenue from a foreign transaction and put it under review. So it is within the norm. The issue is, it's not a lot of money. The President's saying we're going to get a piece, those revenues are capped.I think that the government has every right to look into the questionable tactics that China uses with apps like this. Simultaneously, they don't let us in to their world and their ecosystems and they shut us down. So I think The President, he's going about it in his usual, relatively loud way, but he is on firm legal ground to be taking some of the actions that he has taken. And I think the sale goes through to Microsoft, not sure if it goes in with the next 45 days, deals often get pushed back, but I think this deal will go through.BARTIROMO: Alright. Mark Avallone, thank you so much for joining us. Lou, you will be with us throughout the program. We'll come back to you on this important topic. Let's take a look at the morning mover this morning, BP, the stock jumping after the energy giant announced it's cutting its dividend in half. While the company reported a record loss for the quarter, it came in better than analysts' expectations. BP also outlined its strategy to lower carbon emissions. The stock right now is up 7.25 % in the pre-market.We're just getting started this morning, coming up, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson makes a major play in the sports world, the details on his Gridiron moves coming up.

Cracking down on China, President Trump's comments about the nation's business dealings rippling through corporate America. Microsoft ready to acquire TikTok's American business and now Zoom is deciding to end sales to Chinese customers.Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Analyst and retired four-star general Jack Keane. General, it's always a pleasure to see you. You are our strategic analyst on all things foreign affairs and I really want to zero in on what's happening on China. Do you think that corporate America is getting it in terms of the national security risks?GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST, FOX NEWS: Yes, most definitely. As much as most countries are reassessing their relationship with the Chinese Communist Party, so are our business companies and it's a smart thing to do.The reality is that we have a market based capitalistic system and China has a state-based capitalistic system. And at times every single day, it may feel like a market based capitalist system when you're operating inside of China.But the harsh reality is, Maria, that the state controls the private sector when they want to, and that is very different than the United States. And your relationship with the Chinese Communist Party can change overnight as a result of their geopolitical influence. And what are we dealing with here? We have seven years of President Xi's leadership, the most ambitious, the most aggressive and the most maligned leader since Mao Zedong.And that is the reality. And his control and his manipulation is unheard of since Mao Zedong in terms of what he's doing internally inside of China and certainly what he's doing externally. We just watched him crush the autonomy of Hong Kong 27 years before the treaty was due to expire. And what he's doing with the Uyghurs inside his country is nothing short of criminal.BARTIROMO: And yet they just elevated him to the level of Mao Zedong by making him dictator for life. The administration has been on an all-out campaign, a whole government campaign to ensure communicating the risks and the national security risks of China to America. You're seeing Christopher Ray just to a week ago say that now China has figured out how to meddle in elections and perhaps to influence Congressional leaders.I want to ask you about this, because there's some conversation going on that there's a problem with Democrats and why they will not bring to the floor bills to hold China accountable. Do you see China trying to influence Congressional members?KEANE: Well, I think that the CCP is very crafty when it comes to American politics. They've learned our way of politics, and yes, certainly they tried to have influence over the political leaders in America, both Democrats as well as Republicans.But the movement in Congress is really in the opposite direction now. I mean the vote on Hong Kong was clearly anti-China vote. Both parties were supporting it overwhelmingly, 400 plus in the House, almost all the Senators, Democrats and Republicans voted for it. There is a strategic shift politically taking place.BARTIROMO: And yet, what about California Senator Dianne Feinstein making some positive comments about the CCP last week talking about the US' relationship with China. I spoke with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday and he responded to it on Sunday Morning Futures. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CA): We hold China as a potential trading partner and as a country growing into a respectable nation.BARTIROMO: Why do some in Congress not say the same thing that you've been saying that this administration has been communicating?MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: I saw the statement from Senator Feinstein. I found it perplexing. The good news is we're getting nearly every member of Congress aligned along the administration's policies on China. I think the tide is turning, I think not only here in the United States, but all across the world. The threat from the Chinese Communist Party is becoming clearer and clearer.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: General, this from the Senator who actually had a driver for 20 years, that then we learned was actually a Chinese spy. For 20 years, he was on her payroll and he was a spy.KEANE: Yes, that's an unfortunate characterization she made. It's a thought process that many people in our country had for 20, 30 years, hoping that China as a result of global influence would not only conduct economic reform, which they did on the Deng Xiaoping, but they would conduct political reform and move closer to an open based democratic society.That thought process has failed miserably and I think most people see China for who they truly are today. It's a fundamental clash of values and an ideological clash similar to what we had with the Soviet Union. But when you look at what they're doing with one million Uyghurs in concentration camps, forced sterilization, forced abortions and forced slave labor, all with the ultimate intent to extinguish this minority population that exists in China, and as I mentioned, crushing the autonomy of Hong Kong and then spreading a localized epidemic to a world pandemic, and then say that China is growing into a respectable nation, that's an absurd statement based on what the facts are.BARTIROMO: Exactly, yes.KEANE: And that's the reality of it and fortunately, most members of Congress do not share that view.BARTIROMO: What do you think about this TikTok situation? Do you think that TikTok, if it is acquired by Microsoft, will ever get rid of the Chinese espionage campaign with TikTok?KEANE: Well, we're never going to get rid of the espionage campaign, but I think the government is going to ensure that there's no tie solely to Chinese Communist Party if Microsoft takes it over. That's the one thing that they have got to do as this deal goes forward.BARTIROMO: General, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much. General Jack Keane joining us. We'll be right back.KEANE: Good talking to you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The mail-in voting debate, President Trump speaking out yesterday on an expected lawsuit against the State of Nevada. It just passed legislation to automatically send mail-in ballots to voters. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: You will have somebody like the Governor of Nevada come out with this massive plan out of nowhere to take millions of ballots and send them all over the place. You'll never know who won that state. It'll get messed up, but universal mail-in ballots is going to be a great embarrassment to our country. We will be suing in Nevada and that's already been taken care of. We'll probably file something tomorrow.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Of course, mail-in voting, Dagen McDowell, very different from absentee voting. What do you think?MCDOWELL: Well Nevada is actually the seventh state to send ballots to all the residents ahead because of the pandemic, to send ballots to all the registered voters in the state. A lawsuit now, but if it is a disaster with mail-in voting on Election Day, as we try to count the votes, they're going to be lawsuits then. It's a nightmare involving a lawsuit between Democrats in New York, between Carolyn Maloney in the primary race with Suraj Patel.Suraj Patel, part of a lawsuit. Again, it was a snafu over mail-in voting that Governor Cuomo oversaw. Suraj Patel, Carolyn Maloney's challenger, has charged voter suppression and that an election law snafu might disenfranchise a massive number of voters. That's on the Democrats.What they need to do in all these states is move up the deadlines for these mail-in ballots to arrive, so we actually know who won the Presidential election and Senate elections and House elections in November.BARTIROMO: Well, Facebook is educating users on mail-in voting. It's attempting to prevent the spread of disinformation. Lou, your thoughts on that?BASENESE: Look, I think it's laughable. I mean at what point did Facebook become the de facto educator of the masses? That platform has been used, and I know Dagen shares as much disdain for Facebook as I do, for the spread of misinformation and content that should never be shared.So I think relying on them to step in and bridge the gap just makes absolutely no sense. If we can have in-person protesting, why can't we have in-person voting? And instead of moving to just a broad based mail-in system, why not have an extra day or two of voting, open the polls a day earlier, do things that aren't so open to fraud and allegations of fraud.I mean, at this point, I wouldn't be surprised if you start seeing lawsuits already for a recount just preemptively because people know mail-in voting is just going to be wrought with so many problems. So I don't think Facebook or any platform could step in to really make that any different.BARTIROMO: I mean anybody who moved, they could get their mail-in ballot voted to the old house and who knows who gets it? I mean there are a lot of opportunities for fraud and mistakes with mail-in voting. Any thoughts here, Jon Hilsenrath?HILSENRATH: Yea, two things to echo what Dagen said. I think one of the big worries we should have right now is that we're not going to know who's the next President or who's running the House and the Senate for weeks or months after the election, because it takes time to count these ballots.Having said that, the constitution very explicitly gives the states the power to decide how the voting process works. So the White House can certainly sue the states, but the constitution says it's their job to manage that process, and that's going to be managed differently in different states.BARTIROMO: No, you're right. It's the state legislature for sure. Alright, we'll take a break. When we come back, Washington stimulus battle continues, where negotiation stand this morning on the latest coronavirus package, that's next. And then coronavirus pandemic making your work day longer and now there are numbers to prove that. We are back right after this break. Stay with us.MARIA BARTIROMO, ANCHOR, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Welcome back, good Tuesday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, August, 4th. Let's take a look at markets this morning, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast. We are looking at some pressure underway. Investors awaiting an agreement on a new round of stimulus, tensions with China remain high and as a result, you've got the Dow futures down 39, the Nasdaq futures lower by 33 and the S&P futures right now down by 9 points.Month of August kicking off with a rally, meanwhile, yesterday was strong, the Nasdaq hit another record high. It is up nearly 110 percent since the election of President Trump. The Dow Industrials were up 236 points, the Nasdaq was up 157 and the S&P was up 23 yesterday at 4 O'clock on Wall Street. Global markets this morning are mixed, the European indices look like this, FTSE 100 up a fraction as is the CAC Quarante in Paris, but the Dax Index in Germany lower by 60 points.The U.K. government looking to boost its economy by investing $1.7 billion in building projects. In Asia overnight, it was green across the board following that rally on Wall Street yesterday, best performer was Hong Kong with the Hang Seng index up 2 percent. Well, a Minnesota court investigating how police body cam video of George Floyd's arrest was leaked to the media. Cheryl Casone with the details on that. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: That's right, Maria. The video obtained by "The Daily Mail" is from the body cameras worn by former Minneapolis police officers. Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Keung, the video shows George Floyd begging one of the officers not to shoot him just minutes before he died while being pinned down by officer Derek Chauvin. "The Daily Mail" is not saying how they got the video, right now, the only to view it is by appointment at the courthouse.Minnesota's attorney general says his office is not behind the leak. Well, we now have a cause for the massive wild fire burning in southern California. Officials say the apple fire was sparked last Friday by a malfunctioning diesel vehicle. Several thousand people have been forced to evacuate as crews fight the fire just east of Los Angeles. The apple fire has spread to nearly 27,000 acres and is only 7 percent contained. Finally, some positive progress to report as Boeing works to return the 737 Max to service.In a 36-page document, the FAA is proposing four changes to the plane's design and operation, including the software system that played a role in two fatal crashes. Boeing's spokesperson says this was an important milestone in the certification process. It is still not clear when the Max will be allowed to return to U.S. airspace this year. Here is the stock. Dow component Boeing higher by more than 1 percent in the pre-market. And here's a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. American, Delta and United are going to resume some international flights this month.Pittsburgh will start handing out $500 monthly payments to residents struggling from the pandemic. All part of a guaranteed income program which is funded by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. And Virgin Galactic unveiling its new supersonic commercial jet that will go from New York City to London in about two hours. Sign me up, Maria, and those are your headlines. Back to you.BARTIROMO: Not bad. All right, thanks so much, Cheryl. President Trump signed two executive orders yesterday, one expanding tele-health, the other ordering federal agencies to prioritize hiring American workers. The President says he could take even more action including payroll tax cuts and evictions protections when it comes to COVID-19 relief.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They want to bail out cities and states that have done a bad job over a long period of time. Nothing to do with coronavirus. They're not interested in unemployment. They're not interested in evictions which is a big deal. But I'm going to stop it because I'll do it myself if I have to. I have a lot of powers with respect to executive orders.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is the "Washington Examiner" chief political correspondent, Fox News contributor Byron York. Byron, it's great to see you this morning, thank you so much for being here. What do you make of --BYRON YORK, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Good --BARTIROMO: Stimulus back and forth. Do you think we'll get something before they go home again for their recess on August 7th?YORK: Well, isn't this the classic scenario we have and spending fights in Washington? The -- something needs to be done. So they need to continue these enhanced unemployment benefits. They need to continue PPP, so something needs to be done. But Democrats want to attach much more spending to it, and in this case as the president was referring a trillion dollars in aid to state and local communities and Republicans say, no.I think the Democrats are doing it because they realize in the end, since these other things are desperately needed, they'll get some of what they want. So, yes, I think they'll be a deal, and I think Democrats will get some of what they want and in their view come out ahead of where they would have been had they not held out.BARTIROMO: What about these debates, Byron, Democrats apparently split over whether Joe Biden should go a head-to-head with President Trump. There is an increasing push for Joe Biden to not do any debates. The campaign is saying that it's ready. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KATE BEDINGFIELD, JOE BIDEN 2020 COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: There's one candidate in this race who has agreed to 3 debates, and that's Joe Biden. The Trump campaign has actually not agreed yet to participate in the debates.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And yet you see what the media is saying, Byron --YORK: Well, that's the campaign's position --BARTIROMO: I mean, the media is --YORK: Yes --BARTIROMO: Yes, go ahead.YORK: Well, that's what the campaign's position is. But what's interesting is here, we are hearing some Democratic pro-Biden voices saying, let's don't have any debates. And their rationale is they say President Trump lies so much that there could not be real-time fact-checking, and thus, the American people would be misled, but there's something else going on here.Clearly, a number of people -- and Joe Lockhart; the former Clinton-White House spokesman is the most prominent of them, seem to think that if there were debates and Biden took part in them, that perhaps he wouldn't do that well or that Trump would do better. And they feel that Biden is doing quite well in the polls, a 7-plus percentage-point lead right now in the "RealClearPolitics" average of national polls.He's doing well without getting out, he's doing well without really leaving his basement as they say. So they feel like they don't simply need the debates. On the other hand, remember, we've had presidential debates every cycle since 1976, sometimes they had played key roles in campaigns. They're a critical way for voters to evaluate the two candidates side-by-side. They really have to happen.BARTIROMO: I mean, this is a new low for the media, I'm sorry, but these arguments in the op-ed pages to get him to not do a debate. You've got "The New York Times" columnist Tom Freedman saying "I worry about Joe Biden debating Donald Trump. He should do it only under two conditions, otherwise he's giving Trump unfair advantages." Unfair advantages because you're in a debate? What's the unfair advantage?(LAUGHTER)YORK: And what were the two conditions?BARTIROMO: I mean, it's a joke --YORK: One of the conditions was that Trump release his tax returns, and then the other was the fact --BARTIROMO: Right --YORK: Check thing I've talked --BARTIROMO: Exactly --YORK: About. Yes, you do -- and you have some of these pro-Biden voices, look, I think they are concerned. But here again, I know a lot of my Twitter followers, they say, oh, Joe Biden is old, he's seen now, he's not up to it. Joe Biden took part in 11 Democratic debates between mid-2019 and March of this year. There were a lot of debates now, he didn't really do great a number, but he took part and I'm -- and he ended up with a nomination. So, he can participate in debates --BARTIROMO: Yes --YORK: And I do think most of the voices --BARTIROMO: Well --YORK: We've been hearing are media voices that are concerned about him.BARTIROMO: That's what I'm saying. Yes, it's a new low for the media. Here's one more. This was former Hillary Clinton adviser Zac Petkanas, he's urging Biden not to feel obligated to do any debates. Don't feel obligated to throw Trump a life line by granting him any debates at all. He said -- I mean, this is just outrageous. All right, quick one before we go, Byron, I've got to ask your thoughts on the mail-in voting controversy, the president is warning legal action over a bill passed by the Nevada legislature to send mail-in ballots to every voter. Your reaction?YORK: Well, the president is doing that, and also he spent a good deal of time in his news conference yesterday talking about the situation in New York where the 12th congressional district race which voted on June 23rd is still not decided because of massive dysfunction with vote by mail.And I think what we've seen in the past few days is Democrats defended voting by mail because Trump attacked it, so if he attacks it, they've got to defend it. But I think in the past few days, you've seen a number of voices looking at this, and saying, even if there's no fraud at all, voting by mail could be a significant, huge problem, we won't have a winner of the presidential election on election night.We might not have it 1, 2, 3, 4 weeks later. So this could be an enormous problem giving all the lawsuits, the civil unrests, division that could take place if you have a month with an undecided presidential election in this environment. So I think now we're seeing a number of people on both sides of the political divide worried about voting by mail.BARTIROMO: Well, it's unbelievable. I mean, it's OK to have these peaceful protests, and I say "peaceful" in quotes, and, yet, we can't just go to the voting booth and vote like we always do. Byron, it's good to see you this morning, thank you so much, we will keep watching all of the above. Byron York there joining us this morning. Coming up, The Rock sports play; the Hollywood star hoping to score a touchdown, we'll tell you what The Rock is up against now in his latest business venture.Then marking 25 years, I will be ringing the opening bell this morning, I am so excited to do so, celebrating my debut on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange 25 years ago today. We are coming back and looking at some of the most memorable moments. You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A Hollywood ending for the XFL. Actor and wrestling legend Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson tweeting he is buying the bankrupt professional football league for $15 million. The Rock partnering with a group including producer Danny Garcia. Joining me right now is former WWE superstar, Fox News contributor John Layfield. John, great to see you. Can The Rock make Vince McMahon's creation work?JOHN LAYFIELD, FORMER WWE SUPERSTAR: It's great to see you, Maria, and congratulations again on your wonderful anniversary for your accomplishments. And yes --BARTIROMO: Thank you --LAYFIELD: I believe that The Rock can -- XFL last year was doing quite well in the Spring. In the ratings were good, the live attendances -- crowds were doing well, the live events were doing very well, then the COVID nightmare hit, and that's what happened to the XFL. I think the -- America wants a Spring football league, that's why you've seen one since the UXFL in the early '80s is trying to make it now.I think The Rock has a real chance here, The Rock is very much like Vince McMahon, he's one of the most creative people in the world. The Rock's partnered with RedBird Capital and his wife -- ex-wife Danny Garcia. RedBird is also bought a Toulouse Football Club, soccer club in Europe recently. So, there's some sports knowledge coming from there. I think The Rock has a great chance of making it -- everything he's touched has turned to gold. I'm not sure why this wouldn't.BARTIROMO: Wow, Dagen, jump in here.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: John, so good to see you. You actually wrestled with The Rock in the WWE, and I know that the attitude among people who didn't get wrestling really changed in part because of you and The Rock. What do you think that he is going to do with the XFL? Just -- I know the sky is the limit, but what do you see him doing with the league?LAYFIELD: I think he's going to continue, he and Vince McMahon are still good friends, as far as I know, they started a good collaborative relationship, and I think what Vince was doing is what Rock is going to continue to do with the XFL. You bring in a great game, America's most popular game of football into the next century, the millennial generation that's coming out right now. That doesn't have as far as the attention span.So, they were doing a great job of speeding the game up (INAUDIBLE), making the game a lot faster, making the game more continuous, much like you can say European soccer, European rugby --BARTIROMO: Sure --LAYFIELD: Finally get the game done in about 2 and a half hours, 2 hours, 15 minutes to 2 and a half hours. I think that continues. I think the game just becomes more fun. You know, when you have game that's been around as long as the NFL, there are so much money tied to it, so much bureaucracy creeps in. And so you have a game that becomes a little bit longer, you have a game that becomes quite as not much fun because you have so many different rules and variations and rules.I think stripping some of that back when you can start over like the XFL, that's what Vince McMahon was having success with, but the XFL, I think that's what The Rock will do as well. He is the most talented guy I've ever --BARTIROMO: All right --LAYFIELD: Got a chance to work with. I've got a chance to work with Hulk Hogan, Stone Cold Steve Austin, John Cena, Bruno Sammartino, some wonderful people in the history of this business, he is the most talented I've ever seen.BARTIROMO: Wow, what a list there. John, it's great to see you this morning, thanks very much for your insights on this, we'll be watching. John Layfield joining us there. Coming up --LAYFIELD: Great to see you, you guys are doing a wonderful job, thank you --BARTIROMO: Got talents -- thank you, John. One Olympic swimmer show some skills with a glass of chocolate milk -- wait until you see this, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, time for the Morning Buzz. First up, longer work days in quarantine. Workers spending about 48 and a half more minutes a day at their desks, according to a new study. Lou, are we becoming even more efficient or burning out?LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER & CHIEF ANALYST, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH: No, I think we're burning out, I think the irony here is, we probably all thought we would be more productive at home, but we didn't anticipate that being at home would also mean having the kids at home, our spouse or partners at home too and make things much more difficult.I think you know, one of the things that has happened for many people now, and the study found it is that the number of meetings has gone up by about 15 percent, so it's extending our work day. We're just not as productive -- I mean, personally, I know that what used to be a quick phone call has now turned into an endless Zoom meeting. So I think when we're done with this pandemic, we're all going to have Zoom withdrawal or just revolt from ever using it again.But the fact of the matter is, our work day has a new normal and we've got to figure it out and adjust in that. And that's a key concern, I think for employers having so many employees at home and trying to figure out productivity in an economy that has always relied on being much more productive than anyone else.BARTIROMO: Speaking of Zoom, good morning Zoom. The classic goodnight moon getting its own quarantine rewrite. The author of Manhattan-based investment banker who wanted to help her kids deal with the new normal -- Jon, I'm sure, you know the original. How will this redo fare? What do you think?JON HILSENRATH, SENIOR WRITER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: I might be original to my kids all the time, and it was a very -- during calm, nice book that was perfect for bed time, very kind. There were no politics in it, there were no current events. I'll take the original over this new one a 100 times out of a 100.BARTIROMO: And I don't know if it's so sleepy to be looking at that computer with the Zoom meeting on it. I mean, come on.HILSENRATH: Yes --BARTIROMO: And finally this, Olympic level balancing act. Check this out. Five-time gold medal swimmer Katie Ledecky is showing off her skills in a new Got Milk ad. She's swimming a lab without spilling a drop of the chocolate milk on her head. Dagen, what do you think?MCDOWELL: How did Katie Ledecky know that she could do that? I mean, how did she discover that her head is flat in the back potentially and that a glass of cold beverage would sit nicely on it. I watched the video a few times, and she's smooth. And she's even smoother for getting us and probably every other network to play an advertisement for milk.BARTIROMO: I love it. I love it. All right, still ahead, marking 25 years. We will be taking a look back at some of my most memorable moments from my debut on the New York Stock Exchange 25 years ago this morning. Plus, it's time for you to ask the questions, "ASK THE PANEL" will debut later this month. Please send us a video of your questions, it might be answered on air by our panelists. We can't wait to hear from you.

In China's Xinjiang, forced medication accompanies lockdownAssociated Press InternationalAugust 31, 2020 Monday 8:22 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 1927 wordsByline: DAKE KANG, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) — When police arrested the middle-aged Uighur woman at the height of China’s coronavirus outbreak, she was crammed into a cell with dozens of other women in a detention center.There, she said, she was forced to drink a medicine that made her feel weak and nauseous, guards watching as she gulped. She and the others also had to strip naked once a week and cover their faces as guards hosed them and their cells down with disinfectant “like firemen,” she said.“It was scalding,” recounted the woman by phone from Xinjiang, declining to be named out of fear of retribution. “My hands were ruined, my skin was peeling.”The government in China’s far northwest Xinjiang region is resorting to draconian measures to combat the coronavirus, including physically locking residents in homes, imposing quarantines of more than 40 days and arresting those who do not comply. Furthermore, in what experts call a breach of medical ethics, some residents are being coerced into swallowing traditional Chinese medicine, according to government notices, social media posts and interviews with three people in quarantine in Xinjiang. There is a lack of rigorous clinical data showing traditional Chinese medicine works against the virus, and one of the herbal remedies used in Xinjiang, Qingfei Paidu, includes ingredients banned in Germany, Switzerland, the U.S. and other countries for high levels of toxins and carcinogens.The latest grueling lockdown, now in its 45th day, comes in response to 826 cases reported in Xinjiang since mid-July, China’s largest caseload since the initial outbreak. But the Xinjiang lockdown is especially striking because of its severity, and because there hasn’t been a single new case of local transmission in over a week.Harsh lockdowns have been imposed elsewhere in China, most notably in Wuhan in Hubei province, where the virus was first detected. But though Wuhan grappled with over 50,000 cases and Hubei with 68,000 in all, many more than in Xinjiang, residents there weren’t forced to take traditional medicine and were generally allowed outdoors within their compounds for exercise or grocery deliveries.The response to an outbreak of more than 300 cases in Beijing in early June was milder still, with a few select neighborhoods locked down for a few weeks. In contrast, more than half of Xinjiang’s 25 million people are under a lockdown that extends hundreds of miles from the center of the outbreak in the capital, Urumqi, according to an AP review of government notices and state media reports.Even as Wuhan and the rest of China has mostly returned to ordinary life, Xinjiang's lockdown is backed by a vast surveillance apparatus that has turned the region into a digital police state. Over the past three years, Xinjiang authorities have swept a million or more Uighurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities into various forms of detention, including extrajudicial internment camps, under a widespread security crackdown.After being detained for over a month, the Uighur woman was released and locked into her home. Conditions are now better, she told the AP, but she is still under lockdown, despite regular tests showing she is free of the virus.Once a day, she says, community workers force traditional medicine in white unmarked bottles on her, saying she’ll be detained if she doesn’t drink them. The AP saw photos of the bottles, which match those in images from another Xinjiang resident and others circulating on Chinese social media.Authorities say the measures taken are for the well-being of all residents, though they haven’t commented on why they are harsher than those taken elsewhere. The Chinese government has struggled for decades to control Xinjiang, at times clashing violently with many of the region’s native Uighurs, who resent Beijing’s heavy-handed rule.“The Xinjiang Autonomous Region upheld the principle of people and life first\u2026.and guaranteed the safety and health of local people of all ethnic groups,” Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a press briefing Friday.Xinjiang authorities can carry out the harsh measures, experts say, because of its lavishly funded security apparatus, which by some estimates deploys the most police per capita of anywhere on the planet.“Xinjiang is a police state, so it’s basically martial law,” says Darren Byler, a researcher on the Uighurs at the University of Colorado. “They think Uighurs can’t really police themselves, they have to be forced to comply in order for a quarantine to be effective.”Not all the recent outbreak measures in Xinjiang are targeted at the Uighurs and other largely Muslim minorities. Some are being enforced on China’s majority Han residents in Xinjiang as well, though they are generally spared the extrajudicial detention used against minorities. This month, thousands of Xinjiang residents took to social media to complain about what they called excessive measures against the virus in posts that are often censored, some with images of residents handcuffed to railings and front doors sealed with metal bars.One Han Chinese woman with the last name of Wang posted photos of herself drinking traditional Chinese medicine in front of a medical worker in full protective gear.“Why are you forcing us to drink medicine when we’re not sick!” she asked in a Aug. 18 post that was swiftly deleted. “Who will take responsibility if there’s problems after drinking so much medicine? Why don’t we even have the right to protect our own health?”A few days later she simply wrote: “I’ve lost all hope. I cry when I think about it.”After the heavy criticism, the authorities eased some restrictions last week, now allowing some residents to walk in their compounds, and a limited few to leave the region after a bureaucratic approval process.Wang did not respond to a request for interviews. But her account is in line with many others posted on social media, as well as those interviewed by the AP.One Han businessman working between Urumqi and Beijing told the AP he was put in quarantine in mid-July. Despite having taken coronavirus tests five times and testing negative each time, he said, the authorities still haven’t let him out – not for so much as a walk. When he’s complained about his condition online, he said, he’s had his posts deleted and been told to stay silent.“The most terrible thing is silence,” he wrote on Chinese social media site Weibo in mid-August. “After a long silence, you will fall into the abyss of hopelessness.”“I’ve been in this room for so long, I don’t remember how long. I just want to forget,” he wrote again, days later. “I’m writing out my feelings to reassure myself I still exist. I fear I’ll be forgotten by the world.”“I’m falling apart,” he told the AP more recently, declining to be named out of fear of retribution.He, too, is being forced to take Chinese traditional medicine, he said, including liquid from the same unmarked white bottles as the Uighur woman. He is also forced to take Lianhua Qingwen, a herbal remedy seized regularly by U.S. Customs and Border patrol for violating FDA laws by falsely claiming to be effective against COVID-19.Since the start of the outbreak, the Chinese government has pushed traditional medicine on its population. The remedies are touted by President Xi Jinping, China’s nationalist, authoritarian leader, who has advocated a revival of traditional Chinese culture. Although some state-backed doctors say they have conducted trials showing the medicine works against the virus, no rigorous clinical data supporting that claim has been published in international scientific journals.“None of these medicines have been scientifically proven to be effective and safe,” said Fang Shimin, a former biochemist and writer known for his investigations of scientific fraud in China who now lives in the United States. “It’s unethical to force people, sick or healthy, to take unproven medicines.”When the virus first started spreading, thousands flooded pharmacies in Hubei province searching for traditional remedies after state media promoted their effectiveness against the virus. Packs of pills were tucked into care packages sent to Chinese workers and students overseas, some emblazoned with the Chinese flag, others reading: “The motherland will forever firmly back you up”.But the new measures in Xinjiang forcing some residents to take the medicine is unprecedented, experts say. The government says that the participation rate in traditional Chinese medicine treatment in the region has “reached 100%”, according to a state media report. When asked about resident complaints that they were being forced to take Chinese medicine, one local official said it was being done “according to expert opinion.”“We’re helping resolve the problems of ordinary people,” said Liu Haijiang, the head of Dabancheng district in Urumqi, “like getting their children to school, delivering them medicine or getting them a doctor.”With Xi’s ascent, critics of Chinese traditional medicine have fallen silent. In April, an influential Hubei doctor, Yu Xiangdong, was removed from a hospital management position for questioning the efficacy of the remedies, an acquittance confirmed. A government notice online said Yu “openly published inappropriate remarks slandering the nation’s epidemic prevention policy and traditional Chinese medicine.”In March, the World Health Organization removed guidance on its site saying that herbal remedies were not effective against the virus and could be harmful, saying it was “too broad”. And in May, the Beijing city government announced a draft law that would criminalize speech “defaming or slandering” traditional Chinese medicine. Now, the government is pushing traditional Chinese remedies as a treatment for COVID-19 overseas, sending pills and specialists to countries such as Iran, Italy, and the Philippines.Other leaders have also spearheaded unproven and potentially risky remedies – notably U.S. President Donald Trump, who stumped for the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which can cause heart rhythm problems, despite no evidence that it’s effective against COVID-19. But China appears to be the first to force citizens — at least in Xinjiang — to take them.The Chinese government’s push for traditional medicine, given free to Xinjiang residents, is bolstering the fortunes of billionaires and padding state coffers. The family of Wu Yiling, the founder of the company that makes Lianhua Qingwen, has seen the value of their stake more than double in the past six months, netting them over a billion dollars. Also profiting: the Guangdong government, which owns a stake in Wu’s company.“It’s a huge waste of money, these companies are making millions,” said a public health expert who works closely with the Chinese government, declining to be identified out of fear of retribution. “But then again – why not take it? There’s a placebo effect, it’s not that harmful. Why bother? There’s no point in fighting on this.”Measures vary widely by city and neighborhood, and not all residents are taking the medication. The Uighur woman says that despite the threats against her, she’s flushing the liquid and pills down the toilet. A Han man whose parents are in Xinjiang told the AP that for them, the remedies are voluntary.Though the measures are “extreme,” he says, they’re understandable.“There’s no other way if the government wants to control this epidemic,” he said, declining to be named to avoid retribution. “We don’t want our outbreak to become like Europe or America.”Load-Date: August 31, 2020End of Document

Filing: Kansas prof's prosecution criminalizes job disputesAssociated Press State & LocalAugust 14, 2020 Friday 8:41 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: DOMESTIC NEWS; STATE AND REGIONALLength: 803 wordsByline: ROXANA HEGEMAN and ERIC TUCKER, Associated PressDateline: BELLE PLAINE, Kan. BodyBELLE PLAINE, Kan. (AP) — The prosecution of a Kansas researcher ensnared in a U.S. government crackdown on Chinese economic espionage and trade secret theft opens the door to criminalizing workplace disagreements, his attorneys argued Friday in a motion asking a court to throw out the charges.Feng “Franklin” Tao is charged with not disclosing on conflict-of-interest forms work he was allegedly doing for China while employed at the University of Kansas — something federal prosecutors have portrayed as a scheme to defraud the university, the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation.In their request to dismiss the case, defense lawyers Peter Zeidenberg and Michael Dearington wrote that the government seeks to use Tao's prosecution as a potential new model for the Justice Department to prosecute professors “without having to produce evidence of intellectual property theft or export control violations.”The motion takes aim at the broader China Initiative announced by the Justice Department in 2018 to counter the threat of Chinese espionage and intellectual property theft, including on American college campuses. Since then, federal prosecutors have charged Chinese academics across the country of failing to disclose foreign sources of funding and lying about their links to China.The Trump administration, meanwhile, has escalated its rhetoric against Beijing and taken steps to confront China, including by shutting down the Chinese consulate in Houston and through executive actions that ban dealings with the Chinese owners of TikTok and WeChat. FBI Director Chris Wray said in a speech last month that the bureau opens a new counterintelligence case linked to China about every 10 hours.The indictment against Tao alleges that the Lawrence man's motive was to help China by participating in its “talent plan,” which prosecutors contend is designed to encourage the transfer of original ideas and intellectual property from U.S. universities to Chinese government institutions.Prosecutors accuse Tao of not informing the University of Kansas that he was selected for the Changjiang Professorship or the salary for his appointment to Fuzhou University in China.In their motion, his lawyers warn that the case would open the door to criminalizing employment disputes that are better resolved by a human resources department. Tao faces 10 counts, including seven counts of wire fraud, based on two conflict-of-interest forms he submitted to the university.“The Department of Justice is not the Ministry of Truth, and it lacks authority to regulate routine, private miscommunications between employees and employers regarding employee activities," the motion says.The motion presents hypothetical scenarios in which an employee who misleads an employer could wind up prosecuted, rather than simply reprimanded or fired by an employer. It raises questions about whether a doctor’s office employee in Missouri who falsely calls in sick from his home in Kansas could be charged with wire fraud if he continues to collect his salary, or prosecuted with false statements if the office receives Medicaid reimbursements from the federal government.“This is because the Indictment equates dishonesty in the workplace with fraud, merely because all employees receive salary from their employers, and false statements, merely because an employer receives federal funding,” the lawyers wrote.“If the Court permits this Indictment to proceed to trial, it would open the floodgates to a vast range of federal prosecutions for garden-variety employment disputes that otherwise would have, at most, subjected the employee to administrative discipline at work," they added. "This government overreach would not be limited to university professors.”Tao, an associate professor of engineering, was born in China and moved to the United States in 2002. He has been employed since August 2014 at the University of Kansas' Center for Environmentally Beneficial Catalysis, which conducts research on sustainable technology to conserve natural resources and energy.Justice Department prosecutors in recent years have been particularly focused on Chinese government initiatives that recruit professors in specialized areas in the United States to work in China.A professor who has worked at the University of Arkansas was indicted last month on charges of wire fraud and passport fraud for allegedly failing to disclose ties to the Chinese government and Chinese companies when he received grant money from NASA.Also last month, a rheumatology professor and medical researcher who worked at schools including Ohio State University was charged with using millions of dollars in grant money from the U.S. government to help China develop expertise in rheumatology and immunology.___Tucker reported from Washington.Load-Date: August 14, 2020End of Document

TECH COMPANIES SHOULD STAND UP TO CHINA'S BULLYINGStates News ServiceAugust 11, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 400 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Global tech giants censoring on behalf of the Chinese government for the China market is not news, but Zoom has taken appeasement to the next level by directly censoring users outside of China on the government's behalf. This should serve as a wake-up call to tech companies that keep acceding to Beijing's censorship demands.On June 7, Zoom shut down a US-based Chinese dissident's account after he held a Tiananmen Massacre memorial that was joined by China-based activists and families of victims of the 1989 massacre. Zoom later reactivated the account and said that the suspension was to "comply with local law."It is unclear what Chinese "law" Zoom is referring to that would compel Zoom to censor users outside of China. Besides, freedom of speech is guaranteed in the Chinese constitution and there is no law banning people from attending a vigil to commemorate the Tiananmen Massacre."Complying with local laws" has been repeatedly cited as the reason by international companies when they relent to political pressure from Beijing. Apple said it was "complying with local laws" when it removed hundreds of virtual private network (VPN) apps from China's App Store. LinkedIn said the same when it blocked content critical of the Chinese government.Laws in China are often abusive and don't comply with international human rights standards. Yet tech companies have a responsibility to respect human rights. Yahoo's reputation remains tarnished two decades after it handed over the email records of two journalists to Chinese authorities, which resulted in the pair being sentenced to 10 years in prison.Beijing's fit of rage last year with the National Basketball Association after the general manager of the Houston Rockets posted a tweet supporting the Hong Kong protests shows that any criticism even outside of China can put even major companies' holdings there in jeopardy. Tech companies can never be sure that they won't land themselves in the same predicament no matter how hard they try to stay in the Chinese Communist Party's good graces. Without the rule of law and the protection of basic rights, everyone and every business live in fear of the Party's wrath.Tech companies should stand together to resist Beijing's censorship demands and uphold the right to freedom of expression. Otherwise, the groveling will never end.Load-Date: August 12, 2020End of Document

Congressional Research Service Report: 'Emerging Military Technologies: Background & Issues for Congress'Targeted News ServiceAugust 5, 2020 Wednesday 8:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 8632 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Congressional Research Service issued the following report (No. R46458) entitled "Emerging Military Technologies: Background and Issues for Congress". Here are excerpts of the report issued on Aug. 4 and written by Kelley M. Sayler, analyst in advanced technology and global security:Summary:Members of Congress and Pentagon officials are increasingly focused on developing emerging military technologies to enhance U.S. national security and keep pace with U.S. competitors. The U.S. military has long relied upon technological superiority to ensure its dominance in conflict and to underwrite U.S. national security. In recent years, however, technology has both rapidly evolved and rapidly proliferated--largely as a result of advances in the commercial sector. As former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel observed, this development has threatened to erode the United States' traditional sources of military advantage. The Department of Defense (DOD) has undertaken a number of initiatives to arrest this trend. For example, in 2014, DOD announced the Third Offset Strategy, an effort to exploit emerging technologies for military and security purposes as well as associated strategies, tactics, and concepts of operation. In support of this strategy, DOD established a number of organizations focused on defense innovation, including the Defense Innovation Unit and the Defense Wargaming Alignment Group.More recently, the 2018 National Defense Strategy echoed the underpinnings of the Third Offset Strategy, noting that U.S. national security will likely be affected by rapid technological advancements and the changing character of war.... New technologies include advanced computing, "big data" analytics, artificial intelligence, autonomy, robotics, directed energy, hypersonics, and biotechnology--the very technologies that ensure we will be able to fight and win the wars of the future.The United States is the leader in developing many of these technologies. However, China and Russia--key strategic competitors--are making steady progress in developing advanced military technologies. As these technologies are integrated into foreign and domestic military forces and deployed, they could hold significant implications for the future of international security writ large, and will have to be a significant focus for Congress, both in terms of funding and program oversight.This report provides an overview of selected emerging military technologies in the United States, China, and Russia:* artificial intelligence,* lethal autonomous weapons,* hypersonic weapons,* directed energy weapons,* biotechnology, and* quantum technology.It also discusses relevant initiatives within international institutions to monitor or regulate these technologies, considers the potential implications of emerging military technologies for warfighting, and outlines associated issues for Congress. These issues include the level and stability of funding for emerging technologies, the management structure for emerging technologies, the challenges associated with recruiting and retaining technology workers, the acquisitions process for rapidly evolving and dual-use technologies, the protection of emerging technologies from theft and expropriation, and the governance and regulation of emerging technologies.Such issues could hold implications for congressional authorization, appropriation, oversight, and treaty-making.* * *Contents:IntroductionArtificial Intelligence (AI)United StatesChinaRussiaInternational InstitutionsPotential Questions for CongressLethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (LAWS)United StatesChinaRussiaInternational InstitutionsPotential Questions for CongressHypersonic WeaponsUnited StatesChinaRussiaInternational InstitutionsPotential Questions for CongressDirected-Energy (DE) WeaponsUnited StatesChinaRussiaInternational InstitutionsPotential Questions for CongressBiotechnologyUnited StatesChinaRussiaInternational InstitutionsPotential Questions for CongressQuantum TechnologyUnited StatesChinaRussiaInternational InstitutionsPotential Questions for CongressPotential Implications of Emerging Technologies for WarfightingIssues for CongressFunding ConsiderationsManagementPersonnelAcquisitionIntellectual PropertySupply Chain SecurityTechnology ProtectionGovernance and RegulationOversight* * *IntroductionMembers of Congress and Pentagon officials are increasingly focused on developing emerging military technologies to enhance U.S. national security and keep pace with U.S. competitors. The U.S. military has long relied upon technological superiority to ensure its dominance in conflict and to underwrite U.S. national security.

Such issues could hold implications for congressional authorization, appropriation, oversight, and treaty-making.Artificial Intelligence (AI)/4Although the U.S. government has no official definition of artificial intelligence, policymakers generally use the term AI to refer to a computer system capable of human-level cognition. AI is further divided into two categories: narrow AI and general AI. Narrow AI systems can perform only the specific task that they were trained to perform, while general AI systems would be capable of performing a broad range of tasks, including those for which they were not specifically trained. General AI systems do not yet--and may never--exist./5Narrow AI is currently being incorporated into a number of military applications by both the United States and its competitors. Such applications include but are not limited to intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance;/6 logistics; cyber operations; command and control; and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. These technologies are intended in part to augment or replace human operators, freeing them to perform more complex and cognitively demanding work. In addition, AI-enabled systems could (1) react significantly faster than systems that rely on operator input; (2) cope with an exponential increase in the amount of data available for analysis; and (3) enable new concepts of operations, such as swarming (i.e., cooperative behavior in which unmanned vehicles autonomously coordinate to achieve a task) that could confer a warfighting advantage by overwhelming adversary defensive systems.Narrow AI, however, could introduce a number of challenges. For example, such systems may be subject to algorithmic bias as a result of their training data. Researchers have repeatedly discovered instances of racial bias in AI facial recognition programs due to the lack of diversity in the images on which the systems were trained, while some natural language processing programs have developed gender bias./7Such biases could hold significant implications for AI applications in a military context. For example, incorporating undetected biases into systems with lethal effects could lead to cases of mistaken identity and the unintended killing of civilians or noncombatants.Similarly, narrow AI algorithms can produce unpredictable and unconventional results that could lead to unexpected failures if incorporated into military systems. In a commonly cited demonstration of this phenomenon (illustrated in Figure 1), researchers combined a picture that an AI system correctly identified as a panda with random distortion that the computer labeled "nematode." The difference in the combined image is imperceptible to the human eye, but it resulted in the AI system labeling the image as a gibbon with 99.3% confidence. Such vulnerabilities could be exploited intentionally by adversaries to disrupt AI-reliant or -assisted target identification, selection, and engagement. This could, in turn, raise ethical concerns--or, potentially, lead to violations of the law of armed conflict--if it results in the system selecting and engaging a target or class of targets that was not approved by a human operator.Figure 1.AI Failure in Image RecognitionFigure can be viewed at https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46458Finally, recent news reports and analyses have highlighted the role of AI in enabling increasingly realistic photo, audio, and video digital forgeries, popularly known as "deep fakes." Adversaries could deploy this AI capability as part of their information operations in a "gray zone" conflict./8Deep fake technology could be used against the United States and its allies to generate false news reports, influence public discourse, erode public trust, and attempt blackmail of government officials. For this reason, some analysts argue that social media platforms--in addition to deploying deep fake detection tools--may need to expand the means of labeling and authenticating content./9Doing so might require that users identify the time and location at which the content originated or properly label content that has been edited. Other analysts have expressed concern that regulating deep fake technology could impose an undue burden on social media platforms or lead to unconstitutional restrictions on free speech and artistic expression./10These analysts have suggested that existing law is sufficient for managing the malicious use of deep fakes and that the focus should be instead on the need to educate the public about deep fakes and minimize incentives for creators of malicious deep fakes.United StatesDOD's unclassified investments in AI have grown from just over $600 million in FY2016 to $927 million in FY2020, with the department reportedly maintaining over 600 active AI projects./11Pursuant to the FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA; P.L. 115-232), DOD established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC, pronounced "jake") to coordinate DOD projects of over $15 million./12The JAIC has identified its priority National Mission Initiatives for AI as predictive maintenance,/13 humanitarian aid and disaster relief, cyberspace, and automation. DOD requested $800 million for JAIC and Project Maven, an image processing program, in FY2021./14The FY2019 NDAA additionally directed DOD to publish a strategic roadmap for AI development and fielding, as well as to develop guidance on "appropriate ethical, legal, and other policies for the Department governing the development and use of artificial intelligence enabled systems and technologies in operational situations."/15In support of this mandate, the Defense Innovation Board (DIB), an independent federal advisory committee to the Secretary of Defense, drafted recommendations for the ethical use of artificial intelligence./16Based on these recommendations, DOD then adopted five ethical principles for AI based on the DIB's recommendations: responsibility, equitability, traceability, reliability, and governability./17The JAIC has been charged with implementing the ethical principles./18The FY2019 NDAA also established a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence to conduct a comprehensive assessment of militarily relevant AI technologies and to provide recommendations for strengthening U.S. competitiveness./19The commission's interim report to Congress identifies five key lines of effort for driving U.S. AI competitiveness: (1) investing in research and development, (2) applying AI to national security missions, (3) training and recruiting AI talent, (4) protecting and building upon U.S. technology advantages, and (5) marshalling global AI cooperation. The commission is releasing quarterly memos, which are to provide recommendations for implementing these lines of effort, with a final report due in March 2021.Per Section 256 of the FY2020 NDAA, DOD is also to "develop a strategy for educating servicemembers in relevant occupational fields on matters relating to artificial intelligence"; Section 260 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit through 2023 biannual reports on the JAIC to the congressional defense committees./20These reports are to include a description of the JAIC's mission, objectives, activities, workforce, and organizational structure, as well as a description of any new AI-related policies or ethical guidelines and "any steps taken by the Center to protect systems that use artificial intelligence from any attempts to misrepresent or alter information used or provided by artificial intelligence."/21Finally, Section 5711 tasks the Director of National Intelligence with periodically briefing the congressional intelligence committees on major intelligence community AI initiatives and coordination efforts./22ChinaChina is widely viewed as the United States' closest competitor in the international AI market./23China's 2017 "Next Generation AI Development Plan" describes AI as a "strategic technology" that has become a "focus of international competition."/24Recent Chinese achievements in the field demonstrate China's potential to realize its goals for AI development. In particular, China has pursued language and facial recognition technologies, many of which it plans to integrate into the country's domestic surveillance network. Such technologies could be used to counter espionage and aid military targeting. In addition to developing various types of air, land, sea, and undersea autonomous military vehicles, China is actively pursuing swarm technologies, which could be used to overwhelm adversary missile defense interceptors. Moreover, open-source publications indicate that China is developing a suite of AI tools for cyber operations./25China's management of its AI ecosystem stands in stark contrast to that of the United States./26In general, few boundaries exist between Chinese commercial companies, university research laboratories, the military, and the central government. China's National Intelligence Law, for example, requires companies and individuals to "support, assist, and cooperate with national intelligence work."/27As a result, the Chinese government has a direct means of guiding military AI development priorities and accessing technology developed for civilian purposes.RussiaRussian president Vladimir Putin has stated that "whoever becomes the leader in [AI] will become the ruler of the world."/28At present, however, Russian AI development lags significantlybehind that of the United States and China. As part of Russia's effort to close this gap, Russia has released a national strategy that outlines 5- and 10-year benchmarks for improving the country's AI expertise, educational programs, datasets, infrastructure, and legal regulatory system./29Russia has indicated it will continue to pursue its 2008 defense modernization agenda, which called for robotizing 30% of the country's military equipment by 2025./30The Russian military has been researching a number of AI applications, with a heavy emphasis on semiautonomous and autonomous military vehicles. Russia has also reportedly built a combat module for unmanned ground vehicles that may be capable of autonomous target identification-- and, potentially, target engagement--and it plans to develop a suite of AI-enabled autonomous systems./31In addition, the Russian military plans to incorporate AI into unmanned aerial, naval, and undersea vehicles and is reportedly developing swarming capabilities./32These technologies could reduce both cost and manpower requirements, potentially enabling Russia to field more systems with fewer personnel. Russia is also exploring innovative uses of AI for remote sensing and electronic warfare, which could in turn reduce an adversary's ability to effectively communicate and navigate on the battlefield./33Finally, Russia has made extensive use of AI technologies for domestic propaganda and surveillance, as well as for information operations directed against the United States and U.S. allies./34Despite Russia's aspirations, analysts argue that it may be difficult for Russia to make significant progress in AI development. In 2017, Russian military spending dropped by 20% in constant dollars, with subsequent cuts in 2018./35In addition, many analysts note that Russian academics have produced few research papers on AI and that the Russian technology industry has yet to produce AI applications on par with those produced by the United States and China./36Other analysts counter that such factors may be irrelevant, arguing that while Russia has never been a leader in internet technology, it has managed to become a notably disruptive force in cyberspace./37Russia may also be able to draw upon its growing technological cooperation with China./38International InstitutionsA number of international institutions have examined issues surrounding AI, including the Group of Seven (G7), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which developed the first intergovernmental set of principles for AI./39These principles are intended to "promote AI that is innovative and trustworthy and that respects human rights and democratic values."/40The United States is one of 42 countries--including the OECD's 36 member countries, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, and Romania--to have adopted the OECD AI Principles. These principles serve as the foundation for the Group of Twenty's (G20's) June 2019 Ministerial Statement on humancentered AI./41In addition, the OECD established the AI Policy Observatory in 2019 to develop policy options that will "help countries encourage, nurture, and monitor the responsible development of trustworthy AI systems for the benefit of society."Potential Questions for Congress* What measures is DOD taking to implement its ethical principles for artificial intelligence? Are such measures sufficient to ensure DOD's adherence to the principles?* Do DOD and the intelligence community have adequate information about the state of foreign military AI applications and the ways in which such applications may be used to harm U.S. national security?* How should national security considerations with regard to deep fakes be balanced with free speech protections, artistic expression, and beneficial uses of the underlying technologies? What efforts, if any, should the U.S. government undertake to ensure that the public is educated about deep fakes?Issues for CongressCongress has previously demonstrated interest in conducting oversight of emerging military technologies beyond technology-specific activities. In Section 247 of the FY2019 NDAA, Congress specified "a set of classified reports that set forth a direct comparison between the capabilities of the United States in emerging technology areas and the capabilities of adversaries of the United States."/151These areas include hypersonic weapons, AI, quantum technology, directed energy weapons, and other relevant technologies as determined by the Secretary of Defense. Section 225 of the FY2019 NDAA additionally tasked the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering with generating procedures for developing "technologies that are urgently needed to react to a technological development of an adversary of the United States or to respond to a significant and urgent emerging technology [that are] not receiving appropriate research funding or attention from the Department of Defense."Furthermore, Section 232 of the FY2020 NDAA (P.L. 116-92) tasked the Secretary of Defense with developing "a process to ensure that the policies of the Department of Defense relating to emerging technology are formulated and updated continuously as such technology is developed by the Department."/152As Congress continues to review the Pentagon's plans for emerging military technologies during the annual authorization and appropriations process, it might consider issues surrounding funding considerations, management, personnel, acquisition, technology protection, and governance and regulation.Funding ConsiderationsA number of emerging military technologies, including hypersonic weapons and directed energy weapons, have experienced fluctuations in funding over the years. According to a U.S. government interagency task force on the defense industrial base, such "fluctuations challenge the viability of suppliers within the industrial base by diminishing their ability to hire and retain a skilled workforce, [achieve] production efficiencies, and in some cases, [stay] in business."/153Other analysts have noted that such fluctuations are often due to unavoidable tradeoffs between technology investment priorities or to questions about a given technology's feasibility or maturity./154Some analysts have suggested that, given the potential for technological surprise, funding for overall research and development is inadequate--particularly in light of the 9% reduction in the FY2021 President's budget request for federal research and development. Summarizing such views, technology expert Martjin Rasser notes that reducing overall research and development in order to enable "big bets" or heavy investments in a particular technology or technologies, can be a risky approach because "we just don't know where the next breakthroughs will come from."/155ManagementIn general, DOD manages each of the aforementioned emerging military technologies separately due to the distinct expertise required. For example, within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD[R&E]), there are separate technical directors or assistant directors for artificial intelligence, autonomy, hypersonic weapons, directed energy, biotechnology, and quantum science--among other technology areas--which report through the Director for Modernization to USD(R&E)./156Development of each of these technologies is guided by a standalone technology roadmap and, in the case of AI, a classified strategy. Although the Director for Modernization has oversight over emerging military technologies, some analysts have suggested that there is a need for a more holistic approach to portfolio management that better considers how such technologies might be combined and integrated./157Furthermore, senior leaders do not always agree on the priorities among emerging military technologies--both in terms of effort and funding--and such priorities can shift frequently. This fluctuation has led some analysts to suggest that DOD should adopt a technology strategy "to set spending priorities that can be sustained over time, outlasting individual leaders."/158PersonnelSome reports indicate that DOD and the defense industry have difficulty recruiting and retaining personnel with expertise in emerging technologies because research funding and salaries significantly lag behind those of commercial companies./159Other reports suggest that such challenges stem from quality-of-life factors, as well as from a belief among many technology workers that "they can achieve large-scale change faster and better outside the government than within it."/160DOD faces additional challenges in training and educating its standing workforce. Examples of recommendations for addressing this set of challenges include increasing technology education opportunities at military academies, enhancing partnerships between DOD and research universities, creating government fellowships and accelerated promotion tracks for technology workers, and improving the technology literacy of human resource teams./161AcquisitionDOD may need to continue adjusting its acquisition process to account for rapidly evolving dualuse technologies such as AI./162For example, a 2017 internal study of the process found that it takes an average of 81 months for information technology programs to move from the initial Analysis of Alternatives, defining the requirements for a system, to an Initial Operational Capability./163In contrast, commercial companies typically execute an iterative development process for software systems (such as those involved in AI capabilities), delivering an initial product in six to nine months./164These findings prompted DOD to issue an interim software acquisition policy intended to "[simplify] the acquisition model to enable continuous integration and delivery of software capability on timelines relevant to the Warfighter/end user."/165Similar efforts may be needed for other emerging military technologies.Furthermore, the commercial companies that are often at the forefront of innovation in emerging technologies may be reluctant to partner with DOD due to the complexity of the defense acquisition process. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) study of this issue found that, of 12 U.S. commercial companies who choose not to do business with DOD, all 12 cited the complexity of the defense acquisition process as a rationale for their decision./166DOD has created a number of avenues for rapid acquisitions--including the Strategic Capabilities Office, the Defense Innovation Unit, and Project Maven--that are intended to streamline cumbersome processes and accelerate the acquisitions timeline./167Project Maven, for example, was established in April 2017; byDecember, the team was fielding a commercially acquired prototype AI system in combat./168 Although some analysts argue that these are promising developments, critics point out that the department must replicate such results at scale and implement more comprehensive acquisitions reform./169Intellectual PropertyCommercial technology companies are often reluctant to partner with DOD due to concerns about intellectual property and data rights./170As an official interviewed for a 2017 GAO report on broader challenges in military acquisitions noted, intellectual property is the "life blood" of commercial technology companies, yet "DOD is putting increased pressure on companies to grant unlimited technical data and software rights or government purpose rights rather than limited or restricted rights."/171In an effort to manage these concerns, DOD released an instruction that "establishes policy, assigns responsibilities, and prescribes procedures for the acquisition, licensing, and management of IP."/172The instruction additionally establishes a DOD IP Cadre to advise and assist the acquisition workforce on matters related to IP and calls for the development of an IP strategy to "identify and manage the full spectrum of IP and related matters" for each acquisition program.173Supply Chain SecurityA number of recent reports have raised concerns about the security of the U.S. supply chain for emerging military technologies. For example, one assessment found that China "may have opportunities to jeopardize the development of hypersonics through industrial espionage, transfers of technology, or providing unreliable components" due to its potential exposure to lowlevel U.S. suppliers./174Similarly the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence found that "the United States lacks domestic facilities capable of producing, integrating, assembling, and testing" the microelectronics needed to enable AI, forcing the U.S. "to rely on foreign fabrication and complex global supply chains for production."/175Technology ProtectionEstimates indicate "that American industry loses more than $600 billion dollars [each year] to theft and expropriation," including the theft and expropriation of emerging military technologies and related intellectual property./176The United States has a number of programs devoted to addressing this issue. For example, pursuant to the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA), the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) now reviews certain foreign investments, including those involving "emerging and foundational technologies." In addition, FIRRMA authorized CFIUS to consider "whether a covered transaction involves a country of special concern that has a demonstrated or declared strategic goal of acquiring a type of critical technology or critical infrastructure that would affect United States leadership in areas related to national security."/177Similarly, DOD's Protecting Critical Technology Task Force helps protect universities, labs, and the U.S. defense industrial base against the theft of "classified information, controlled unclassified information, and key data."/178As part of this effort, the task force intends to institute cybersecurity training programs for small businesses, enhance DOD's understanding of supply chain vulnerabilities, and develop a prioritized list of technologies that are critical to national security--as mandated by Section 1049 of the FY2019 NDAA--among other activities./179Some analysts have recommended expanding technology protection efforts to include U.S. allies and partners./180Governance and RegulationAccording to then-Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats, "technology developments ... are likely to outpace regulation, which could create international norms that are contrary to US interests and increase the likelihood of technology surprise."/181To address this concern, some analysts have argued that "the United States should undertake broad, sustained diplomatic engagement to advance collaboration on emerging technologies, norms, and standards setting."/182Oversight/183As Congress conducts oversight of emerging military technologies, it may be challenged in its ability to independently evaluate and assess complex, disparate technical disciplines. In 1972, Congress established the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) to provide expert "assessments, background papers, technical memoranda, case studies, and workshop proceedings" that were to inform congressional decisionmaking and legislative activities./184Congress eliminated funding for OTA in 1995 "amid broader efforts to reduce the size of government./185Since then, Congress has continued to debate the need for OTA or a similar technology assessment organization./186* * *Footnotes:1 Remarks as delivered by Secretary of Defense Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, "Defense Innovation Days Opening Keynote," September 3, 2014, at https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Speeches/Speech/Article/605602/.2 The Third Offset Strategy is a strategy for maintaining U.S. military superiority.

KENNEDY INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO PROTECT AMERICAN CITIZENS, BUSINESSES, SECURITY INTERESTS FROM COMMUNIST CHINAStates News ServiceAugust 5, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 589 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Louisiana Senator John Kennedy:Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) today introduced three bills aimed at protecting Americans from the schemes of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which routinely spies on American citizens and bullies American businesses.Communist Chinas ambition is to eclipse Americas economy and erase our freedoms, and it plays the long game. Chinas government pressures U.S. businesses to read from its communist song sheet while planting its state-owned factories on American soil. Meanwhile, the CCP spies on our citizens and steals our innovation. Its time to take specific, decisive steps to protect Americans and their businesses from the CCPs attacks, and thats what these bills do, said Kennedy.Kennedys package includes the Combatting Chinese Propaganda Act, WeChat No More Act and Exposing Chinas Belt and Road Investment in America Act.Combatting Chinese Propaganda ActThe Chinese Communist Party often pressures U.S. companies to speak and act against their own interests and against American liberties. The Combatting Chinese Propaganda Act prohibits companies that do business in the U.S. from making public statements that reflect the propaganda of the Chinese Communist Party.Whether a company is U.S.- or foreign-owned, the Combatting Chinese Propaganda Act would prohibit companies operating in America from taking actions that are either against their fiduciary interests or at the bidding of Chinas government.The legislation would also make it illegal for companies to provide Chinas government with the personal information of Chinese dissidents.WeChat No More ActWeChat has direct connections to the CCP, and the company spread pro-China misinformation with the goal of influencing the American public during the 2016 election. The platform censors topics like the #MeToo movement and Chinese public health scandals.The WeChat No More Act would prohibit federal officials, federal employees and Members of Congress from downloading WeChat on government devices, with limited exceptions, including intelligence or cybersecurity activities.This legislation is critical to Americas national security as WeChat is the most popular messaging application in China, with more than one billion users. As a result, people outside of China often depend on WeChat to communicate with those inside Chinas borders.Exposing Chinas Belt and Road Investment in America ActWhile the Chinese government keeps its domestic markets largely insulated from foreign influence, it regularly invests in the U.S. and other countries under the greenfield model. Firms fully owned by Chinas communist regime are increasingly buying land, building factories and taking advantage of state and local tax breaks on American soil.The goal of such state-operated enterprises is to siphon assets, technological innovation and influence away from U.S. businesses in order to expand the global presence of the Chinese Communist Party.The Exposing Chinas Belt and Road Investment in America Act would put Chinese greenfield initiatives under the review of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). CFIUS would review these investments for national security purposes. The bill would extend CFIUS jurisdiction to cover greenfield investments made by entities under the control of the Chinese government. The legislation would also make it mandatory for greenfield investments to file a declaration with CFIUS if Chinas government has a substantial interest in the investment.Load-Date: August 5, 2020End of Document

Microsoft has a long history in China. That could cut both ways for TikTokCNN WireAugust 6, 2020 Thursday 9:07 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1020 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Microsoft has spent decades building goodwill with Beijing, and that could help its bid to buy TikTok's operations in the United States and a few other countries. That is, unless deteriorating US-China relations get in the way. Microsoft has emerged as the leading candidate to save TikTok from President Donald Trump's threat to ban the app unless it finds an American buyer. The app is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance. A deal would give Microsoft ownership and operation of TikTok services in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Unlike other big US tech companies, Microsoft has some major clout in China, and its products have a significant presence there. It has been in China since 1992, and employs 6,000 people in the country. Microsoft software is used by the Chinese government and companies, LinkedIn is a popular social media platform for Chinese professionals, and Bing is the only foreign search engine with any amount of market share in the country. The Washington State-based company also boasts an A-list alumni network in China, thanks to the hugely influential Microsoft Research Lab Asia, or MSRA. Microsoft's cloutThe Beijing-based lab --- a world-class computer science research hub --- is widely viewed as a boot camp for China's technology sector. Many founders and senior executives at companies such as Alibaba, smartphone maker Xiaomi, and e-commerce upstart Pinduoduo got their start at Microsoft and were trained at MSRA. Even Zhang Yiming, the founder and CEO of ByteDance, briefly worked at Microsoft before reportedly leaving out of boredom. Microsoft "is really well respected" in China's tech community, according to Edith Yeung, who spent years investing in Chinese companies with venture capital firm 500 Startups. She is a partner with Race Capital, investing mostly in US firms. That respect is especially true when it comes to artificial intelligence, Yeung said. One of the best-known AI experts in the world, former head of Google China Kai-Fu Lee, helped establish MSRA.ByteDance has a slew of addictive apps that all rely on AI algorithms. The apps learn from users' behavior, and continuously feed them content that they want to see. Many in China's tech industry believe Microsoft is "the best choice," to buy TikTok, because at least Microsoft has "the AI chops to understand what ByteDance is doing," said Yeung. A forced sale of TikTok to Microsoft would be "a win-win-win, in a pretty horrible situation," said Tony Verb, co-founder of GreaterBay Ventures & Advisors, which works with Chinese entrepreneurs. It will likely be a victory for Trump, it's good for Microsoft to get a fast-growing product like TikTok, and for ByteDance, "it's the less horrible outcome," according to Verb. Microsoft and ByteDance did not respond to requests for comment for this story. Challenges in ChinaLike other multinationals, Microsoft has had its fair share of challenges in China. Rampant piracy prevents the company from making significant inroads in the market. Microsoft president Brad Smith said in January that even though Microsoft software is widely used in China, the country accounts for less than 2% of the company's global revenue. Last year, Microsoft's search engine Bing, was briefly blocked in China. It wasn't clear what sparked the suspension, but it came as tensions between the United States and China were spilling over into the tech sector, with Washington stepping up its campaign against Chinese tech firm Huawei.Microsoft is also facing scrutiny from China's State Agency for Market Regulation, which is investigating whether it has violated the country's anti-monopoly laws. The probe is focused on Windows and Office software. And at a time of escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing, Microsoft's business in China could prove to be a liability, as the world's two largest economies shun cooperation and inch closer to a technological decoupling. Some Trump administration officials are suspicious that Microsoft is too cozy with Beijing. Microsoft-owned products such as Bing and Skype have enabled Chinese surveillance and censorship, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said in an interview on CNN on Monday.Bing is able to operate its Chinese site, cn.bing.com, because it censors its search results. During a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last year, Smith said Microsoft has "days when there are either difficult negotiations or even disagreements" with Chinese authorities. "There's some fishy stuff going on there," Navarro said. If people use Skype in China, the Chinese Communist Party "is listening in," he added. "The question is, is Microsoft going to be compromised?" Navarro said. He also questioned whether Microsoft should be forced to "divest its Chinese holdings" if it buys TikTok. China could still claim 'a pretty good win' Meanwhile, Trump has touted the forced sale of TikTok as a win, and said that the US Treasury should get a cut of the deal if it goes through. Industry experts say the TikTok deal could cost Microsoft between $40 billion and $50 billion.Trump's comments sparked an outcry in China. State-run newspaper China Daily likened the sale of TikTok to a "smash and grab" raid orchestrated by the US government.But the sale of TikTok should also be viewed as a huge win for China's tech industry and the innovation coming out of Beijing, according to Rich Robinson, a professor at Peking University and founding partner of Whip Wham, an investment practice focused on China and Asian markets."Last time I checked, $50 billion is a pretty good win," Robinson said. ByteDance was able to get hundreds of millions of users around the world hooked on TikTok, the app brought in tens of billions of dollars in revenue last year and it was the first Chinese social media platform to breakthrough in international markets, he points out. "That's all winning," said Robinson. "Too bad it got politicized."--- Laura He and Clare Duffy contributed to this report.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

TikTok War: China Will Take Action If US "Steals" Its Popular AppCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 4, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 867 wordsBodyA few hours ago, the account on Weibo (Chinese Twitter) of Zhang Yiming,the CEO of ByteDance - TikTok's parent company - appeared with all the comments deleted. After the news of the possible sale to Microsoft of the subsidiary of the short video app in the United States, several Chinese users began to release messages against Zhang, accusing him of being a "traitor".In these times of pandemic, with a new Cold War backdroping the two world superpowers, China is cultivating an increasingly nationalistic sentiment, pushed in part by the aggressive diplomacy of its leaders and by becoming the recipient of criticism and mistrust of the global courtyard. In this sour context, whatever the Chinese Communist Party's propaganda media points to him as a traitor, he may fall into the vilification of a nation that previously prided itself on his achievements and ascending him on the pedestal of the erudite celebrities of the world's most populous country.With Zhang Yiming, the campaign against him has already begun on social media. Some accuse him of "kneeling" to Donald Trump after the U.S. president gave TikTok until September 15 to move into the hands of U.S. capital or could no longer operate in his country for national security reasons.In the face of such controversy, Zhang, 37, that he surprised his compatriots with his short video application that he released in 2017 and which he called Douyin - to expand outside Chinese borders, He considered that TikTok's name would be better received—he explained in a letter to his employees that he "disagrees with the decision to sell its U.S. subsidiary" as they have always pledged to "protect user data and maintain the neutrality and transparency" of TikTok, which in the United States has 80 million users."We haven't found a final solution yet but, considering the current international situation, we must address the ORDER of the US president to ban TikTok and the decision of the US Foreign Investment Committee (CFIUS)," Zhang says in his letter. That it hasn't closed the door at any time for sale is what has the users of the Asian giant. Meanwhile, Chinese media keeps their critical editorials frozen against Zhang at the expense of upcoming moves with Microsoft, a company for which he worked briefly after graduating 16 years ago in Software Engineering from Nankai University.Microsoft interestMicrosoft confirmed a few days ago its intention to purchase TikTok. And Trump has insisted on the deadline for executing the operation before he implants the lock on the popular app. In July it was the Government of India that first decided to veto TikTok, which had 661 million downloads in the Asian country, almost 30% of its global market. The reason, according to Prime Minister Narendra Modi,is that "these applications are detrimental to the sovereignty and integrity of the country." Australia also threatened to remove the app from its channels. But it was Mike Pompeo,US Secretary of State, who at the end of July gave the first notice: "We are considering restricting users' access to the TikTok app because of concerns that the Beijing Government is using it as a means of monitoring."From China, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin has responded this week that his government "strongly opposes any U.S. action against Chinese software companies over national security concerns." ForWang, the threat of banning applications like TikTok, which is based in Beijing, is a"violation of the principles of the market economy and exposes the hypocrisy and double standards typical of the United States to maintain justice and freedom. It also violates the principles of openness, transparency and non-discrimination of the World Trade Organization."Beijing MeasuresCommunist Party official media, such as the China Daily newspaper, say its government will not accept a Washington-imposed sale operation to Microsoft and that Beijing could take action if that purchase is forced. "The United States has offered China the option of submission or deadly combat in technology," says an editorial in China Daily. Another Chinese state newspaper, the Global Times, titled a story released yesterday: "The AMERICAN theft of TikTok infuriates Chinese high-tech companies." According to the newspaper, Chinese tech companies "enred in the Trump administration's increasingly unpleasant crackdown, are reflecting on acting proactively with public anger growing on both sides of the Pacific, as the US drama forces the sale of TikTok."In June, the Chinese company hired Kevin Mayer,a former Walt Disney executive, as CHIEF Executive Officer." TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders in security, products and public policy in the United States," said a company spokesman. "We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked."As a gesture to change its image increasingly deteriorated following constant accusations from the United States, TikTok ceased operating last July in the Hong Kong app market following the passage of the new National Security Act that threatens the autonomy of the former British colony since China regained its dominance 23 years ago.Load-Date: August 5, 2020End of Document

CONGRESSMAN ANDY BARR INTRODUCES LEGISLATION REQUIRING PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE TIES TO CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTYStates News ServiceAugust 5, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 528 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Kentucky Rep. Andy Barr:Congressman Andy Barr has introduced H.R. 7924, the Transparency in Chinese Government Investment Act (TCGIA) of 2020. As of September 2019, 172 Chinese firms were listed on major U.S. exchanges, with a total market capitalization of more than $1 trillion. This legislation requires companies listing on U.S. exchanges to be transparent about any connection to or financial support by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Financial support includes subsidies, grants, loans, loan guarantees, tax breaks, tax incentives or any preferential treatment related to Chinese government procurement policies.The TCGIA also stipulates that companies must identify any of their officers or directors who hold or formerly held positions with the CCP, Chinese government or other Chinese affiliations specified in the TCGIA. Lastly, companies must disclose any association with Chinese strategic initiatives such as Made in China 2025, or the New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development plan, in addition to other initiatives outlined in the TCGIA.This legislation would provide unprecedented transparency for American investors with respect to CCP investments in publicly traded companies, said Congressman Barr . CCP investment in American companies frequently leads to CCP manipulation of American companies and investors whether it be the forced transfer of technology or the outright theft of American intellectual property. These are just two examples of many tactics used by the CCP that hijack American innovation, devalue American capital markets and most importantly threaten the investments of millions of American citizens.Additionally, the TCGIA exposes Chinese companies raising capital in American markets that are part of broader CCP strategic initiatives that undermine American national security and further some of the CCPs most dangerous activities, Barr continued . I am urging Congress to act now to protect the integrity of our financial markets and our national security.For years the Chinese Communist Party has abused free market principles to advance their goals for economic and technological dominance to the detriment of U.S. businesses and consumers, said Congressman Michael McCaul (R-TX), who serves as the Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. This bill gives U.S. investors greater transparency into how publicly-listed companies are benefiting from and supporting CCP practices that hurt the U.S. economy. I applaud Representative Barr for his leadership on this critical legislation as well as his tireless work on the China Task Force to hold the CCP accountable.Congressman Barr has been heavily involved in crafting legislation to counter CCP aggression and hold China accountable in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic that originated in Wuhan, China. Barr was appointed to the China Task Force in May by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (CA-23).

That's WeChat, the Chinese app banned by TrumpCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 894 wordsBodyAfter vetoing the short video platform TikTok, US President Donald Trump took the same move against another major Chinese social media: WeChat, known as the Chinese WhatsApp.The application, whose Chinese name is Weixin, has more than 1.2 billion users. Although its developer, Tencent, does not make public its breakdown by country, most of them are found in China, since in the Google Play app store downloads are above 100 million worldwide.Trump considers it a danger to national security by ensuring that it "automatically captures large portions of information" from its users, "allowing the Communist Party of China (PCCh) access to private information" from both Chinese and U.S. citizens.The US President also claims that WeChat censors content considered "politically sensitive" by the PCCh and that it "could be used for disinformation campaigns" by the Chinese government.But what makes WeChat so important to China?                        A must-have 'all-in-one'Apart from being an application through which to chat with friends and other contacts, WeChat is a platform that encompasses a high number of services and has become an "all-in-one" practically indispensable for daily life in China.The first big difference with WhatsApp, the Western application with which it is usually equated, is its integrated payment service: WeChat Pay allows you to have a virtual wallet linked to a bank account with which you can transfer money or make payments by scanning a QR code.Through WeChat Pay you can pay for electricity or water, recharge the balance of the phone line, donate to charity or pick up a hospital appointment, although it also allows you to chat live with a doctor and explain the symptoms.In addition, WeChat is one of the main news sources for the Chinese, has a kind of Facebook-style "wall" where you can hang photos or comments and share them with contacts, and also supports "miniprograms", apps that are used through the platform rather than having to download them separately from the store.And now, in times of pandemic, it has become one of the main platforms on which to access the so-called "health codes", mandatory in many cities to enter bars, restaurants, shops or even on the subway.In short, beyond chatting, WeChat is used in The day-to-day of China for tasks as varied as paying in a store, paying household expenses, reading news, ordering food, buying movie tickets or booking accommodation or a plane ticket.Being the most popular by far from the social media allowed in China, many Chinese in the diaspora will have it harder after the U.S. ban on contacting their family and friends in the Asian giant.Foreigners residing in China will also have it more complicated and will have to resort to virtual private networks (VPNs) to connect to Western messaging apps such as WhatsApp or social networks such as Facebook, censored in China.Tencent, a digital giantBehind WeChat is Tencent, one of the largest firmsAsian giant, which had previously achieved success with another social network, the "Chinese Messenger" QQ.Two prestigious economic publications, Forbes and Fortune, include it in their lists of the world's largest companies: according to the first, it is ranked 55th, and according to the second, in 237. Its value exceeds $695 billion (about 588.230 million euros).31% of its capital belongs to its main shareholder, the South African conglomerate Naspers.Created in 1998, the company has been run since that year by one of its founders, "Pony" Ma Huateng, China's second richest man behind e-commerce giant Jack Ma.With this conglomerate Tencent has maintained a rivalry for years in the field of investments, spending billions of dollars on different bets, especially in the field of technology: last January, it presumed that 160 of the companies in which he had injected money had ended up becoming "unicorns".Apart from competition between China's two mobile payment giants, WeChat Pay and Alipay (Alibaba subsidiary), Tencent has also invested money in several businesses of increasing importance both in the Asian giant and internationally.From Tesla to your favorite video gameIn China, it controls 17% of JD, Taobao's main rival (Alibaba's flagship retail portal), and as of October 2019 it also had 18.5% of the Pinduoduo platform, the third party in this sector.It also owns more than 20% of technology giant Meituan Dianping, focused on services such as home food, and 40% - although he wants to buy 100% - of the search engine Sogou, one of Baidu's main rivals (the "Chinese Google"), as well as stakes in Kuaishou, an 'app' of short videos that competes with Douyin, original version of TikTok.The conglomerate also has interests in the electric vehicle sector, with 15% of China's Nio and 5% of the US's Tesla.Internationally, its best-known investments – in addition to the 9% he controls spotify – are in the video game industry, with stakes in firms known as Activision Blizzard (World of Warcraft), Epic Games (Fortnite) or Riot Games (League of Legends). It also owns the mobile version of the popular game PUBG.Following the news of the Veto to WeChat in the United States, Tencent today lost more than 5% on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, whose reference, the Hang Seng, is the number one value by quotation weight.The company plans to announce its second quarter results on August 12.Load-Date: August 8, 2020End of Document

China Blasts Trump's Move on TikTok, Calls Him 'Modern-Day Pirate'USNEWS.comAugust 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; World Report; Vol.; No.Length: 631 wordsByline: Paul D. ShinkmanHighlight: Chinese state news called the president a 'modern-day pirate' amid other condemnation from the Foreign Ministry in Beijing and from the Chinese-owned app itself.BodyChina's government on Friday expressed outrage at President Donald Trump's unilateral and vague ban on dealings with the Chinese owners of social media apps TikTok and WeChat, saying his decision will only harm the U.S. and calling him a "modern day pirate." [READ:Microsoft in Talks to Buy TikTok]"The U.S. administration places its self-interests above market principles and international rules to the detriment of American users and companies. It will only end up hurting its own interests," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said in a Twitter post early Friday. China's Global Times blasted Trump's "white-knuckle move" late Thursday as an act of "robbery" and retribution against the popular apps. Analysts described "the unscrupulous president as a pirate in the modern era" and "that the example set by the U.S. government utilizes executive power to prey upon foreign businesses," according to the news outlet, which is not a direct mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party but is aligned with its views. Trump issued two executive orders late Thursday that serve as a sweeping condemnation of the two apps but do not provide clear guidance on what happens next. He threatened to "close down" TikTok in the United States by Sept. 15 unless Microsoft Corp. or another company acquires it. Microsoft has publicly expressed interest in acquiring TikTok and has said it is working toward a deal. TikTok in a statement early Friday said it was "shocked" by the president's order, adding that it was issued "without any due process." "For nearly a year, we have sought to engage with the U.S. government in good faith to provide a constructive solution to the concerns that have been expressed," the company wrote. "What we encountered instead was that the administration paid no attention to facts, dictated terms of an agreement without going through standard legal processes, and tried to insert itself into negotiations between private businesses." [MORE:China Shook by U.S. Retaliation: U.S. Intel]Business and government leaders have long expressed concerns about the fact that TikTok's Chinese parent company collects and controls so much data on users from the U.S. Some federal agencies have banned the app from employees' government-issued cellphones. Tik Tok has stressed that it does not share data with the Chinese government. Lawmakers and others, however, are worried that the company could be forced to hand over their data to the Chinese government. The move serves as a dramatic escalation in already escalating tensions between the U.S. and China. Other countries have also taken measures to restrict the use of Chinese apps among their citizens. India banned TikTok and dozens of others after a deadly encounter between its soldiers and China's in a contested part of their shared border. Paul Shinkman is a national security correspondent.

China will not defend TikTok owner from US pressureCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 10, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 743 wordsBodyGiven Beijing's willingness to threaten countries blocking Huawei's 5G technology, it would be easy to assume that China plans to retaliate Washington for forcing the Chinese owner of TikTok to sell the app's U.S. operations. But in reality, ByteDance is no other Huawei and Beijing is unlikely to defend the company, Chinese technology industry participants said."Most people in China would laugh at the idea that ByteDance works closely with the Chinese government," said a Chinese technology industry executive who worked with ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming.Huawei is more important than ByteDance for China's domestic economy, on which the Communist Party built its legitimacy. Huawei made the cell phone masts that supported China's mobile technology revolution, and indirectly employed legions of workers.ByteDance, on the other hand, makes news and video applications that are a source of concern for Beijing censors. While it is one of the few companies that continued to hire during the pandemic, it mainly hires graduates of elite universities in big cities.m{947915}"ByteDance's relationship with the Chinese government is not good at all: they find it very difficult to control this type of social media platform," said Li Chengdong, CEO of Haitun, a technology-focused think-tank."They're not a strategically important company," Li added. While Huawei is a 33-year-old "national champion", ByteDance is relatively a newcomer. Its founder does not have a place in the national political advisory body, unlike its more established competitors, Baidu and Tencent.U.S. sanctions against Huawei are also a major threat to the company's survival, which depends on the global chip supply chain. More than 60% of Huawei's revenue comes from abroad. By contrast, ByteDance spends the profits it earns in China in order to expand into the United States, where it is not yet profitable.With Huawei's incorporation into their networks, countries are trapped in an ongoing economic relationship with China, something that suits Beijing. But while TikTok's algorithms made it viral globally, ByteDance does not engender strategic dependence. It is much easier for the world's teenagers to find another internet fad than for governments to separate their telecommunications infrastructure.The result is limited impetus from Beijing to respond. China protects its most important interests: supporting the economy and foreign demand for its goods. The high-risk U.S. presidential campaign, full of rhetoric against China, makes it less safe for Beijing to play an intensification game."Beijing will not open another battlefield against the US by ByteDance," said Feng Chucheng, a political risk analyst and partner of independent research firm Plenum. "The issue also touches on the US election, something China doesn't want to be perceived as intervening."Even if such a desire existed, there are few U.S. technology targets left that China can attack. Google's Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube—ByteDance's main competitors—are already banned in China, although they sell advertising to help Asian companies reach foreign customers.m{947887}Microsoft, which is in negotiations to buy TikTok's operations in the US, has long been on good terms with Beijing. The company has been aincubator for the Asian country's technology talent, including briefly Zhang. For now, almost 90% of Computers in China work with Microsoft Windows. Beijing tries to replace Windows with a national equivalent, starting with government procurement contracts. But analysts estimate that the replacement will take years. Meanwhile, Microsoft remains welcome in China.One of the consequences of ByteDance's forced sale to the US—beyond market capitalization—is indirect damage to Chinese entrepreneurs, who see their high global expectations shrink.One of those entrepreneurs, James Liang of travel site Ctrip, published an article arguing that, in response to the US decision on TikTok, China should take a position of moral superiority and open its internet. The message was quickly censored."The founders of Chinese startups do not want an alliance with their country's government. They just want to create something very big and make a fortune," said a Chinese technology executive who worked with Zhang. "Since the Communist Party tightened its controls within the country in recent years, these entrepreneurs are looking for foreign markets. Now they have few places to go."m{947881}srgsLoad-Date: August 11, 2020End of Document

Brad Wenstrup (R-OH); Flynn Judge Hearing.MORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 8:00 AM ESTAugust 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; FinancialLength: 7937 wordsByline: Maria Bartiromo, Cheryl Casone, Dagen McDowell, Edward LawrenceGuests: Jon Hilsenrath, Stephen Moore, Eric Freedman, Dominick Tavella, Joanie Courtney, Brad Wenstrup (R-OH); Gordon ChangBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back.Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Jobs Friday, August 7th.Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the nose on the East Coast.Jobs in America, 30 minutes from now we will get another look at the impact that the coronavirus is having on the American economy. Economists are expecting 1.6 million jobs added to the economy in the month of July, with the unemployment rate ticking down to 10.5 percent. We'll bring you those numbers as soon as they hilt the tape and check for any impact on markets.Meanwhile President Trump is taking aim at possibly Chinese apps, two executive orders banning U.S. transactions with TikTok and WeChat in just 45 days. TikTok says it was shocked by President Trump's move. It claims it has never shared user data with the Chinese government. The White House is also looking to crack down on U.S. listed Chinese companies, the trade on the NYSE and Nasdaq.More on this market moves coming up.Stimulus showdown. Still no deal and major risks remain. It is unclear if any talks will happen today with the stimulus deadlock and jobs numbers about to come out.Futures are under pressure this morning. Take a look at where we stand an hour and a half before the opening bell sounds. The Dow Industrials are down 137 points. The Nasdaq is down 45. The S&P lower by 14.This after a pretty good rally yesterday. In fact, markets ended near their session highs yesterday, the Nasdaq scoring its 4th record close in a row. The Dow Industrials up 185 points at 4:00 on Wall Street.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.Global markets this morning mixed. Take a look at European indices where we are looking at a flat showing in the U.K. FT 100 down just one point. The CAC 40 in Paris down just 13 points.But Germany's DAX index is up. In fact, Germany showed some signs of economic recovery. Industrial output was up 8.9 percent in the month of June. That, fueled by a rise in German exports.In Asia overnight, markets were mostly lower following President Trump's executive orders targeting Chinese apps. The Chinese Shanghai composite down about one percent.Joining the conversation this morning: Dagen McDowell, Joanie Courtney. Great to see you ladies this morning.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Great to see you.JOANIE COURTNEY, EMPLOYBRIDGE: Great to be here.BARTIROMO: Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning.President Trump turning up the heat on TikTok and Tencent-owned WeChat signing an executive order last night that bans these Chinese social media apps in 45 days. The president calling TikTok a threat to national security.The company is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company and it is accused of gathering user data that could be shared with China's government, the Communist Party. TikTok just responded moments ago to this executive order. And it says that the company is shocked and it will pursue legal actions in response. TikTok also said it has never shared data with the Chinese government or censored content at its request.Meanwhile More Portland unrest to report. Violence erupting overnight for the 70th straight day. Rioters setting fires outside of a police precincts. At one point rioters are seen throwing paint on an elderly woman who is using a walker as she confronting them outside of that police precinct.Now to the deadlock in D.C. Democratic leaders White House officials say that negotiations have stalled Democrats are still pushing for a package of more than $3 trillion dollars. President Trump tweeted yesterday that he is planning on executive orders on several key stimulus issues and that he will do so if lawmakers fail to reach a solution.The president spoke in Ohio yesterday about the resilience of the American economy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We will rise from the current adversity of this horrible, invisible enemy and we will be more prosperous and resilient than ever before. We've done things that we never knew we could do. One of the key lessons we've learned in this battle against the Chinese virus is that the mighty American economy has a fantastic ability to adapt and repurpose its factories. We are engaged in the most rapid industrial mobilization by far since World War II.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Ohio congressman, member of the House Intelligence Committee and Ways and Means committee, Brad Wenstrup.And Congressman, it's great to see you. Thanks very much for joining us.What was the response in Ohio to President Trump?REP. BRAD WENSTRUP (R-OH): I think it was a good response, you know, it's a very interesting day because our governor who was going to join the president, tested positive and then went back to Columbus and tested negative for COVID. So that is another issue, in and of itself.I think the president was received positively. I think there is obviously great concern about what is going on with negotiations in Congress. We see we're trillions apart and Nancy Pelosi said she is not going to budge look.And you know, you just look at this, where we are right now. You have several Democrats -- and I could list five or six names that have come out and said that her Heroes Act, doesn't address the realism of what's going on. It wasn't realistic. It goes far beyond COVID and pandemic and it has a lot of dollars for people that aren't hurting.So we have a ways to go but, there are things that I definitely support that we have to support our schools and getting them to reopen. And then also childcare and I have a bill that would expand FSAs (ph) for example to allow people to extend them beyond the deadline and to increase what they fund there to be able to pay for childcare.People can't go back to work if schools aren't --BARTIROMO: Yes.WENSTRUP: -- and if we don't have childcare, and one of the key issues as you know, is liability protection.BARTIROMO: So is that -- is that what the Democrats are pushing up against? I mean I want to talk to you about Flynn and about Durham, but let me just say that we are going to get the jobs numbers for the month of July, in about 25 minutes.And Nancy Lazar from Cornerstone Macro has been on this program a lot. She's expecting no job growth. So the estimates call for 1.48 million jobs added to the economy. Lazar says no, no, no, we are not going to get any growth in jobs because we've hit a bit of a wall. She is expecting growth in the second half of the year, by the way, but things have turned more negative is the bottom line.We are seeing a break in what started as a recovery. Do the Democrats -- do both sides of the aisle not see the urgency here? What is holding this up?WENSTRUP: Oh, I think we see the urgency for sure, but again, we are trillions of dollars apart and she doesn't want to budge. She doesn't want to put the American people first. She wants to put some of the members of her party first. And not all of them I would say.But that -- to your point about the job numbers, it is going to be difficult for a lot of people to return to work, if they don't have a place for their children to be taken care of safely in childcare or at their schools. And so we do want to support what is going on in our schools --BARTIROMO: Right.WENSTRUP: -- so that they can open safely and with common sense.BARTIROMO: All right. We've got an important hearing this upcoming week about General Michael Flynn. D.C. district court Judge Emmet Sullivan will be questioned Tuesday by his peers on his impartiality after pushing against the Justice Department's recommendation that charges against Michael Flynn be dropped.Congressman, what is your take here? Your reaction that this is still going on around Michael Flynn. And also where is John Durham's investigation? When are we going to see the results of this investigation given now we're 90 days away from the election?WENSTRUP: Well, you know, there is so much evidence that you know that we have known on the intelligence committee for some time. And more of it has come out and obviously, there is a lot of exculpatory evidence for General Flynn.So I'd say sooner rather than later --BARTIROMO: Right.WENSTRUP: -- but I know that he wants to do it right and he wants to proceed with an emphasis on reality and have all his facts in line.But at the same time this has been a ping pong match for General Flynn without a doubt. And you know, it was said that he, you know, by that FBI he wasn't lying to begin with but Peter Strzok decided to take it a different way he and found an ally I believe, in Judge Sullivan. And what we have today, is now their questioning Judge Sullivan's impartiality and I think that that is appropriate and it's unfortunate that it has come this far.BARTIROMO: All right. Do you think we are going to get developments in the Durham investigation by the end of the summer which is what AG Barr told us?WENSTRUP: I believe so and I think it's only fair to the American people. You know, some people say we don't want it to affect the election. Well it should affect the election because it tells you about the people that are running for office like Joe Biden, and -- and the Obama administration and all those. And if Susan Rice, for example is the vice presidential candidate, you really need to look at all the things that she took part in while she was in the administration that were nefarious and major and I think the American people deserve to know all of that before the election.BARTIROMO: All right. Well, we'll see. Congressman, it's always a pleasure to talk with you. Thank you, sir.WENSTRUP: You, too. Thank you, Maria. Have a good day.BARTIROMO: Congressman Brad Wenstrup joining us.We're about 20 minutes away from the July jobs' report. We're going to break down everything you need to know on where we are in jobs. Where are the opportunities today?Markets down 152 points on the Dow going into it.Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Escalating tensions with China. President Trump issuing executive orders on Chinese apps TikTok and WeChat last night. The orders ban U.S. transactions with the parent companies ByteDance and Tencent and they go into effect in 45 days.TikTok this morning responded saying that it is quote/unquote "shocked" and that the order came down without due process. The company also said it has never shared data with the Chinese communist government or has it censored content at the CCP's request.Joining me right now is author of "The Coming Collapse of China and the Great U.S.-China Tech War" author, Gordon Chang. Gordon it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for being here.GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: So let me get your take firs ton TikTok's response because the CEO comes out. They say, we're shocked at the president's moves. We have never shared any data with Chinese government and we are not intending to. And you say?CHANG: That does not appear to be factual. You know, we know that TikTok has been surveilling U.S. users. Apple, for instance -- and this is not just the U.S. federal government. This is Apple caught TikTok twice -- once in April and the other time in late June abusing the clipboard function.We know that TikTok has also have been surreptitiously downloading software on users' devices. It's been misusing data on minors. And in addition, perhaps the worst thing of ail is that there are allegations which are still unconfirmed but allegations that appear credible that TikTok has been trying to manipulate political opinion in the U.S. by the way it curates videos.BARTIROMO: Yes. Let me ask you what the broader issues and solutions are here, Gordon. I have got a list in front of me of all of the cases and charges and it is a long list. from the DOJ indictments of professors, academia people -- all charging the same that we're talking about stealing data. using data, surveilling American citizens. There are a lot of claws from China in American business.How are we going to get it out? How are we actually going to have a comfort level that the CCP is not surveilling people? Is not entangled in our companies when they've spent so much money acquiring Silicon Valley, acquiring, you know, stakes in companies to force the transfer of technology, so that they could effectively steal IP.CHANG: Well, the only effective way to do this, the only practical way to do this is to cut ties with China because as you point out China's malicious activities have been pervasive. They've been across the board and they've been extremely effective.We know that China has been stealing hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. intellectual property each year. We know through its hacks of various institution, both government and private, that it is going after the data of U.S. citizens. The only way that we can stop this is to reduce our ties with China.I know that many people will find that to be unfortunate. Of course it is, but unfortunately, China is driving this and so the only way to stop it is to end our relations with China.BARTIROMO: So some people feel that CCP was able to institute its own at the head of CalPERS, the chief investment officer. I want to get your take on what took place this week which really didn't get a lot of coverage. It was in "The Wall Street Journal" that the California Public Employees Retirement System otherwise known as CalPERS -- the chief investment officer stepped down this week. He was in the roll for about a year and a half. And this is Ben Meng resigning because apparently he failed to adhere to conflict of interest rules. What do you say about the CIO of the largest U.S. pension fund being run by Ben Meng?CHANG: There were extreme concerns about his appointment before he actually took the job. And, you know, as we've seen, it's not only conflict of interest. His performance -- he underperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin. So you know, clearly this was something that had to be done. CalPERS should be applauded for taking this step but on the other hand CalPERS should be condemned for hiring him in the first place because everyone knew this was going to happen.BARTIROMO: But was there evidence that he was investing CalPERS' money in Chinese companies? What was he doing in terms of his role being at the top of CalPERS? How was he using or exploiting that position in your view?CHANG: Well, as you point out he actually was investing substantial money into Chinese companies, far more than you would expect in these circumstances for someone in this position. And also because of his prior history, this was thought that was going to happen.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Again, this is Ben Meng resigning about a year and a half into his tenure at the top of CalPERS. This is the largest U.S. pension fund and many people didn't realize that the CIO was investing so much in Chinese companies.Gordon, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.Gordon Chang --CHANG: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: -- joining us this morning.And we are just a few minutes away from the July jobs' report. We're going to break down everything you need to know about jobs today. Where are we in this recovery?Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The July jobs report due out in just about seven minutes. Economists are expecting 1.6 million jobs added to the economy last month with the unemployment rate ticking down to 10.5 percent.Joining us to break it all down this morning: senior writer at the "Wall Street Journal" Jon Hilsenrath; former "Wall Street Journal" editorial board member and "Trumponomics" co-author Stephen Moore; Lebenthal Global Advisers president Dominick Tavella and U.S. Bank Wealth Management chief investment officer Eric Freedman.Thank you, one of and all, great to see you. We are rocking and rolling ahead of these jobs numbers.Jon Hilsenrath, let's kick it off with you, please.Significant downside risk to the July payrolls is what Nancy Lazar wrote from Cornerstone Macro two weeks ago. Why do you believe there is a feeling that there has been a break in this recovery that we are going to see downside risk to these numbers this morning?JON HILSENRATH, SENIOR WRITER, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL": Well, I mean directly related to the coronavirus. We saw outbreaks in big, important states like Texas, Florida, Arizona in the month of July and that could have stalled the recovery.You know, the way I look at it we lost 22 million jobs in March and April. We got about a third of them back in -- in May and June. And what I am looking for is whether we stay at some decent pace of coming back. We need about two million jobs are a month just to get to climb out of this hole in 10 months.So, you know, we've got to be seeing numbers of one to two million to keep this going on.BARTIROMO: Wow.All right. These are important issues and those are big numbers.Let's slip in a short break and then get the panel's take on what we're going to see and its impact. The July jobs report right after this break.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Good Friday morning, everybody.We are awaiting breaking news on jobs in America this morning. The July jobs report is due out in a minute and a half. Economists are expecting 1.6 million jobs added to the economy in the month of July and the unemployment rate ticking down to 10.5 percent. We'll have the numbers as soon as they hit the tape.Ahead of the numbers futures right now are pointing to a lower opening this morning, down about 100 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Nasdaq down 36. And the S&P lower by 12 points.Dagen McDowell, final thoughts before we get these numbers. And let me just say that in the month of June we had 4.8 million jobs added to the economy. Now the estimate's only 1.6 million.MCDOWELL: I can say that economists don't know what to expect in less than 45 seconds because the range is a loss of 280,000 jobs up to a creation of four million. The estimates are all over the map here. We really -- that is why this is -- is such a wild card today.BARTIROMO: Yes. That is true.Steve Moore, we will see what happens in Washington in terms of the stimulus package but clearly, we have seen a break in the month of July from this recovery that started.STEPHEN MOORE, FORMER WSJ EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: Yes there is no doubt about that, Maria, and I would be very shocked if we saw a million and half jobs given the fact that - as John was talking about that we have seen several major states shut down parts of their activity.This is a really important number that we're going to get in one minute, the reason it so important is this is going to have a big impact, on these negotiations on these stage four stimulus plans.BARTIROMO: Wow! The market completely coming back we got the DOW Industrials well off the lows, now down just 24 points the NASDAQ down 11 and the S&P down 3 points as we await numbers. Markets have been Cheryl Casone has number right now.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: We do, we do. OK, so we actually have a beat, there goes the DOW right there we have a beat for the number of jobs added. The estimate 1.6 million we came in at 1.763 million.Now to the unemployment rate the expectation we were going to dropping 10.5 percent we're at 10.2 percent both of these numbers are better than expected. I want to add here right now also, I want to go through a couple more pieces of key data here.Manufacturing, that was pretty weak folks, we were expecting a gain of 253,000 manufacturing jobs. We got an actual gain of 26,000, private payrolls came in line and this kind of goes in line with the ADP report on Wednesday, we were expecting 1.47 million jobs added in private sector.We got 1.46 million, earnings month-to-month we were looking for a loss of half a percent we got a gain on average hourly earnings 0.2 percent. The year-over-year number and this is big I know a lot of folks were watching out for this. The year-over-year number we were looking for a gain 4.1, on earnings year-over-year we got 4.8 percent that is a bigger than expected gain.Workweek hours pretty much in line and government payrolls a gain of 301,000 labor force participation 61.4, labor force participation. So here is where we are at right now with jobs added.May and June we added together that was 7 million now we're up to 8.76 million jobs added in three months, to Dagen's point and this was a big one the estimates were all over the place we thought we could have gotten a loss of 208,000 of the bottom end of the range we could have gained 4 million.But, again, these numbers better than expected Maria and all of that is playing out despite losses in we're seeing in Texas, Florida and California. These numbers playing out on a national scale and there goes the markets right there Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: Yes, and that is why we are seeing this market come all the way back from lows. Eric Freedman, what do you think about these numbers? Give us your assessment of 1.76 million jobs added to the economy in the month of July?ERIC FREEDMAN, CIO, U.S. BANK WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Maria, better than expected I think the key thing is the distribution. If you look at cities, that did well, and the cities that really needed to do well. The key thing we are focused on is New York, L.A., Chicago, whether do they look like?And also just that breadth of improvement across those sectors so this has been led by health care, by government as well as by other parts of technology we have to see a broadening out. Next month Maria is going to be key, when we get to that back to school period and seeing who had to stay home versus who could actually go back to work next month is going to be critical for this market to continue to propel higher.BARTIROMO: Dominick Tavella, this is propelling. We are now positive DOW Industrials up 20 points what do you make of this market reaction?DOMINICK TAVELLA, LEBENTHAL GLOBAL ADVISORS PRESIDENT: Honestly Maria I think the markets are surprised. And if you look at where we started out and we were going to be negative for the day and maybe big negative that this number disappointed. The markets genuinely surprised.If you look at the ADP number we got the other day it was a big miss. ADP was expected to show an increase of 1.2 million jobs really got 167,000 new jobs, big revision for month before though. So I think this is a pleasant surprise the August numbers are critical.I think it's conceivable of the California Texas, Florida layoffs actually show up in the August numbers instead of July numbers so far so good.BARTIROMO: OK. Joanie Courtney any sense of where the hiring was in month of July? Where the jobs opportunities are right now Johnnie?COURTNEY: I got it. So Maria, I was looking at some of numbers here, and you know the temporary health sector came back added 143,000 jobs, I know in the business, that I run we're seeing a very strong demand of course in mortgage loans that's no surprise based on the low interest rates that we see.But those position of loan processors closers are in such high demand right now. There you know manufacturing and logistics jobs are coming back, a little surprised we didn't see a stronger number in the manufacturing sector.But, again, I think as we saw in mid June, with COVID starting to surge again, manufacturing really has to come to a halt. So the jobs growth is still very strong in the professional and business service sectors where people can also work from home.That is really helping companies with keeping their employees productive, and allowing them to work from home again we did see great growth in health care sector. You know that got--MCDOWELL: I've got the actual breakdown Maria, by industry.BARTIROMO: Yes, go ahead Dagen.MCDOWELL: Leisure and hospitality added 592,000 jobs that was about one third of the total gain in nonfarm payrolls. Employment in food services and drinking places up by more than half a million 5020,000 that was on heels of a gain of 2.9 million in May and June but despite the gains over the last three months, employment and food services and drinking places is still down by 2.6 million, since February.That is one of the - weak spots there and one of the concerns that these restaurants and bars are going to be put out of business permanently. Retail trade 258,000 jobs. Government 301,000 jobs there was broad-based job addition health care 126,000 jobs, manufacturing was somewhat weak spot with just 26,000 jobs added in July the expectation was for about 10 times that.COURTNEY: Yes, the instruction was also very week--BARTIROMO: Yes, go ahead Joanie.COURTNEY: I'm sorry Maria I was just saying construction was also pretty weak.BARTIROMO: That is a surprise to me in terms of construction being weak. Yes, Steve Moore let me ask you about importance here of this stimulus package obviously, you have been an Adviser to the president on the Tax Legislation. You have also been pushing this payroll tax cut the Democrats will not agree with it right now.MOORE: So it looks like Donald Trump is very, very close to signing an Executive Order to implement this payroll tax without Congress which is something as you know I have been a strong advocate of. He has legal authority to do it.So look, this report sets up very well for Donald Trump and these negotiations, with Pelosi he can move forward with the payroll tax cut which helps every working American gives them a 7.5 percent pay raise a really nice stimulus for the economy.You mentioned, in that - I believe you said 300,000 additional government jobs, if that number is true, Donald Trump that we don't have to give hundreds of billions of dollars to states, these the government sector of the economy is the one that is actually growing the fastest on this idea of giving more and more money to government sector of the economy.I think is crazy especially given this very strong number for increased government growth. By the way, the federal government is the one sector of the economy that keeps growing and growing. So I do think that Trump is going to say to Pelosi wait a minute here we don't need this massive stimulus bill the economy is coming back pretty well on its own.MCDOWELL: Well, Steve Moore the headline from Reuters says U.S. job growth slows sharply in July rather than still being about job creation, it is about job growth slowing. But I tell you, you are going to lose a million or more jobs just by letting this extra $600 per week expire I've heard from so many people in the - let me just finish the thought, and when I finish my sentence you can get the in here.I've heard from so many people, I am out of work, because of a Coronavirus pandemic shutdown. And now I am collecting $300 a week in unemployment benefits is less in some states. I am out of work because of no fault of my own because we're battling a virus and you are going to take by - you're basically going to take away my ability to pay bills and my rent.MOORE: Dagen we estimate we've lost two million jobs as a result of these high unemployment benefits. You just go out and talk to small businesses around the country, it's the biggest problem in the economy right now is businesses cannot get workers back on job because many workers are making twice as much money being unemployed as going back to the job.This is a job killer, the idea that $600 a week is helping the economy that's crazy and it's unfair to the millions and millions of people working in country today and they're getting paid less than people on unemployment. Dagen how can you justify that?MCDOWELL: It's unfair for people who can't go to work because of a Coronavirus pandemic and you basically took away their ability to pay their bills in many parts of this country.BARTIROMO: Yes. I understand that but do you have to be making more than you making on the job that is the issue not necessarily that there should not be any money but more than you working, when you are at home--MCDOWELL: Because the issue--BARTIROMO: --because I did speak with a number of Congressmen and a number of Senators who told me that they were getting calls from small business saying you are killing. My employees do not want to come back why would they're making more money at home than they are on the job.I can tell you in terms of some money to people but to actually give them more money and the incentives to stay home does impact the economy's opening again Dagen.MCDOWELL: I have heard that from small business owners. I have heard that from say dentists in New York City they can't get employees back. And I've heard from people who have worked through this shutdown that they feel, shunned and they're angry that they were making less putting their health on line going to work, than people on unemployment.That being said, the Republicans had months to put together a plan because they knew this was expiring the end of July, and if they wanted to do a stair step of like we're going from 600 to 400 to 200 and then let it expire - they put nothing out there they and they let the Democrats basically run roughshod over them.EDWARD LAWRENCE, CORRESPONDENT, FOX BUSINESS: Well Maria, can I get jump in?BARTIROMO: What Steven Mnuchin put out there was the idea that the states already - already do 50 percent of lost wages that is what the states do. Steven Mnuchin said well since the states are giving 50 percent of lost wages already let the federal government kick in 20 percent, take that up to 70 percent of a person's lost wages.And so it is going to be different where you are, and what you are making? But they averaged it out at $200 from the federal government that is how they got to this point because the states already replenished 50 percent of lost wages when you are out of a job.I know that Edward Lawrence has more on report this morning in terms of the job creation and where this is going let's get to Edward he is in D.C. right now Edward.LAWRENCE: Yes Maria, well, I've got some revisions too, we look at May was revised up 26,000 jobs, June was revised down 9,000 jobs here the total revision of up 17,000 jobs here. Also when you look at the U6, the U6 is actually gone down from was it 18 percent to 16.5 percent, gone down on that front.And when you look at the trends here, you talk about construction, yes, they only created 20,000 jobs, in the month of July but the three month total, is 639,000 jobs, for construction, leisure and hospitality created 2.1 million jobs last month in June, in July 529,000. So you are talking two month total of 2.69 million.So you've got a trend here of a couple months, where there is a lot of job creation, and then the revisions are up total 17,000 Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, we want to keep looking at this because, any indication of what this says in terms of the rest of the year, any indication here of what we might expect from jobs market going into year- end, Eric?FREEDMAN: Maria I think the key thing is just in terms of those sectors that may participate and may start to see it cannot fall as Dagen pointed out with respect to hospitality and leisure that is going to be critical and I can't emphasize enough.The next two months are significant. We have a catalyst of back to school that story keeps change for families, the stories keeps changing for businesses and that has material impact on who will be adding jobs? The more kids stay home, which you can maybe the right thing it is depending on the geography that obviously has the opposite effect in terms of the economy.So we actually are bullish, we do think that this is a bridge to get us to the other side. We're - again we have to keep in mind there isn't vaccine coming and the reason that we continue to be constructive on the path forward is because, that vaccine can't come soon enough form when it comes there is going to be a lot of pent-up demand as well so a lot of hiring to be done which leaves us with a glass half full.HILSENRATH: Hey Maria, can I jump in?BARTIROMO: Jon Hilsenrath.HILSENRATH: Yes, I wanted to--BARTIROMO: Go ahead.HILSENRATH: --one about this debate about stimulus and maybe other one about kind of where we stand? On debate about stimulus, there is a lot of discussion about federal unemployment benefits and that is important and it is a challenging issue to deal.But I think Stephen Moore hit on another issue which is really important and plays to - and that state and local governments. So, you know if you look at what is going on at the government level? Yes, overall employment might have been up for the month.But is where you would expect federal unemployment is up from a year ago because the government can that federal government can borrow all it wants. If you look at local government hiring and local government payrolls they're down 879,000 from a year ago.Local governments are being slammed right now because their sales taxes had been hit. Their unemployment numbers are going up and I think a real headwind to this expansion in every state, red state and blue state in the second half of the year is going to be these headwinds to state and local governments, who have to balance their budgets unlike the federal government.So, that is an important part of this debate about stimulus that isn't getting discussed. In terms of where we stand in this recovery, you know, let's kind of go to a bird's-eye view. 1.7 million is a really good number we should be encouraged by that at that rate, we can climb out of this hole within 8 months?If we can keep that 1.7 million increase a month going we can we out of this in 8 months that is great news. Now what's a big question whether we can do it? But like we were all deep in numbers right now and looking at all these different things I think we should say that there is good progress still being made.And the final thing is because of what we saw in Florida and Arizona you can't separate out the virus pulling the economy that when this virus hits it affects the economy. You know it might be the case that we did better last month because places like New York and New Jersey were getting back on their feet.So you know, I think we should not see this as just a pure trade-off between - the virus and getting the economy back on its feet.BARTIROMO: Well, I will tell you one thing, Dagen, if Mayor de Blasio does not get more money from the government, he has promised to raise taxes on the wealth that he may do it anyway.But he said he is not going to bend over backwards like Andrew Cuomo has to the New Yorkers who have fled the city he is looking for a tax on wealthy New Yorkers to close to help close the massive budget gap. So that is his answer to all of this Dagen.MCDOWELL: My question to the Mayor, and to the Mayor's some of these very liberal cities that are seeing not just unrest but people fleeing for the country, what wealthy?Because a lot of people have left New York City and have left these urban centers and so you could and to Jon's point you could see that downward spiral, that causes these cities to collapse in on themselves where you start hiking income taxes rates on the people who were still there, and you create even greater burden on them, and so you force a greater movement out of those very urban areas.To Jon's point if you look at the total number of jobs created in May June and July this includes the revisions, it is 9.23 million jobs. You look at the 22.2 million that were lost between February and April, this nation has made back he nearly 42 percent of the jobs lost between February and April, because of those shutdowns.We have a long way to go but we are heading in the right direction, this is a lower number but it certainly shows that we're on our way back.TAVELLA: Maria can I jump in?BARTIROMO: It still show a recovery right Steve? Yes, go ahead, go ahead.TAVELLA: This is Don.BARTIROMO: Go ahead Don.TAVELLA: One of the things I just want to emphasize here in a glass half full. This is not a demand problem we keep looking at a recession, you have high unemployment people really don't have the money to go out there and spend it. They can't vacation. They can't buy the new refrigerator so it is that's a demand problem.This is not a demand problem. If you could open up restaurants if you can open up bars - if you ask Disney, we can open up the parks people would come in and maybe not at the level that they did pre-January 1st last year but people would go out they would shop, they would spend money.So the quicker we come to the solution, of a virus this is a virus problem not a demand problem. The quicker the economy gets back to normal. So, yes, it is going to be a bumpy road to year-end it's not going to be a flat curve here. We are going to have good days and bad days but this demand is there people will come back, they will spend money. And I say do the jobs will come back, so definitely in glass half full.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --last point.BARTIROMO: Well, it is interesting to see where the job creation was, go ahead Jon.HILSENRATH: Well, just on this point about fighting the virus, so we saw in March and April, that these broad shutdowns these aggressive shutdowns of business and stay-at-home orders were very damaging to the economy. There was a low cost way in terms of the economy to fight the virus that is why wearing masks; you can go about your business, and wear a mask, and without damaging the economy and fight the virus.I think one of the lessons from last four months is that people who have concerns about how they look in public wearing a mask need to get over those snowflake concerns, and by into this because that helps to fight the virus and doesn't hurt the economy. There was all kinds of trade-offs when you could be thinking about right now.MCDOWELL: I look better with a mask on Jon Hilsenrath number one. And I think your message could be applied to people who were worried about voting in November.I said the other day, if you have been able to go to grocery store once a day and wear a mask and you've been able to go to Lowe's or Home Depot wherever of you been going even during the shutdowns if you are in the good enough health to do that you can go and put a mask on and keep your distance, and vote the way we normally do. And I think that's more of a message people need to be sending.MOORE: Maria, could I have something about recovery?BARTIROMO: I agree with that. Please.MOORE: Maria yes, so looks us have been talking a little bit about.BARTIROMO: Go ahead.MOORE: --about recovery really back in a strong way, and a critical part of this somebody mentioned it earlier but it is absolutely critical for covering the fall. We've got to get schools opened up it is not just a issue for the social and academic development of our kids but Maria you are not goes to be able to get people back to jobs if your schools closed up.So this is a really critical issue. And you've got a lot of states I live in Montgomery County, Maryland where not only do they want to shut down the public schools they want to shut down the private schools which is absolutely asinine and crazy.But look we've got to do this; it is safe for the kids there are ways to do it and one whole year of kids not having school? That is a very, very scary proposition for the future of this country.BARTIROMO: And - and there is a cost to that, because they will when they go to get a job be at disadvantage in terms of wages, when they actually do get a job, because of the lost schooling.MOORE: That is right.BARTIROMO: Labor report participation rates at 61.4 percent what would you say this tells us he Joanie goes ahead.COURTNEY: Yes, you know I think, concerning that we're not seeing more people try to get back into the workforce it does bring it back to the stimulus point. We really do need to get that right and get some kind of deal done. And I don't mean continue the $600 benefit, because that really is becoming an issue.I can tell you we have thousands, thousands and thousands of jobs, open, and we are having difficulty recruiting people and getting them to come to work, but there is that wage range where they are making more money on unemployment than they're if they went back to work.So that really is an issue. It also could be part of the reason we didn't see higher growth in construction in manufacturing I see it happening, in our business. We are actually having a national hiring day on August 25th because we can't get thousands of jobs filled.So my point is, these numbers could even be better if we could get the stimulus correct. I do agree though with Steve Moore's point a big issue is going to be getting schools back open because, some people really can't get back to work, if they have young children at home, and that is a big challenge that our country is facing right now I know.BARITROMO: Eric, let me ask you about growth in 2021. Tell us how you see this playing out in terms of an economy that is recovering or trying to recover from this shutdown, when do you actually see things normalizing once again Eric?FREEDMAN: Maria, probably in literally not the second half - until the second half of next year and that is contingent on either real progress, on virus antiviral - I'm sorry antivirus steps that are taken pre-vaccine or pre-antibody solutions or pre-vaccine.So I think there are a couple of things to keep in mind. Number one this back to school time period, is critical, and seeing how students get back if they are practicing the right social distancing and other techniques to stay healthy that is critical and that will allow more gradual recovery.I do think that if you look at the progress we're seeing in areas like leisure and hospitality is constructive and I think doing on a gradual basis is the right step. But in terms of things like business travel and in terms of things like company CAPEX anticipating consumers going back in and buying you know more durable goods and more longer lasting goods that isn't happening until second half next year.That being said it doesn't mean we can't discount that more sooner and we're expecting markets to - again we've had a real narrow leadership market environment thus far but we expected to broaden out.So things like you know starting to build positions in areas like small-cap stocks looking a little more broad we think makes sense but do not sell health care do not sell financials, or do not sell technology, those are spots that we think are still mainstays in prime portfolios.BARTIROMO: All right, Dominick, do you agree with that do you want to be buyer of those groups?TAVELLA: I definitely want to be buying. You know a bit of a big fan of health care since January. We still maintain a significant position there, and have done fantastic. I think the balance of this year, at least it is a good place to sit.And, look, the - the markets starting to roll over meaning we are starting to see other sectors perform better. The value sectors performing a little bit better. So I think there are opportunities here through the end of the year. Don't, don't panic don't sell. Be patient.You've been rewarded so far I think you get rewarded the rest of the year. There will be some dips in here use those as opportunities to add to your equity position don't be a seller.BARTIROMO: So what if we don't get a stimulus package this week? Jon Hilsenrath, what are the implications here? Obviously the two sides cannot get together we thought we would see something before they left to recess, which is tonight?HILSENRATH: Well, yes, I will come back to what I said earlier. I do think that there is a hard debate about unemployment benefits and how to calibrate them? This seems to me a real issue about paying people not to work. But I am going to come back to the state and local financial situation.Local governments are going to be in a position not where they just have to raise taxes in the coming six months but when they're cutting jobs future jobs police jobs fire fighter jobs and if the government doesn't - if the federal government doesn't look at that, then just don't be surprised if that is a big headwind on this economy in the second half of the year.MCDOWELL: Jon, it is Dagen.BARTIROMO: Well, don't forget the headwind of crime. Don't forget the headwind of crime Dagen. I mean, you know these rioting and this destruction of property, only extends this slowdown and contraction.HILSENRATH: Maria just on that point, if we want to make sure that the police aren't defunded and maybe federal government should be having discussions about funding police departments while these local governments are under so much strain.MCDOWELL: Well, Jon on that note.BARTIROMO: I agree with you.MCDOWELL: There was $10 billion that was set aside in the earlier stimulus package, the rescue package for states and localities and also, tribes. There hasn't been even close to a billion dollars spent. I think in recent weeks it was only $100 million of that $10 billion had been spent, so the issue is, is to loosen up the rules and restrictions on how the states and localities are spending that money?That's one issue. And then the other thing is, people, even because that $600 extra per week from the federal level expired, it's going to take weeks even if Congress can get something done to reinstate some, if not all, of that and so you will see a dramatic slowdown in spending, aggregate spending, if you let the payments lapse, they will fall 4.3 percent in one month according to those researchers at the University of Chicago.MOORE: Dagen, I got to say this. There is going to be so much opposition, justifiably so in red states, that acted fiscally responsible that now they have to pay taxes to bail out New York and California and Illinois and states that have acted so incredibly fiscally irresponsible?And my goodness Jon, New York spends twice as much per person on government as Florida does. Why should people in Florida have to bail out New York? There's this mythology out there that the federal government can give money to the states.The only way the federal government can give money to the states is to take the money from the states in the first place. So it's just a massive redistribution--MCDOWELL: But the fact is, let me just finish, the fact is that New York and these large blue states, New York is a net giver to the federal fiscal every year - that every single year New Yorkers pay more in taxes to the federal government than we take. For a lot of red states that is not true. They are net takers, not givers. That's a fact.HILSENRATH: If I can add on that, this mythology that the red places are more fiscally responsible than blue. You have places like Seattle have tripled credit ratings. You know, I'm a little skeptical of this idea that it's just the red states that are more fiscally responsible.Moreover, this is a national recession and national virus, and we are seeing right now Florida, Texas, they are getting slammed by this virus, they're getting slammed by the recession. They are not the new to the economic consequences--BARTIROMO: Yes we all are. You are absolutely right.And we are all getting slammed by this, and we got some good news this morning.It's been a great show everybody. Thank you so much for joining us, Dagen McDowell, Joanie Courtney, Jon Hilsenrath, Stephen Moore, Dominick Tavella, and Eric Freedman. I told you we were all hands on deck.Right to Varney & Co. we go. David Asman in for Stuart this morning. Have a great weekend David, over to you.Load-Date: August 7, 2020End of Document

As Trump digs in, will it be US versus China in tech?Associated Press Financial WireAugust 7, 2020 Friday 10:48 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 1072 wordsByline: ZEN SOO and TALI ARBEL, AP Technology WritersDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump’s bans on two popular Chinese social media apps — TikTok and WeChat — are the latest moves in an escalating U.S.-China rift, and point to a future where technology and innovation are increasingly walled behind political barriers.In China, the Communist Party has long limited what foreign tech companies can do. It blocks access to major U.S. internet services, like Google and Facebook, along with thousands of websites operated by news organizations and human rights, pro-democracy and other activist groups.Those restrictions have helped nurture homegrown tech giants that in recent years have started expanding, and even dominating, outside China.Now the U.S. and other countries are putting their own limits on China.The executive orders from the White House are vague. But experts said they appear intended to bar TikTok and WeChat from the app stores run by Apple and Google when the orders take effect in 45 days. That would make them more difficult to use in the U.S.“This is a pretty broad and pretty quick expansion of the technology cold war between the U.S. and China,” said Steven Weber, faculty director for the University of California, Berkeley Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity.The Trump administration has been hawkish against China. A big example is Huawei, the world's biggest maker of smartphones and network equipment, and China’s first global tech brand. Washington has moved to cut off Huawei Technologies Ltd.'s access to chips and other technology, tried to push allies away from Huawei and barred U.S. government funds from being used to pay for Huawei equipment in U.S. networks, citing security concerns.The Trump administration has also blocked Chinese buyers from acquiring U.S. companies.Now it's going after popular services used by millions globally. The effort is driven not only by security concerns but also Trump’s anger at Beijing, blaming China for the coronavirus pandemic and for hurting his re-election chances, according to two White House officials not authorized to speak publicly about private deliberations.“We are entering an era of an increasingly bifurcated internet, where it may become more difficult for Chinese information companies to succeed outside of China,” said Lindsay Gorman, a fellow specializing in emerging technologies at the Alliance for Securing Democracy.China's so-called Great Firewall has allowed Chinese internet powerhouses like e-commerce giant Alibaba, social media company Baidu and WeChat owner Tencent, which makes most of its money from online games and entertainment in China, to amass hundreds of millions of users — in some cases over a billion. For context, Facebook says it has more than 3 billion users across its various apps, including Instagram and WhatsApp and Messenger.But Bytedance’s TikTok has run into obstacles outside China. In the U.S., where TikTok says it has 100 million users, it may have to sell to Microsoft because of the U.S. government's national-security concerns. China's authoritarian government can demand access to data from companies, a concern that has also dogged Huawei. TikTok maintains that it does not share user data with the Chinese government nor censor content at its request. It suggested it would sue to make sure it and its user were “treated fairly.”WeChat, which has more than 1 billion users, is less well-known than TikTok to Americans without a connection to China. Mobile research firm Sensor Tower estimates about 19 million U.S. downloads of the app. But it is crucial infrastructure for Chinese students and residents in the U.S. to connect with friends and family in China, as well as for anyone who does business with China.Within China, WeChat is censored and expected to adhere to content restrictions set by authorities. The Citizen Lab internet watchdog group in Toronto says WeChat monitors files and images shared abroad to aid its censorship in China.“A U.S. ban of on WeChat would deepen the split between the United States and China on a human level by removing the de facto channel of communication for the Chinese diaspora,” said Gorman.Tencent also owns Riot Games, publisher of hit video game League of Legends, and has a big stake in Epic Games, the company behind video game phenomenon Fortnite. It also has a streaming deal with the NBA.It's not clear what will result from Trump's executive orders, how WeChat and TikTok users will be affected, whether Tencent's other operations are at risk, or whether there is legal authority for what Trump wants to do.More actions against Chinese technology companies may be coming from the U.S. and other countries, analysts say. China has a reputation for economic espionage and China-backed hackers have been blamed for breaches of U.S. federal databases and the credit agency Equifax."I think we’ll only see even further attempts by the U.S. to ban or prohibit Chinese products, services and investment,” said Andy Mok, senior research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing.

As Trump digs in, will it be US versus China in tech?Associated Press InternationalAugust 7, 2020 Friday 10:48 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 1072 wordsByline: ZEN SOO and TALI ARBEL, AP Technology WritersDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump’s bans on two popular Chinese social media apps — TikTok and WeChat — are the latest moves in an escalating U.S.-China rift, and point to a future where technology and innovation are increasingly walled behind political barriers.In China, the Communist Party has long limited what foreign tech companies can do. It blocks access to major U.S. internet services, like Google and Facebook, along with thousands of websites operated by news organizations and human rights, pro-democracy and other activist groups.Those restrictions have helped nurture homegrown tech giants that in recent years have started expanding, and even dominating, outside China.Now the U.S. and other countries are putting their own limits on China.The executive orders from the White House are vague. But experts said they appear intended to bar TikTok and WeChat from the app stores run by Apple and Google when the orders take effect in 45 days. That would make them more difficult to use in the U.S.“This is a pretty broad and pretty quick expansion of the technology cold war between the U.S. and China,” said Steven Weber, faculty director for the University of California, Berkeley Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity.The Trump administration has been hawkish against China. A big example is Huawei, the world's biggest maker of smartphones and network equipment, and China’s first global tech brand. Washington has moved to cut off Huawei Technologies Ltd.'s access to chips and other technology, tried to push allies away from Huawei and barred U.S. government funds from being used to pay for Huawei equipment in U.S. networks, citing security concerns.The Trump administration has also blocked Chinese buyers from acquiring U.S. companies.Now it's going after popular services used by millions globally. The effort is driven not only by security concerns but also Trump’s anger at Beijing, blaming China for the coronavirus pandemic and for hurting his re-election chances, according to two White House officials not authorized to speak publicly about private deliberations.“We are entering an era of an increasingly bifurcated internet, where it may become more difficult for Chinese information companies to succeed outside of China,” said Lindsay Gorman, a fellow specializing in emerging technologies at the Alliance for Securing Democracy.China's so-called Great Firewall has allowed Chinese internet powerhouses like e-commerce giant Alibaba, social media company Baidu and WeChat owner Tencent, which makes most of its money from online games and entertainment in China, to amass hundreds of millions of users — in some cases over a billion. For context, Facebook says it has more than 3 billion users across its various apps, including Instagram and WhatsApp and Messenger.But Bytedance’s TikTok has run into obstacles outside China. In the U.S., where TikTok says it has 100 million users, it may have to sell to Microsoft because of the U.S. government's national-security concerns. China's authoritarian government can demand access to data from companies, a concern that has also dogged Huawei. TikTok maintains that it does not share user data with the Chinese government nor censor content at its request. It suggested it would sue to make sure it and its user were “treated fairly.”WeChat, which has more than 1 billion users, is less well-known than TikTok to Americans without a connection to China. Mobile research firm Sensor Tower estimates about 19 million U.S. downloads of the app. But it is crucial infrastructure for Chinese students and residents in the U.S. to connect with friends and family in China, as well as for anyone who does business with China.Within China, WeChat is censored and expected to adhere to content restrictions set by authorities. The Citizen Lab internet watchdog group in Toronto says WeChat monitors files and images shared abroad to aid its censorship in China.“A U.S. ban of on WeChat would deepen the split between the United States and China on a human level by removing the de facto channel of communication for the Chinese diaspora,” said Gorman.Tencent also owns Riot Games, publisher of hit video game League of Legends, and has a big stake in Epic Games, the company behind video game phenomenon Fortnite. It also has a streaming deal with the NBA.It's not clear what will result from Trump's executive orders, how WeChat and TikTok users will be affected, whether Tencent's other operations are at risk, or whether there is legal authority for what Trump wants to do.More actions against Chinese technology companies may be coming from the U.S. and other countries, analysts say. China has a reputation for economic espionage and China-backed hackers have been blamed for breaches of U.S. federal databases and the credit agency Equifax."I think we’ll only see even further attempts by the U.S. to ban or prohibit Chinese products, services and investment,” said Andy Mok, senior research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing. He noted U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s statement this week of wanting a “clean” internet and networks free of Chinese influence.India has also blocked a slew of Chinese services, citing privacy concerns, amid a border standoff. The U.K. reversed plans for Huawei in its new high-speed mobile phone network. It said U.S. sanctions made it impossible to ensure the security of equipment made by the Chinese company.“You start wondering what will happen in terms of globalization, both economically and politically, if we have every country having completely separate networks, with completely different technology economies, access to information and social spheres,” said Tiffany Li, a visiting professor at the Boston University School of Law.The Chinese foreign ministry accused Washington of “political manipulation" but did not indicate how Beijing might respond.

Trump's veto on WeChat could end up damaging AppleCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 10, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 770 wordsBodyLast Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump issued two executive orders aimed at stemming the advance of two popular Chinese-born apps, Tim Tok and WeChat. The latter, however, could cause collateral damage and end up hurting the largest American company by market capitalization, Apple.The text of the orders is ambiguous and leaves the door open to several exceptions, but in principle it would prohibit American companies from doing business with Tencent, owner of WeChat, in too regards this popular instant messaging platform, the most used in China and very popular among emigrants in the country in other parts of the world, including the US. , to keep in touch with family members.In the order, Trump explains that the measure, which will take effect on September 20, has been taken to protect the personal data of American users. "WeChat automatically captures a lot of information from its users.This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to American-owned and personal information. In addition, the app captures the personal and proprietary information of Chinese citizens visiting the United States, thus allowing the Chinese Communist Party a mechanism to control Chinese citizens who may be enjoying the benefits of a free society for the first time in their lives," he explains in the order.Trump vs. WeChatBut the new guideline could put an American company, Apple, in serious trouble. The company has its largest market outside the U.S., with millions of iPhone users in China.In China, WeChat is practically a must-have on a day-to-day basis. Not only is it the most popular messaging application, as it can be in Spain WhatsApp, but it is used in many shops to make payments or as an identification system in third-party applications.Trump's order expressly prohibits American companies (and their citizens) from conducting "any type of transaction with Tencent or its subsidiary companies" related to WeChat.That means Apple might find itself in need of removing the WeChat app from the App Store, depending on how that text is interpreted.The order explains that the agency responsible for deciding how the veto is formally applied will be the U.S. Secretary of Commerce and that it will do so within 45 days. Also that you must comply with the laws already established, which leaves the door open to various scenarios.If Apple is forced to remove WeChat from the AppStore, however, the economic blow could be severe. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes it would be a 30% drop in the number of iPhones sold (Apple's main business). "Because WeChat is very important to Chinese users because it integrates communications, payments, e-commerce, social software, news reading and productivity features, we believe the measure will sink iPhone shipments into the Chinese market," explains the analyst.In principle, the executive order does not affect other products of Tencent Holdings, a Chinese conglomerate that in recent years has extended its tentacles in the entertainment and electronic entertainment industry.She owns or is in control of some of the world's most famous racing video games, such as Fortnite or League of Legends. It also owns 10% of Universal, 9% of Spotify and 2% of Warner Music. A more severe veto, therefore, could have far more serious consequences for the global economy.TikTok, the otherVictimThe other executive order issued friday refers to another business controlled by a Chinese company that enjoys enormous popularity in the West: the video-centric social network TikTok.As in the case of WeChat, Trump will prohibit U.S. citizens and U.S. companies from maintaining business relationships with ByteDance Ltd., the Chinese company that controls the app, within 45 days.The text is just as ambiguous as weChat's and also delegates to the trade secretariat the development of specific rules within the prescribed timeframe.This order, however, could have been created to accelerate the negotiations Microsoft has had for months with ByteDance to take control of TikTok outside China.Microsoft is not the only Western company that is trying to get hold of the social network. Twitter has also been interested in a possible purchase.TikTok, for its part, is considering the U.S. government to sue the U.S. government for considering this veto "to be a dangerous precedent for the concepts of freedom of expression and free market." The company also claims that it has never shared information about its users with the Chinese government. In China, ByteDance operates a similar but focused social network exclusively on that market, known as Douyin.Load-Date: August 11, 2020End of Document

CSIS: COVID-19 is Proving a Boon for Digital AuthoritarianismTargeted News ServiceAugust 18, 2020 Tuesday 9:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2033 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Center for Strategic and International Studies issued the following commentary on Aug. 17 by Aidan Powers-Riggs, former research intern with the China Power Project:With the coronavirus pandemic still raging and prospects for a comprehensive vaccine still far off, global leaders are urgently searching for ways to contain the virus--often seeking to emulate proven models of success.Somewhat ironically, China has emerged as an attractive model for flattening the infection curve, despite the virus originating from within its borders. Beijing's public health response--defined by the stewardship of advanced digital technologies to control and monitor the virus's spread--has drawn international praise from leading health officials for its effectiveness in containing the outbreak. With limited alternatives from Western countries, global leaders have increasingly looked to China for technical guidance and material support, and Beijing has eagerly provided its assistance.While China's surveillance technologies have long been sought after by authoritarian regimes seeking to shore up domestic control, the pandemic has expanded their appeal in the international marketplace. China's effective response to Covid-19 has amplified global demand for its digital public health toolset, providing a new inroad for its government and technology companies to deepen their international footprint. The resulting proliferation of Chinese surveillance technologies and data collection platforms, under the cover of anti-epidemic cooperation, may be providing China an opportunity to further promote its model of digital governance. Global debates over the norms and standards that govern acceptable use of digital tools by central governments around the world are far from settled, and this new environment risks tilting the balance away from democratic values in the digital world.How Covid-19 Attracts Chinese TechChina's use of technological tools, from artificial intelligence (AI)-powered public security platforms to cloud-linked medical software, has been integral to its coronavirus response. The Chinese government rapidly mobilized a vast array of surveillance tools, ranging from dense networks of security cameras, advanced facial recognition software, location-tracking apps, and even talking police drones. A smartphone app, piloted in Hangzhou but quickly spreading throughout the country, was developed to track citizens' history and health conditions, rating their risk for carrying the virus and assigning a correspondingly colored QR code.China has now largely contained the virus, but there is growing concern that the enhanced surveillance systems it has put in place are becoming permanent. Hangzhou's Communist Party secretary suggested the city's health monitoring app should become part of daily life and "loved so much that you cannot bear to part with it." Although some citizens have demanded the government delete personal health data after the crisis has passed, authorities have put forward no formal plans or mechanisms to ensure those demands will be met.Having declared victory over the outbreak at home, Beijing is now exporting its anti-epidemic tools and practices to countries around the world--often building upon pre-existing partnerships. In Ecuador, Chinese technology systems, including a Huawei-built AI-powered diagnostic system and a comprehensive public security platform designed by Chinese engineers, have become strategic tools for central authorities in their fight against Covid-19. The Chinese-built security system, called ECU 911, provides police services access to GPS data integrated with feeds from over 5,800 video surveillance cameras blanketing the country. Since the crisis, ECU 911 has reportedly assumed "new responsibilities" to help the country move towards what authorities there are openly calling the "new normal."Huawei has also used the outbreak to pitch its services to the Indian government. The company offered Indian authorities 5G thermal imaging software to help them "apply [Huawei's] learnings and experience from China to the current situation in India." In an unusually transparent statement illustrating the company's broader objectives, Huawei India CEO Jay Chen suggested "the success of 5G applications in the public health domain could also inspire businesses in other sectors to leverage 5G's popularity and explore new applications of the technology."Even where Chinese-built technology has not been actively utilized, countries have emulated Beijing's anti-epidemic measures. The success that early adopters of smartphone-based epidemiology had against the virus--namely China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore--encouraged a rapid and widespread global diffusion of centralized contact tracing apps. Yet in many countries, these technologies were hurriedly adopted without corresponding assurances of user protection. As of mid-June 2020, at least 47 such apps were active in 28 countries, of which nearly a quarter had no privacy agreement and over half had no clear measures to ensure anonymity.In the face of the virus's mounting toll, calls to put aside privacy concerns in favor of public health have gained ground even in major democracies such as the United Kingdom and the United States. In the United Kingdom, top health experts nearly succeeded in pushing the government to implement a centralized contact tracing app, more akin to the central data-aggregation design of Chinese systems than the decentralized privacy-oriented versions now being implemented in select U.S. cities. Yet across the United States, location-tracking tech firms once scorned by public officials are now being utilized by state and local authorities to monitor hotspots as economic reopening gets underway.Empowering Authoritarian GovernanceWhile China's anti-epidemic technologies may be helping some countries curb the immediate threat of the virus, they also carry an inherent risk of co-optation by authoritarian regimes seeking to consolidate authority. As China's sophisticated public surveillance platforms--enhanced with AI technology, location-tracking software, and personal data integration techniques--diffuse around the globe, recipient governments gain access to a readily-used authoritarian toolkit that can be easily retooled from its original public health purpose. This technology poses a particular risk to fragile democracies and countries in the developing world, where civil society is weak but Chinese influence is growing.Recent events have demonstrated that this co-optation risk is not limited to authoritarian regimes. U.S. analysts need not look far for cautionary tales. In the United States, as demonstrations swept through some of Minnesota's largest cities as a result of the police killing of George Floyd, state law enforcement officials openly refashioned the epidemiological paradigm of "contact tracing" to track the origins of protestors.It should be noted that, on its own, the use of advanced technologies in public health does not pose an inherent threat to democratic governance. Ultimately, the actors leveraging the technology are the ones who determine how it will be used. Yet in countries without robust democratic institutions that provide checks on authority, the risk of misuse is elevated. Even South Korea, a strong democracy whose Covid-19 response has been hailed as a model of digital public health, was shown to have failed to adequately protect the personal data of thousands of people using its mandatory quarantine app. Public blowback forced accountable elected officials there to address the app's vulnerabilities, but in countries without institutional balances or open civic discourse, such oversights likely go systematically unchecked.Beyond easing and encouraging authoritarian inclinations worldwide, the spread of China's technology-focused Covid-19 response has accelerated the normative challenge that China's governance model poses to the underlying values of today's liberal international order. As China's surveillance technologies and data-collection protocols prove effective at stemming the spread of disease, their broader application may gain global legitimacy. This will boost an ongoing effort by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to shift prevailing global narratives on governance away from a preference for liberal democracy toward an international order that is friendly to autocracy. The CCP has and needs no better narrative instrument than a highly visible demonstration of its model's success, particularly when compared to the foundering responses of many Western democracies.Technology's central role in this defining narrative moment for China cannot be overlooked. In the United States and many European countries, where privacy protections are strictest and public appetite for widespread surveillance is minimal, authorities were slow to harness technology to limit the virus's spread. Although factors beyond the underuse of technological tools were undoubtedly at play in those countries, their comparative failure to curb the virus nonetheless only boosts the attractiveness of China's tech-focused model, where civic and digital freedoms are readily sacrificed for the "greater good" of public health.Setting Standards for the "New Normal"Recognizing an opportunity to further consolidate global leadership, Beijing has actively used health cooperation to promote a "global community of health for all," with China at the center. Despite resolutely denying any intention of exporting a Chinese Covid-19 response model, leaders in Beijing have encouraged the narrative that China's health response is one to be praised and replicated by the international community. In conversations with world leaders, Chinese President Xi Jinping has repeatedly invoked the concept of a "Health Silk Road," seeking to revive a Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)-linked project aimed at promoting global health cooperation centered around Beijing's high-tech framework. By the end of May, China had sent medical teams to at least 27 countries, focusing largely on its strategic BRI partners in the developing world such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, Laos, Cambodia, the Philippines, and countries across Africa.CCP leaders have also called for China to seize the opportunity presented by Covid-19 to advance a sweeping strategy to set the global standards for next-generation technologies. The plan, called China Standards 2035, seeks to internationalize Beijing's preferred standards for emerging tech like AI, blockchain, and 5G. Government documents show the Covid-19 crisis is set to play a major role. A work report released by China's National Standardization Committee in early March calls for China to "strengthen the construction of the relevant standard system for the prevention and control of Covid-19," and promote its "standards for emergency response, social prevention and control." If China's domestically cultivated digital governance toolset continues to gain global popularity and legitimacy through the pandemic's spread, Western governments and companies will face an uphill battle competing against China's standards-setting agenda.As the world limps toward recovery, observers should carefully watch the continued spread of China's anti-epidemic technologies and methods and their knock-on impacts on principles of digital freedom and civic rights. To be an effective counterweight against the shifting balance towards authoritarian principles in the digital world, the United States and other like-minded democracies would be best served by presenting an attractive alternative to China's technology and limiting the appeal of Beijing's intrusive response model. Washington's chance to lead by example has long since passed; however, by uplifting successful democratic governments like those in Taiwan, South Korea, and New Zealand as the gold standard for responsible use of epidemiological technology, perhaps the United States can play a role in ensuring that the future of fighting disease does not come at the expense of civic and digital freedoms.[Category: Political]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7210816 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 18, 2020End of Document

Center for Strategic & International Studies: Hikvision, Corporate Governance, and the Risks of Chinese TechnologyTargeted News ServiceAugust 8, 2020 Saturday 8:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1466 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Center for Strategic and International Studies issued the following blog:As concerns have grown in recent years about the economic, national security, and human rights risks posed by Chinese technology firms, the United States has responded by banning or restricting the way many Chinese firms can operate in the country. Around the world, other governments are taking similar measures, citing security risks due to these companies' alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Many Chinese firms, like Hikvision, Huawei, and TikTok, have pushed back on these measures, asserting their independence from the Chinese government. However, questions remain about how susceptible these companies are to Chinese influence, and how countries can evaluate these risks to calibrate their policy measures according to the actual dangers posed to citizens and their data. In making this risk calculation, one of the most important questions regards the corporate governance structure of Chinese firms.An illustrative example of a Chinese firm whose corporate governance raises significant concerns about Chinese influence is Hikvision. The Hangzhou-based Hikvision is the world's leading video surveillance equipment supplier, with revenue of over $7 billion in 2018. The United States has raised a number of concerns about the security risks posed by Hikvision, however, and has leveraged a number of restrictions against the company in recent years.One of the most powerful policy tools the United States has to act against Chinese firms it deems risky is to add them to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) Entity List - making these companies subject to specific licensing requirements for exports. Companies on BIS' Entity List "have been determined by the U.S. Government to be acting contrary to the foreign policy interests of the United States." In October 2019, Hikvision was added to the entity list amidst growing concerns that the Chinese government would be able to use Hikvision technology to spy on or collect data from individuals outside of China. Western leaders have expressed concern over Article 7 of the Chinese National Intelligence Law which reads, "Any organization or citizen shall support, assist, and cooperate with state intelligence work in accordance with the law." In calling for limits on Chinese tech companies' presence in the U.S. and other Western countries, policymakers often cite Article 7 and raise concerns over companies' limited ability to resist requests for information from the CCP.Hikvision has not been allowed to sell its products to U.S. government agencies since August 2019, and the White House is in the process of finalizing a federal contractor ban for Hikvision and four other companies. Given Hikvision's deep-seated integration with the CCP, the recent scrutiny is not unwarranted: Hikvision's founding, controlling stakeholders, and leadership structure are all inextricably connected to the Chinese government.The People's Republic of China (PRC) is the controlling stakeholder of Hikvision, with 41.88% ownership. The state-owned China Electronics Technology Group (CETC) controls these shares through its subsidiaries, the China Electronics Technology HIK Group Co., LTD (CETHIK) and CETC No. 52 Research Institute. Hikvision disclosed that these CETC-owned enterprises are shareholders, but still brands itself as an "independent" corporation. However, as IPVM reported in 2017, the labelling of these CETC subsidiaries as simply shareholders minimizes and obscures the control the Chinese government actually has over Hikvision. CETHIK includes Hikvision's revenue and employees in its own reported metrics, and the two supposedly independent corporations have the same leadership and governance structure. Chen Zongnian is not only the CEO of Hikvision, head of the 52nd Institute, and Communist Party Secretary of CETHIK, in 2018 he also joined the National People's Congress. Hikvision's own 2015 annual report makes clear the nature of CETC and the State's involvement: the controlling stakeholder is labeled "Central State-owned," while the corporation, called "the actual controller," is described as a "Central State-owned assets management agency." It is difficult to discern where Hikvision begins and the CETC ends.The close ties between the CCP and Hikvision suggest that Hikvision will be able to exert influence in Beijing, and may be quick to cooperate with government requests for information. Government contracts helped launch Hikvision: in 2008, the surveillance company helped with security at the Beijing Olympics, and in 2011 Hikvision signed a $1.2 billion deal to create a safe city in Chongqing. Between 2016 and 2017, Hikvision signed deals worth $272 million with the police in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, where Uighur Muslims are subject to invasive security measures.While the United States is now taking action to limit the presence of Hikvision technology in government agencies, that hasn't always been the case. In August 2016, the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan put out a federal bid for security cameras, with the stipulation that only Hikvision products would be accepted. Stephen Bryen, an international affairs and cybersecurity expert, expressed concerns about the purchase of Hikvision cameras by the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. Bryen warned of security risks, lamenting that Hikvision products are not secure, and that "installing [Hikvision's] commercial cameras in one of the [United States'] most sensitive locations...is a big mistake." IPVM also reported on the bid, calling it "a risk for the US government to be deploying Chinese government controlled surveillance cameras into high security federal facilities."In November 2016, Hikvision cameras were removed from the Kabul embassy.Security experts have long alleged that Hikvision technology is insecure, and that poorly-written code could allow unauthorized users to access cameras' metadata and video footage. The main risks concerning Hikvision's questionable cybersecurity track record are well founded. Hikvision cameras were hacked in the Chinese province of Jiangsu in March 2015 and DVR technology in Hikvision cameras was co-opted in 2014 to mine for bitcoin. Some fear that backdoors in the technology could grant the Chinese government access to all Hikvision footage, whether captured domestically or abroad. In May 2017, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) issued an advisory revealing the presence of a backdoor into Hikvision cameras that was classified as "remotely exploitable/low skill level to exploit." The researcher who discovered the loophole, Monte Crypto, confirmed that the backdoor "allows unauthenticated impersonation of any configured user account."Though Chinese intelligence operations are not always visible, there seem to be real risks involved in installing Hikvision and other Chinese technology in our most sensitive institutions. The discovery of easily exploitable backdoors, as well as Hikvision's inextricable links to the CCP, suggest that it is highly possible that the Chinese government has access to footage captured by Hikvision cameras, which could be used to build dossiers on Chinese nationals abroad and punish them at home, or to collect information on other countries' national security infrastructure.While the addition of Hikvision to the entity list and the federal contractors ban are positive steps, they may be too little too late. In October 2019, more than 2,700 Hikvision cameras were reportedly still in use across the federal government, despite the numerous DHS warnings about Hikvision's security vulnerabilities. The technology is found in police departments and on army bases throughout the country, potentially exposing our most sensitive information to the Chinese government.The increased scrutiny of Chinese owned companies in recent months raises questions about how the U.S. might respond to these companies' operations and mitigate the risks posed to American users. As the U.S. government considers weighs potential bans and export controls, it must closely consider the unique governance structures of these corporations in order to effectively evaluate the risks they pose and to implement proportionate controls and countermeasures.Anna Lehman-Ludwig is a research intern with the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, DC.[Category: Political]Contact: H.

EXIM Chairman Kimberly Reed Delivers Remarks at Center for Strategic, International Studies: 'Future Directions of Export-Import Bank of U.S.: Neutralizing China, Advancing U.S. Comparative Leadership in World'Targeted News ServiceAugust 1, 2020 Saturday 8:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3100 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Export-Import Bank of the U.S. issued the following news release on July 31:Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) President and Chairman of the Board of Directors Kimberly A. Reed delivered remarks (virtually)-- "Future Directions of the Export-Import Bank of the United States: Neutralizing China and Advancing the United States Comparative Leadership in the World"--at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (link is external) (CSIS).Following a series of recent remarks made by National Security Advisor Ambassador Robert C. O'Brien, FBI Director Christopher Wray, Attorney General William P. Barr, U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper, and U.S. Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeoexplaining the different facets of America's relationship with China, Chairman Reed underscored the magnitude of Chinese state-backed unfair competition, which undermines U.S. exporters and puts America at a disadvantage in key sectors critical to the United States' long-term economic and national security. She highlighted how our nation is taking a competitive approach to these, and other, challenges posed by Beijing, as outlined in the United States Strategic Approach to the People's Republic of China (link is external).Chairman Reed's remarks focused on EXIM's new "Program on China and Transformational Exports" (China Program)--one of the most significant initiatives in EXIM's 86-year history--which was established in the agency's historic bipartisan Congressional reauthorization and signed into law by President Trump on December 20, 2019. The law charges EXIM with a goal of reserving at least 20 percent--$27 billion--of its $135 billion financing authority--for the China Program, and with advancing "the comparative leadership of the United States" with respect to China, and supporting "United States innovation, employment, and technological standards," through direct exports in key industries, including 5G, fintech, renewable energy, biomedical sciences, biotechnology, artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced computing, and semiconductors. More generally, EXIM is placing emphasis on technologies critical to long-term American prosperity and security, such as space technology.Following Chairman Reed's formal remarks, she joined Daniel Runde, Senior Vice President, William A. Schreyer Chair and Director, Project on Prosperity and Development at CSIS, who also serves as Chair of EXIM's Sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee, for a "fireside discussion." You can find a full recording of the event here (link is external)."It is an honor to join CSIS' Dan Runde and more than 200 attendees virtually--just over one year since I was sworn in as President and Chairman of EXIM-- to reflect on the important work we have done to support U.S. exporters and workers, and highlight opportunities for the future," said Chairman Reed. "In the last year, we have successfully reopened, reauthorized, and reformed the agency. In that historic reauthorization, signed into law by President Trump, Congress recognized on a bipartisan basis EXIM's strategic value as a tool to counter the People's Republic of China's unfair and aggressive trade practices. I am excited to continue supporting U.S. businesses and workers by helping to level the playing field for American exporters, as we, through a whole-of-government approach, neutralize Chinese export subsidies, and advance the United States comparative leadership in the world. I'd also like to thank Dan Runde for his service and invaluable insight as Chair of EXIM's Sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee."Chairman Reed added, "Our agency has actively engaged important members of the nation's high-tech industrial base to solicit their views on how the agency can be more helpful in supporting their exports abroad. This outreach will hopefully drive new significant deal flow supporting U.S. jobs. But, we--I--want more. A lot more--particularly deals supporting smaller but growing companies, which have been an exciting source of innovation around the country. Where those capabilities have been developed in the United States--we must support their export. With this in mind, EXIM can support U.S. technology innovators in their desire to compete in the international marketplace, which is a vitally important part of our overall economic and national security approach to addressing China's ambitions to technologically dominate worldwide."You can find a full transcript of Chairman Reed's remarks as prepared for delivery below, or by clicking here.* * *To: Kimberly A. Reed, President and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Export-Import Bank of the United StatesRemarks at Center for Strategic and International Studies (Virtual Event)Future Directions of the Export-Import Bank of the United States: Neutralizing China and Advancing the United States Comparative Leadership in the World (https://www.csis.org/events/online-event-future-directions-export-import-bank-united-states)Washington, D.C.July 31, 2020Remarks as Prepared for DeliveryThank you, Dan Runde, for hosting me today. Dan, I so appreciate the great work you are doing by chairing our Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) Sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee. Your commitment and understanding of the connection between the private sector and good governance in extending freedom and prosperity, especially to Africa and the developing world, really comes through in your leadership of the Committee.I also want to thank the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) for all the innovative thinking and sound judgment this organization has applied to our nation's security over so many years, and for working to make the world safer and freer.I join you virtually today from my office at EXIM, which is on the northeast corner of Lafayette Park and overlooks the White House. This agency was created in 1934, and it is an honor to serve as the first woman President and Chairman of the Board of Directors of EXIM. You will see behind me on the walls of this historic office knotty pine paneling, which, as the first West Virginian to lead EXIM in its 86-year history, has a special meaning to me.We all continue to contend with the difficulties brought on by the COVID-19 global pandemic, but Americans will succeed in returning to greatness, health, and peace of mind. Banishing fear today means together re-opening, safely and effectively, the greatest economy the world has ever seen--an economy the American people built thanks to President Trump's policies of cutting taxes, reining in regulation, and standing up for American workers.But to return to that greatness we must fearlessly use all the tools we have available. One of the most important tools is export finance.This is where my agency comes in. EXIM fills gaps in private export finance to bolster U.S. job growth. EXIM does this through trade financing solutions such as export credit insurance, working capital guarantees, and guarantees of commercial loans to foreign buyers--all of it to empower the exporters of U.S. goods and services.When I look out my window and see the White House, I thank President Trump for nominating my fellow Board Members, Spencer Bachus and Judith Pryor, and me. This bold step led to the full reopening of EXIM after nearly four years of dormancy except to transactions under $10 million. Between 2015 and 2019, EXIM had no quorum of its Board of Directors, and so its ability to perform its mission of supporting U.S. jobs by facilitating American exports was severely limited. And, the world changed a lot over those four years, particularly when it comes to the People's Republic of China. But with the firm support of the President and a strong bipartisan majority in Congress, that quorum was restored with our U.S. Senate confirmation on May 8, 2019. I also appreciate the important contributions U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, who serve as ex officio Members of EXIM's Board of Directors.On July 20, our nation celebrated the 51st anniversary of the historic moon landing. I felt that same sense of American innovation and purpose when, at Andrews Air Force Base on December 20, 2019, President Trump established the Space Force and, later that night on Air Force One, signed into law EXIM's historic reauthorization. Thanks to the President's leadership and bipartisan support in the Congress, EXIM was reauthorized for the longest period in its 86-year history--a historic seven years. This gives needed certainty to U.S. businesses and stakeholders, as well as to the world.In the short time since, EXIM has already made great progress on behalf of American business and U.S. workers. In Fiscal Year 2019, EXIM authorized a total of $8.2 billion in financing--including $2.2 billion for small businesses--and this is estimated to support 34,000 U.S. jobs. Thus far in Fiscal Year 2020, as of June 30, EXIM has authorized $1.9 billion in financing that is estimated to support 12,000 U.S. jobs. Just yesterday, the EXIM Board of Directors approved a $97.2 million transaction supporting 800 U.S. jobs, mainly in Florida, that utilized an EXIM COVID-19 economic recovery measure. And we look forward to considering more transactions soon, while also protecting the American taxpayer.Congress mandated in our Charter that EXIM focus on promoting the expansion of EXIM's financial commitments in sub-Saharan Africa. The EXIM Board unanimously authorized one of the largest transactions in EXIM's history, a $4.7 billion transaction assisting the construction of a liquified natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique. It involves 68 U.S. suppliers supporting 16,700 American jobs in Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and the District of Columbia. Follow-on sales are expected to support thousands of additional jobs across the United States. And this transaction is significant not only because of its historic size, the U.S. jobs supported, and the potential for economic freedom for the Mozambique people, but because EXIM's involvement helped displace Chinese and Russian financing from this deal.Speaking of China, that country has changed the nature of global competition over the past years with a pre-meditated strategy of aggressive official export financing. It totaled at least $76 billion in 2019, dwarfing that of any other country. Its official medium- and long-term export credit activity was roughly equal to that of all G7 countries combined--for the second year in a row.China has been the catalyst for most major export credit agencies becoming more proactive. There were 85 export credit agencies four years ago; now there are 115--a striking 35-percent increase from 2015 to 2019.Last month, I was pleased to submit EXIM's annual Report to the U.S. Congress on Global Export Credit Competition. The Report underscores the magnitude of Chinese state-backed unfair competition, which undermines our U.S. exporters and even puts America at a disadvantage in key sectors critical to our long-term economic and national security. Fortunately, our nation is taking a competitive approach to these, and other, challenges posed by Beijing, as outlined in the United States Strategic Approach to the People's Republic of China (link is external) released in May.Over the last few years, the Trump Administration has pursued a comprehensive, whole-of-government approach to helping the United States maintain its technological edge over geopolitical competitors, particularly, China. National Security Advisor Ambassador Robert C. O'Brien ("The Chinese Communist Party's Ideology and Global Ambitions" (link is external) at the Arizona Commerce Authority Conference Center), FBI Director Christopher Wray ("The Threat Posed by the Chinese Government and the Chinese Community Party to the Economic and National Security of the United States (link is external)" at the Hudson Institute), Attorney General William P. Barr (Remarks on China Policy (link is external) at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum), U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper ("U.S. Vision for Security in the Indo-Pacific Region (link is external)" at the International Institute for Strategic Studies), and U.S. Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo ("Communist China and the Free World's Future" (link is external) at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum) recently delivered a series of remarks explaining the different facets and implications of America's relationship with China.When it comes to EXIM, as part of our historic seven-year bipartisan reauthorization, Congress directed that EXIM establish a new "Program on China and Transformational Exports" (China Program), one of the most significant initiatives in EXIM's 86-year history. The purpose of the China Program is "to support the extension of loans, guarantees, and insurance, at rates and on terms and other conditions ... fully competitive with rates, terms, and other conditions established by the People's Republic of China."EXIM's new legislative mandate will enable us to be a bold and innovative partner when our great U.S. companies and workers, seeking to compete against China all around the world, need support and private financing is not available.The law charges EXIM with a goal of reserving at least 20 percent--$27 billion--of our $135 billion financing authority--for the China Program, and with advancing "the comparative leadership of the United States" with respect to China, and supporting "United States innovation, employment, and technological standards," through direct exports in key industries, including 5G, fintech, renewable energy, biomedical sciences, biotechnology, artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced computing, and semiconductors. More generally, EXIM is placing emphasis on technologies critical to long-term American prosperity and security, such as space technology.I recruited David Trulio, a senior leader from the Pentagon with tremendous leadership and international business experience in both the public and private sectors, to serve as my Counselor and Senior Vice President for the Program on China and Transformational Exports.Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich recently wrote that without EXIM "there is no practical, clear way to compete against the ever-expanding Chinese economic-military machine." With this new Program on China, EXIM is directly taking on China's opaque and exploitative model of economic development and finance, while at the same time supporting American jobs.Over just the last few months, our agency has actively engaged important members of the nation's high-tech industrial base to solicit their views on how the agency can be more helpful to them in supporting their exports abroad.This outreach will hopefully drive new significant deal flow supporting U.S. jobs. But, we--I--want more. A lot more--particularly deals supporting smaller but growing companies, which have been an exciting source of innovation around the country. Not only in Silicon Valley and New York, but also in places like Austin, Orlando, Denver, Atlanta, Raleigh-Durham, and Phoenix, and even in West Virginia--all of which are maintaining exciting emerging technology ecosystems that need to be supported.Why? Because the mission is that important. The United States and China are increasingly on separate paths in the development and use of powerful, foundational technologies around the world. It began with 5G and drone technology and will likely continue through AI, advanced and quantum computing, and other emerging technologies.Where those capabilities have been developed in the United States--we must support their export. With this in mind, EXIM can support U.S. technology innovators in their desire to compete in the international marketplace, which is a vitally important part of our overall economic and national security approach to addressing China's ambitions to technologically dominate worldwide.This is what Congress wants us to do. And, this is what the President wants us to do. In this mission, EXIM must succeed.EXIM also is implementing six reforms from Congress to which I, someone who believes in free markets and prosperity while not unilaterally disarming to the disadvantage of the United States, am personally committed:* Increasing transparency;* Strengthening taxpayer protections;* Improving protections for domestic companies;* Ensuring EXIM does not "crowd out" private financing options;* Cracking down on bad actors; and* Working to reduce the reliance on export credit agencies globally.To better ensure that EXIM is not competing with private capital, EXIM has amended the agency's economic impact procedures to better assess the potential impacts of its pending transactions on relevant domestic industries. And EXIM has strengthened its determination of "additionality"--why a transaction could not go forward without EXIM financing and therefore requires EXIM support. The agency now will require an overall more robust process and more written documentation from applicants to determine additionality, from the inception of each transaction until it is presented for Board consideration.In the past, EXIM has been needed most during periods of stress in global financial markets. This was the case following the 2008 financial crisis when EXIM authorizations increased 80 percent. When COVID-19 impacted our country and the world, EXIM took swift action and we continue to respond to the U.S. and global financial disruptions and instabilities.At the outset of the crisis, EXIM quickly mobilized as part of a whole-of-government approach to focus on the pandemic economic recovery. I am so proud of our 515 employees and contractors at EXIM for how, on a temporary basis, they transformed into a fully-teleworking agency, putting health and safety first as they worked with American exporters to reduce the negative economic impacts of the pandemic--especially when it comes to U.S. jobs.I just want to say what an immense honor it is to be a part of furthering this historic effort to support and advance America's prosperity. EXIM's new vision is "Keeping America Strong: Empowering U.S. Businesses and Workers to Compete Globally." EXIM is going to be serving American businesses of all sizes that seek to export; we are going to continue to be supporting U.S. jobs, and helping to keep America strong for years to come.Thank you again, Dan. I am happy to take questions.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7195572 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 1, 2020End of Document

FBI arrests IU Ph.D. candidate, alleges he lied about Chinese military service on visaIndiana Daily Student: Indiana UniversityAugust 30, 2020 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1151 wordsByline: Caroline AndersBodyAn IU Ph.D. candidate and researcher was arrested in July after an FBI investigation alleged he was one of several Chinese researchers in the U.S. who knowingly lied on his visa application by saying he had never served in the Chinese military. Kaikai Zhao was studying machine learning and artificial intelligence at the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. His lawyer, Indianapolis-based Brad Banks, declined to comment on the case. IU does not comment on pending criminal matters.Zhao was arrested July 18, and a judge decided Aug. 5 to hold him without bail until trial.Despite investigators' allegations that Zhao "made false statements concerning that military service to conceal the true nature and purpose of his educational pursuits in the United States, federal charging documents do not present evidence of Zhao transmitting information to the People's Liberation Army.Federal authorities believe this case is part of a program run by the PLA or another institution to send military scientists to the U.S. under false pretenses. Three other researchers - all of whom were studying at universities in California - were arrested in July on the same visa fraud charge. A fourth, who was studying at the University of Virginia, was arrested Friday and charged with theft of trade secrets and accessing a computer without authorization.In a statement, Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers called the purported scheme "another part of the Chinese Communist Party's plan to take advantage of our open society and exploit academic institutions."Zhao's case and the four similar ones came after President Donald Trump issued a proclamation in May that barred Chinese citizens at the graduate level and above who have ever been affiliated with a Chinese entity that uses or supports China's military-civil fusion strategy from being granted visas to study in the U.S. The order also prompted a review of individuals already in the U.S. who fell into that category.Minyao Wang, a New York City attorney who has worked on intellectual property theft cases related to China, said the government was definitely looking for more evidence of wrongdoing by Zhao, but they probably would have found it by now if they were going to."Technically and officially and legally, he has not been accused of doing anything," Wang said, referring to the absence of charges beyond visa fraud. "But there is obviously the insinuation that like, 'What the heck are you doing in a research lab in Bloomington, Indiana, if you're an undercover Chinese military officer?' And that is actually a very valid question."Court documents say an FBI surveillance team saw Zhao meet with two officials from the People's Republic of China's Chicago Consulate on July 17 in a park near his Bloomington home. The trip's stated purpose was for officials to give health packages of masks and wipes to Chinese students. Wang called the meeting "exceptionally unusual," noting the officials drove nearly 250 miles to Bloomington, and said it was compelling circumstantial evidence that Zhao is not an ordinary civilian.In an interview with the FBI after his July 18 arrest, Zhao repeatedly denied having met with consulate officials the day prior until agents told him they watched the meeting happen. Zhao reportedly then told agents the meeting was about his visa, and the officials said the U.S. government might contact him because of his military background and the schools he attended.On his visa application, Zhao disclosed he had a bachelor's degree from China's Aviation University of Air Force and was a joint student Ph.D. candidate at China's National University of Defense Technology and Naval Aeronautical University, which are all PLA-affiliated. When asked on the visa application if he ever served in the military, investigators say Zhao answered no."He sort of wasn't being super super honest," Wang said, "but then he also told people that he went to a Chinese military academy."This photo of Kaikai Zhao wearing a People's Liberation Army Air Force uniform appeared in the conclusion of the December 2015 article he co-authored at the Aviation University of Air Force, according to the FBI. Zhao denied being in the Air Force and told officials he wore the uniform for the photo to increase the prestige of his research and school.Courtesy PhotoIn charging documents, the FBI also noted the Aviation University of Air Force is a similar institution to the U.S. Air Force Academy where students are active military members as they earn bachelor's degrees. Investigators also found photos of Zhao wearing the PLA Air Force uniform and his name on published research concerning military radar technology. Zhao denied serving in the air force and told investigators he wore the uniform in a photo for a research study he had worked on to raise the prestige of the research paper and school.As part of the investigation, agents searched Zhao's Bloomington apartment and office in Luddy Hall. They took documents and electronics from both locations and found a ripped-up copy of his visa application in the trash can next to his bed.A 2018 policy brief from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute found dozens of PLA scientists have "obscured their military affiliations" to travel and do research in the European Union and countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the U.S."It's not clear that Western universities and governments are fully aware of this phenomenon," the brief reads.Another Chinese graduate student in Zhao's intelligent systems engineering program said Zhao was shy but always friendly and helpful. He was also incredibly serious about his work, she said, and would sometimes get to Luddy Hall at 7:30 a.m. and not leave until 10:30 p.m.He kept sticky notes on his desk and computer monitor at Luddy with encouraging phrases to remind him to keep going and not be afraid of failure. The graduate student, who asked to remain anonymous since the investigation is still open, said she was sad for Zhao and couldn't see a reason why he would intentionally lie on his visa application.Their program is also fairly new - it was founded in 2016 - and not yet widely known, she said, so she didn't know why the Chinese government would send someone to steal information from it.Zhao's goal was to be a professor someday, his peer recalled, and he wanted to finish his Ph.D. as quickly as possible because his wife still lived in China.Wang said unless the U.S. can find evidence of Zhao transmitting information he wasn't allowed to take, it's likely he will be offered some kind of plea deal and move back to China. This would be standard for someone facing this kind of accusation, Wang said.Like what you're reading? Support independent, award-winning college journalism on this site.

US.- Beijing says it will defend chinese companies' interests in the face of US pressure on TikTokCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 20, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 387 wordsBody    BEIJING, 20 (EUROPA PRESS)   China considers that the United States' accusations of Chinese companies such as TikTok, owned by ByteDance, alluding to an alleged national security risk "lack a factual or legal basis" and violate the principles of the market economy against what Beijing has expressed its readiness to defend the legitimate interests of Chinese companies.   China's Ministry of Commerce has long lamented that the United States has long resorted to 'national security' and 'national emergency' as reasons to restrict or even prohibit Chinese companies from making normal investments and business activities in the country by imposing vetoes on transactions with Chinese companies for unjustified reasons.   "There is no factual or legal basis, which seriously damages the legitimate rights and interests of companies and seriously violates the basic principles of the market economy. This is not good for China, it is not good for the United States and it is not good for the whole world," Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng said at a press conference.   In this regard, the Chinese official has warned that The measures taken by Washington will affect investor confidence in investing in the United States and has pointed out that China strongly opposes the political use and generalization of the review for national security reasons of investment.   "The Chinese government is determined to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of domestic companies," he said.   In this way, the Ministry's spokesman has urged the United States to abandon its bad practices, stop the unjustified repression of Chinese companies, and work toward economic and trade cooperation between China and the United States.   U.S. President Donald Trump on August 14 an executive order approving a 90-day deadline for ByteDance to end its operations in the country and get rid of the data. Trump accuses the app of exposing Americans to the risk of data theft or propaganda by the Chinese-born company.   Previously, the US representative had signed an executive order to ban business within 45 days with WeChat, a courier service company of the Chinese company Tencent, as well as the owner of TikTok. These pressures are in addition to those exercised against the activities of telecom equipment manufacturer Huawei.Load-Date: August 21, 2020End of Document

US sanctions 24 Chinese companies over South China Sea island buildingCNN WireAugust 27, 2020 Thursday 7:45 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 909 wordsDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  The United States government has imposed sanctions on dozens of Chinese companies for helping Beijing advance its territorial claims in the South China Sea -- the first punitive action of its kind over the disputed waters, and one that is almost certain to escalate tensions between the countries.In a statement Wednesday, the US Commerce Department said the 24 state-owned companies -- including several subsidiaries of the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) -- played a "role in helping the Chinese military construct and militarize the internationally condemned artificial islands in the South China Sea" and "must be held responsible."The companies will be added to the Commerce Department's Entity List, which restricts American firms from selling US goods and technology to them without a special license, according to the statement.Separately, the State Department announced Wednesday that it would impose visa restrictions on Chinese individuals "responsible for, or complicit in, either the large-scale reclamation, construction, or militarization of disputed outposts in the South China Sea, or the PRC's use of coercion against Southeast Asian claimants to inhibit their access to offshore resources."Under the restrictions, the individuals will not be allowed into the US, and their immediate family members may also be subject to restrictions. The State Department did not name the officials or specify how many of them are subject to the restrictions.Bilateral relations between Washington and Beijing have plunged to their lowest point in decades, following the coronavirus pandemic and ahead of the US presidential election in November. The Trump administration has previously sanctioned Chinese companies and officials over Beijing's crackdown on Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region, tightening control on Hong Kong and national security concerns over varying forms of advanced technology.But this is the first time the US government has taken punitive action against Chinese entities over the South China Sea -- years after Beijing started to accelerate its construction and militarization of artificial islands in the strategic waterway.The Chinese government has yet to comment on the decision.Since 2013, China has dredged and constructed more than 3,000 acres (12.1 square kilometers) across seven features in the South China Sea, which include air defense and anti-ship missile features, the Commerce Department statement said.In its statement, the state department said the CCCC "led the destructive dredging" of Beijing's South China Sea outposts and is also one of the leading contractors used by Beijing in its "Belt and Road" global infrastructure initiative.Other companies listed include Beijing Huanjia Telecommunication Company, Changzhou Guoguang Data Communications, Guangzhou Guangyou Communications Equipment Company, Shanghai Cable Offshore Engineering Company, Tianjin Broadcasting Equipment Company, and research institutes attached to China Electronics Technology Group Corporation and China Shipbuilding Group. "The entities designated today have played a significant role in China's provocative construction of these artificial islands and must be held accountable," said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in a statement. China claims almost all of the 1.3 million square mile, resource-rich waters as its sovereign territory, but they are contested by a handful of other governments in the region, including the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and the self-governing island of Taiwan.On Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian called the sanctions a gross interference in China's internal affairs and a violation of international law. "China's relevant construction on its own territory is entirely within the scope of sovereignty and has nothing to do with militarization. The participation of Chinese enterprises and individuals in the country's construction activities is reasonable and legal, and it is understandable. There is no reason for Chinese companies and individuals to participate in relevant illegal sanctions in their own country," said Zhao.The US doesn't have any claims in the waters, but has repeatedly conducted freedom of navigation operations aimed at challenging China's claims.Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared most of China's claims illegal. "Beijing's claims to offshore resources across most of the South China Sea are completely unlawful, as is its campaign of bullying to control them," he said in a statement. "The world will not allow Beijing to treat the South China Sea as its maritime empire. America stands with our Southeast Asian allies and partners in protecting their sovereign rights to offshore resources, consistent with their rights and obligations under international law."Home to vital shipping lanes, the South China Sea is widely deemed as a potential flashpoint for military conflicts between the US and China. The countries have recently stepped up military actions in the narrow waterway. Last month, the US Navy staged exercises involving two aircraft carrier strike groups in the South China Sea -- the first time it had done so in six years.This week, China launched three military exercises on Monday alone in Pacific waters, from the South China Sea in the south to the Bohai Sea in the north. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Chinese FM says visit to Europe carries 4 signalsStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeAugust 27, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MEDICINE; Pg. 1Length: 494 wordsByline: Samantha LongBodyChinese businesses like Huawei Technologies Co pose a threat to the West, Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Nathan Law said on a visit to Italy today, shortly before the Italian foreign minister was due to meet China's top diplomat.U.S. President Donald Trump blames Beijing for the spread of the disease, which emerged in China previous year.Noting that the outbreak in China is now effectively under control, Wang said China, as a member of the global village, stands ready to share anti-pandemic knowledge and experience, and provide necessary support so as to help Europe defeat the pandemic at an early date. This is the first foreign visit of the Chinese Foreign Minister since the Corona epidemic and aims to reduce the growing hatred againstBeijing in European countries.China and Italy are major countries responsible for world peace and development, so both countries should vigorously promote the process of multilateralism and trade liberalization, and maintain the safe operation of the global industrial chain and supply chain, said Wang.Huawei has denied allegations by the United States that it is a Trojan Horse for Chinese cyberspies andBeijing has criticised countries such as Britain and Australia, which have said they will shun the Chinese technology giant. "We do not let other countries do so to push their own private interests, damaging the interests of other nations". China recently has toned down its rhetoric against the US, and both sides this week reaffirmed their commitment to the phase-one trade deal. Europe is also struggling with Corona, along with China's diplomatic moves andBeijing sponsored fake news have also increased its problems. "To the extent there are distortions created by the U.S., China has the right to bring the situation back to normal".'West Wing' reunion episode to boost Michelle Obama's voter driveObama is the founder and a co-chairwoman of the organization that aims to help people register and to vote. Nearly all of the major cast members of the long-running show will be returning for the special episode.Wang said his visit is a continuation of China-Italy solidarity in fighting the coronavirus pandemic and marks the beginning of bilateral efforts to deepen cooperation in the post-pandemic era.Europe's strategic significance toBeijing has increased as relations with the USA deteriorate and Pompeo seeks to build an anti-China bloc of countries, according to a researcher at the government-affiliated Chinese Academy of Social Sciences who asked not to be identified due to rules for speaking with the media.Actually, this video was the propaganda of the Chinese government, to tell the world that China is providing medical aid to Italy and the Italians are very happy with it.China has sought to blame Pompeo for worsening ties with the US while appealing to a broader set of policymakers. "We have to continue following the consensus of our two heads of states". Wang's first stop was Italy.Load-Date: August 27, 2020End of Document

All eyes on the GOP night one at the Republican National Convention will kick off tonight in Charlotte, North Carolina.Tonight's theme, The Land of Promise, features Party heavy hitters like Donald Trump, Jr., Former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, Senator Tim Scott for South Carolina, Congressman Matt Gaetz from Florida and Jim Jordan and RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel all speaking this week.President Trump will be speaking in some capacity every night of the convention.

Shares of Facebook this morning are higher in the premarket as are many stocks, it's up about 1 percent.Time for the Word on Wall Street. Joining me right now is Bulltick Capital Markets Head of Global Research Kathryn Rooney Vera. Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney. And Michael Lee Strategy's Michael Lee. Great to see everybody this morning, thank you so much for joining us.We've got a pretty good rally underway, we're expecting a 300 point move right out of the gate this morning, extending a record run last week, but there are still concerns about valuations.Ken, your take on where we are in markets from a valuation standpoint?KEN MAHONEY, CEO MAHONEY ASSET MANAGEMENT: Look, the running of the bulls continue, right? And I know it's been very Apple-centric, right. We saw what happened last week and I think Apple's gone up 8 points this morning.But yes, you're seeing that, yes, it is a crowded trade right now between Amazon, Apple and Microsoft and so forth, but it's working and people are going to put money where it's working at the time.Yes, valuations are a stretch, but then again, when you have the 10 Year Treasury at 0.65, where else are you going to put your money? So, I think that's part of the reason there.A, it's -- you know -- money managers -- you know -- they're very bearish, you know, they need to keep up with the Jones, they need to add money to equities, whether they like the market or not, whether they like valuations or not, they need to keep up with the S&P 500. So, all those confluents, things come together, that's why we have this bull run that we're seeing here and again this morning.BARTIROMO: Well, you're right. I mean, they aren't a lot of alternatives when you've got zero percent interest rates elsewhere, where you going to get yields. Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell headlined the Fed's Annual Jackson Hole Symposium, that's happening this week. Powell is expected to speak out about the Fed's long awaited review of monetary policy framework.Kathryn, what are you expecting from Powell? He has already told us that these rates, like the 10 Year, are going to stay near rock bottom until 2024 at a minimum.KATHRYN ROONEY VERA, HEAD GLOBAL RESEARCH BULLTICK CAPITAL MARKETS: Yes Maria, I think Jay Powell is going to focus on the inflation targets. Are we going to move towards an average inflation rate?My expectation is that the Fed is going to take the 2 percent target as a minimum and is -- is excited to see inflation even pick up, let alone touch the 2 percent target. So, I think we should expect a dovish (inaudible), as a previous guest mentioned. Hey, this is working. Are we accumulating and fomenting a bubble? That's another question.Until inflation comes to the floor, Maria, then we have to stand this and we have to follow and try to get a step ahead of the Fed. What is the next thing the Fed is going to buy?BARTIROMO: So, do you think you want to still invest in stocks during the this Jackson Hole meeting and do you think that the markets -- will there be anything that changes what's out there or is this already prices in?VERA: I think it's largely priced in. Everyone, and -- and myself included, we expect the Fed to continue to be dovish. I think this is just going to double down on the dovishness of the Fed.As I said, until we get inflation we shouldn't expect anything other than free money, easy money, because it's working. There is no inflation yet, so I do expect the Fed to continue to buy assets and augment their asset purchases.If we get a leg down, Maria, and I expect -- my -- my basic view is that a 10 percent correction will cause the Fed to step in with a heavier hand, but the Fed is only buying 3 percent of its -- of its assets in high yield bonds, so that will be the next thing. I think you can get juicy yield from fallen angel bonds, you can get 7, 8 percent yield from bonds that have just recently lost their investment grade and that's going to be where the Fed buys next.BARTIROMO: Yes. All right, meanwhile, TikTok expected to sue the U.S. Government after President Trump's plans to block the app of force a sale. The Chinese owned social medial company is arguing that it's being unfairly labeled a security risk. Of course we know that the CEO of TikTok is an American citizen, used to be at Disney. Michael, your thoughts.LEE: Yes look, TikTok can sue whoever they want. It -- you know -- the fact of the matter still remains, that they are a Chinese spyware app. They're collecting data on teens and preteens for the most viral regime in history the Chinese Communist Party and the executive poses -- the executive branch poses broad authority when it comes to national security risks.So, they can sue -- they can sue, they can not sue, the fact of the matter is that -- you know -- TikTok, while popular amongst children, is a -- it's a disaster. So, I don't think this -- maybe this lawsuit will get some attraction, maybe it won't. It won't really matter in the end. It's either going to be shucked out or sold.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well -- well, we'll see. I mean, my question around this story has been, how many TikTok employees are going to go work at Microsoft, if Microsoft acquires this company, because the Chinese Communist Party has been very effective at getting data from the inside.They're identifying employees or sending employees in there to actually send data back to the CCP. So, it's very important to understand how any deal with an American company's going to -- going to take place.Kathryn Rooney Vera, Ken Mahoney, Michael Lee, it's great to see you. Thank you so much for the Word on Wall Street this morning.VERA: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Michael, you'll be with us all morning long. We are grateful. Coming up Trump 2020 Presidential Campaign Senior Advisor Jason Miller is here on the Republican National Convention, which kicks off today.I'll be speaking with Housing and Urban Development Secretary Dr. Ben Carson, one of the highlights this week he has breaking news on opportunity zones in America.And then in the 8:00 am hour Congressman Lee Zeldin his here talking about the U.S. Postal Service, the Postmaster General will testify before House lawmakers later today.Former Acting White House Chief of Staff and Former Office of Management and Budget Direct Mick Mulvaney here on President Trump's economic message.And COVID-19 impacting real estate, the New York market taking a big hit, worse than after September 11, and the 2008 Financial Crisis, we're going to talk about it.You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: And the countdown to 2020 is on, 70 plus days away from the election. The Republican National Convention will kick off today. Party heavy hitters taking the stage tonight, including Nikki Haley, Congressman Steve Scalise, Senator Tim Scott, President Trump is expected to speak in some capacity every night of the convention before accepting the big nomination with an important speech on Thursday.The GOP releasing its goals for a second term, including creating 10 million jobs in 10 months and developing a COVID vaccine by the end of the year. This is the president's second term agenda. The convention coming as White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway said that she's leaving the White House for personal reasons.Joining me right now is Trump 2020 Presidential Campaign Senior Advisor Jason Miller. Jason, it's great to have you this morning. Thank you so much for being here. What will be a success, from your standpoint, for the next four nights of the convention?JASON MILLER, SENIOR ADVISOR FOR TRUMP 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: Maria, good morning, thank you for having me on, on such a huge day, both a kick- off for the convention as well as the launch of our second term agenda for President Trump.I think going into to tonight and this week it's really going to be about telling the American story, telling the stories of the forgotten men and women that President Trump reached out to in 2016, showing not just what he's done for them over the first four years, but you can make the case that President Trump's done more for folks in American in the first four years than any other president in history, but also the vision looking ahead. And this is a key contrast, Maria, from last week this week.Last week was all about grievances and painting a divisive picture of America. This week you're going to see optimism, you're going to see a reason for people to come and support President Trump, even if they weren't with him in 2016, you'll see why we have so many people and it's going to completely change the perception of who is a Trump supporter, what it means to be a Trump supporter. There is a lot of excitement.BARTIROMO: So, go through the agenda for us, Jason. I think one of the important ones here, obviously jobs, creating 10 million jobs in 10 months, how is the president going to do that? And then, he also wants to cut taxes to boost take-home pay and keep jobs here in America. I know that he's talked a lot about moving supply chains back to America.MILLER: Absolutely, and this is one of the things with the agenda, it's very aggressive and I think a lot of folks last night, including the great one, Mark Levin chimed in and said it's one of the most aggressive and proactive agendas that they've seen in history.And at the top is jobs and that's where President Trump is really the jobs president. We talk about 10 million new jobs in 10 months. We're going to use tax credits, additional deregulation, additional tax cuts, different things to both create jobs that are here, we talk about a million new small businesses, obviously eradicating COVID-19, this is another key differential. I think Joe Biden wants to manage COVID-19, President Trump wants to eradicate it, that's a huge differential.But Maria, the point, and you talk about this every single day on the show, it's also about getting tough on China and stopping our reliance on China. This means bringing back a million manufacturing jobs from China, holding them accountable for what they did with the China virus.This is a key differential, but there are a lot of things to look -- go to DonaldTrump.com the website and check it out, but you're going to see President Trump holding the Chinese government's feet to the fire and really getting tough in a way that we haven't seen in generations.BARTIROMO: Yes, and -- and -- and the president goes through healthcare, education, draining the swamp and defending our police as also priorities for his second term, along with ending illegal immigration and protecting American workers. Is all of this resonating?Let's talk about the state of the 2020 race, Jason. This month's national poll from the "Wall Street Journal" and NBC News shows President Trump behind Joe Biden, ahead of the RNC trailing by nine points nationally. It is also worth noting however the same poll from that week during the 2016 election showed the same difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. What's your read on these polls?MILLER: Well, we're actually in better shape now than we were four years ago and I'm going to put on my kind of political nerd hat for just 20 seconds here and to explain to folks who are either A, at the office, or B, still at home getting ready for work.So first and foremost, when you look at the national polls, you've got to keep in mind that like this NBC "Wall Street Journal" that when you go from registered voters, which is what they sampled, to likely voters, President Trump picks up about four points. That's because Democrats run up the score in blue states like New York and California. Republicans run up the score in red states, say like, Georgia and Alabama.So, there's about a four point pick up there. Then when you look at the battleground states, the states we need to get to 270 versus the states -- or versus just overall nationally we close the gap further.And so, between closing it from registered to likelies and then also when you look at the battlegrounds as opposed to the national ballot, that can close up by as much as eight or nine points just on its own.Our internal polling shows this either leading or within the margin of error for every stat the president needs to get to 270. We've picked up about four points in the last two weeks. Rasmussen has the president over 51 right now. And so, our internal polling President Trump we think is winning, is in position today to win this thing. And to come out of that after the Democrats convention, pretty remarkable.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, the poll also finds that the president has maintained his support among white and Latino Americans. What about women, what about African-America community? How do you feel about the president resonating in those two areas?MILLER: Oh, very good. And you look at our, especially with our African- American supporters, the Black Voices for Trump, we've been opening up field offices all over the country, a great team there with Katrina Pierson and we talk about Gail Wilson and also Harrison Floyd, great, great team here at Trump Headquarters. I think we're up to -- I think we're in the neighborhood of like 18 or 19 regional offices all around the country.We -- and is -- and you're going to have Dr. Carson coming up here shortly to talk about opportunity zones and this is a great agenda, numbers also improving with suburban women as well. I tell you, Maria, the momentums on the president's side right now, we're pretty excited.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean I think school choice is -- is something that people want to hear more of. I know the president spoke about education, we'll be watching what he has to say about that as well.Jason, it's great to have this morning. Good luck. We will see you soon.MILLER: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Jason Miller. Coming up Senator Lindsey Graham sounding off, breaking news on "Sunday Morning Futures" yesterday. We want to show you the double standard at the FBI regarding the Trump and Clinton Campaigns. Lindsey Graham unveiling breaking news documents on that.Then, partying too hard, college students risking their academic lives if they do not tone it down. We're going to take a look. You're watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. What a double standard. Newly released declassified FBI documents, which we broke on "Sunday Morning Futures" showed that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were treated far differently during their 2016 presidential election campaigns.Senator Lindsey Graham told us about it yesterday on "Sunday Morning Futures."(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: In March of 2015 the FBI finds out about a plot by a foreign government to lobby her campaign and funnel millions of dollars into the Clinton campaign illegally. They open up an investigation in October of 2015 FBI personnel met with the Clinton campaign to tell her about the problem so she could fix it. They never issued the FISA warrant. That was the right way to do business.Forward to 2016, four counter intelligence investigations opened by the FBI against the Trump campaign. They never tell him about it so he can fix it. They used it as a way to spy Trump and they informed Clinton about the problem she was facing so she could fix it, the ultimate double standard.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Lee Carter -- Lee Carter is with us this morning. And Lee, what's your take on this? We knew that there was a double standard applied to the Trump and Clinton campaigns, but what really struck me there was that in March of 2015 the FBI found a foreign government trying to funnel millions of dollars into Hillary Clinton's campaign. You know, Lindsey Graham would not tell which country it was, that was top secret, but I -- other sources tell me that it's not China or Russia, it's a different country.But of course the FBI dealt with it differently. They told Hillary so that they wouldn't have to spy on her campaign and get a FISA warrant.CARTER: I mean, there's no question that people should be outraged at the double standard here. There's no question, that -- you know -- you've been talking about this for a long time, Lindsey Graham has been talking about this.We're learning new information all the time and it should be very, very upsetting to the American people that we're treating people of different parties in different ways, that we're treating people clearly with favoritism. And that's something that we need to deal with.The problem that I have with all of this though is that is complicated for people to understand what's really at play here. What we're looking at is - - in some ways this is a -- this is cronyism, in some ways this is playing favorites and I think that we need to get the message simplified in a way that people are going to understand why this is such a problem and really what's at stake here, because this is a big issue.BARTIROMO: Yes. It's -- it -- it is a big issue, which is really why I've been outraged by it from the moment I sniffed it out, because it's not fair to create a story about collusion and then get the media to drive the bus on it to get the whole country talking about it, but that is exactly what took place and it took place around a FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign and -- with -- because they said that they though that -- that Russia was trying to meddle.In fact, now learn that the same situation happened with Clinton and it was a different country, and yet they told Hillary, they said, look, there's somebody on your campaign who is trying to facilitate millions of dollars coming from this country into the campaign. So, what does she do, she fired him.And with Trump, they never told him anything, any -- anything that they were worried about, they just put four different investigations in place and started spying on the campaign. So, there you go.We'll see what happens with the John Durham investigation, that's a criminal investigation, we are expecting results coming up in the next couple of weeks. A.G. Barr told me that it should happen by Labor Day, so is that kind of things that you're weighting to see, Lee, where you're seeing accountability, so that people can understand what took place so that it doesn't happen again?CARTER: I think we need to see both the accountability, but I think we also have to come up with a better -- a better message summing up what the real issues is and what this means for our intelligence community and what this means for America.BARTIROMO: All right, we will keep watching this. It's an ongoing story until we do hear from John Durham, that's for sure. Coming up, Republicans are making their case this week.Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson is here. Dr. Carson will break news on opportunity zones, you don't want to miss it.And then Lori Loughlin has been sentences. The actress apologized after learning her fate for here role in the college admissions scandal. We're taking a look.You're watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, August 24th.A look at markets right here, 7:31 a.m. on the East Coast.Futures indicating a big gain at the start of trading this morning. The Dow futures up 286 points. The Nasdaq futures up 105. And the S&P futures higher by 29.Parlay (ph) on this. The FDA announcing emergency authorization for convalescent plasma. That to treat Covid-19 patients. That's helping lift some (INAUDIBLE) this morning. Markets finished in the green on Friday, so the momentum goes on. Friday, the S&P 500 saw its longest winning streak of the year. The Dow Industrials were up 190 points, the Nasdaq was up 46, and the S&P was up 11 and two-thirds.European markets are also higher this morning. Take a look. A firmer tone there as well with the FT 100 up 115, the CAC quarante up 111, and the DAX index higher by 306. The European indices up about 2 percent or more.In Asia overnight green across the board there as well, but Hong Kong was really the standout. The Hang Seng index up 1.75 percent overnight in Asia.Microsoft is weighing in on Apple's threat against the maker of "Fortnite."Cheryl Casone with those details now.Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That is right, Maria.Microsoft in a court filing says the entire video game industry will be hurt if Apple makes good on its threat to block Epic Game's developer account. Microsoft says the move would prevent it and other game developers from using Epic's Unreal Engine, which is used to make 3D graphics. Apple removed "Fortnite" and other Epic game titles from its App Store for violating its payment rules.Taking a look at Apple and Microsoft both in the pre-market. Apple up more -- almost 3 percent, folks. Microsoft up almost 1 percent.Well, the attorney general for the U.S. Virgin Islands reportedly will subpoena billionaire investor Leon Black as part of the investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein case. According to "The New York Times," the attorney general wants information related to Black's business dealings with the late convicted sex offender. The subpoena seeks financial statements and tax returns for Black and a number of organizations that are connected to him. Black is the co-founder and CEO of Apollo Global Management. That's a private equity firm.And finally this, a snag in remote learning. Schools could see a laptop shortage according to an Associated Press investigation. Lenovo, HP and Dell have told school districts they have a shortage of nearly 5 million computers. The companies blame supply chain disruptions and sanctions on China. These shortages could last up to several months. Want to do -- take a look at HP in the pre-market right now. It is up by more than 1 percent.And then, real quick, a look at Dell. There is the Lenovo and Dell stocks, as you can see comparison year-to-date performance on both of those. Nice little uptick at the end of the chart there, Maria.And those are your headlines.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you.Meanwhile, creating economic opportunity. The White House Council of Economic Advisors is releasing its analysis of opportunity zone investment. It shows over the past two years $75 billion of private capital has flowed into disadvantaged communities across the country.Joining me right now is Housing and Urban Development Secretary Dr. Ben Carson.Mr. Secretary, it's always great to see you. Thank you so much for being here.DR. BEN CARSON, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT SECRETARY: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Well, these are serious numbers flowing into the --CARSON: You know, your report is --BARTIROMO: Yes, go ahead.CARSON: Yes, it's very -- it's very serious. You know this $75 billion in two years is remarkable because as the program was put together, Secretary Mnuchin and his group predicted $100 billion over 10 years. We're talking $75 billion in just two years.The Council on Economic Advisors also predicts that that will lift 1 million people out of poverty. And you look at opportunity zones versus non-opportunity zones, from the second quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2019, 29 percent increase in economic investment in those areas. So it's having a profound effect. As far as property values are concerned, they go up 1.1 percent just with the announcement of you being in an opportunity zone. And it's predicted that 11 percent decrease in poverty in opportunity zones. So these things are actually working extremely well. They will continue to improve as time goes on. There's some who want to denigrate them and say all kinds of horrible things. You know, that's the society we live in today. But let the facts speak for themselves.BARTIROMO: Yes, I don't -- yes, I don't understand that. I mean these are really important areas that are lifting many boats.Tell me where these opportunity zones are, Dr. Carson, and also what areas of the population are they impacting most? Walk through the people who are actually feeling an impact and how.CARSON: Well, they're actually all over the -- all over the country. If you go to opportunityzones.gov and look at our best practices report to the president, you can see they're everywhere. For instance, in Delaware, a vertical farm was developed in opportunity zones designed purpose of employing people who are released from prison. And in January of this year they hired their first 10 and there will be many more coming after that.In Phoenix, Arizona, a convalescent center that was boarded up and pretty much forgotten about has been revitalized and is in the process of being completed, 96 beds, 80 high paying jobs for people who have behavioral disturbances, which generally we just leave out on the streets now, starting to address those kinds of issues.And so we're -- we're looking not only to people who are being served, you know, I was in Tampa, Florida, a few weeks ago, a 12-block area being completely revitalized with beautiful housing. And these are the kinds of things that the program was designed to do and is doing very well and will continue to do.BARTIROMO: So what can you tell us about the African-American vote today and the support for President Trump because I'm trying to understand whether or not this is resonating with -- with the minority community going into the election. Do you feel that it is? Do you feel that you see the support out there from those populations?CARSON: Well, a lot of people that I talk to in the African-American community have opened their eyes and, you know, are no longer just being dictated to. You know, I find it really fascinating that so many people want to accuse Republicans and the president of being racist. Real racism is when you look at somebody and you determine how they're supposed to think and how they're supposed to vote based on the color of their skin. I don't know what's more racist than that.But, you know, when you look at the things that are done, not the things that are promised or talked about, but what are the things that are done, then I think it becomes a real challenge for some of the traditional strongholds to say you must vote for us.BARTIROMO: Yes. What -- what do you mean in terms of -- in terms of -- I want to switch gears, Dr. Carson, and ask you about treating coronavirus. The Food and Drug Administration, we've been talking this morning about granting emergency authorization for convalescent plasma treatment for hospitalized Covid-19 patients. Meanwhile in -- in a new (INAUDIBLE) report from the "Financial Times" says that the White House is looking to fast track AstraZeneca's Covid vaccine ahead of the November election.Dr. Carson, you obviously are a pioneer in neurosurgery, but I want to get your take on -- on what we're seeing and what we could see out there in terms of, I don't know, supplements or -- there are natural supplements also being talked about out there, Aliandrid (ph), and I want to get your take on where we are in terms of vaccines and treatment for the coronavirus.CARSON: Well, I think the president's announcement yesterday was very important. You know, we've known about the benefits of convalescent plasma for more than a century and it's been used effectively in many cases. Are there some risks? Of course there are, the same kind of risk as you would have with doing a blood transfusion. But you can sit there and you can concentrate on the risk and you can say, oh, you know, somebody can have a reaction and -- an anaphylactic reaction and they can die or -- or this thing is poison or that -- I mean, or you can say, you know, we're smart people, let's figure out how we do this, not how we don't do it, but how do we do it.We're in the midst of a pandemic. And the important thing about the president's announcement yesterday is that it appears that the FDA is ready to take a different attitude and, you know, rather than just sitting in the corner and being like a scared little person, saying, let us use our knowledge and our expertise to find ways to do appropriate testing. We're not saying things just need to come out and be utilized in the public. We're saying, things need to go through the testing process. And if you have evidence that, you know, something is not very dangerous, it may have some tiny risk, but not very dangerous, and there's anecdotal evidence that it's extremely effective, you need to get on-board --BARTIROMO: Yes.CARSON: And start testing that immediately so that we can get the kind of results that allow people to utilize it.BARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, when we have spoken before, we've talked about the shutdown and a lot of open real estate out there because companies now may not need that 60 floor building and they may not need, you know, all of this space in terms of commercial real estate for people coming back because a lot of the employees don't want to go back the way that they were.CARSON: That's correct.BARTIROMO: As HUD secretary, what are you looking at in terms of all of this extra real estate? Do you believe that there are other uses? The last time we spoke you had said, well, we could even see low income housing.Tell me how you're looking at a lot of available real estate today given this shutdown.CARSON: Well, you know, interestingly, after every pandemic there are big changes that occur in a society. And that will be the case with this one as well because we've learned a lot of things in terms of distal working, distal meeting, education. And that will impact the way that -- that spaces are utilized, including large office spaces. And many organizations, construction companies, et cetera, are already talking about this. And the government, the federal government, will be quite willing to work with them in order to facilitate that.BARTIROMO: To -- to facilitate housing for -- for the low income communities in some of this available real estate?CARSON: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: All right.CARSON: And, you know, you get rid of a lot of the questions about, you know, crowding, et cetera.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, because you've got homelessness that's rising in so many cities that we've been talking about so much. Look at New York. Look at San Francisco. I mean there's a serious need, worse than ever now.CARSON: Absolutely. And this is the time to address it. You know, we actually have more money dedicated to it right now. If we don't have to use it, you know, all of it to keep people from -- from being evicted, which means we need to get the economy rolling again.BARTIROMO: Yes.CARSON: And that is such a key factor right now. We have the ability to do it. Do we have the will to do it? Yes. And we have to be courageous and move forward and get it done and stop being afraid.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. We'll be watching you this week at the RNC, Secretary.Thanks very much for joining us.Secretary Ben Carson right here.CARSON: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: We'll be right back.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Actress Lori Loughlin is now headed to prison. The "Full House" star sentenced to two months after pleading guilty in the college admissions cheating scandal. Loughlin's husband was sentenced to five months behind bars for his role in paying $500,000 in bribes to help get their daughters into the University of Southern California as rowing recruits. Joining us right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano.Judge, will the coronavirus keep them from serving time? What's your take on this?JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Well, I don't know if the coronavirus will. It's going to depend on the sort of checklist that the Bureau of Prisons has, Maria, in which they check off, you know, what is the percentage of infections in the -- in the prison, has anybody died, what is our ability to keep it clean, where did the new prisoners come from. My guess is, for a short -- relatively short term, given the average length of federal sentences, two months, that she will not get out early because of coronavirus. So two months means 85 percent of two months. So you're talking about six -- six or seven weeks.BARTIROMO: What -- what about this TikTok battle, Judge? TikTok reportedly set to sue the Trump administration today over its proposed ban on the Chinese-owned social media giant.Do they have a strong case?NAPOLITANO: Well, they do. I mean the argument that they've made, Maria, is that there's been no due process, meaning the government has just made a determination that because they are owned by a Chinese company, therefore the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party has access to the data of Americans who use TikTok. So the lawyers for TikTok, in my view, are making a very -- a very strong and rational argument, which is the government has to prove its case.So this is the rare case where the plaintiff doesn't have to prove the case, the defendant does. So when TikTok sues the Department of Treasury, actually, which is the department that licenses them, it will be the burden of the DOJ representing the Department of Treasury to prove not only that the Chinese government and the Communist Party have access to the data, but in fact that they have acquired the data. TikTok says it hasn't happened and therefore it can't be proven. So it will be a very interesting case.Prediction. Some American company that we all know and we know the names of the potential bidders will buy TikTok before the litigation gets going and this will go away and the TikTok users will be happy.BARTIROMO: They'll be happy but we'll see how many TikTok employees go work for that company, whether it's Microsoft or Oracle or anybody else. That's the concern I've been raising, Judge, because China has been real effective at going inside and stealing from the inside with employees who work there. So we'll see about that.NAPOLITANO: Yes.BARTIROMO: It's under -- it's under consideration, I guess, that the president's looking at, right?NAPOLITANO: Well, the president's concerns are very legitimate and profound.BARTIROMO: Yes.NAPOLITANO: China has been stealing things from us for years. Now they're going to be stealing individual American's personal, private data.BARTIROMO: Yes.NAPOLITANO: The president has a duty to -- to prevent that. But the courts, of course, have to make sure that that duty was exercised properly and not politically.BARTIROMO: All right.Judge, thank you so much. Judge Andrew Napolitano. We'll see you soon, sir. Thank you.We will be right back.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Time for the "Morning Buzz."First up, stop partying or leave. Northeastern University is warning students large gatherings could lead to being kicked out of campus housing or even expelled.Michael, do you see this happening?MICHAEL LEE, MICHAEL LEE STRATEGY: Oh, look, Maria, this is -- I have no idea how they're going to enforce this. This is an insane policy. These are college kids. If I was returning to school right now, I don't know that I could pay to go to college with these types of restrictions. I also think it's ridiculous by the university. You're something like 30 or 40 times more likely if you're between the ages of 18 and 35 to die of a car accident versus the coronavirus. I actually think the Beastie Boys wrote a song about this, you've got to fight for your right to party.BARTIROMO: Oh, boy. Yes, you do. You have to fight for it.Next up, Roger Goodell is taking a step back. Lee, the NFL commissioner says that he should have had listened earlier to players kneeling during the national anthem. Goodell acknowledged during an interview that he wishes he knew back then what was going on in communities.Michael, your take?LEE: Yes, Maria, Roger Goodell gets a lot of flak for good reason. He's the mouthpiece for 32 eccentric billionaires. So you have a league that's a majority African-American, where you've got a lot of players that are young men that have worked very hard to get to where they got to that feel strongly about kneeling for the anthem. And then the other side of this is the NBA's ratings are absolutely collapsing. It's been devastating. In sports, it's been go woke, go broke. So he's in a very difficult situation to try to manage everybody right now. I think that's why he makes over $40 million a year. I do not envy this situation. It's going to be really interesting when the NFL opens up.BARTIROMO: Yes, it is.Finally, snacking around the world. Lay's inspired by the flavors of popular destinations, bringing the world to you by way of its famous chips. You can win one of the four new snacks and imagine yourself somewhere far, far away.Lee, do you want to try this?LEE CARTER, POLLSTER AND PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS: I sure do.I've got to say, one of the things that -- I worked for a potato chip company and one of the things that we got to do when we traveled around the world was taste all the local flavors and they are so, so interesting because you don't realize that these big companies go local and really make flavors to go to local tastes. And so I would encourage everyone to try and get a bag.BARTIROMO: I like it.All right, still ahead, Covid-19 hits real estate. The New York market takes a plunge. We've got all the details next hour right here.MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.Load-Date: August 24, 2020End of Document

Q&A: What's up with Trump's orders on TikTok and WeChat?Associated Press Financial WireAugust 8, 2020 Saturday 1:49 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 1349 wordsByline: TALI ARBEL, AP Technology WriterDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump has ordered sweeping but vague ban on dealings with the Chinese owners of popular apps TikTok and WeChat, saying they are a threat to U.S. national security, foreign policy and the economy.But it's far from clear what the administration intends to actually do when the bans take effect in 45 days, since the orders are currently blank checks waiting to be filled in. Uncertainty also surrounds what effect the orders will have on the apps' users, whether the administration will face legal challenges over its authority to ban consumer apps, and what the companies — or China — will do next. Microsoft is in talks to buy parts of TikTok, in a potential sale that's being forced under Trump's threat of a ban.Here's what's at stake:Q: WHAT ARE THESE COMPANIES?A: TikTok, owned by ByteDance, is an increasingly popular video app with 100 million U.S. users and hundreds of millions globally. It has a fun, goofy reputation, full of people lip-syncing, dancing and pulling pranks, and is exceptionally easy to use. Like other social-media companies, it has raised concerns about the privacy of its users and how it moderates content. It has spawned an influencer culture of its own and nurtured music hits; Facebook and Snapchat see it as a competitive threat.Tencent’s WeChat is a critical communications and payments service in China and with Chinese emigrants abroad, with 1.2 billion users globally. It doesn't break out U.S. users, but mobile research firm Sensor Tower estimates 19 million downloads in the U.S. since 2014.But Tencent is intertwined with other major U.S. entertainment brands. It owns Riot Games, publisher of hit video game League of Legends, and has a big stake in Epic Games, the company behind video game phenomenon Fortnite. It also has a streaming deal with the NBA.Q: WHAT WOULD THE ORDERS DO?A: The first thing they've done is to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo earlier this week said that “we want to see untrusted Chinese apps removed from U.S. app stores.” The vague wording of the orders, which prohibit “any transaction” under U.S. jurisdiction with either Tencent or ByteDance, could be interpreted to support an app-store ban and other measures, experts said. It's not clear how it would apply to Tencent's other properties and partnerships.We'll presumably know more in 45 days.Q: WHY IS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CRACKING DOWN ON TIKTOK AND WECHAT?It’s driven by concerns over collection of American users’ data and longstanding complaints about Chinese business tactics, according to two White House officials not authorized to speak publicly about private deliberations. Trump had long taken aim at TikTok but the move against WeChat was an escalation.But the picture is more complicated than just that. Trump's frustration over the coronavirus pandemic and China also drove his actions, the officials said. He has blamed the outbreak on Beijing and questioned whether China’s leaders purposefully failed to contain it to spread economic disaster to other nations. He also has privately raged against China, blaming the nation for hurting his re-election chances and expressing no desire for a further trade deal.Trump ignored questions about the executive orders from reporters on the tarmac after deplaning in advance of a three-day weekend at his Bedminster club.Q: ARE THE ORDERS LEGAL?It would be difficult for the government to stop people from using WeChat and TikTok — there are workarounds even if they're removed from app stores — and it's not clear the president has a legal basis to do so under the powers cited in the orders, experts said. Moreover, civil-rights groups said a ban raises First Amendment concerns.“Selectively banning entire platforms harms freedom of speech online and does nothing to resolve the broader problem of unjustified government surveillance, including by our own government,” said Hina Shamsi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's National Security Project, in an emailed statement.TikTok says it will “pursue all remedies” and suggested it would sue to ensure the company and its users are “are treated fairly.”Q: DO I NEED TO DELETE TIKTOK FROM MY KID'S PHONE?A: Not as a result of the Trump administration's actions, though you might want to take a closer look anyway.TikTok, like most other social networks, collects data about its users and moderates what’s posted. It grabs people’s locations and messages they send one another, for example, and tracks what people watch in order to know what kinds of videos they like and how best to target ads to them. U.S.-based platforms do much the same thing, so deleting TikTok but leaving Snapchat, for instance, might not change things much.But the administration and some scholars worry that China can force its companies to help the government gather intelligence. In the case of TikTok, this remains a hypothetical threat, said Samm Sacks, a researcher at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center — but she acknowledges that it could be happening.TikTok says U.S. user data isn't stored in China and that it wouldn't hand it over. But experts believe said that if the Chinese government wants information, it will get it. The U.S. government has also cracked down on Chinese telecom companies Huawei and ZTE because of this worry. The companies deny that they facilitate spying.There are also concerns about TikTok censoring videos critical of China, which TikTok denies, and pushing propaganda. Advocates in the U.S. also say the company is violating children’s privacy laws.WeChat, meanwhile, is censored within China. The Citizen Lab internet watchdog group in Toronto says WeChat monitors files and images shared abroad to aid its censorship in China.Q: IS THE ALLEGED CHINESE THREAD FROM TIKTOK AND WECHAT UNIQUE?A: No. China’s economic espionage is a well-known constant, and the Chinese military or groups with ties to it are accused of massive hacks of sensitive information from the credit agency Equifax and the federal Office of Personnel Management.The U.S. government has also raised user data concerns about Huawei, a maker of smartphones and network equipment that is China’s first global tech brand. It has moved to cut off access to chips and other technology for Huawei, banned U.S. government funds being used on its equipment and pushed allies not to use it. The government has also blocked China from purchasing several U.S. companies.But several experts say that the U.S. government is lashing out at Chinese tech companies without taking other significant steps to protect Americans’ privacy.Meanwhile, the Trump administration has been embroiled in a tariff war with Beijing over its technology ambitions. And election-year politics in the U.S. may be raising the stakes. Trump appears to be using friction with China to drum up voter support.Q: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?A: The U.S. government is effectively forcing ByteDance, TikTok’s owner, to sell so it can salvage the app in the U.S., a huge and valuable market. TikTok is in talks with Microsoft, which has said it intends to complete discussions by Sept. 15.Q: DO U.S. TECH COMPANIES STAND TO BENEFIT FROM PRESSURE ON CHINESE APPS?A: Could be. Users could step back from TikTok and focus more on Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube or other apps. Facebook rolled out a TikTok clone on its Instagram service this week — interesting timing.If Microsoft does end up buying some or all of TikTok, it would get a fast-growing app with younger users, a whole new consumer business. But some analysts are skeptical of what Microsoft can do with a product that's so different from its core workplace business.And there is speculation that Facebook could point to a Microsoft purchase of TikTok to say that there is more social-media competition in the U.S., relieving antitrust pressure on itself.___AP reporters Jonathan Lemire in Bridgewater, N.J., Barbara Ortutay in Oakland, Calif., Mae Anderson in New York, Frank Bajak in Boston, Joe McDonald in Beijing and Zen Soo in Hong Kong contributed to this article.Load-Date: August 7, 2020End of Document

RINEHART: Don't Ban TikTok Before A Public TrialThe Daily CallerAugust 12, 2020 Wednesday 07:17 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: OPINIONLength: 828 wordsByline: Will Rinehart, Contributor, wiLLriNEhaRT32485327482@yahoo.comBodyLink to ImageEditor's note: We endeavor to bring you the top voices on current events representing a range of perspectives. Below is a column arguing that the U.S. should not ban TikTok until definitive proof of wrongdoing can be found. You can find a counterpoint here, where James Carafano, vice president of the Heritage Foundation, argues that the U.S. should take a more aggressive approach to limit TikTok's cooperation with the Chinese government.On August 6, the White House gave TikTok's parent company in Beijing, ByteDance, 45 days to sell off the social media app or face a ban in the United States. Hours later, the Trump administration also dropped an executive order on Tencent, banning the WeChat app from phones with a similar deadline. Both are being targeted for their data practices.Those in favor or opposed to the executive order on TikTok have created a false choice between an outright ban and doing nothing. This is wrong. There are a range of options the administration could take, but they all must begin with defining the clear harms caused by TikTok. We need the whole picture before outlining appropriate remedies.According to the executive order, TikTok poses three kinds of risk. The administration accuses the Chinese government of using the app to collect data that might be used to track federal employees and blackmail them, censoring content that could be damaging to the Chinese Communist Party,and using the app in disinformation campaigns.As for the claims around tracking and data collection, some reports suggest that TikTok is sending encrypted information back to China. This is known as exfiltration, and it is a serious charge. However, there is hardly enough evidence to convict.French security researcher Elliot Alderson conducted a deep dive on these logs and found nothing unusual, saying, “in its current state, TikTok doesn't have a suspicious behavior and is not exfiltrating unusual data.” He continued, “we would obtain similar results with Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram and others.”The other two charges laid in the executive order against TikTok are more subtle, but are just as serious. Yet, close watchers of TikTok are skeptical of the claims of censorship in the United States. Analyst Eugene Wei noted, “I tend to think that problem is overrated because my sense is that many in China still don't understand the nuances of American culture, just as America doesn't understand theirs.”Rather, the evidence suggests the company is focusing more on privacy and transparency. Last month, it pulled out of Hong Kong because it didn't want to comply with China's censorship standards and requests for data. The company has also reinstated videos condemning Beijing's crackdown on Muslims that were wrongfully taken down. Last week, TikTok announced that they are disclosing their algorithms, moderation policies and data flows to regulators for review. If the White House wanted to investigate the company to see if they were censoring content and waging disinformation campaigns, TikTok would hand over the evidence.While those in favor of banning TikTok highlight the benefits, there are clear downsides as well. For one, banning apps like WeChat and TikTok close off American companies from foreign markets. One recent report estimates that Apple would suffer 25-30 percent decline in global sales if these apps were not available. Moreover, the White House would likely be entangled in undoing years of deals between Tencent and the startup ecosystem where it has invested billions. Finally, the move would embolden techno-nationalist voices within China to take even harder stances on the United States.Most importantly, banning TikTok removes the soft influence that the U.S. market could play in shaping one of the most valuable tech companies in the world. In fact, the company seems to be struggling to pull itself away from its Chinese roots. All of the small shifts to capture the large international market have caused a backlash in China, where the founder is routinely called “a traitor of China, a coward, and an American apologist.”At a gut-level, the move by the White House feels satisfying. Finally, the president is doing something to curb Chinese overtures on the Internet. But the ban does little to push back on the actual rights violations by the Chinese government. Instead, the president should be more forceful in calling out China for surveilling and oppressing Uighurs, while also showing more support for protestors in Hong Kong that are crying out for democracy and freedom.While Trump can make a strong argument that he has the legal authority to enforce a ban, it is not prudent. What separates the United States from China is that we rely on open debate and due process. We should find more proof of wrongdoing. Thoughtful, targeted responses are needed, not blanket bans.Will Rinehart is a senior research fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University. Graphic Indian mobile users browses through the Chinese owned video-sharing 'Tik Tok' app on a smartphones in Amritsar on June 30, 2020. - TikTok on June 30 denied sharing information on Indian users with the Chinese government, after New Delhi banned the wildly popular app citing national security and privacy concerns.

So stay with us for that.Now business first, Disney reporting mixed earnings after a rough quarter, jolted by the coronavirus pandemic of course. The company most notably seeing a $5 billion loss in revenue largely due its park shutting down. Take a look, as you can see the numbers there obviously below expectations as well. This as Disney is reporting a 100 million Disney+ subscribers and the promise of a new streaming service.Joining me right now to talk more about that is Mainstay Capital Management CEO and Chief Investment Strategist David Kudla and CFRA Research Media & Entertainment Analyst Tuna Amobi. Great to see you guys. Thanks so much for being here. Tuna, let me kick this off with you, your reaction to the to the Disney quarter, is this what you expected obviously with this pandemic?TUNA AMOBI, MEDIA & ENTERTAINMENT ANALYST, CFRA RESEARCH: Good morning, Maria. It was a really-really interesting quarter, right. So they missed on the revenue line and they outperformed on the bottom-line EPS number, a couple of things here. So we knew going in that theme parks was going to take a major hit from COVID-19 and also the studio as a result of the theater shutdowns domestically and internationally.The surprise though, to us, which more or less was an accounting thing that media networks actually had $1 billion higher operated income, which was primarily due to the deferral of programming costs, both on the entertainment side and on the sports side with the shutdown of live sports. These costs would be kind of incurred in future quarters. But all in all, more than anything else Maria, I think it underscored the pivoting that Disney has been doing toward direct-to-consumer platforms.As you alluded to, the milestone hundred million for the free streaming platforms, and then actually something more interesting that we saw, kind of the Mulan film being released into Disney+ as a pay-per-view offering. This is quite revolutionary in terms of how the windows are changing and this has been catalyzed by the COVID-19, where a lot of the studios, Disney taking the lead here to kind of going out to release this marquee title into their streaming.And then, also the $5 billion impairment that they took in the international channels underscores this shift to streaming. And lastly I might add, the launch of Star branded international direct-to-customer to kind of house all of their adult focused brands was actually another major announcement that we saw. So all in all, a lot of interesting things, take- aways.BARTIROMO: Yes. I think it's really important that you mentioned this live action, Mulan film skipping theaters all together in September, going straight to digital. Do you think that this is going to indicate the future? Many people are balking at the $29.99 price tag. Tuna?AMOBI: Indeed, Maria. So it's something that we certainly did not see coming but as you alluded to, the price tag seems pretty steep. This has been offered in countries where they can integrate that into the Disney+ platform, while also in other countries where theaters are open, they're still going ahead to release the title.And while Disney has couched this as an experiment, I think there is every chance that it could actually portend a trend. Look at Universal and AMC for example, agreeing to shorten the theatrical window. So we see a lot of studios experimenting with different release dynamics as a result of this COVID-19.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's true. And that would be understandable. Let's talk technology for a second. David, tech on a tear, NASDAQ closing at another record yesterday, 30th record of the year. Broader markets boosted by gains in technology as well and hopes for a new round of coronavirus relief. You've got the NASDAQ up at 10,941 right now.Apple meanwhile is nearly nearing $2 trillion in valuation, David. It is set for a 4:1 stock split. What's your take on technology?DAVID KUDLA, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MAINSTAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Well, it was believed by many investors, many analysts for a very long time that big cap tech was a house of cards ready to fall, and what we've seen as the tech continues to go and go and go. And it really, what we say is, tech is eating the world. When we look around at the companies who continue to prosper and whether that's in e-commerce, whether that's in internet stocks, retailers - the larger retailers, e-commerce, they are enabled by technology or technology companies themselves.And these are companies that have solid balance sheets. They have great cash flows. We see money continue to flow to those stocks in the markets. Valuations are stretched, but they've been stretched for a long time and when we look at the secular growth story for a lot of the technology names, it is the place where we want to be. If we look at during the pandemic, they became a defensive sector during the pandemic, holding up well during the initial stages of the lockdown and their secular growth stories is causing them to continue to lead in this market upturn.BARTIROMO: Yes, I get the secular growth story. Here we go in a pandemic shutdown and the digital economy is just penetrating even more. But David, would you put new money into tech today given these valuations? I mean a lot of people look at Apple and say, "Well, it's still cheap compared to what the earnings growth potential is." I know all names are not the same within tech, but are there areas that you would invest today? New money?KUDLA: Yes, I would and I know when you look at some of these names and look at some of the valuations, you struggle with it from a fundamental analysis, but if you look at the growth story that's there and you look at where else we can invest today, we see value stocks have their day in the sun every once in a while. We'll see a brief leadership, but you take the last quarter, the growth index had its best quarter in 40 years. And we continue to see growth, continue to outperform because secular growth stories are outperforming cyclical growth stories in environment like this. That takes us right back to technology names. That's where we want to be.BARTIROMO: Alright, we will leave it there. David Kudla, great to see you. Tuna Amobi, great to see you as well. Please come back soon, gentlemen, thank you so much talking about the stories of the morning. And we are just getting started this morning.Coming up, join us, we've got a big rest of the show.

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton is discussing the Kodak investigation as well as investing in Chinese companies. And then a big surprise. Some of you may already know what it is, but for those who don't, stick around. I've got some news for you. You're watching Mornings with Maria, live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Rising tensions between the United States and China, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar leading a high-level visit to Taiwan. It is the first visit by U.S. cabinet official in six years. The U.S. and China agreed to meet later this month to review the implementation of that Phase 1 Trade Deal.Joining me right now to talk more about that is The Daily Wire writer Ian Haworth. And Ian, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us. Well, things are certainly getting tough between the U.S. and China at this point, but I guess China did buy that $200 billion in commodities, soybeans that it had promised the United States. Where are we in your view?IAN HAWORTH, WRITER, THE DAILY WIRE: Well, I think the important thing to think about whenever we talk about China, is to look at them in the context of their recent history. I think it's very easy to get distracted with certain instances of the news. For example, TikTok is in the news, people are talking about whether or not we should force them to sell it or to close it down due to spying concerns.What we've got to think about is the fact that the Chinese Communist Party is an evil regime. It's a dictatorship that doesn't care about human rights, and we need to be approaching our relationship with them with that in mind. And in my view, retreating from that regiment we have with them, time after time, we've learned this lesson, they are simply not to be trusted on the world stage. I think coronavirus has shown us that.And so whenever I talk about China, yes, they might follow through with one deal here or there. It's within their interest to follow through. But I think we've got to make sure that we do not forget that quite frankly, they're an evil dictatorship and buying some amount of soybeans doesn't change that.BARTIROMO: That is exactly right, Ian. I could not agree further because the truth is, as we've seen evidence over and over again of this steady intellectual property theft, which the CCP just refuses to even admit. So how do you see a relationship or a partnership, a business partnership taking place over the long term, if it's pretty clear at this point that 40 years of engagement has not worked?HAWORTH: I simply don't really see it happening. I think the Chinese government have shown their hand over and over and over again. And really it's a matter of globalist naivety that we keep falling for it. I mean again, to go back to the coronavirus, the coronavirus is the Chinese government's fault. I think especially in the United States, there's a lot of arguments over who to blame, whether it's state governments, federal governments, the Democrats are doing mental back-flips to try and blame Trump for every single thing that has happened to do with coronavirus. But ultimately, it's because the Chinese government kept it under wraps for so long. They forced journalists into silence. Some people even disappeared. This is a brutal regime.And so when we consider that every element of Chinese life including media, including businesses, are only allowed to exist with the express permission of the Communist Party, I don't really see how we can in good conscience work with them. Especially if you look at the human rights abuses right now, China is the world's largest producer of cotton and in the region where 84% of China's cotton is produced are these Uyghur concentration camps.BARTIROMO: That's right.HAWORTH: And so if we, especially with a lot of the work protests going on to do with Black Lives Matter and systematic racism, Chinese government exemplifies that. And yet a lot of people don't really care because ultimately it comes down to people like cheap sneakers, they like cheap clothes, they like cheap electronics. We as a country and consumers need to make that decision because money will out. I think the NBA has shown that too. So to answer your question, I don't really see a relationship growing or flourishing, if we are able to look ourselves in the mirror at the end of the day.BARTIROMO: Well, what's going on with the Democrats? It seems that every time Kevin McCarthy asks to bring a bill to the floor, Nancy Pelosi will not do it, bring a bill to the floor to keep China accountable. And I continue to hear, in fact, I heard it again yesterday, speaking with a very high up insider who told me that the CCP is in constant motion, trying to influence policy at every turn, local elections, mayors, and congressmen, and congresswomen, sitting Congress today. So how worried should we be that the CCP is trying to influence our sitting congressmen and women, right now, as they try to influence policy?HAWORTH: Well, I think we should be very worried and we should assume that they're doing so. I'm not really surprised; China is involved in so many areas of world life. If you think about their actions in the internet, their actions through various companies spying. We just had a Consulate in Houston that was shut down for spying.So the notion that they're lobbying and pushing people in government for the policies they wish isn't really a surprise. The issue with the Democrats is, due to, in a lot of cases, Trump derangement syndrome, they're more focused on 2020 than anything else. So the fact that we have who should be our number-one global enemy, China, where we should have a bipartisan agreement that we need to change our relationship with them, the Democrats are far more focused on maintaining power in 2020, on hiding the fact that Joe Biden is a terrible candidate who can barely put a sentence together by blaming Trump for literally everything that is wrong in the world, whether it's his fault or not.Again, bringing it back to the coronavirus. I think it's a perfect example of, there are legitimate criticisms of Trump when it comes to the coronavirus, but ultimately it's China's fault. But if you were to ask a Democrat that, you would never even think that China had put a step wrong. It's quite horrendous to me really (ph).BARTIROMO: That's right. And you recently wrote a piece comparing this to 1930s, Nazi Germany. We'll talk more about that. Ian, please come back soon. Thanks very much. Ian Howard, joining us there. We'll be right back. Stay with usBARTIROMO: Welcome back now, this is Fox Business alert, Teladoc Health and Livongo announcing a merger and deal valued at $18.5 billion. The headquarters will be located in New York and the deal will be completed by the end of 2020. The stocks, as you can see, are active. You've got Teladoc down one-and-a-third percent and Livongo Health up two-and-a-third percent on this news. Of course, we know that telemedicine has been penetrating even further through this pandemic.Meanwhile there's this, the stimulus showdown continues in Washington. Lawmakers are inching toward the next round of coronavirus stimulus. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saying that he is willing to support extending the $600 unemployment bonus that just expired. President Trump already supporting that plan. McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi meanwhile weighed in yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): What we're hoping for here is a bipartisan proposal. We're ready to help and hopefully we can, as other speakers have pointed out, get rid of the trillion dollars that's unrelated to the problem.REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): This takes time and it takes specificity and we call each other back, with you bringing more of your information tomorrow, we'll be more aware so that we have a clearest understanding of what is going to be in the bill and what the consequences are.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Let's talk about this and the consequences. Dagen McDowell, I want to get your take. But first, let me welcome back to the program, The Wall Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor James Freeman. Good morning, James. Great to have you back.JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Good morning Maria, great to be here, great to be back.BARTIROMO: Yes, let's talk about stimulus. Dagen, it looks like they're going to have to get something done. They're leaving for recess at the end of the week; they've got to come together in the next two days. What do you think?MCDOWELL: The Republicans did drag their feet in addressing this issue with the $600 extra per week pay by the federal government expiring at the end of the month. The Democrats stepped up in May to pass $3.5 trillion plan. So, the Republicans are back on their heels, but clearly the Democrats are not going to go for just a fix for the $600 in unemployment benefits.The Democrats stopped an effort by two senators trying to pass narrow legislation last week, again, extending this extra benefit through the end of the year, albeit smaller. Martha McSally, the Senator tried to do it for a week. A no go from the Democrats on that because the goal here is to load up that pork pie. This isn't going to be a trillion dollars; it's going to be trillions of dollars in state aid, an aid to reopening schools.Even if the schools don't reopen, there is billions and billions of dollars that was allocated earlier in the year in an earlier stimulus that has not been spent. That is not going to stop the Democrats from trying to dole out billions more.BARTIROMO: Yes, and the argument, James, was that the $600 a week was allowing people to make more money staying home than they were making on the job. But, the Democrats will not give. So it looks like the Republicans are going to have to agree to extending the $600 a week. What do you say?FREEMAN: Yes, those sound bites you played, the two parties are sounding a lot more friendly with each other right now and I think that's bad for taxpayers and for the economy. As you said, you want incentives for people to work. If it pays more to stay home, you're going to see what we've seen to this point, which is a lot of small businesses who want to operate, who can operate, have difficulty finding workers because the benefits are above what they would make in the market.So, I think we need to get people back to work and we also don't want to give states' mayors, governors any financial incentive to maintain lockdowns. We want to have all the incentives going in the direction of maintaining the economy, which is the wealth that ultimately provides for all our healthcare.BARTIROMO: And Mattie, some people I think running some of these cities and states would like the economy to be shut down in 90 days because you've got a Presidential Election, and they'd like to just associate Donald Trump with shutdown, chaos, all bad things going into the election.MATTIE DUPPLER, PRESIDENT, FORWARD STRATEGIES: Maria, you're right. There's absolutely a political angle here, but Dagen is also correct in saying that Republicans in a unified posture in order to get us to The Election where Republicans can show they have a steady hand here. We are not out of the coronavirus infection yet. And that is really what's keeping a lot of the employment picture to be uncertain.So, I think the Republicans need to claim victory on the UI extension here. Whatever the amount is, I think they need to move past that, what they need is to get in writing a transition off of that extended federal insurance, so Democrats can continue to hold over Republicans' head when the expiration comes at the end of the year whenever that may be.MARIA BARTIROMO, ANCHOR, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: All right, let's take a short break, when we come back, we've got to get into President Trump taking his fight over mail-in voting to court. We will talk about it. Then Southwest warning. The airlines fighting a growing problem on its flights. Details right after this short break. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Wednesday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, August 5th. Let's take a look at markets this morning, 6:33 a.m. on the East Coast, we are looking at a rally underway this morning right out of the gate. The Dow Industrials are going to be up 180 points, Nasdaq futures are up 35, the S&P futures right now up 17.This after the Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 all ended the day higher yesterday. The momentum goes on. The Dow was up 164, but look at the Nasdaq ending yesterday with another record close extending a winning streak to 5 days. This is the 30th record high for the Nasdaq this year. Global markets this morning mixed, mostly higher in Europe, businesses in the U.K. growing at the fastest pace in 5 years. The Purchasing Managers Index coming in at 57, any level above 50 is growth as you see the FTSE 100 is up 65 right now.The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 42 and the Dax Index in Germany is higher by 113 points, it's about 1 percent. In Asia overnight, markets were mostly higher, you did have weakness overnight in Japan, but the best performer was Korea, Kospi Index up 1.5 percent. Well, U.S. and Chinese officials are set to review the first phase of their trade deal later this month. Cheryl Casone with more details on that, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: That's right, Maria, the U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are expected to discuss China's compliance with the trade agreement six months after it took effect. One key issue, China falling short of its commitment to buy more U.S. imports. The virtual meeting going to be held as tensions rise between the two super powers. The latest example, President Trump's threat to ban TikTok in the United States unless its U.S. operations are sold to a U.S. company.Well, fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic forcing Virgin Atlantic to file for Chapter 15 bankruptcy here in the United States, that type applies to foreign companies that operate here. This move, part of the airlines $1.5 billion restructuring plan coming out of the U.K. Virgin Atlantic says it's going to write a cash next month if restructuring is not approved. The airline so far has laid off more than 3,500 workers and closed its base at London's Gatwick Airport.And finally, here's a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. The Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly is investigating whether Kodak jumped the gun, announcing a $765 million loan from the government to make drug ingredients. Advertising money being spent on podcast in this country on track to cross the $1 billion mark in 2021. Finally, Sony Pictures made $230 million in the second quarter. That is despite major Hollywood production being shut down due to the pandemic, Maria. And those are your headlines from the newsroom, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you. Fighting voter fraud. The Trump administration is suing Nevada over legislation signed Monday that would automatically mail ballots to active registered voters. This is the Trump campaign suing. The president is pushing back while praising systems and states like Florida.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Florida is different from other states. I mean, in Nevada, we have a governor, he said let's just send out millions of ballots and the Post Office cannot be prepared. I haven't spoken to the Post Office about it. But I don't know how they could possibly be prepared. I can't imagine the Post Office could do it. All of a sudden, they're supposed to be dealing in millions of ballots, but Florida has done a great job and we have total confidence that if you mail in your ballots in Florida, it's going to matter.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And of course, the campaign is suing because they are worried about the upcoming election. Joining us right now is the editor-at-large of Reason, Matt Welch, Matt, great to see you. Your reaction to what the campaign is doing here, and how worried are you about mail-in voting?MATT WELCH, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, REASON: I'm not that worried about mail-in voting. We don't have -- we have mail-in voting in 5 states in this country already. They mail votes -- ballots out to every voter in places like Hawaii, in Utah and et cetera. What I'm mostly worried about is what's happening in places like New York where you and I are sitting here. They had an election 6 or 7 weeks ago, they're still counting it up.It's a logistical problem to count in a big title wave of mail-in ballots. So, if you haven't done the prep work on that, you're in a lot of trouble, we could be sitting and talking about election day through December and January, which is a nightmare scenario for everybody involved. Trump administration and Trump himself have been talking, shall we say out of a lot of different sides of a lot of different mouths when they've discussed voter fraud, and this stretches back to the 2016 election.There aren't actually very many incidents of voter fraud in this country, although when it does happen, it's often times with absentee ballots because people get confused more often than anything else. So, it's a logistical problem for sure. The problem for Trump also is that it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy especially in places like Nevada. Nevada, older voters, there's lots there, because they don't have income tax. They vote Republican and younger voters who tend to Latino tend to vote Democrat.It's the older voters who are using mail-in balloting. So if Trump talks a lot about how mail-in ballot is bad and wrong and potentially full of fraud, he could be discouraging his own voters. So, it's something that he's -- I think he needs to be more keenly aware than he has.BARTIROMO: Yes, but we've already seen fraud. We saw it in New Jersey, we're seeing this, you know, question about who is getting the mail. I mean, Dagen McDowell, didn't you get somebody's absentee voted -- voting ballot in your apartment? Didn't you see mail right there that you actually were talking about the other day?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: This goes right to the issue. I got -- with absentee ballots, let's be clear. People get an application for an absentee ballot, and then you have to send the application in. And I got one for somebody who hasn't lived in my building for 10 years. But the issue is and Matt is touching on this, let's be really clear, let's not use the word fraud. Let's use the word mess and morass when it comes to states and boards of election, local authorities and bureaucrats and the Postal Service that are not ready and cannot handle what could be mass ballot mailings which is what Nevada wants to do.Again, California is in addition to those 5 states that Matt was talking about where they are mailing ballots to voters this year because of the pandemic. We are not ready as a nation to handle what will be an unprecedented mail-in presidential election. And this goes to the authority of the states and the people in boards of elections. One thing here in New York that the "New York Post" reports, and they write an editorial about it today.As many as one quarter, 25 percent of the 120,000 mailed-in ballots cast in Brooklyn alone for June's primaries might be disqualified. One quarter, and that's according to the boroughs Democratic Party boss. We are not ready for this. If you can go to a grocery store during the pandemic, you can go and line up and vote. Wear a mask, keep your distance, but do it the regular way.BARTIROMO: Well, this is what I'm saying, saying messy morass --WELCH: And to be clear -- right --BARTIROMO: But you know, let me tell you, I mean, that could open the door to fraud! I mean, that's what AG Bill Barr told me just a month ago that it just has the potential to open the flood gates of fraud. That is an AG comment, not mine, Matt.WELCH: Yes, it's -- the potential is there. The question is how does it happen? I mean, for example, I can still as far as I know vote in the state of California. I haven't lived there in 15 years or so in some-odd things, but I'm still on the rolls locally, but then the mechanics of how to do that are a little bit more difficult. I would have to show up some polling place, you know, in Hollywood, and I don't know where it would happen after that.So it's more difficult to try to execute that than it is something that has been observed out there. There is a quantitative difference. Dagen is absolutely right to talk about in most places -- it's you know, you mail in to get your ballot mailed to you. That's much different than what Nevada is talking about, and California is going to be a basket case. I think maybe thankfully, it's that we already know what the presidential race is probably going to be like in California, but that type of scale is the problem more than anything else. In the New York case --BARTIROMO: Yes --WELCH: Specifically it's -- you have to get the rules right and the Trump campaign is actually right to talk about this in Nevada. You have to get the rules right about post-dating and verification of things like that when you go to these types of mail-in situations.BARTIROMO: Well, then, that's a problem. Matt, it's great to have you this morning, we're going to keep talking about this, please come back soon, thank you sir.WELCH: Thank you --BARTIROMO: Matt Welch joining us this morning from Reason. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Small business slammed by the coronavirus pandemic. New data from the New York Fed shows a 22 percent decline in the number of small business owners from February to April. That number ticking up to 41 percent among black business owners. The study finding black firms twice as likely to close up shop due in part to weak relationships with banks and lack of access to PPP loans. Joining me right now is the Chairman of the FDIC Jelena McWilliams. And Jelena, it's great to have you this morning, thank you so much for joining us. What is the answer for small business at this point?JELENA MCWILLIAMS, CHAIRPERSON, FDIC: Good morning, Maria. So the answer for small business is really to work with our banks and we have seen that banks have been at the forefront of the PPP efforts and other small business loan modification efforts. From the regulatory side, we have encouraged banks to work with our borrowers, meaning to proactively reach to their customers and figure out, do you need help, do you need us to modify your loan, do you need extra credit.And so we have been very encouraging with the regulatory side to make sure that small businesses in particular have access to credit.BARTIROMO: And at this point, you know, there are many that have been unable to withstand this shutdown. They will not make it out of this. They have been unable to access those banks. What do you do for those smaller restaurants, service businesses that may not have a banking relationship to rely on?MCWILLIAMS: So those -- some of those businesses certainly have to depend on some of the government actions in the coming months. But the environment is particularly hard for small businesses, but people being unable to go and pay -- you know, visit restaurants or go shopping at a small business. I know that I have had a number of offers to visit small business shops, and I have utilized those as much as I can to support the local economy.I do think it's important for banks and I cannot reiterate this message enough to work with our borrowers and figure out how to help them get through the -- through this pandemic frankly. Because going into the crisis, banks were well capitalized. There's plenty of liquidity in the system to go into the small businesses, and frankly, I do think that banks have been at the forefront and in particular have been helpful to small businesses and frankly, could do even more.BARTIROMO: And chairman, you are also spear-heading the FDI tech initiative to try to accelerate banks' digital transformation in response to COVID-19, tell me what that involves.MCWILLIAMS: Thank you for that question. It has been one of my frankly top projects at the FDIC. The future of community banks in particular, but all banks is going to be depended on how quickly they can adapt to digital transformation(ph) and delivery, because frankly, their customers are coming to expect it. And so we have the FDI tech lab, the FDI tech, FDIC tech lab at the FDIC. And so one of the initiatives that we're working on is working on rampage products that I think to figure out how can we get banks to a better solution or a number of their technological utilities and services and channels of delivery.And frankly, I have been pleased with if there's any silver-lining in all of this in the pandemic in particular. It is the fact that banks have to adapt very quickly to being available online and online only to their customers. Some banks have --BARTIROMO: Yes --MCWILLIAMS: Capped their branches open. But a lot of them have closed the branches down. So the technological transformation in the last 3 months, I would say, is probably tantamount to what would have transpired over 3 or 4 years in peace time.BARTIROMO: Yes, I think you make a really important point, and this is great for small business as well as individuals. Real quick, before you go, Jelena, tell me why the black portion, black ownership of small business has been hit harder than the rest.MCWILLIAMS: Well, we have seen with a lot of issues surrounding racial inequality and in the wage and income gap over the past few months in particular that the African-American community has been particularly hard hit by a number of the economic actions and the shutdowns frankly of the economy in different parts of the country. Same applies to small business. And at the FDIC, we have a particularly strong initiative with the minority to bolster institutions that serve in the number of cases African-American communities to see what help we can offer these small banks.The MDI -- so-called MDIs to support local businesses and specifically African-American businesses because it is crucial to those in the communities in color in general to be able to have access to credit.BARTIROMO: Yes, it sure is. Jelena, good to have you this morning, we'll be watching the developments, thank you. Jelena McWilliams from the FDIC this morning, the chairman, we'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Time for the Morning Buzz. First up, Southwest is asking passengers to stop boozing it up. The airline is not serving drinks, but it is seeing an uptick in passengers bringing their own. Southwest facing backlash for cutting certain cleaning priorities, no longer disinfecting armrests and seatbelts between flights. What? Dagen, what do you think?MCDOWELL: I carry my own anti-bacteria wipes with me, and my own liquor when I go on an airplane.(LAUGHTER)So, I am not going to be flying Southwest. You want people to obey the rules and keep calm, you better liquor them up.BARTIROMO: You crack me up. Really, you're just cracking me up. All right, next up, Mac and cheese in the morning? Kraft temporarily replacing dinner with breakfast on packages. Tweet using the hash tag KMC for breakfast for a chance to win one of these limited boxes. Hey James, are you in having a Mac and cheese for breakfast?JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, a 100 percent. I mean, that is the go-to option especially when you have maybe friends and family getting --BARTIROMO: Right --FREEMAN: Together during the Summer with socially-distanced, of course, but that is the go-to meal that all the kids will eat. So as long as they don't bring along their own liquor to the breakfast table, I think it's absolutely fine.BARTIROMO: Oh, gosh, this Morning Buzz is cracking me up this morning. All right, dancing to a scholarship, this viral video of an 11-year-old boy from Nigeria catching the eye of the American ballet theater, which offered him a scholarship. Other schools are also interested. Mattie, pretty amazing how a viral video can change a person's life, but that is exactly what's happening here.DUPPLER: You know, the internet gets a lot of bad rap, but this is just one example I think of how the connectivity of the global economy and global community --BARTIROMO: Right --DUPPLER: Can really be used for good. I mean, it's a beautiful video. But I will say one thing, Dagen, brings the mimosas, James brings the Mac and cheese. When this is all over, we're going to have one heck of a breakfast party.BARTIROMO: Yes, we really are. Oh, God --MCDOWELL: Let me tell you this really --BARTIROMO: Go ahead, Dagen --MCDOWELL: Quickly. I have to tell you this really quickly. So forget the mimosa, I saw a nine-year-old woman on an airplane at about 7 O'clock in the morning one day, order a bloody mary with no tomato in it. She got a -- class of Vodka at 7 O'clock in the morning. I was like if that's the key to living to 90, then, I am all in.DUPPLER: Then I'm in --BARTIROMO: It probably made her feel better to just say -- to say virgin Mary or --MCDOWELL: Yes --BARTIROMO: Bloody Mary even though there was no mix in it.MCDOWELL: Yes --BARTIROMO: All right, look, I've got the giggles now. I've got to see if I can get rid of them. I've got a big announcement to make later on in the show. Some of you may already know it, but for those who don't, stick around, we've got some news this morning.

China's 'Bat Woman' Calls Claim Country Tried to Steal U.S. COVID-19 Vaccine Data 'Nonsense'Newsweek.comAugust 24, 2020 Monday 5:58 AM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 533 wordsByline: Jason MurdockHighlight: "China's vaccine research is currently at the forefront," top Chinese virologist Shi Zhengli said in an interview with CGTN, a state-controlled media outlet.BodyA virologist at the centre of China's coronavirus research has said it is "nonsense" to suggest the state has tried to steal other nations' vaccine data. Dr. Shi Zhengli, who leads a unit at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) and was coined "bat woman" due to her expertise on diseases linked to the mammals, has rejected claims that China had spearheaded vaccine-related attacks against the U.S. following accusations last month."It is nonsense," the researcher reportedly said during an interview with CGTN, a state-controlled media outlet. The voiceover was narrated by the website.Suggestions that hackers aligned with the Chinese government had been targeting virus research surfaced in recent weeks, including from the U.S. federal government. Experts say that Russia-linked adversaries are conducting similar cyber-operations.In late July, Reuters reported that hackers with ties to the Chinese state had attempted to infiltrate U.S. biotech company Moderna in an effort to hijack its COVID-19 data. The accusation was called "baseless" by a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson.Earlier the same month, the U.S. Department of Justice unveiled an indictment naming two suspected hackers with ties to China's Ministry of State Security, or MSS.A media release at the time, which described the pair as being a "prolific threat to U.S. networks" said the suspects had "probed for vulnerabilities in computer networks of companies developing COVID-19 vaccines, testing technology, and treatments." It remains unclear if any attacks have been successful.In the CGTN interview, released online August 21, Shi appeared to reject the claims of state involvement, although conceded that she was unaware of the evidence held by the U.S.Experts have previously told Newsweek such hacks are fairly common."China's vaccine research is currently at the forefront," Shi said. "We isolated the virus strain all on our own and the whole research procedure is being conducted by the Wuhan Institute of virology and Wuhan Institute of Biological Products Company."The vaccination is being researched by [academic] Chen Wei's team, which has their own intellectual property too. I don't know if there's any evidence at all for the U.S. to claim that we steal their research."Previously, the Chinese virus expert told Science that president Trump should apologize to the Wuhan virus institute for alluding to a conspiracy theory that claimed the outbreak started at the lab, which is based in the city where COVID-19 originated."There is no evidence for what they've said. They are lying. They are lying for political reasons," Shi said in the most-recent interview, according to CGTN.In recent weeks, Trump has taken a trade dispute with his Beijing counterparts to a new level by issuing orders promising to restrict services including TikTok and WeChat.In May, the president said China's "pattern of misconduct" was "well known" and accused the foreign state of orchestrating a "cover-up of the Wuhan virus" that allowed the infectious disease to spread. "For years, the government of China has conducted illicit espionage to steal our industrial secrets, of which there are many." Trump said.Link to ImageGraphic Shi ZhengliJOHANNES EISELE/AFP/GettyChinese virologist Shi Zhengli is seen inside the P4 laboratory in Wuhan, capital of China's Hubei province, on February 23, 2017. - The P4 epidemiological laboratory was built in co-operation with French bio-industrial firm Institut Merieux and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.Load-Date: August 24, 2020End of Document

State-financed media outlets such as BBC and NPR that operate “with editorial independence” will not be labeled, the company clarified.“Unlike independent media, state-affiliated media frequently use their news coverage as a means to advance a political agenda,” Twitter wrote in the post. “We believe that people have the right to know when a media account is affiliated directly or indirectly with a state actor.”Link to ImageTwitter labels Chinese-state media accounts (Screenshot/Twitter)Link to ImageTwitter labels Russian-owned media outlet (screenshot/Twitter)The platform will also label government officials and other individuals who “are the voice of the nation state abroad,” specifically accounts associated with China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, Twitter added. Labels will only be applied on countries that make up the UN Security Council, according to the blog post.The platform will expand the labels for spokesmen and officials in the future.“We will also no longer amplify state-affiliated media accounts or their Tweets through our recommendation systems including on the home timeline, notifications, and search,” Twitter explained. The platform will continue to amplify the accounts of government officials and spokespeople.Chinese politician Lijian Zhao's account will now be subject to a label. Zhao, the deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's Information Department and one of China's most prolific propagandists, suggested in March that the United States brought coronavirus to China.Officials believe coronavirus, or COVID-19, originated in Wuhan, China, before spreading worldwide and reportedly killing 110,000 people in the United States. Twitter applied a fact-check label to his March tweet in May, but Zhao's account has not yet been removed.Zhao also falsely suggested in the tweet that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield was “arrested.”Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Trump bans dealings with Chinese owners of TikTok, WeChatAssociated Press Financial WireAugust 7, 2020 Friday 7:01 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 1103 wordsByline: TALI ARBEL, AP Technology WriterDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump on Thursday ordered a sweeping but unspecified ban on dealings with the Chinese owners of consumer apps TikTok and WeChat, although it remains unclear if he has the legal authority to actually ban the apps from the U.S.The twin executive orders — one for each app — take effect in 45 days. They say they are necessary because the China-owned apps “threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States,” and call on the Commerce Secretary to define the banned dealings by that time. While the wording of the orders is vague and appears to have been rushed out, some experts said it appears intended to bar the popular apps from the Apple and Google app stores, which could effectively remove them from distribution in the U.S.“This is an unprecedented use of presidential authority,” Eurasia Group analyst Paul Triolo said in an email. At a minimum, he said, the orders appear to “constitute a ban on the ability of U.S. app stores run by Apple and Google to include either mobile app after 45 days.”Triolo said the orders may face legal challenges and warned that Beijing is likely to “react harshly, at least rhetorically.” Trump’s orders cited legal authority from the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act.The action is the Trump administration’s latest attempt to hobble China, a rising economic superpower. Over the past several years, it has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment. China-backed hackers, meanwhile, have been blamed for data breaches of U.S. federal databases and the credit agency Equifax, and the Chinese government strictly limits what U.S. tech companies can do in China.Election-year politics in the U.S. are fanning the flames, as Trump appears to be using friction with China to drum up voter support.Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers share concerns about TikTok running from its vulnerability to censorship and misinformation campaigns to the safety of user data and children’s privacy. But the administration has provided no specific evidence that TikTok has made U.S. users’ data available to the Chinese government. Instead, officials point to the hypothetical threat that lies in the Chinese government’s ability to demand cooperation from Chinese companies.Earlier in the week, Trump threatened a deadline of Sept. 15 to “close down” TikTok unless Microsoft or another company acquires it, a threat the new executive order appears to formalize. On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced an expansion of the U.S. crackdown on Chinese technology to include barring Chinese apps from U.S. app stores, citing alleged security threats and calling out TikTok and WeChat by name.TikTok did not reply to queries. Tencent and Microsoft declined to comment.“The U.S. thinking is that anything that is Chinese is suspect,” said Andy Mok, a senior research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing. “They’re being targeted not because of what they’ve done, but who they are.”Leading mobile security experts say TikTok is no more intrusive in its harvesting of user data and monitoring of user activity than U.S. apps owned by Facebook and Google.“I am the first to yell from the rooftops when there is a glaring privacy issue somewhere. But we just have not found anything we could call a smoking gun in TikTok,” mobile security expert Will Strafach told The Associated Press last month after examining the app. Strafach is CEO of Guardian, which provides a firewall for Apple devices.The order doesn’t seem to ban Americans from using TikTok, said Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. She added that such an order would be nearly impossible to enforce in the first place.“If goal is to get teenagers to stop using TikTok, I’m not sure an executive order will stop them,” she said. “Every teenager knows how to use a VPN (a virtual private network). They will just pretend they are in Canada.”And it would be difficult to prohibit people from using the apps if they already have them, even if an app-store ban went into effect, said Vanderbilt University law professor Timothy Meyer.TikTok, known for its short, catchy videos, is widely popular among young people in the U.S. and elsewhere. It is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, which operates a separate version for the Chinese market. TikTok insists it does not store U.S. user information in China, instead caching it in the U.S. and Singapore, and says it would not share it with the Chinese government.TikTok says it has 100 million U.S. users and hundreds of millions globally. According to research firm App Annie, TikTok saw 50 million weekly active users in the U.S. during the week of July 19, the latest available figure. That’s up 75% from the first week of the year.WeChat and its sister app Weixin in China are hugely popular apps that incorporate messaging, financial transfers and an array of other services, and claim more than one billion users.

Trump bans dealings with Chinese owners of TikTok, WeChatAssociated Press InternationalAugust 7, 2020 Friday 7:01 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 1103 wordsByline: TALI ARBEL, AP Technology WriterDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump on Thursday ordered a sweeping but unspecified ban on dealings with the Chinese owners of consumer apps TikTok and WeChat, although it remains unclear if he has the legal authority to actually ban the apps from the U.S.The twin executive orders — one for each app — take effect in 45 days. They say they are necessary because the China-owned apps “threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States,” and call on the Commerce Secretary to define the banned dealings by that time. While the wording of the orders is vague and appears to have been rushed out, some experts said it appears intended to bar the popular apps from the Apple and Google app stores, which could effectively remove them from distribution in the U.S.“This is an unprecedented use of presidential authority,” Eurasia Group analyst Paul Triolo said in an email. At a minimum, he said, the orders appear to “constitute a ban on the ability of U.S. app stores run by Apple and Google to include either mobile app after 45 days.”Triolo said the orders may face legal challenges and warned that Beijing is likely to “react harshly, at least rhetorically.” Trump’s orders cited legal authority from the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act.The action is the Trump administration’s latest attempt to hobble China, a rising economic superpower. Over the past several years, it has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment. China-backed hackers, meanwhile, have been blamed for data breaches of U.S. federal databases and the credit agency Equifax, and the Chinese government strictly limits what U.S. tech companies can do in China.Election-year politics in the U.S. are fanning the flames, as Trump appears to be using friction with China to drum up voter support.Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers share concerns about TikTok running from its vulnerability to censorship and misinformation campaigns to the safety of user data and children’s privacy. But the administration has provided no specific evidence that TikTok has made U.S. users’ data available to the Chinese government. Instead, officials point to the hypothetical threat that lies in the Chinese government’s ability to demand cooperation from Chinese companies.Earlier in the week, Trump threatened a deadline of Sept. 15 to “close down” TikTok unless Microsoft or another company acquires it, a threat the new executive order appears to formalize. On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced an expansion of the U.S. crackdown on Chinese technology to include barring Chinese apps from U.S. app stores, citing alleged security threats and calling out TikTok and WeChat by name.TikTok did not reply to queries. Tencent and Microsoft declined to comment.“The U.S. thinking is that anything that is Chinese is suspect,” said Andy Mok, a senior research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing. “They’re being targeted not because of what they’ve done, but who they are.”Leading mobile security experts say TikTok is no more intrusive in its harvesting of user data and monitoring of user activity than U.S. apps owned by Facebook and Google.“I am the first to yell from the rooftops when there is a glaring privacy issue somewhere. But we just have not found anything we could call a smoking gun in TikTok,” mobile security expert Will Strafach told The Associated Press last month after examining the app. Strafach is CEO of Guardian, which provides a firewall for Apple devices.The order doesn’t seem to ban Americans from using TikTok, said Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. She added that such an order would be nearly impossible to enforce in the first place.“If goal is to get teenagers to stop using TikTok, I’m not sure an executive order will stop them,” she said. “Every teenager knows how to use a VPN (a virtual private network). They will just pretend they are in Canada.”And it would be difficult to prohibit people from using the apps if they already have them, even if an app-store ban went into effect, said Vanderbilt University law professor Timothy Meyer.TikTok, known for its short, catchy videos, is widely popular among young people in the U.S. and elsewhere. It is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, which operates a separate version for the Chinese market. TikTok insists it does not store U.S. user information in China, instead caching it in the U.S. and Singapore, and says it would not share it with the Chinese government.TikTok says it has 100 million U.S. users and hundreds of millions globally. According to research firm App Annie, TikTok saw 50 million weekly active users in the U.S. during the week of July 19, the latest available figure. That’s up 75% from the first week of the year.WeChat and its sister app Weixin in China are hugely popular apps that incorporate messaging, financial transfers and an array of other services, and claim more than one billion users. Around the world, many people of Chinese descent use WeChat to stay in touch with friends and family and to conduct business in mainland China.Within China, WeChat is censored and expected to adhere to content restrictions set by authorities. The Toronto-based Citizen Lab internet watchdog group has said WeChat monitors files and images shared abroad to aid its censorship in China.The order against Tencent could have ramifications for users beyond WeChat, which is crucial for personal communications and organizations that do business with China. Tencent also owns parts or all of major game companies like Epic Games, publisher of Fortnite, a major video game hit, and Riot Games, which is behind League of Legends.“This is a pretty broad and pretty quick expansion of the technology Cold War between the U.S. and China,” said Steven Weber, faculty director for the Berkeley Center for Long Term Cybersecurity.

China's Communist Party is a threat to the world, says former elite insiderCNN.comAugust 20, 2020 Thursday 8:07 PM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 2169 wordsByline: By CNN StaffDateline: Hong Kong BodyCai Xia is no stranger to defying expectations. During her years at the Chinese Communist Party's top training center and think tank, the outspoken professor had surprised many with her liberal ideas and support for democratic reform.More recently, she caused a stir with a spate of scathing denunciations of China's ruling elite and the country's leader Xi Jinping -- a rare rebuke from a longtime insider that led to her expulsion from the Party earlier this week.In an interview with CNN from the United States, where she has lived since last year, Cai went a step further by calling on the US government to double down on its hardline approach towards Beijing. She said she supported the Trump administration's ban on telecommunications giant Huawei, which Washington claims is a national security risk due to its alleged connection to the Chinese government -- an allegation Huawei has repeatedly denied.Cai also called for sanctions on top Chinese officials and appealed to the international community to join hands in stopping the Communist Party from "infiltrating" global institutions and spreading Xi's "totalitarian" ideals."The relationship between China and the United States is not a conflict between the two peoples, but a contest and confrontation between two systems and two ideologies," Cai told CNN.Cai said she had been stranded by the coronavirus pandemic after arriving in the US last year as a tourist. She declined to disclose more details about her current situation or plans for the future, citing fears over her personal safety.Since coming to power in late 2012, Xi has consolidated his position and authority over the Party, which ranks among the world's largest political organizations with 90 million members. He has unleashed a sweeping crackdown on political dissent, civil society and the mostly Muslim Uyghur minority in the Xinjiang region, and tightened control over Hong Kong, a former British colony that was promised a high degree of autonomy when it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997.Now, according to Cai, the Communist Party aims "to replace the free and democratic system of modern mankind represented by the United States, and the values and order of peace, democracy, freedom and justice," with its own model of governance.Cai's comments come as relations between the US and China deteriorate to their lowest point in decades. The world's two largest economies have sparred in nearly every aspect of their bilateral relationship, including on trade, technology, human rights, and financial flows.The Trump administration has moved to decouple the two economies, including most recently issuing executive orders that would ban popular Chinese mobile apps from operating in the US. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has portrayed China as an existential threat to the US, giving a speech in July that called for "the free world to triumph over this new tyranny ... the old paradigm of blind engagement with China simply won't get it done. We must not continue it."The Chinese government has repeatedly rejected similar accusations. "We have no intention of becoming another United States. China does not export ideology, and never interferes in other countries' internal affairs," Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said earlier this month.Criticism from overseas is of course easier to deflect than criticism at home. Cai, 67, is one of a small but growing number of prominent insider voices who have spoken out against the Party and its authoritarian turn under Xi. But her decades-long career as a Communist Party scholar and adviser has given her criticism a special weight -- and dealt an embarrassing blow to the Party.On Wednesday, the Global Times, a Chinese government-run tabloid, called Cai's recent public remarks a "blatant betrayal" to China that is "totally indefensible," and accused her of colluding "with external forces to hurt the interests of the motherland."Â The Central Party School, where Cai taught for 14 years before retiring in 2012, announced on Monday that she had been expelled from the Party for "making remarks that have serious political problems and damaged the country's reputation." It also cut off her pension and other retirement benefits.The announcement offered scant details, but Cai said the school's internal statement listed three things that led to her removal: a short essay she wrote in May that decried Beijing's national security law on Hong Kong as "brutalizing the Hong Kong people," a leaked audio recording in which she labeled the Party a "political zombie" and referred to Xi as acting like a "mafia boss," and an online petition she signed in February calling for freedom of speech following the death of Li Wenliang, the Wuhan doctor who was reprimanded by police for attempting to raise the alarm about the country's coronavirus outbreak. Li later died after catching the virus.Cai said she shared the essay and speech with friends in private and had not expected her words to make waves online. Both were swiftly censored in China but circulated widely overseas. But now that she no longer belongs to the Party, she said she felt obliged to speak out publicly.An insider-turned criticFor more than three decades, Cai had closely dissected the Party from within. Throughout her academic career, she examined its internal workings and ideologies. She taught class after class of officials, first at a local Party school in her home province of Jiangsu and later at the Central Party School in Beijing -- the elite training ground for China's most senior cadres and political rising stars.Her research focus later shifted from ideology to democratic political transition, in the hope that the Party could one day begin to reform itself internally by allowing wider intra-party democracy.But it was from the inside that Cai watched the Communist Party, which is the sole governing party within mainland China, taking a harder stance on internal debates and dissent. Under former President Hu Jintao, Xi's predecessor, dissent was still tolerated -- although the space was already shrinking, Cai said. Since Xi came to power, however, intra-party democracy has become nothing but an empty name, she added."What he emphasized was the concentration of power and the absolute conformity and loyalty to the Party's central leadership," she said. "He does not allow dissenting voices from within the Party, punishing those who air a different opinion with Party discipline and corruption charges."Last month, the Party expelled Ren Zhiqiang, an influential real estate tycoon and longtime Party member, for "serious violation" of Party discipline and law, after he penned an essay criticizing Xi's response to the coronavirus epidemic.In a statement, the Party's disciplinary watchdog accused Ren of not toeing the Party line on "major matters of principle," "smearing the Party and country's image," and being "disloyal and dishonest with the Party." It also accused Ren of corruption and handed him to prosecutors for criminal investigation.Cai had previously voiced support for Ren when the outspoken tycoon was silenced from Chinese social media in 2016 after he questioned Xi's order that all state-run media must stay loyal to the Party in comments online. This time, she penned an essay in his defense, calling Ren the latest victim of Xi's "ruthless crackdown" on dissent within the Party.Speaking to CNN, Cai said Xi's "reign of terror" did not come from a position of strength -- instead, it exposed his deep sense of insecurity. "He's the one who's the most scared. That's why he launched round after round of purges inside the Party," she said. "The person holding supreme power always feels that others are plotting a power grab."In the current political climate, few dare to speak up publicly, Cai said. "When reporting information to their superiors, officials often conceal the truth and only report what they would like to hear. The information conveyed upwards is false, and there is no more scientific, democratic, open and transparent decision making," she said. "Under such circumstances, major problems will definitely arise in policy making."Some critics have blamed China's slow initial response to the coronavirus outbreak on its political system and culture of discouraging lower-level officials from reporting unpleasant truths.In the early days of the outbreak in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged, healthcare workers like Doctor Li Wenliang were punished for trying to sound the alarm. Wuhan officials later admitted they had not disclosed information on the coronavirus "in a timely fashion."But the Chinese government eventually managed to contain the outbreak, after imposing stringent lockdown measures that brought much of the country to a halt. As the virus spread to other parts of the world, however, many governments, including the United States, have floundered in their own attempts to curb its spread. As of Sunday, the coronavirus has infected more than 23 million people and claimed over 800,000 lives worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.Cai accused the Chinese government of initially covering up the outbreak and causing the virus to wreak havoc across the globe -- a claim which Chinese officials have repeatedly and strenuously denied. Propelled by this view and the US-China trade war, Cai said countries are no longer willing to appease China, as they now have a "clear picture of Xi."'Returned to the side of the people'Cai was born into a so-called "red family" -- her grandfather joined the Party in the early years of its founding and her parents fought in the Communist revolution that brought the Party to power. She had a strict upbringing, ingrained with her parents' revolutionary belief that the people should be freed and empowered to rule the country.When Cai was a young teenager, Chairman Mao Zedong launched the Cultural Revolution, unleashing ten years of political and social turmoil. In 1966, Cai traveled to Beijing and joined thousands of student paramilitaries, known as the Red Guards, who gathered fervently in a rally in Tiananmen Square to greet Mao. But she said she also witnessed the terror of the movement, including the brutal beatings of teachers."I saw how miserable people could be without any rule of law, any protection of rights. It scarred me deeply, and since then I've always been on alert that our country cannot return to that era," she said."Since Xi came to power, however, his language, ideas and actions are all harking back to the Cultural Revolution -- for us who have been through that period, we're very sensitive (to that shift)."Cai said she believes there is widespread discontent within the Party over Xi's policy directions, especially among the generation of officials who went to college after the Cultural Revolution, rose through the Party ranks during former leader Deng Xiaoping's reform and opening era in the 1980s, and witnessed China's rapid economic and social development in the ensuing decades. But she said there is little chance for any form of opposition to organize under Xi's heavy-handed rule.Cai holds a grim view for the future. Xi is leading the country away from the path of reform and opening, she said. Without internal reforms, conflicts and tensions will build up and one day erupt all at once, causing the sudden collapse of the Party-state system and plunging the country into chaos, according to Cai.Xi, for his part, has repeatedly said he is committed to reforming China. "What should be and can be reformed, we will resolutely reform. What should not or cannot be reformed, we will resolutely not reform," he said in a speech commemorating the 40th anniversary of Deng's policy of reform and opening in 2018.But according to Cai, the only way to prevent future calamity, is to replace Xi as the top leader, who she accused of "kidnapping" the country."China won't be able to head towards democratic politics under Xi," she said. "Only by letting Xi step down, can the pro-reform voices arise within the Party and pro-reform forces play their role in adjusting the direction that China is heading in."But that might not happen anytime soon. Xi was expected to step down in 2023, but in 2018, he abolished the presidential term limit, clearing the way for him to stay in power indefinitely.For now, Cai said she was happy to be expelled from the Party, which she said no longer resembled the Party she grew up believing in.She had already wanted to quit in 2016, when Ren, the property tycoon and fellow Party member, was silenced on social media. Cai spoke out in Ren's defense, only to be warned herself by the Party to hush up. She argued that she had the right to speak up as a citizen."They told me: 'you're first a Communist Party member, and your identity as a citizen comes later.'" Cai recalled. "I thought to myself then, I would rather have my rights as a citizen than Party membership.""Now, I feel like I've finally returned to the side of the people," she said.Load-Date: August 22, 2020End of Document

Trump, TikTok and a dangerous precedent for democracyCNN.comAugust 7, 2020 Friday 3:15 AM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESSLength: 1123 wordsByline: Analysis by Luke McGee, CNNBodyPresident Donald Trump's ongoing battle with TikTok is becoming one of the most curious chapters in America's emerging cold war with China. Earlier this week, Trump issued an executive order which gave the Chinese social media giant until the middle of September to find an American buyer or be banned in the country. He also issued a similar executive order for the Chinese messaging service WeChat.This story draws together several threads. Microsoft is prepared to pay around $50 billion for an app that is primarily used to watch short, funny videos created by other users. The app currently has 100 million American users and analysts believe this might grow so fast it will soon be worth $200 billion. The Trump administration wants to ban the app because it believes its Chinese owners could be required to cooperate with the Chinese government, which in turn, could use the platform for espionage or to spread misinformation, threatening national security. If Microsoft and TikTok cannot pull off this purchase by mid-September -- a tall order for a deal of this size -- Trump pulls the plug on its US operation.It's an irresistible twist in the Trump administration's four-year diplomatic spat with Beijing and comes hot off Trump pressuring other countries to take a harder line on China.However, critics worry that Trump's latest attempts to turn the screws on China could set a dangerous, anti-democratic precedent in how governments try to control the way citizens use the internet, which will be applauded by leaders of countries where democracy is already backsliding."Restricting internet and interfering with people's capacity to criticize power is not unprecedented on a global scale. It has happened in India, Iran and in different parts of Africa," said Nanjala Nyabola, an author and political analyst specializing in politics in the digital age. "What people are struggling with is the fact it's happening in the US. When a country like the US begins to erode the ideas of democracy it naturally opens the door for other countries to do the same."This might seem a dramatic analysis at first glance, given the comparisons in Iran and Africa, where people are arrested for expressing dissent online. All Trump is talking about is removing certain platforms from the American internet.It's the fact this is happening in the democratic posterchild that makes Trump's move so notable. "Every time Western leaders undercut free speech and the movement of ideas across boundaries without good reason, the cause of civil liberties is undermined," said Nic Cheeseman, professor of democracy at the University of Birmingham. "It makes it that bit easier for governments seeking to clamp down on social media -- in Iran, in Turkey, in Tanzania -- to shut down critical voices."Whether or not Trump has good reason, as Cheeseman puts it, to shut down TikTok is open to debate. TikTok is owned by a private Chinese company called ByteDance. TikTok itself does not operate in China and, in the case of the US, TikTok maintains that users' data is stored on servers inside the US.However, China skeptics worry that Beijing could demand TikTok hand over this data. They suspect that the Chinese government could force ByteDance to censor content, as happens routinely on the Chinese internet, most notably on WeChat, where words and images relating to controversial issues like the Tiananmen Square massacre and Tibet are banned from group and private chats.They fear that the platform could be used to spread misinformation in the US. And, ultimately, they believe that the term private company is relative in China, the autocratic superpower currently locking horns with America.There is also some irony in the idea that should the US jettison TikTok from the internet, it would be behaving in some respects like China, whose government carefully censors what its citizens can do online. Some of the biggest American tech companies, including Facebook, Twitter and Google are banned in China."It is critical that any steps taken are in accord with democratic values ... and messaged from the frame of advancing a democratic information space -- not just countering authoritarian threats," said Laura Rosenberger, director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy and senior fellow at the Marshall Fund for the United States. "It's critical that the US not take steps that close ourselves off and create the sovereign information model that Beijing wants and that would weaken democracy."Nyabola believes that the TikTok debacle and the consequences it could have for US democracy must be viewed in the context of Trump's four years in office. "During the course of the Trump administration, things that were once taboo have become normalized. It has interfered with institutions like the Attorney General's office in relation to investigations into the President. How that might look to countries wanting to silence to shut up government critics is worrying."True to this form, even in his proclamations on TikTok, Trump announced his highly unusual opinion that should a deal be struck between Microsoft and ByteDance, the US Treasury department should get a "substantial amount of money" for the deal."Whether it's Microsoft or somebody else, or if it's the Chinese -- what the price is, the United States could -- should get a very large percentage of that price. Because we're making it possible," he said.Leaving aside the fact that there is no obvious legal mechanism by which Trump could make this happen and there was no mention of it in the executive order, the fact he seems to think his government deserves a kickback for any deal is revealing."Trump's call for the Treasury Department to benefit from the sale of TikTok to Microsoft smacks of the kind of thing that happens in failed states or banana republics where clientelistic arrangements mean that warlords or quasi-rulers get kickbacks from businesses as a tribute for allowing them to operate," said Joe Robinson, a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge, specializing in modern statehood in the digital age.The row over TikTok will doubtlessly reverberate in the media. And however trivial blocking a social media platform might seem on the surface, it's always worth remembering that when the President of the US does anything, the world watches. Even if Trump gets his way and TikTok is banned, Cheeseman said the US will still hand the Chinese government a propaganda consolation prize. "Blocking a foreign-owned platform for flimsy reasons would put the US on similar ground to China -- the next time America complains about China's wall of internet censorship, the Communist Party can turn around and say: but we are just doing the same thing as you."Load-Date: August 9, 2020End of Document

Thank you so much. It's really such a day looking back.Now, top stories that we are watching this morning.Tropical storm Isaias spawning tornadoes and dumping rain over eastern Virginia and Maryland after making landfall as a hurricane near Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina. The system knocking out power and sparking a series of house fires, forcing dozens out of their homes.It is now churning up East Coast and is expected to create weather today.Democrats and White House officials calling the latest round of talks on a COVID-19 relief bill productive, but there are apparently still some differences to work out. President Trump says he is ready to act on his own if necessary by using executive orders to freeze evictions and suspend collection of the payroll tax.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They want to bailout cities and states that have done a bad job over a long period of time. Nothing to do with coronavirus.They are not interested in unemployment. But I'm going to stop it because I will do it myself if I have to, I've a lot of powers with respect to executive orders.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Sources tell Fox News that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she is not confident that they can move a COVID-19 stimulus bill through this week.Teachers, parents and students taking to the streets in cities across the country meanwhile protesting against plans to reopen schools while the COVID-19 pandemic is still surging in parts of the country.

The President's also saying that the U.S. should get a cut from this deal because it is making it possible for the sale to happen. The Trump administration is accusing Tiktok, which is based in China, of sharing data of American citizens with the Chinese government.Overnight China slammed the potential sale as quote, "smash-and-grab" by the U.S.Futures pointing to a lower opening this morning after the Nasdaq closed at an all-time record high yesterday. Investors keeping an eye on earnings and any developments out of Washington on a possible stimulus deal.Joining me right now to talk more about that is Allianz chief economic adviser Mohamed el-Erian. Mohamed, it's great to have you this morning.MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER, ALLIANZ: Thank you, Maria. Thank you for 25 great years of reporting and insights. Congratulations.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much Mohamed.What do you think is needed in this stimulus package that would move markets and move the economy to actually show growth second half of the year?EL-ERIAN To protect people, Maria a lot of people are losing jobs again through no fault of their own and they need relief. But we also need forward-looking measures, pro work forward-looking measures. So it's a very tricky balance that's facing Congress right now. I think they're going to get somewhere but it's not going to be perfect.BARTIROMO: You know, they are talking about all sorts of -- of ideas from the payroll tax which is what the President wants to do, eliminate that payroll tax to extending the $600 a week.Do markets care about debt? I mean the President's talking about something $1.5 trillion. Nancy Pelosi has already passed a $3 trillion bill in the House. When do markets and investors start recognizing $22 trillion in debt and all the spending will have to be reined in at some point.EL-ERIAN: Not for now because interest rates are very low. And there's no sense that the government is crowding out the private sector.But Maria, critically the question we should be asking is the following. Is this extra debt contributing to our long-term economic growth? There is nothing wrong with debt if it results in higher growth. The problem with debt is when it results in lower growth.So markets will at some point ask that question, but right now, markets are just asking a very simple question. Are we getting more liquidity support from the Fed primarily but also from the fiscal agency? That's what markets are interested in right now.BARTIROMO: And, of course, we need to see growth in the economy. We saw two good months of data in May and June, Mohamed. What's your estimate or expectation on the state of the economy right now. Do you think we'll see growth in the third and fourth quarter?EL-ERIAN: So we will see growth but nothing like what we need and what we expected just a few weeks ago. If you look at the high-frequency indicators, the ones that measure daily economic activity, they are partial but they provide some insight. We are leveling off in many states and not surprising because of the health situation.I think people are mandated to do less because we have halted reopenings or gone backwards. Or people themselves are less willing to engage in the economy. So we are seeing a leveling off of economic activity so the bounce in the third quarter is not going to be as big as we need, unfortunately.And it's really important that we resume this process of health reopening. We can do it but it requires behavior modifications on the part of many.BARTIROMO: Dagen.MCDOWELL: Mohamed, you mentioned a policy -- working on policies that is pro-work, that looks at the road ahead. What is that? What would that be potentially? And is it something in any part of the discussions happening about the next stimulus here down in Washington?EL-ERIAN: It is not as yet. The vast majority of the discussion is about relief. About what do you do to help people, businesses, and local and state government. And there's lots of disagreement on that.But that is relief. There are three other buckets. There's the second bucket of living with COVID, being able to live this period in a healthy and economically-productive manner. There's a third one of making sure that we counter the pressure on productivity over the long term which means let's invest in infrastructure. Let's invest in people. And finally, we've got to counter the increase in household economic and security.So let's think of four different buckets, three of them are pro-growth, one of them is relief, and we are focusing mostly on relief right now for understandable reasons. But we need to take a more holistic approach over time.BARTIROMO: So what's the answer for investors then, Mohamed? I mean we are at record highs once again in the Nasdaq. We continue to see this market move higher despite the fact that we just reported the biggest contraction in the economy that we've seen, 32.9 percent? Would you be allocating new money to stocks here?EL-ERIAN: So I think you've got to look at what we've done so far this year. It's incredible.The Nasdaq is up 22 percent. The Dow Jones is down 6 percent. So we have an outperformance of the Nasdaq of almost 30 percentage points. That is enormous. The outperformance relative to the S&P is almost 20 percentage points so far this year. That is also enormous. And that's because tech names have become everything to everybody.You're looking for growth, go to tech. You're looking for defensive, go to tech. Why? They have strong balance sheets.My own view is we've come a very long way. I like the themes, but I don't like the valuations. But Maria I said this you two to three weeks ago and we've basically stayed flat since then except for the Nasdaq so I have been wrong on the Nasdaq.But I like the themes. I'm just a little bit worried about where their valuations have gone.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean valuations keep going higher with some of these tech names. Look at Apple hitting -- I mean we're talking about $2 trillion, very close to it. Is technology getting ahead of itself?EL-ERIAN: So I like technology. Let me just be clear, technology has four attributes you want because they translate into both resilience and liquidity. They have very strong balance sheets. They've positive cash flow even in this economy. They have good management. And the world is coming to them both during the shutdown and later.So these are very strong names. So their themes are very, very solid. It is just a matter of how much are you willing to pay for this.BARTIROMO: Absolutely.Mohamed, it's great to see you this morning. Thank you so much for joining us.EL-ERIAN: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Mohamed El-Erian joining us.Coming up, the mail-in voting debate. Trump 2020 presidential campaign national press secretary Hogan Gidley is here to talk about the concerns around mail-in voting.And then a new way to age. Suzanne Somers joining us on healthy living through this pandemic.And here's a shot from the New York Stock Exchange this morning. Today I am marking 25 years since my debut on the New York Stock Exchange floor. I will be ringing the opening bell. I'm so excited to do so.More MORNINGS WITH MARIA next, live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Baseball is back but it's been touch and go as games are being postponed and rescheduled due to the pandemic. Miami Marlins CEO Derek Jeter defending his players after half of them tested positive for COVID. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DEREK JETER, CEO, MIAMI MARLINS: I'm hoping that the first question today is about the health of our players who tested positive because it really has been disheartening to not read anything about that. We continue to hear and read about rumors about our players' actions in Atlanta and we need to stop that.Our team and our players deserve better than that. And as I mentioned these guys are sick.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Major League Baseball cancelling a game between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago White Sox that was to be played on the Field of Dreams in Iowa.Jon, what do you think?HILSENRATH: Well, you know, you have to wonder if baseball is going to be able to finish the season the way things are going you know, if we see more outbreaks like this. And Derek Jeter is right. I never questioned Derek Jeter as a long-time Yankees fan. you have to worry about the players' health.I'm just going to point to one other thing, Maria, we've talked about before. As the father of a boy in high school, I know that America's real past time is Friday night lights, Friday night football and there's a Friday night football high school football games in jeopardy right now all over the country.So I just hope this thing gets under control so I could see my son play one last time this summer -- I mean this fall.BARTIROMO: Yes. But how does it get under control?HILSENRATH: Well, that is a problem. I mean that is why -- that's why I asked if we're going to actually end the baseball season and it's why they've canceled the football season in Maryland even though a lot of other states are keeping it going. But I don't know if we are going to be able to get there.BASENESE: I think this gets to the question of should we just not get back to life as normal. Is there anything we can effectively do, you know? I mean there are so many things -- the daily aspects of life that are vital to our morale that we just can't do right now.You can't watch your son play Friday night football. You can't watch our national pastime which was a huge thing coming out of September 11th to restore confidence in the country. And you know, I don't see that we've seen any effective way to control the spread of the coronavirus.We're not -- we're seeing positivity test rates go down, the death rates go down. As long as we're at capacity -- I know this may sound harsh and inhumane in some sense -- but as long as we're not at capacity in hospitals, can't we just get back to life as normal because otherwise if we don't we are going to try and shut down the country every time we have some kind of health scare. And I just don't think that's feasible for any Americans.BARTIROMO: A lot of people feel that way. A lot of people feel that way, Dagen.MCDOWELL: But it takes a great deal of care and how you interact with other people. Derek Jeter was talking about the Marlins, that they didn't go to bars and clubs. And it's my understanding they're not really sure where the first case came from in this group of players. But clearly it is important to Derek Jeter and his reputation. He is trying to stand up for himself and the organization.But, again, you have to take incredible care when you are interacting with people. You have to keep your distance if you can, and you have to wear a mask. And it is very hard to keep it under control and just to say oh, well if older people are at risk, stay away from them.It isn't easy. Take it from me. When you've got a dad who has a heart attack and is in the hospital and you have to go down there and take care of him, you do what you can. But it is not -- it is almost impossible to just stay away from your loved ones if they're over the age of 65.BARTIROMO: Yes.(CROSSTALK)HILSENRATH: I agree.HILSENRATH: In terms of getting back to normal life, we have more than 150,000 deaths and even if you're suspicious about, you know, how these deaths are counted, if you look at CDC statistics, access that, just counting sheer birth certificates, we're way over where we normally are.A lot of people are dying and life doesn't get back to normal for them or their families ever.BASENESE: Yes. But normal to where? Relative to what? We are dealing with a pandemic. I think at some point you have to -- you can't -- you can't wait --(CROSSTALK)BASENESE: -- we can't wait for a vaccine to get back to normal life. You can't shut the economy down every time someone gets --BARTIROMO: That's right.BASENESE: and again I have at-risk family members of age, I'm not advocating being reckless. Please don't misunderstand that.I am just saying at some point, we got to get back to doing life in a responsible way, instead of this fits and spasms of it's on, it's off, it's closed, it's not closed.MCDOWELL: We are -- but we are back to -- we are back to a life, a pandemic life. That a lot of -- again we have reopened in a safe way. If you walk around New York City -- I mean it's incredibly unfortunate that bars can't open inside, restaurants can't open inside, Broadway is totally shut down. But that's going to be the normal until there is a vaccine.But a lot of people are back on the job, a lot of people are going about their business, being safe. That is that is the life that we're living now.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: And the city seems a little better, too.HILSENRATH: On this issue of death, if you look (INAUDIBLE) at counting death certificates, it's up 20 to 40 percent above where it was a year ago. That is a lot of people dying.BASENESE: We didn't have the coronavirus then again. That is an irrelevant statistic to compare.HILSENRATH: Exactly.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Well look, this is the conversation -- this is the conversation taking place across the country, guys. It's really true.Stay with us. We'll be right back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, when it gets really cold, this ski cap makes into a ski mask.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, let's see.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I can't see.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hang on, hang on, hang on. Watch out, watch out, watch out.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It scared me. (INAUDIBLE) my whole life flashed in front of my eyes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did you see?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Nothing, it was too dark.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Suzanne Somers rocking into fame in the 1970s as Chrissie Snow (ph) on "Three's Company".Now the actress turned health and fitness guru is out with her 27th book, "A New Way to Age: The most cutting-edge advances in anti-aging".Joining us right now is the woman herself, Suzanne Somers. Suzanne, it is so great to see you this morning.SUZANNE SOMERS, AUTHOR: Hi there.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for being here.SOMERS: 5:00 in the morning.BARTIROMO: You are a princess to be getting up early for us.So look, you have been at this a long time. And you still look gorgeous and thin. What are you doing to stay fit and healthy during quarantine? First tell us that.SOMERS: Well, the nice thing is you can't go anywhere. You know, I grow my own food, I guess you're not surprised at that. And here's what we've been doing. Every night at 5:00 Al and I meet at our outdoor bar and we have a tequila. And I look forward to it all day.It takes my mind off of (INAUDIBLE) but that's not what this book is about. It's not about drinking tequila. But you know, I used to have a glass of wine if I wanted to have any alcohol. And I noticed where I was going with all these books about hormones. I noticed that women get sort of puffy and big on the upside of their bodies and you're realized it's the yeast and the sugar from wine.So my kids said, why do you drink tequila. I said well, I have never had a hard liquor drink in my life. They go well, tequila has little to no sugar so I tried it and I liked it and so that's my little nasty habit and we only have one but it's, I don't know. We dance and we have a really good time together.But what I wanted to write about is now that I'm 73, I am chronologically old but I'm not old. You know what I mean? And I have been living the life that I write about for all these years. I guess I've been writing -- I've written 27 books. A long time I've been writing books.My first book was in 1973. And I was discovered by Johnny Carson in the commissary at NBC, Burbank. I eat like -- I have positive thoughts. I love my husband. I'm on biogenical (ph) hormones because I realized that aging is about worn out parts.And so if you -- what I have about in this book is about every chance you could possibly take from life extension so the price is real good. You want to know what your toxic burden is like how many -- you test for (INAUDIBLE). You can test for mineral deficiencies, nutrient deficiencies.All the things that with aging kind of decline, the new thinking is put it back naturally so you can minimize your use of pharmaceutical drugs. I'm not anti-pharmaceutical. When you need them, you need them. And they're a godsend.BARTIROMO: Yes.SOMERS: But if you can do it naturally, there are two things that most people don't know about. I live in a 100-year-old house in Palm Springs. So there are (INAUDIBLE) and filled with debris. And you got to have roto- rooter guy come and clean them out.Well the same thing happens to ourselves. So aging is about malfunctioning cells and the ratio to functioning cells. There is a supplement called (INAUDIBLE). It's about $5 a week, you take two tablets every week and what cytolytics (ph) do is cleans out the cellular debris in each cell allowing the cell to actually reverse aging and get young again.So that's one thing that I write about in "New Way to Age".There's another thing called NAD, a lot of people have heard of that. You'll be impressed with me -- nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. But it's easier to say NAD. NAD is something you take every day and that repairs the DNA breaks. So there are two reverse aging things that don't cost much that actually turn the clock back. I mean I go into great depth writing about them here.I have (INAUDIBLE) with a different way to approach that.BARTIROMO: And we've been -- we've been showing on the screen some of your tips like eating right, you said. and doing yoga every day. Also you said you stopped using artificial and toxic chemicals.You mentioned the alcohol and tequila and wine -- is it that tequila has less sugar, Suzanne?SOMERS: Yes, little to no sugar if you drink the clear. The brown tequila is all sugar. But I don't know. I know -- I think -- I live in Palm Springs. I think everybody in Palm Springs at 5:00 has a cocktail. It's just -- that's what people do there. And Al and I started doing this. We have this bar outside we call Big Al's Bar. And what I now do, twice a week I have a Facebook Live show where -- actually there will be one Friday night. We did one Tuesday night. So every Tuesday and Friday I have these Facebook Live shows where, wow, they're coming. They're coming in the thousands and hundreds of thousands.BARTIROMO: Well, we've --SOMERS: And all these -- these people have been reading my books all these years. So we have a cocktail (INAUDIBLE) and we have a real good time.BARTIROMO: Well, we've been talking about this and I coming to that Facebook Live party one of these nights, Suzanne. I'm looking forward to it. Thank you so much. Congrats on another book and looking healthy and strong and beautiful, as always.SOMERS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Suzanne Somers, great to have you this morning. Thank you.SOMERS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon.Check out the book, "A New Way to Age," by Suzanne Somers.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Argentina reaching a deal with creditors to restructure its debt.Cheryl Casone with the details now.Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Maria, this is just breaking. The country has just reached a $65 billion agreement with three of its creditors. This is going to help the country restructure a massive debt load. Under the deal, Argentina will change the payment dates for some of its new bond issuance. Some major Argentine bondholders include, we should add here, Fidelity Management and Research Company, Monarch Alternative Capital. Again, big market news just breaking this morning.Well, Zoom video is suspending direct sales to its customers in China. That starts August 23rd. Which means those users will have to work with Zoom's partners on China's mainland. Not clear what's behind Zoom's decision, but the company has been under scrutiny for connections with China, such as unintentionally routing some meeting through Chinese servers.Taking a look at Zoom in the pre-market, down a quarter percent.Finally, Orlando Magic Forward Jonathan Isaac made headlines last week when he stood instead of kneeled for the national anthem. Well, now, his jersey is flying off the shelves. Isaac says he stood because he feels that kneeling and wearing certain t-shirts does not support black lives. His jersey became the second best seller in the NBA's website this past weekend behind LeBron James. Unfortunately, Isaac will miss the rest of the season, Maria. He tore his ACL on Sunday.And those are your headlines from he newsroom.Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you.We are looking at the mail-in voting debate now.President Trump spoke out about this yesterday on an expected lawsuit against the state of Nevada. It just passed legislation to automatically send mail-in ballots to voters.Here's the president.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You'll have somebody like the governor of Nevada come out with this massive plan out of nowhere to take millions of ballots and send them all over the place. You'll never know who won that state. It will get messed up. But universal mail-in ballots is going to be a great embarrassment to our country.We will be suing in Nevada. And that's already been taken care of. We'll probably file something tomorrow.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now to talk more about that is Trump 2020 National Press Secretary Hogan Gidley.Hogan, it is great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for being here.HOGAN GIDLEY, NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY, TRUMP 2020: Thanks so much for the time, Maria. I appreciate it.BARTIROMO: So, Hogan, here we are in a shutdown because of coronavirus. The pandemic, obviously, something we are all dealing with.I understand the risks around mail-in voting, but what is the president going to do? He can't sue every state that decides to legislate and send these mail-in voting ballots out, can he, given the fact that they can just say, look, we have to send them out because of the coronavirus shutdown?GIDLEY: But there are already mechanisms in place to vote. You can do that through absentee voting, of course.This situation in which the Democrats are trying to do universal mail-in voting is rife with the potential for fraud and for cheating.And I always find it ironic, Democrats always project on to Republicans the very thing they themselves are guilty of actually doing.A great example, they accused this president of colluding with Russia to change the outcome of an election. It was the Democrats who actually bought and paid for a Russian dossier that was filled with things from a British spy. So talk about foreign interference.This issue is exactly the same. They're accusing the president of trying to change the date of the election. Well, let's be clear, in ten states Democrats are suing so that those states can allow votes to come in after Election Day. They are literally trying to change the date of an election and blaming us for it.Nevada is a great example. They've legalized ballot harvesting, meaning I can just go into a nursing home and take 500 votes and take them down to the polling place anytime I want. They've legalized voting after Election Day.It's like if I woke up in Nevada on Wednesday morning and said, oh, guess what, Donald Trump's winning by 5,000 votes, the DNC says, hey, go find me 5,001 votes. You can do that under Nevada's new law. It's absolutely ridiculous. It makes our election system compromised. And it takes away the sacred right of one -- one vote for one person and it won't count the way it normally has because people can double dip.Those universal votes, the mail-in ballots, will come to their homes whether they've requested them or not, meaning they can go on Election Day and vote --BARTIROMO: Yes.GIDLEY: And they can vote by mail. The whole thing is just a total scam. But the president's on to it and we're going to try to make it stop.BARTIROMO: Well -- well, you make a lot of good points because I know that the Democrats have done that, blame the Republicans for something they're doing. I mean the Russia probe is a perfect example, that's true. Hillary Clinton and the Democrats paid for the dossier and they used it to spy on the Trump campaign.GIDLEY: Right.BARTIROMO: But now you're seeing this movement. The media is also involved. Whether it be mail-in votings, technology companies suppressing conservative conversation, or now this new thing that's comes out where the media is all on board for it, to throw out this idea of no debates --GIDLEY: Yes.BARTIROMO: And, you know, Joe Biden should not agree to do any debates to - - Tom Friedman in "The New York Times" is saying, well, don't give a pass to Trump by doing a debate.How are you going to stop it, Hogan? I mean what can the president really do to make sure that the voting booths are where people decide on the next president and not these mail-in votings? Can you do anything other than the president suing Nevada?GIDLEY: Well, listen, it's pretty clear, the media are good at a couple things, attacking Republicans and protecting their own. And it's pretty clear that the Democrats are someone -- a group that they, obviously, side with politically. It mirrors their own personal agendas. And so they're trying to attack this president in every way they possibly can. And through this mail-in voting system, through the debates, it's no different.They don't want Joe Biden out there debating. You've seen what he is on the -- on the stump when he's not scripted. You've seen him fall apart and say crazy things about children loving to rub his leg hair and all types of claims about, you know, that -- that he doesn't know the date of -- the year of 9/11. Those are the types of things they don't want to -- the public to see.But while the Democrats are counting on the media, we are counting on the people. And they're the ones who are going to stand up and say, no, we want a free and fair election because we know if it's free and if it's fair, Donald Trump will be re-elected to four more years.BARTIROMO: Hogan, do you believe these polls, because in many polls the president is lagging Joe Biden. What's the story on the polls?GIDLEY: So many of the polls are bad for -- for various amount of reasons, but typically they track the same methodology they used in 2016, except this time they tend to be worse. Whereas in exit polling, for example, in 2016, they got about 36 percent of the sample were Democrats. Now they're sampling 46 percent of Democrats. So they're really trying to depress the voters.But our voters are excited. They're enthusiastic. They're the ones that are going to turn out and vote for this president. No one's excited about Joe Biden.BARTIROMO: All right, we'll leave it there.Hogan, it's great to see you this morning. Of course we'll be watching.Hogan Gidley joining us this morning on the Trump 2020 campaign.Coming up, a personal milestone. Today marks 25 years to the day since I first reported from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Today I'll be ringing the opening bell to mark the occasion. And, next, we're going to take a look back at some of the most special moments.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Today marks 25 years to the day that Maria Bartiromo became the first reported to appear live from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: I remember the first day, when I first got down there on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. It was scary. You have to remember, at that time it was a sea of suits. It was all men.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The action has started on the New York Stock Exchange. Standing by, right in the middle of all this, CNBC's own Maria Bartiromo.I think I see you down there, Maria.BARTIROMO: Hi there. I am down here. I'm amongst everyone else.I got the job because Dick Grasso, then the chairman and CEO of the NYSE, wanted to demystify things and actually explain how trading works. He wanted somebody to do that. I'm so proud to be able to say that I helped really democratize information and help investors get on a level playing field which the institutional investors by getting the same information at the same time.I did face obstacles when I got down there initially because there were a lot of people who did not want me there. I had to have sharp elbows. I had to be tough. I had to stand my ground. And it's hard sometimes, in the middle of it, when you've got guys constantly making snide remarks about you and pushing you out of the way. I had to push back.I remember I used to tell my assistants if they came in with low cut or short skirts, I would say, don't wear that again. It's important to understand that you want to be taken seriously and want them to look at you and understand you're talking professionally about business and don't have a lot of distractions for them to think about other stuff.I was never offended by the term "money honey." People would say to me, aren't you upset that people are calling you this? Of course not. I found it to be a complement. And I never questioned whether or not my viewers or my sources took me seriously. I knew they did.I watched the first plane go into the first building on television from my office and then I raced downstairs, went to the corner of Wall Street and Broadway, watched the second plane go into the second tower, in person, right in front of me. I hid in the MetLife building across the street from the New York Stock Exchange under a -- in a little stairwell. And I remember a woman next to me was crying so much, and I said, you have to stop crying, we need to get through this together.On Monday, September 17th, the markets reopened. I remember that morning my boss called me, Bob Bright (ph). He said to me, Maria, don't forget when you go on today the world is watching. And it was sobering. You could only say, we are down but we are not out. We will rise again.The best piece of advice I was ever given was by my mother who said to me, excellence comes through preparation. She wrote that down on a little piece of paper for me decades ago and she put it on my desk. And I always would look at it every morning. That's what I did. I knew some guys had it in for me. I knew some of them didn't want me there. And you know what I did, I went home and said, I'm going to own this job.The last day of my recording on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange was incredible. They have a tradition of, when somebody leaves, they do what's called a clap off. And basically trading stocks, I couldn't believe it, it was like more than I could take. I started hysterical crying.I'm really grateful for all the people on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange who I've been able to grow with and be friends with for years and years. It's an incredible place and they really do support one another.(END VIDEOTAPE)MCDOWELL: Thank you to the New York Stock Exchange and for CNBC for their use of photographs and all of that footage.Maria, it just -- I mean it makes me emotional for so many -- for so many reasons because I know what you did for women. I know what you did for women in finance. I know what you did for women across this country, standing there and being your strong self and just being as brilliant as you are.So what was one of the most significant moment on the -- on the floor you - - you know, looking back?BARTIROMO: Well, I -- and thank you so much for saying that, Dagen.I think one of the most significant things is what I said in that piece, and that is the idea that investors can get information about trading as it was happening.I used to be on the floor and I -- I loved going into the crowd. So I would say, in the morning, look, you know, IBM is the stock to watch. We're going in. And then we would -- and then I would walk into the crowd and say, what does the market look like? What does the market look like? And I would be able to get out where IBM was poised to open before you had to call your broker. So you actually had it as soon as we knew it on the floor. And that was so significant.And opening up the morning call, being able to, you know, get into the office and call sources at different trading desks and find out what they were pushing, what they were telling their clients to do, getting that info out so that the individual can be on the same playing field as the institution. I'm really, really proud of that.But mostly I just want to say that everybody at the New York Stock Exchange was so kind to me, even though there were a handful of people who didn't like the idea that things were changing, that Dick Grasso wanted to open it up, and that cameras would be there, me, a woman, having the camera. Most of the people down there were so supportive and really wanted me to do well. And I've made so many friends down there. I'm so grateful, not just of the New York Stock Exchange. I'm also very grateful to CNBC for all that they did to help democratize information and put me on the floor of the exchange. I can't believe it's been 25 years and it's definitely emotional for me today looking back on all of those years. So much has occurred in this 25-year period.MCDOWELL: Well, collect yourself -- so collect yourself so I don't get emotional.We'll be right back.More on Maria's 25th anniversary right after the break.MCDOWELL: Marking a milestone.Maria Bartiromo, you revealed how the Wall Street boys club made your life tough when you were first broadcasting from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, but you powered through. And I just wanted to reiterate that you were a picture of grace and strength and toughness and brilliance. And women across the country could watch you. Young girls could watch you.I was just starting out as a financial journalist and you gave me inspiration and a roadmap of how to do my job. And I just -- I -- I think words will fail to capture the impact that you've had on so many people in this -- in this country and really around the world.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for saying that.I think that, you know, when women saw me down there, and they said, well, look, she's in the middle of all of those guys and she's in the middle of a sea of suits, then I -- why -- why aren't I having a better handle on my finances and, oh, I could do that. So I hope that it did give emerging women and emerging generations the confidence to go get them.Look, when I first got to the (INAUDIBLE) there was definitely upset by it.MCDOWELL: By -- wait, by the way, we have a -- we have a -- we have something for you.BARTIROMO: Oh, OK.MCDOWELL: We have something for you to show you how much we love you and for all your work. Ba-boom, there you go.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Congratulations.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.Oh, my goodness. You guys are too much. Thank you.MCDOWELL: She loves -- you love flowers. Hydrangeas, orchids, roses.BARTIROMO: I do. You're right.MCDOWELL: But I interrupted you. Go ahead.BARTIROMO: I could not be more grateful to this team. No, no, I could not be more grateful for you, to this team, Patrick, Rachel, the entire team who worked so hard to put this program on every day. And I'm so proud of it. And I'm so proud of the last 25 years. So much has happened in this last 25 years, I feel so grateful. Grateful to all of you, grateful to the New York Stock Exchange, to CNBC, to Fox Business for giving me this opportunity.I'm still working the hardest I've ever worked and loving it. I'm very grateful.We'll take a break.When we come back, marking 25 years. I'll be ringing the opening bell this morning in honor of my anniversary, this morning at 9:30 a.m. Eastern on "VARNEY AND COMPANY." I hope you'll join me.More MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business right after this.BARTIROMO: Thank you Dagen McDowell, Jon Hilsenrath, and Lou Basenese.

US talks tougher on Chinese tech, but offers few specificsAssociated Press Financial WireAugust 6, 2020 Thursday 12:58 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 410 wordsByline: TALI ARBEL, AP Technology WriterDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday called for a big expansion of U.S. government curbs on Chinese technology, saying that it wants to see “untrusted Chinese apps" pulled from the Google and Apple app stores.Outside experts called Pompeo's proposal vague and possibly illegal.Pompeo called out popular video app TikTok and the messaging app WeChat, which people in the U.S. use to communicate with others in the U.S. and China, as “significant threats to the personal data of American citizens, not to mention tools for CCP content censorship.” CCP refers to the Chinese Communist Party.The U.S. government has already been cracking down on Chinese technology companies. For instance, it has long singled out telecom equipment provider Huawei, encouraging allies not to use its equipment in their high-speed 5G wireless networks and banning U.S. telecom companies from using government funds for equipment and services from Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese telecom equipment provider.Citing national security concerns, it has also barred Google from providing its Android apps such as Google Maps for Huawei phones. The Federal Communications Commission is considering barring operations of Chinese telecom companies China Telecom and China Unicom, which provide services in the U.S., due to national-security concerns.President Donald Trump has also threatened to ban TikTok, although the legal basis for such a move remains uncertain.“It’s a PR stunt. No specifics. It’s an objective,” George Washington University professor Susan Ariel Aaronson said by email.Eurasia Group analyst Paul Triolo said the U.S. government is trying to push its allies and companies to stop using Chinese gear and software “at all levels of their communications networks, from the internet backbone to app stores.” That includes calling for companies to yank their apps from Huawei's app store, which advertises that it contains apps from European and U.S. companies like travel service Booking and Amazon.The legal authority for the administration to take action against apps and app stores is unclear, Triolo write in a research note. The State Department did not immediately a question seeking information about the legal authority the administration could use to justify such measures.The initiative is meant to force countries and companies to choose sides between the U.S. and China, Triolo said. He expects many companies and governments to resist.Load-Date: August 5, 2020End of Document

Microsoft CEO plunges into tensions between US and China in search of deal with TikTokCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 5, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 939 wordsBodyMerger agreements are rarely simple. But at Microsoft Corp, executive director Satya Nadella is now trying to sign a takeover agreement that satisfies not only companies and their shareholders, but two governments in stiff competition for technological influence.If it works, acquiring TikTok's U.S. operations from Chinese parent company ByteDance Ltd. could be a boon for Microsoft's business, giving it 100 million mostly young users to boost its consumer-oriented operations. But the search for TikTok has put the software giant at the center of the U.S.-China firestorm.Nadella has been in an unconventional stance for a CEO, having spoken to President Trump on the phone about the deal on Sunday. Then, in a statement, the CEO took the unusual step of thanking the president for his personal participation in the negotiations. On Monday, Trump insisted that some of the purchase price of the deal would go to the U.S. Treasury, a term that some observers described as inappropriate.There's a lot at stake for Microsoft. The company has big business with the U.S. government and last year won a $10 billion cloud computing contract with the Pentagon, which disputes the losing bidder Amazon.com Inc. His business in China, Microsoft President Brad Smith said in January, accounted for 1.8 percent of total revenue, or more than $2 billion a year. The company does not break down China's sales in its financial filings.In China, talking about a sale of TikTok has dropped sharply. The Global Times, a tabloid Communist Party newspaper, ridiculed the situation as "the hunt and looting of TikTok by the United States government in conjunction with high-tech companies in the United States." One risk for Microsoft is that the Chinese government will retaliate for the company's role in an agreement with TikTok, as political analysts suggested, such as attacking Chinese versions of its Bing search engine or LinkedIn, the business-focused social media platform that Microsoft purchased in 2016Microsoft has been able to keep those services running in China even when other tech giants have declined, in part by agreeing to meet the Chinese government's censorship requirements. The Facebook Inc. service is prohibited in China. Google removed its search engine from the country due to censorship of search results.What has helped Microsoft's relative success in China has been its focus under Mr. Nadella in selling to commercial customers rather than trying to attract consumers. "Because Microsoft has focused on the company, it has been much easier for them to operate in China," said Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University's Stern Business School. "The conflict of interest between Microsoft products and what the Chinese government is interested in controlling is minimal."Microsoft has for years managed to maintain good relations with political leaders in Washington and Beijing. Nadella hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Washington, in 2015. A year later, the CEO visited Beijing and met with political leaders there. Later, in 2016, Nadella and Smith, who played an important role in helping the CEO deal with Washington, joined other top executives for a technology summit convened by Trump, then president-elect, making Microsoft one of only two companies, along with the parent company ofGoogle, Alphabet Inc., in sending two executives.Since Trump took office, Microsoft criticized the administration's immigration policies and requested exceptions. But the company also defended its work with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement service tasked with implementing those policies, and with the Pentagon after its rival Google stopped bidding for a cloud computing agreement with the military.Even with its successes, the Chinese market has long posed challenges for Microsoft. Unbridled piracy of your Windows operating system and Office productivity applications made it difficult to grow your business.More recently, Microsoft has made progress, convincing the Chinese government to take strong action against pirated software, said Paul Triolo, head of the global technology policy practice at Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. It has also partnered with China's 21Vianet Group to sell its booming cloud services locally.In 2017, Microsoft introduced a version of its Windows 10 software specifically for use by the Chinese government. The custom version included a different type of encryption and other changes. "We designed Windows to enable the use of local encryption for large public sector customers," the company said, adding that it worked with government customers elsewhere to address "problems that matter to them."During the pandemic, the company announced the growth in China of Teams, its new video conferencing and collaboration product that Microsoft sees as its next box office hit. Between late January and early March, Microsoft said it had seen a 500% increase in meetings, calls, and conferences that took place through teams in China.Microsoft's possible agreement for TikTok's U.S. business has also generated criticism in some corners of the U.S. "Microsoft helped China build its great firewall that is used to sometimes monitor, monitor, censor, and imprison the Chinese people," Said Peter Navarro, the president's economic adviser, in an interview with Fox News over the weekend. "We have to be very careful with this."Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a longtime critic of China, in a tweet, called the purchase of TikTok by an American company that secures the data "a positive and acceptable outcome."Load-Date: August 6, 2020End of Document

MCSALLY, BLACKBURN DEMAND CHINA REPAY ITS $1.6 TRILLION DEFAULTED DEBTStates News ServiceAugust 13, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 590 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Arizona Senator Martha McSally:U.S. Senators Martha McSally (R-AZ) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) today introduced a concurrent resolution calling for the People's Republic of China (PRC) to make good on a sovereign debt of $1.6 trillion owed to 20,000 American families.Between 1900 and 1940, the Republic of China issued millions of dollars in sovereign debt around the world, including in the United States. They defaulted on this debt in 1938, and in 1949, the Communist Party, led by Mao Zedong, took over China, forming the PRC. Under international law, the PRC as a successor government of Republic of China is responsible for repaying its debts.However, China reneged on its financial obligations, and as a result, 20,000 families in over 46 states were never repaid. In 1987, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher successfully demanded China repay the bonds. This resolution calls on President Trump to do everything in his power to achieve resolution and repayment of the defaulted sovereign debt, currently valued at $1.6 trillion according the American Bondholders Foundation, of the PRC for 20,000 families in the United States."China has repeatedly failed to honor its obligations to America, taking American families' money and jobs," McSally said. "Well, the abuse ends here. We are holding China accountable for their debt and for unleashing the coronavirus on the world. We demand China pay back the $1.6 trillion it owes to American families.""Senator McSally and I introduced the Civil Justice for Victims of COVID Act to give Americans a pathway to sue the Chinese government for its role in the spread of the coronavirus," Blackburn said. "However, this is not the first time China's actions have had an outsized impact on the American people. Twenty thousand American families are still owed a collective $1.6 trillion from a debt on which China defaulted in the early 20th Century. What 2020 has made clear is that the status quo is not working when it comes to our relationship with China."The resolution can be found here.Senator McSally is committed to holding China accountable.On July 29, McSally introduced legislation that would require online retailers like Amazon to disclose the origin of products made in China.On July 22, McSally spoke on the Senate floor about China's malevolent behavior.On July 21, McSally introduced two bills to protect American taxpayers and prevent the Chinese Communist Party from using American public transportation and military technology as a means to undermine America.On July 21, McSally cosponsored bipartisan legislation to help stop foreign governments, particularly China, from stealing American taxpayer-funded research and intellectual property developed at U.S. colleges and universities.On July 20, McSally introduced the Civil Justice for Victims of COVID Act to allow Americans to sue China in federal court for its role in causing the coronavirus pandemic.On June 18, McSally and Barrasso's op-ed ran in the Washington Times stating: "China will stop at nothing for world dominance ... From here on out, rare-earth minerals and other essential materials must be domestically sourced or supplied by our allies."On May 14, McSally introduced the Securing America's Vaccines for Emergencies (SAVE) Act to diversify the country's medical supply chain and reduce U.S. dependence on China.On March 20, McSally called on America to stop outsourcing to China the manufacturing of items that are critical to our national security.###Load-Date: August 13, 2020End of Document

Trump Announces Sanctions On Chinese Officials, Including Hong Kong LeaderThe Daily CallerAugust 7, 2020 Friday 01:50 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 386 wordsByline: Anders Hagstrom, White House Correspondent, anders@dailycaller.comBodyLink to ImagePresident Donald Trump's administration announced sanctions against 11 Chinese officials on Friday, including Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, Bloomberg reported.The sanctions apply to certain members of the Chinese government, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and some Chinese companies. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo listed seven of the officials the sanctions will hit, including Lam, Teresa Cheng, Erick Tsang, Zheng Yanxiong, Eric Chan, John Lee Ka-chiu and Chris Tang.The U.S. says each played a role in enacting a recent national security law in Hong Kong that effectively ended its status as a Western-style democracy and placed it fully under the control of the CCP.“This law, purportedly enacted to 'safeguard' the security of Hong Kong, is in fact a tool of CCP repression,” Pompeo said in a statement released to the press. NEWS: The Trump admin is poised to impose sanctions on Chinese officials including CARRIE LAM. The new sanctions will be announced today. Will also target Chinese companies and Communist Party officials, sources tell me, @nwadhams and @jendeben. - Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) August 7, 2020The news comes less than a day after Trump signed executive orders prohibiting transactions with mobile applications TikTok and WeChat, which are owned by Chinese companies ByteDance and Tencent respectively. Those orders will go into effect in 45 days, at which time the order says no U.S. transactions can be made with ByteDance regarding TikTok, nor with Tencent regarding WeChat. (RELATED: TikTok Pledges To Fight Political Misinformation, Foreign Interference Ahead Of 2020 Election)“The spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China) continues to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States,” both orders read.The text of the order initially spread concern that the order would affect Tencent's other subsidiaries as well. Tencent owns Riot Games and has a 40% stake in Epic Games, the companies behind some of the most popular video games in the country, including League of Legends, Valorant and Fortnite.White House officials clarified that the order only prohibits transactions with ByteDance and Tencent that are related to either TikTok or WeChat.Graphic June 28, 2019 - China's President Xi Jinping (R) shakes hands with US President Donald Trump before a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Osaka. - From the Arab Spring to bloodletting in Syria, from Obama to Trump, from terror in the streets of Paris to Brexit, the 2010s began with hope for a more equitable world, and end with a slide towards nationalistic populism.

The Dow finishing its best August in more than 30 years. Markets bouncing back from the coronavirus pandemic; that gauge seeing a 57 percent increase since March.Joining me now, Applico CEO Alex Moazed in joining our conversation all morning long. Pollster and maslansky + partners President, and Persuasion author Lee Carter, oh Lee, can't wait to talk about polls with you, and CampusReform.org's Editor In-Chief Cabot Phillips. Welcome one and all.Alex, to you first. What gives with these markets with quite frankly just devastation across the economy?Alex, can you hear me OK?ALEX MOAZED, FOUNDER AND CEO, APPLICO: Yes, I can hear you.MCDOWELL: So just explain the kind of runaway record-breaking markets with an economy that's still in many places flat on its back.MOAZED: Yes, I mean we just see these tech platforms, many of them monopoly stocks booming and with no end in sight. We have PLAT, I mean WisdomTree's primary growth fund is up over 14 percent in the past 30 days compared to S&P, which is about 9 percent. So we see CRM added to the Dow Jones. These tech monopolies are able to just continue to reinvest in growth and they're not slowing down.MCDOWELL: Is there any end in sight?MOAZED: As we see with Facebook, for example, Zuckerberg just saying that they're going to continue to invest not only domestically, but abroad. We see many of our large U.S. tech companies investing in India, for example, with Jio.So they have plenty of resources, many of their businesses, even in businesses like hospitality or travel, you see these platform businesses, these marketplace businesses right where they have two-sided network effects, you see them dip less back in March-April and you've seen them bounce back much faster.And they've been able to invest in growth whereas other more traditional linear businesses have not been able to do that. So they are actually being able to use COVID in this inevitable shift to just digital behaviors to their advantage. So no, I don't think there's much of an end in sight.MCDOWELL: When you're talking about the business versus the stock prices, and is there any concern for you about just pure gambling and speculation in a name like Tesla, or even Apple?Because just personally, I've seen people who used to bet on sports, and when sports shut down, they turned through Robinhood to essentially speculating on these stocks. So the growth might be as far as I can see, but there is kind of still a disconnect, if you will, between the stocks and the actual underlying companies.MOAZED: Yes, I mean I'd say the whole stock market, there is kind of a question around reality versus what we see in the stock prices these days. Apple, specifically, I think there's some real China exposure there, especially if we look at what you were just talking about with TikTok and some of the Chinese tech companies operating in the U.S. So that would be my concern on Apple frankly. And Tesla, I guess, to a certain degree as well also has similar type of exposure.MCDOWELL: Let's talk about China and TikTok, a deal to sell that app's U.S. division reportedly now stalled over new Chinese restrictions on exporting artificial intelligence or AI. TikTok's parent company ByteDance in talks with companies including Microsoft, Walmart and Oracle. The Trump Administration has set a mid-September deadline for a deal. Alex, what do you make of this?MOAZED: This deal scares me and I think the ban is appropriate as we've seen with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. striking down the sale of Grindr, which is like Tinder for the LGBT community. They shut that down over similar concerns around privacy. The ban is appropriate, what scares me is frankly, potential sabotage, not necessarily by ByteDance but by the CCP. We know that CCP likes to control their image internationally and they don't want to be seen as being strong handed by the U.S. to sell their prized asset in TikTok.So you have 14 million lines of source code here. There - if you're front loading any - if it's a $25 billion check and you're front loading that cash to ByteDance, I think there's a real risk. But you don't really know what you're getting until very long after the purchase day. So that's the first concern, is around frankly just nefarious activity. Maybe ByteDance doesn't even want it to happen, but all of the product and engineering of TikTok is in China, and there is only so much control that ByteDance has relative to the Chinese government's influence on the employees.Second concern is just the people. You're buying the shell a company, right? You're buying code and data, but who are all the people that are going to work on this business? Microsoft doesn't have a consumer content platform business with just hundreds of people lying around that can go and work on this business.I think they need to look at buying Triller, for example, which is the number two kind of TikTok competitor based in the United States. Just purely for the people who are then going to run this business and work on the product, because you can't have the Chinese engineers and product managers working on the code that you've now just acquired from Chinese- located ByteDance. There's some real risk here.MCDOWELL: Every time we talk about this story, that's something that Maria Bartiromo brings up is the people and what are you really buying? Alex, great to see you. Thank you so much for being here. Alex Moazed. I hope - Alex, it's been a while, I hope I pronounced your name correctly. Please correct me - always feel free to.MOAZED: You did.MCDOWELL: OK.MOAZED: Thanks for having me.MCDOWELL: Please feel free to correct me if I foul up. Alex, great to see you.Here's a look at your morning mover.

And Oregon's governor is calling back state police. But a war of words is brewing between President Trump and Portland's Mayor Ted Wheeler who blamed the president for the violence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TED WHEELER, MAYOR OF PORTLAND: Mr. President, while this is the first time in decades that America has seen this level of violence, it's you who have created the hate and the division.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Joining me now former NYPD lieutenant and Pace University law enforcement professor Darrin Porcher. Darrin it's always great to see you. You have this mayor who has stood by and watched this unrest develop, the anarchy and the mayhem in his streets for literally three months. And he is still pointing fingers at somebody else who doesn't happen to run his city, or even run his state.DARRIN PORCHER, FORMER NYPD LIEUTENANT: Well, it is unfortunate. Mayor Ted Wheeler needs to take a look in the mirror and place blame on himself. Initially, President Trump sent in federal law enforcement agency support in Portland in connection with the protection of federal statutes and federal courthouses.However, there was a peace accord that was brokered between the elected officials in Portland and the White House, whereas they look at a switch out the federal law enforcement officers with state police.That subsequently didn't work, because the violence continued to manifest. And so, now President Trump was merely taking a second bite at the apple, because when we see the violence displayed in that city has subsequently led to a death of a counter protester in connection with Black Lives Matter sympathizers and Trump supporters.So it's just par for the course that the president steps in and sets forth a level of protection for the citizens in Portland. The silent majority in Portland is under siege by anarchists and this I believe is the right step to take appropriately.MCDOWELL: And don't forget, when those federal officers were sent in lawfully to protect the federal courthouse, you had people all over the media and even in politics saying that the reason that there was unrest in the city is because of the very presence of those federal officers.And when they left, guess what, you had week after week after week of ongoing violence and unrest. So again, that's why people don't believe, and don't even - and stop listening to the rhetoric out of people like Ted Wheeler.PORCHER: This is unfortunate and I see this happening with a lot of the democratically-controlled cities. No one is taking responsibility for the anarchy displayed in these cities, more so specific to the Democratic Party.The Democratic Party has failed to take responsibility for the violence, so to speak, that's plaguing these populations, and it's the Republican contingent that's saying, "Hey, wait a minute, when do we go to place some moratorium on this violence that's plaguing these cities?"So I just think President Trump is just doing what's right, because he's ultimately responsible as a commander in-chief for the police actions and the safety of the citizens of the United States. That's three - excuse me, that's 360 million citizens that are in the United States and this is just par for the course.MCDOWELL: A call for calm over the wake and following the death of a St. Louis police officer. Officer Tamarris Bohannon shot in the head responding to a call Saturday afternoon; the suspect taken into custody after a nearly 12-hour standoff. Darrin, what needs to be done to end this violence?PORCHER: There's a dangerous precedence that's being set forth in America. And unfortunately, now is the time that law and order needs to come to the forefront. I believe in a democratic society and the First Amendment rights for individuals to protest, but we at certain point, we need to right the ship.And losing this police officer is a travesty not just to that police department, but all of the citizens that are being afforded the protections by this police department. Therefore, as a result, now is the time that we need to look forward to a more - sound system of protecting - of our society.MCDOWELL: Darrin, did you happen here in New York City, it's a growing problem and I would say that people or the people who live here, residents, citizens are increasingly distressed what about they see.There is a video that was all over the internet of a man trying to rape a woman on a subway platform on Lexington Avenue, and he was apparently arrested. But Darrin, again, the police are just not supported, certainly not here in New York to intervene and really stop these crimes before they happen.How does that change, and can it change with the current mayor, I've called him a frankenidiot before, with the current mayor still in office.PORCHER: Mayor de Blasio is the catalyst to the media replies in violence in connection with New York City. We have been plagued with unprecedented violent crime that is subsequently putting the citizens of New York, the 8.5 million citizens of New York in harm's way.We had a rapist, an attempted rapist, that looked to assault someone in the subway system which was in public. This really begs the question of when is Mayor de Blasio going to step down? I think that this is something that the governor needs to look to in terms of removing the mayor. And unfortunately, nothing is being done, and that's what's causing the violence to manifest.MCDOWELL: Darrin, great to see you. Thank you so much always. Darrin Porcher, we'll see you soon. I hope the circumstances are better next time.Coming up, the race for the White House tightening up, the latest polls and where President Trump is gaining ground, ahead.MCDOWELL: The race for the White House tightening up, the Republican National Convention giving President Trump a boost according to a new Yahoo! News YouGov poll; the poll showing that Joe Biden's lead shrinking to 6 points, the narrowest margin in nearly two months.Lee, what else are you watching here in terms of the polls tightening?LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: So there's a bunch of things that I'm actually watching, because these polls are really hard to understand exactly what's going on, because if you think back to 2016, we had very similar numbers.Hillary was ahead all the way through and yet she didn't win. So the things that I'm looking at, number one, independents. Your independents looking for, there is some polling that says that independents are 10 points ahead with - for Donald Trump over Joe Biden.The other thing I'm looking at is battleground states, because the nationwide polling is interesting in that it helps to understand sentiment where the direction is going, but it doesn't really help you understand Electoral College.So when you look at some of the races that are tightening in those battleground states, specifically I'm looking at Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, when you look at those races tightening, that's where Biden has to be concerned because he is now leading by much less of a margin than Hillary Clinton was at the same time in 2016.And I'm not surprised that his favorability rating is not moving, because the bottom line is this, Donald Trump is who Donald Trump is. Many people don't like him, but will still vote for him. And I think that's something else to watch for and there's other polling numbers that I'm really focused on to see how comfortable are people really expressing their political feelings in this moment.MCDOWELL: Right. I want to move on to the new ABC News-Ipsos poll showing Joe Biden and President Trump's standings remaining unchanged following the DNC; 31 percent of Americans favoring the president, with 46 percent backing Joe Biden. Cabot, what do you make of these newer polls?CABOT PHILLIPS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, CAMPUSREFORM.ORG: Well, I think the newer poll is showing Trump moving in a favorable direction, so the American people are just more interested in Donald Trump's message right now.Joe Biden message, it's clear at this point is we're going to tackle COVID and just the idea that Joe Biden is a nice guy and the people want that right now. I think the American people are a lot more concerned with the unrest in the streets, with the violence and with the economy getting back going. That seems to be Donald Trump's clear message coming out of the RNC and I think that's going to be a powerful one.And I do think that, with the violence continuing, every day that the Biden campaign refuses to come out and forcefully condemn it, is a day that they're going to suffer. And the reason that the Democrat Party and Joe Biden won't come out and more forcefully condemn these riots is because they're afraid of turning off a sizable portion of their base that doesn't have a problem with them.A sizable portion of their voter base really doesn't see a problem with destroying and looting property, because they don't think it's a problem. And so, I think that's why they that they haven't condemned it, and I do think long-term that's going to hurt the Biden camp moving forward, because people are fed up with it I think on both sides.MCDOWELL: Well, Lee, the Vice President Biden did come out with a statement yesterday on the violence in Portland, that shooting in Portland, but he essentially and if you go through it, he blames President Trump for it.And on that note, at the end of the day, all of those protesters you saw harassing, even attacking attendees of the RNC in Washington D.C., you think that they were Republican voters - attacking - Rand Paul attacking Congressman Brian Mast who is a double-amputee combat veteran, a Purple Heart recipient, screaming at elderly people.So again, that's what people are seeing, and it is not just Washington, but it is across the country. So the fact that Joe Biden was largely silent for months and now has come out and is trying to pivot and call it Trump's America. How do voters react to that? Is that one thing that's turning the tide?CARTER: Look, I think that the person who is reacting is not the one who has actually talked about this all the time. Biden is now reacting to Donald Trump's message. For the last two months, Donald Trump has been focused on law and order, he's been criticized for it, a lot of people have called him racist as a result of it.The bottom line is this, Americans are concerned about their physical safety. And whoever wins on safety, on making people feel the most safe is the one who is going to win in this moment and I think Joe Biden is just starting to realize that. His message is far too reactive in this moment.MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Lee. Can't wait to talk to you some more as the morning wears on.Coming up, the pandemic's effect, MGM forcing job cuts, details ahead. Plus, TikTok talks, say that five times fast, China throwing a wrench into President Trump's plans to obtain the popular social media app for an American company. Back in a minute.MCDOWELL: Welcome back, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, August 31st. Take a look at where markets are as we wrap up the month of trading. Turning to Dow, Nasdaq 100 and S&P, we have green across the board and they're kicking off the day, the Nasdaq and the S&P in record territory. The all three major market gauges on track for their fifth- straight month of gains. This after the Nasdaq and S&P closed out the week at all time highs. Checking in the globe, European markets are in the green. The English market is closed today, the FTSE 100 not trading, but France and Germany to the plus side.And Asia overnight, markets mostly lower, Japan's Nikkei bucking the trend in Asia, closing in the green. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway announcing a $6 billion investment in five Japanese companies including Mitsubishi and Mitsui. Meantime, the death toll from Hurricane Laura growing, Cheryl Casone has those details. Cheryl?CASONE: Yes, Dagen, that's right. At least, 18 people are dead across Louisiana and Texas. Residents are struggling to pick up the pieces, more than 300,000 homes and businesses still without power this morning. That can last for a month. The storm wiped out at least 170 major transmission towers. Well, MGM Resorts laying off 18,000 furloughed workers effective today. Business at MGM like other hotel casino operators severely disrupted by COVID-19 after reopening in June. Taking a look at the stock in the pre-market, it is actually higher by a little more than half a percent. Well, racial justice front and center at the "MTV Video Music" Awards, The Weeknd addressing recent protest during his acceptance speech for best R&B video.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ABEL MAKKONEN TESFAYE, SINGER & SONGWRITER : It's really hard for me to celebrate right now and enjoy this moment. So I'm just going to say justice for Jacob Blake and justice for Breonna Taylor.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, the show facing some backlash this morning over this performance by rapper DaBaby. He's seen standing on top of a police car while a city burns behind him. The show, though, still honoring actor Chadwick Boseman who died on Friday. They aired his 2018 acceptance speech after he won the award for best hero in a movie for "Black Panther". May he rest in peace, Dagen. And those are your headlines.MCDOWELL: I'm going to say something personal right now. Nothing has hit me harder since my mother died of cancer last November than Chadwick Boseman's death. And I think that, that goes for anybody who has lost a loved one to cancer, but my mother always said, I lived a long life, do not mourn for me. She was like -- she always said weep and pray for those who have still so much life to live and so much joy left to give.CASONE: Yes --MCDOWELL: And that really I think -- I just -- I think there was such a ground swell of emotion --CASONE: Yes --MCDOWELL: Across the country because no one knew that he was sick. But --CASONE: Yet, he hid it, yes, he hid it for four years, and then he was out doing all these appearances to inspire younger African-American men to dream their dreams, yet, he was --MCDOWELL: Well --CASONE: Sick at the time, which is just amazing --MCDOWELL: And going and visiting children sick with cancer, say at St. Jude Hospital.CASONE: Yes --MCDOWELL: But one more thing, I always used to say, oh, I would love if people who are sick when they're battling cancer, if they come out and discuss it, but you know what? I don't feel that way anymore. You do what you have to do to put your one foot in front of the other and lead a life and make contributions while you're still on this earth. And just --CASONE: Yes --MCDOWELL: God-speed to Chadwick Boseman --CASONE: He was -- he was too young --MCDOWELL: Yes --CASONE: Gone too soon, yes --MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Cheryl.CASONE: You bet.MCDOWELL: The race for the White House meantime, Joe Biden heading to Pennsylvania today, asking voters if they're safe in Donald Trump's America. President Trump announcing a visit to Kenosha, Wisconsin, tomorrow, following a week of violence and unrest, both candidates going head-to-head on issues of racial justice and safety and security. Joining me now, Mercury partner Bryan Lanza and Rock Solutions senior adviser Kristen Hawn. Bryan, how did the ongoing -- ongoing unrest impact voters in key battleground states because Joe Biden's lead in the critical battle grounds has narrowed significantly. He's only up by 2.7 points over Trump at this point in those states.BRYAN LANZA, FORMER TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Good morning, thank you. You know, it's compounding, you know, I think the last several months, you've seen President Trump's polls, poll numbers increase and he's been around states, is because he's trying and talking about what the post-COVID economy is going to look like. And now, he's even now starting to talk about law and order, public safety, you know, victims, you know, the suburban neighborhood which were becoming more and more, you know, leaning towards Biden starting to have second thoughts.And as they have second thoughts, this is the time that the president is pushing law and order message which is exactly what they want to hear right now. And so, you know, Biden took too long to address it and he's suffering the consequences.MCDOWELL: Vice President Biden did put out a statement yesterday, and here's some of what he said. "It is not a peaceful protest when you go out spoiling for a fight. What does President Trump think will happen when he continues to insist on fanning the flames of hate and division in our society. The job of a president is to lower the temperature to bring people who disagree with one another together to make life better for all Americans, not just those who agree with us, support us or vote for us."Kristen, the vice president was largely silent for months as this violence erupted in these cities, particularly, whether it's Portland, Seattle and other areas. And as Lee Carter pointed out, Joe Biden is now reacting -- he's reacting to President Trump -- that's a losing position.KRISTEN HAWN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I mean, I think the vice president is -- has a right message, and frankly, I'd like to see the president have more of a message of, you know, he's condemned violence on both the far- right and the far-left, it's time for our president to bring people together, that's what Joe Biden is trying to do. The president, though, clearly sees -- you know, the political calculation here is that, you know, these -- as long as there's unrest, you can have fears, fears he can capitalize on that. It's unfortunate. I am interested to see what he's going to say over the next couple of days, hopefully, it's one of coming together, understanding all sides.But understanding the law and order is at the top of others' minds right now. You know, the polls are always going to narrow, we knew that was going to happen. But I think that the message coming out from both campaigns or rather the president and the Biden campaign is really important for the American people.MCDOWELL: Don't you think though the Vice President Joe Biden should have been more forceful? I mean, he put out a written statement. But where was he when this violence started happening, the mayhem, the anarchy? These are small businesses that were trying to recover from the COVID shut down, literally being destroyed in places like Portland and Seattle. Where was the vice president in June and July on this?HAWN: Yes, I mean, the vice president has always condemned violence on both sides, and you know, it's -- the president often times has confused, you know, these violent actions which are unacceptable with peaceful protests. I mean, I myself was down in Washington D.C., at a peaceful protest when we were pepper sprayed or had tear gas on us, and you know, these are things that the president is confusing, the two of these things. We have to get law and order in place. I think the local officials in these states have a responsibility to do that. But we also have to understand that people are hurting right now, and there are -- there are black men and women being shot in the streets. And so, we need to come together as a community, the president has a role to play and as the commander-in-chief.MCDOWELL: Bryan, I'll just add one thing on that note. That the Senate Republicans tried to open debate, floor debate on police reform in June. And in all -- all proposals would have been guaranteed an up and down vote. Proposals from the Republicans and proposals from the Democrats. This is Senator Tim Scott's bill and the Senate Democrats filibustered it and basically shot or knocked down -- I didn't want to use the word, shot, knocked down, opening that debate. So that's where we are, if you want to talk about Democrats versus Republicans, Bryan.LANZA: I mean, the Democrats, not Republicans and President Trump are going to be politically weak in terms of all the violence occurring in these cities. That's why they took the position that they took in June and July and did nothing, because they thought the long-term political damage will be enough that would ultimately cost President Trump and his presidency. Now that position, now that political policy has backfired. Now, people have been asking where is Joe Biden? So much of a criticism of President Trump who is seen for not wearing a mask, and that's sort of touting the significance of a mask.You know, Joe Biden is going to -- he should have received the same criticism -- Joe Biden should have received the same criticism for being silent. And you know, they're this -- they're the ones that said silence is complicit. And so last -- you know, several months, Joe Biden has been complicit in these violence in American cities. And it's just tragic that it took -- it took several deaths, it took the instructions of thousands of businesses that is facing thousands -- millions of workers for us to finally get to the position of Joe Biden put a statement. Finally.MCDOWELL: Bryan and Kristen, thank you so much for having a reasonable conversation this morning. Great to see both of you. Coming up --HAWN: Thank you --MCDOWELL: Amazon helping keep you fit body and mind. The new fitness tracker following more than just your workouts, we take look. Plus, the very first virtual Video Music Awards, Lady Gaga's costume changes, just some of what's making a buzz this morning. You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.MCDOWELL: The battle for TikTok taking a new turn, and China tightening its export rules for technology, now including artificial intelligence. Reports now say these new rules are stalling a possible deal between TikTok's parent company and interested American companies including Microsoft and Wal-Mart and Oracle, Joining me now is Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives. Dan, how do you see this playing out?DAN IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH SECURITIES: Well, good, I think it throws wrench in negotiations. I ultimately think a deal would have been announced this weekend from Microsoft. TikTok -- but ultimately, this is China putting their hand into this. I think it stalls negotiations. But I think the outcome continues to be Microsoft for TikTok even though this definitely adds to the poker game.MCDOWELL: Is this really a good deal if Microsoft gets its hands on TikTok? Is that -- does it benefit Microsoft or does it bring heat and a headache?IVES: Yes, the Heat and the headache, I think are sort of noise, from Microsoft, it would be a golden opportunity. I mean, they could get an asset, recall 35 billion that I believe is worth 200, 250 billion in the next three years. And really, if you look from the down on Microsoft, it's a consumer strategy. I mean, a TikTok asset, this is something that comes on once every decade. So if they could get this, that's why they're so aggressively going after this along with Wal-Mart in terms of that consumer peace. So it would be a golden deal in the eyes of investors, now, obviously, it's getting through negotiations with this complicating things clearly.MCDOWELL: One of our earlier guests, Alex Malazar(ph) had brought this up, is that do -- does an American company acquiring the TikTok-U.S. division really know what it's getting in terms of code and data, and even and you factor in the people part. Again, when dealing with China and dealing with the Communist Party, they are -- I mean, are you in danger of getting something that -- well, doesn't amount to anything?IVES: Yes, I mean, look, from Microsoft and Redman, I mean, it's --MCDOWELL: Yes --IVES: In my view, it's probably some of the smartest engineers in the world. Right so, if you look at what Microsoft has done in terms of building out the cloud, I think there's no other company that I think it fits better in terms of -- and of course, Oracle, which is another innovative company going after TikTok. So I think Microsoft, they recognize the million lines of code and what's here in terms of TikTok. And I ultimately believe, you know, TikTok and to Microsoft significantly increases the evaluation, and Nadella and everything they've done out of a lot of confidence in Microsoft. I think investors do that this is something they realize what they're getting in terms of the size and the hundreds of millions of potential consumers.MCDOWELL: Well, Wal-Mart along for the ride too, how in the heck does that play out? And Wal-Mart is a co-purchaser.IVES: Yes, for Wal-Mart, I mean, on the consumer side, this should really give them a huge eye on the quiver versus Amazon and the e-commerce side. If you look at what TikTok, what they've done in China, a lot of cross- pollination on the consumer side. So for Wal-Mart partnering with Microsoft, I think that was really a final piece in the puzzle to get that deal done for Wal-Mart. I think, it's another, it's a no-brainer move, giving what they can do with a TikTok asset. And really, this is ultimately Christmas morning coming early for Microsoft and Wal-Mart in terms of TikTok, and obviously, China, that throws a wrench in it this weekend, but I ultimately think this soap opera ends the same way with Microsoft and the victory circle.MCDOWELL: So ends in a couple of weeks, certainly before that kind of mid- September deadline.IVES: Yes, because remember clock is ticking --MCDOWELL: Right --IVES: And if that plug gets pulled, TikTok's evaluation goes down, 60 percent, 70 percent. So this definitely -- you know, this is a high game stakes of poker, but obviously time is ticking.MCDOWELL: Dan, great to see you this morning, thanks for getting up early --IVES: Thank you --MCDOWELL: With us, Dan Ives, always a pleasure. Coming up, have you heard about this? Get it, sheep. The world's most expensive sheep sold, and the price tag making a buzz this morning.MCDOWELL: It's time for the Morning Buzz. First up, stars socially distancing, the VMAs still a night of glitz and glamour even without a live audience. Lady Gaga's frequent and extravagant costume changes with matching mask. Marking the night, she and Ariana Grande performing together, winning the first award of the evening. Miley Cyrus bringing back her "Wrecking Ball", Gaga also honored with the first Tricon Award. Lee, did Gaga and the "MTV" and "MTV" nail it?CARTER: You know, I think it's amazing what they were able to do with pre- recording, it's not live. It was a totally different kind of event. It was entertaining, Lady Gaga is absolutely extraordinary in what she was able to deliver. She won five awards and changed her wardrobe, I don't know how many times throughout the night, but I think they did an amazing job and she's an extraordinarily -- you know, she's such a gift. She is so talented.MCDOWELL: Except they set off fireworks outside of my apartment in the Hudson River on Thursday night at like 11 O'clock at night, pre-taping some of that, and one of my dogs just spontaneously went to the bathroom, so I'm still waiting for "MTV" to come over and clean up my -- clean up the rug because of their stupid fireworks -- I digress.(LAUGHTER)Moving on --CARTER: Yes --MCDOWELL: A sheep breaking records. A sheep named Double Diamond selling for big cash. Three bidders join together to pay a million dollars. Cabot, can you imagine paying that much for a sheep?PHILLIPS: If I did pay that much for a sheep, it better fly, it better have all sorts of technological advantages over every other sheep, it better do a lot for me. This is going to be a very busy sheep. He's going to be having lots and lots of girlfriends and children all throughout the countryside of that great land. And again, this is a new record, it bested the previous record which was 300,000. So huge new record here, but again, I'm going to expect some pretty big returns unless that sheep pay that much --MCDOWELL: OK --PHILLIPS: But good for him --MCDOWELL: Yes --PHILLIPS: For knowing his worth.MCDOWELL: I said a million, it's about half a million, so he's really not all that. Finally, Bill Gates, the banker Warren Buffett getting more than nice words for his 90th birthday. Bill Gates making his pal a home-made Oreo cake with Buffett's face on it. Lee, you know that Bill Gates did not bake that cake.CARTER: I know, he didn't. But you know what I love, I love your stories of really successful people who have close relationships with somebody as their mentor. When you look back at their relationship and you hear the stories about how Warren Buffett really challenge him to answer questions he never had to answer before which made him a better businessman. I think everybody should have those kinds of relationships, they're like real close friends, somebody you trust, somebody who is going to challenge you to be better. I think that's one of the biggest things you can do for yourself and your career. Find yourself some good mentors.MCDOWELL: Amen, Lee Carter. Still ahead, there's two more hours of Lee and Cabot, so stick around. Still ahead, word on Wall Street, hear from top financial analysts helping you watch your wallet. All that starts next hour on MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.Load-Date: August 31, 2020End of Document

TikToking Lives Away: Malware, China and GenocideThe Bates Student: Bates CollegeAugust 4, 2020 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1450 wordsByline: Roy MathewsBodyEver since the demise of the popular video sharing app Vine in December of 2016, many have craved the next big video sharing app. Enter TikTok, an app launched by ByteDance, a Beijing based internet technology company founded by Zhang Yiming in 2012. TikTok's explosive popularity has led Yiming to become the ninth richest man in China, as monthly users as of 2019 clock in at 1 billion people. However, TikTok was not Yiming's first attempt to make an app that would get Gen-Z  hooked. In 2018, Yiming's earlier video sharing app Neihan Duanzi was shuttered by the Chinese government's State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film, and Television for "vulgar content." In an apology to Communist Party officials, Yiming criticized his company and product, saying that "we took the wrong path and content appeared that was incommensurate with socialist values." However, Mr. Yiming wouldn't let the Communist Party dampen his ambitions; he instead chose to "deepen our cooperation with official party media, elevating distribution of authoritative media content, and ensuring that official party media voices are broadcast to show strength." Not long after the Communist Party's crackdown on Neihan Duanzi, advertorial videos showcasing China's army, police, and strength of the Communist Party began to appear on the app after tweaking the algorithm of the app. Neihan Duanzi was never successfully marketed outside China, but Yiming's new app TikTok has brought in billions for ByteDance. In the U.S. millions of citizens have downloaded and posted on TikTok videos of endless content. Most U.S. citizens are clueless to the fact that they are enjoying a Chinese Communist Party approved piece of malware on their phones. Forbes reported on an investigation into TikTok by Apple in early 2020, where technology researchers Talal Haj Bakry and Tommy Mysk discovered that TikTok was able to read and store information copied to your clipboard if it was installed on your phone. Any time a user would copy a picture, message, link, or anything to the clipboard, TikTok would not only store that information away, the app would also note patterns on your keyboard, including the order of every single keystroke. TikTok stated it would stop this practice in April of 2020, but in June of 2020 Apple had to issue a iOS 14 that warned when an app was taking your keyboard information. TikTok was still stealing its users' information.Scrambling to cover itself, TikTok issued a statement that they had "already submitted an updated version of the app to the App Store removing the anti-spam feature to eliminate any potential confusion." In other words: We got caught doing something we weren't supposed to be doing, but don't worry we've fixed it. TikTok's malware doesn't just copy your keyboard information. If you've enabled your fingerprint to unlock your phone, or own a Macbook or iPad, TikTok can read whatever you type on those devices too, as well as have a reading of your fingerprint. This is because of Apple's "universal clipboard functionality" that allows your Apple devices to be interconnected with each other for ease of use. So if TikTok is downloaded on your phone while you are working, it can read anything: passwords, documents, emails, and bank information.Who cares though, right? I still want to be able to do the latest dances, memes, and viral challenges so I'm not missing out on anything! That's the standard excuse I hear from a lot of U.S. college students; after all, if the Chinese government has all your information already, what's the point of detoxing from TikTok? Just ask the Uighur Muslims of Xinjiang Province in Western China. The genocide began after President Xi Jingping ordered party officials to engage in an all-out "struggle against terrorism, infiltration and seperatism" using the "organs of dictatorship" and showing "absolutely no mercy," according to a massive leak of internal Communist Party documents obtained by the New York Times. Of these leaked documents, over 150 of them dealt with "surveillance and control of the Uighur population." In the city of Kashgar, a government technician explained to a New York Times reporter how the system of checkpoints around the city and high definition cameras could let the government compile information on specific individuals. The correspondent was even shown an example of a government file, which contained "photo, home address and official identification number of a woman who had been stopped at a checkpoint on a major highway. The system displayed details of her education, family links, recent visits, and travel routes around the city." China created a system of segregated surveillance, whose purpose is to compel Uighurs to "submit to monitoring and data collection," in a wider effort to wipe out the Uighurs culture and transform them into obedient, secular citizens who will never challenge the Communist Party. The issuing of identification cards to Uighurs also means that they will have to turn over their movements and location in order to buy food, gasoline, phones, computers, and sugar. The Chinese government's surveillance program amassed some 68 billion records on Uighurs in Kashgar alone. With this large amount of information at the Party's disposal, it becomes only a matter of arresting individuals and sending them off to what the government calls "re-education camps" in order to break the Uighurs of their culture, religion, and individuality. Almost 1 million people are currently being beaten, tortured, and brainwashed in Chinese Communist Party concentration camps. An internal Party memo leaked to the BBC states the following rules: "Never allow escapes, increase discipline and punishment for behavioral violations, promote repentance and confession, make remedial Mandarin studies the top priority, encourage students to fully transform, and ensure full video surveillance coverage of dormitories and classrooms." Uighur inmates are rewarded points for their "ideological transformation and compliance with discipline" which determines whether they get to contact their family or be released from the camp. Former inmate Orynbek Koksybek described his time in the camps as "seven days of hell...My hands were handcuffed, my legs were tied. They threw me in a pit. I raised both my hands and looked above. At that moment, they poured water. I screamed. I don't remember what happened next. I don't know how long I was in the pit but it was winter and very cold. They said I was a traitor, that I had dual citizenship, that I had a debt and owned land." Omir Bekali was "forced to stand at a wall for five hours at a time. A week later, he was sent to solitary confinement and deprived of food for 24 hours." When Mr. Bekali was finally given food, his only choice was to eat the pork and alcohol provided to him by the prison guards (both forbidden in Islam). Mr. Bekahli also strapped him into a "tiger chair," a device that clamped down his wrists and ankles. They also hung him by his wrists against a barred wall, just high enough so he would feel excruciating pressure in his shoulder unless he stood on the balls of his bare feet." Inmates who denounce their Islamic faith and culture are rewarded, while those inmates that refuse are beaten, deprived of food, and thrown in solitary confinement or outdoor pits. The inmates who showed promise are taken to less heavily guarded camps where "internees wake up at dawn, sing the Chinese national anthem, and raise the Chinese flag" every morning. Next, internees learn red songs like "Without the Communist Party, there is no New China" and are educated on how "the indigenous sheep-herding Central Asian people of Xinjiang were backward and yoked by slavery before they were 'liberated' by the Communist Party in the 1950s." Finally, they finish their days with their evening meal, but not before being ordered to give their thanks for their meal: "Thank the Party! Thank the Motherland! Thank President Xi!"What is happening to the Uighur people right now is an example of how the Chinese Communist Party harnesses people's information for their own exploitation. The U.S. continues to let the Chinese government profit off a piece of malware on customers' phones worldwide, with many of its users ignorant to the unspeakable human rights abuses against Uighur Muslims. What can you do? Start by being an ally and deleting TikTok from your phones. The Chinese government, like every other government on Earth, gets its tax revenue through its state owned enterprises and by leveling taxes on private businesses, transactions and customs, all of which are utilized to get the app on to your phone.Load-Date: August 4, 2020End of Document

For Whom the Tok TiksAtlantic OnlineAugust 6, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1877 wordsByline: Ian BogostBodyUpdated at 11:15 p.m. ET on August 6, 2020.What is TikTok though? It's an app for creating and sharing short videos, but that description undersells its delight: lip-synched anthems that spawn split-screen duet replies; "challenges" that turn boring tasks into virtuosic dances; wry, incisive takedowns of national politics by teens too young to vote; pets, kids, emo kids, emo pets, and comedians.That's part of what TikTok is, anyway. It's also a data-collecting social-media platform that sells and serves ads, like any other social-media platform. But it's not exactly like any other social-media platform, because TikTok is one of the only Chinese-made apps that is broadly popular in America. This fact rankles the White House because the company could pass U.S. user data to the Chinese government. Today, Donald Trump issued an executive order that would ban TikTok's clever videos from American shores entirely.Unless, as Trump has put it, a "very American" company buys TikTok from ByteDance, the platform's Chinese owner, and repatriates its data. It's ironic to try to blockade a foreign app, given that America has imposed Facebook, Google, Uber, and all the others on the rest of the world, whether those nations asked for them or not. (Often they didn't.) Microsoft has emerged as the likeliest suitor-and among the only ones capable of shelling out an estimated $20 billion to $50 billion for a cat-dancing video app.The threat that the White House might disappear a favorite app has turned esoteric trade diplomacy into a tiny culture war. Among the many horrors of 2020, America can add a multibillion-dollar international dispute about a data-vacuuming platform on which people  film themselves in their bathroom mirrors and prank their parents. "They can pry TikTok from my cold dead hands," one fan said. "I need my cat videos." Some teens who love the platform have even become newly endeared to Microsoft, the most boring of old-guard tech companies, as TikTok's possible savior.[Read: TikTok stars are preparing to take over the internet]It's gratifying to cast TikTok as an innocent bystander in a trade war between the U.S. and China, or as fuel for a generation gap between Boomers and Zoomers, or as a David facing off with the tech-establishment Goliath. Two years of breathless coverage of TikTok as a fresh-faced force of delight and opportunity have made the app feel like an underdog bet in a prizefight against entrenched ne'er-do-wells, such as Trump and Facebook.But TikTok, I regret to inform you, is also bad. Chatter about its possible ban or fire sale makes the harm it can cause, which is multifaceted, even more visible. To peel the app like an onion reveals that there's really no good outcome, whether or not a deal or a ban comes to pass. TikTok is going to be America's problem in America, or America's problem in China, or both.Collecting data is probably bad, no matter who does it. The administration fears that this app, the first Chinese offering to really break big in the United States, could share the data it collects from Americans with the Chinese government for nefarious exploitation. Some critics have shrugged off this concern as xenophobia, yet it does have merit. The Chinese government can demand that tech companies hand over data, and that could turn TikTok into a Trojan horse for cyberespionage or blackmail. (ByteDance has made assurances that it stores TikTok's data outside of China, but that's cold comfort given China's ability to compel compliance.)The thing is, it's not necessarily less worrisome for the same data to be held by American companies; it's just concerning in a different way. Look at all the trouble Facebook, Instagram, Google, Twitter, and others have gotten into regarding their choke hold on information and their questionable stewardship of its use. The collection and sharing of data that people store or create on technology platforms, along with the ease of disseminating fake information, have been the defining problem of the American technology industry in the past two decades. Microsoft has come under less scrutiny, but mostly because the company has never really invested in consumer-internet applications beyond Skype and LinkedIn. Microsoft hasn't made Facebook's errors, but it also hasn't had much opportunity to do so.The engagement economy is also bad. Watching a stylist perform a haircut with a butcher knife or a comedian lip-synch to Trump or an actual cat perform a Doja Cat song is fun. But social media can never be taken on its own. Every post serves a common master: the platform, which aggregates the attention and data of individual creations into an engagement-delivery machine, mostly so the platform's owner can sell advertising.Platforms need more users posting more content to thrive, and so they must either find new audiences or cannibalize old ones. TikTok does not disrupt the long-standing pattern of consumer apps seeking to make cultural waves, but each wave eventually crashes to shore. Fifteen years ago, Facebook was cool to teens; 10 years ago, Instagram took its place, so Facebook bought it; now Instagram is copying TikTok with a new feature called Reels.[Read: Why America is afraid of TikTok]Eventually, inevitably, TikTok will fall from grace, if not by executive ban then by a more ordinary acquisition, or natural decline, or replacement by another, cooler option. When it does, the addicts and influencers attached to it today will invest all that effort in someone else's corporate platform, just as the Viners who vanished when Twitter shut down that service did, or the YouTubers who were demonetized, or the Tumblrers who were banned. No matter how liberating or delightful the posts feel, content creators are also puppets of the platform owners, who in turn vie for temporary dominance over one another.The geopolitical rewards from solving the TikTok problem are bad news, too. ByteDance isn't the biggest Chinese tech company, but it's worth a hefty $100 billion, and it operates other services in China, India, Indonesia, and elsewhere. If allowed to continue operating in the United States, ByteDance could further entrench its global position. But if Microsoft acquires the product, then the global industry would consolidate further-and mere weeks after the House held a hearing about antitrust concerns in the sector. Global online media will become further controlled by American technology firms, or else by Chinese ones. That's not much of a choice at all.Then there's the political glad-handing, a matter far more boring than any TikTok video, but necessary to understanding the significance of all of them together. In a call with the president over the weekend, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly managed to talk down Trump from immediate intervention. (Trump's executive order says the deal can go through if it closes by September 15.) If Microsoft can solve a political (and perhaps personal) problem for the White House, the company would win favor with the administration. That could deepen Microsoft's already-remunerative relationship with the federal government in areas such as cloud-computing services, for which the company manages a $10 billion contract with the Pentagon.An acquisition could equally endear Microsoft to Chinese President Xi Jinping. On Tuesday, the government-owned newspaper China Daily published an editorial condemning Trump's "smash and grab" approach to TikTok, and vowing that China would retaliate against unilateral American action. Microsoft has maintained a foothold in China since 1992, earning it respect alongside local tech giants such as Tencent and Baidu. Even so, China still accounts for only 2 percent of Microsoft's revenue. By helping to mediate the standoff, Microsoft could improve its fortunes in China. In either case, the American-policy dimensions of a TikTok divestiture would play second fiddle to the corporate benefits of a $1.6 trillion behemoth.Finally, the artificial intelligence that makes TikTok great is also dangerous, no matter who's got their hands on it. TikTok is like an iceberg. On the surface, users make and share short videos, which they can also spread via other social-media platforms. No big deal.Then there's the rest of the iceberg. ByteDance has created a colossal infrastructure to make the app so engaging. All social apps are designed for compulsion, but TikTok is particularly addictive because it dispenses with the setup that Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and others require. There's no need to find people to follow or to build a long pattern of use. Instead, you download it, watch a few videos, and TikTok starts recommending more: sour worms and liquor in a vat; Mr. Clean dancing across the carpet; a lip-synch of a cat's fear of bath water. You don't even need an account.The recommendations are surprisingly effective. That's because ByteDance has invested enormous time and money to develop artificial-intelligence software that scans posted videos for substance, form, and meaning, and uses that material to recommend more. For TikTok viewers, the resulting sensation is overwhelming, a bit like when Google first replaced AltaVista: magically good results.But who will own these valuable AI systems if TikTok gets split up in a sale? The AI has potentially broad application in identifying and matching patterns of information to the people who would want it. A company like Microsoft could use this system in any number of ways, including in its enterprise products, such as email or LinkedIn. But it's not yet clear if intellectual property such as TikTok's AI will divest in a purchase, or if it will remain in ByteDance's hands, or if both entities will share in it, or something else entirely. Microsoft has said only that it will "own and operate TikTok" in a few English-speaking markets.The Trump White House hasn't weighed in on this detail. Yesterday, Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, sent a letter to Microsoft posing numerous questions about the deal, but none considered how the company might share in the general software already imbricated with TikTok itself.The mystery spawns another set of bad options. Would it be worse if China retained sole control over the AI that makes TikTok and other services so effective, or if that technology were also in the hands of an American tech giant that's one of the most valuable companies in the world? Is it worse to isolate that engagement in a series of viral-media Chinese exports, or to allow an American powerhouse to transplant the AI that makes TikTok so compelling into more mundane apps, including cloud-computing services that run corporate and governmental systems, office software that oversees spreadsheets and word-processing documents, and a social network that millions of people use for recruiting?TikTok might be pleasant, or joyful, or even subversive. But it is also an app on your phone, on the internet, connected to data centers and driving both corporate amalgamation and transnational entrenchment. It's a bummer, but nothing is ever just an app anymore. Maybe Microsoft will save TikTok, or maybe not. Either way, there aren't better and worse options here, so much as worse and even worse ones.Load-Date: August 7, 2020End of Document

CSIS: Notes From a CSIS Virtual Event - Countering Chinese EspionageTargeted News ServiceAugust 18, 2020 Tuesday 9:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 921 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Center for Strategic and International Studies issued the following commentary by Anna Lehman-Ludwig, former research intern with the Technology Policy Program:On August 12, CSIS hosted a conversation with Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers on Chinese cyber espionage. John Demers leads the Department of Justice's China Initiative, created in 2018 to combat espionage directed by the Chinese government.The Initiative attempts to disrupt what Demers called China's "rob-replicate-replace" policy, where Chinese individuals or companies steal American IP, replicate the product or service in China, replace the American company on the Chinese market, and, if all goes well, on the global market. Most cases prosecuted as part of this are insider cases, concerning individuals who steal IP from American companies or universities where they work and provide that information to China. This can take the form of State-directed cases or individuals induced by the incentives found in Chinese programs.In State-directed cases, the Chinese intelligence services will develop relationships with individuals working in companies in the U.S. and co-opt them to gain information, utilizing traditional espionage approaches.Chinese talent recruitment initiatives like the Thousand Talents Program are another way that the Chinese steal IP. Individuals who enter into Thousand Talents contracts may take information from their American employer - generally a corporation or a university - and transfer that information to China. When applying for the Thousand Talents Program, individuals must show how they will bring IP back to China. Notably, these individuals generally hide their affiliation with Chinese institutions from their American employers and the American government.Demers also spoke to the recent closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston: "Houston has long been on the radar screen of the FBI as a source of significant intellectual property theft" and covert foreign influence. The closure of the Houston consulate and the simultaneous arrests of PLA-affiliated individuals who had not disclosed their affiliations were initial public attempts aimed at disrupting Chinese IP-theft operations in the country.In addition to IP theft by espionage, Demers noted that there are also cases where Americans provide personal data to China, as is the case of TikTok and other mobile apps. In discussing TikTok, Demers highlighted Beijing's appetite for large volumes of personal data, citing the 2015 OPM hack and the 2017 Equifax breach.National security concerns regarding TikTok pertain to data and censorship. Individuals willingly download the app and input personal data, and the app also collects information from your phone - including geolocation data and contact lists. While this information provides users a better TikTok user experience, it can also be abused by China. Censorship is another issue for TikTok, which has been accused of censoring certain policy views, including about Uighur Muslims, protests in Hong Kong, Tibet, and Taiwan. Demers also discussed how the Chinese government uses WeChat to control the information environment of foreign exchange students.Recent indictments have highlighted China's attempts to steal IP pertaining to a coronavirus vaccine. According to Demers, the Chinese have long been interested in biomedical research and it would be surprising if China were not trying to access the most valuable biomedical research of the day. Information about a vaccine has enormous value financially and geopolitically, and China's attempts to access this information is part of a greater effort to collect salient biomedical research to boost its domestic biotechnology sector.Demers also addressed concerns about how current actions against Chinese IP theft could lead to a potential Red Scare. Demers emphasized the need for corporations and businesses to focus on behaviors that might signify IP theft or other crime, and not focus on ethnicity. He further affirmed that the screening of Chinese researchers and individuals as they leave the country is precise and targeted.While other countries carry out espionage operations in the United States, China is unique in its focus on stealing commercial technology. Other countries, such as Russia, conduct espionage in the form of trying to access American military and export control technology, but China's attempts to steal IP for the purpose of creating domestic competitors to American companies is unique.The administration has recently acted against Chinese companies - including Huawei, TikTok, and Tencent - operating in the United States. The focus on telecommunications comes from an appreciation that as we move to 5G technologies, our lives are increasingly mediated by networks. The rise of IoT devices increases the amount of data that can be harvested. Recent actions, such as the Clean Network Initiative and Trump's Executive Order, reinforce the effort to ensure that trusted vendors from trusted, like-minded countries are supplying these telecommunications services.Demers also discussed U.S. cooperation with allies on China issues. China's behavior during the coronavirus pandemic and China's actions towards Hong Kong and the Uighurs has helped move some Europeans share U.S. security concerns.The full discussion can be watched here: https://www.csis.org/events/online-event-countering-chinese-espionage[Category: Political]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7210814 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 18, 2020End of Document

US/China.- Trump prepares to make a final decision on the use of the well-known Chinese app TikTokCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 2, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 319 wordsBodyMADRID, 2 (EUROPA PRESS)US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has confirmed that U.S. President Donald Trump is finalizing preparations to make a decision on restricting the country's use of the well-known TikTok video app on suspicion that he would be sending information from his users to the Chinese government."President Trump is going to take a series of steps over the next few days regarding the wide range of national security risks posed by Chinese applications," Pompeo said on Fox News on Sunday.Pompeo has assured that Chinese companies are "providing data directly to the Chinese Communist Party and its national security apparatus," such as facial recognition patterns, phone numbers, and friend information."When the president makes his decision, he will do so with the assurance that the people of the United States will not take any risks." We're approaching a solution and I think we'll soon know the president's announcement," he added.TikTok, a video application that enjoys immense popularity among young people for its humorous content, is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance. The company says it is not sharing data with the Beijing Government despite complaints from the US government.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has also told ABC on Sunday that "the app cannot exist in its current form" because of the security issues it has. "We can't risk me sending to China personal information about a hundred million Americans," he told ABC.Thus, Mnuchin has indicated that the president is trained to "either force a sale of the company" or resort to an executive law of emergency powers that prohibits any means of communication that poses a threat to the United States.Faced with this situation, computer giant Microsoft, which intended to acquire the US section of TikTok, has cried out talks to Trump's opposition, in a new episode of the long trade disputes between China and the US president.Load-Date: August 3, 2020End of Document

GU Professors Teaching Classes On China Take Online Learning Precautions in Light of Possible Security ThreatsThe Hoya: Georgetown UniversityAugust 29, 2020 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1146 wordsBodySome Georgetown University professors teaching classes about China are taking precautionary measures to protect students and faculty from possible security threats during online learning in the fall.Some faculty worry lecture recordings and other technical vulnerabilities in Zoom may endanger students and instructors who criticize the Chinese government. Faculty who spoke with The Hoya are particularly concerned some sensitive course material may violate the broad and vague stipulations of the latest Chinese national security law. The law, enacted by the Chinese government June 30 in response to ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, is an open-ended prohibition of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers against the Chinese government.JULIA GIGANTE/THE HOYA | Wary of possible cybersecurity threats from the Chinese government, some Georgetown professors teaching online classes on China are taking precautionary measures to protect their students and are urging others to do the same.James Millward, a professor of Chinese and Central Asian history, said because the crimes are vaguely defined, the scope of the new law's impact on foreign nationals is still unclear."If you read the text of the National Security Law, it is very broad and virtually any US-taught class dealing with contemporary China will have material that the CCP could, if it wished, call subversive or separatist-which could have very severe consequences for a student found with such things on their laptop, or downloading a video of a class with such content from a Canvas or Panopto server," Millward wrote in an email to The Hoya.In the past, the Chinese Communist Party has taken punitive action against Chinese students who have voiced anti-regime opinions while studying abroad. In November 2019, a Chinese student studying at the University of Minnesota was sentenced to six months in prison in China for tweets he had posted while abroad.Kristen Looney, an assistant professor of Asian studies and government who is teaching a "Politics of China" course this semester, said she adapted her syllabi to reflect the newfound risks that come from virtual learning."I think every faculty teaching courses on China should notify students of the risks, so I just put a section about online meeting policies on my syllabi," Looney said in an interview with The Hoya.Millward said he became alarmed about Georgetown using the Zoom video conferencing software for the upcoming virtual semester without properly educating faculty about the privacy issues that may arise from it. Millward and other Asian studies professors across the country penned a statement in July calling on universities to adopt safer online learning practices.Millward said the habit of recording lectures has undermined efforts by Zoom and administrators to secure communications on the platform and protect users."The university administrations imagine, 'Oh, we just record everything on Zoom and then send it to them or record everything on Zoom and it stays in the cloud on Canvas and then they can go download it whenever,'" Millward said in a follow-up interview with The Hoya. "The problem with that is that, although Zoom is now theoretically end-to-end encrypted, once it's stored somewhere and then you're downloading it as a file, that file's on your computer. And it's also no longer encrypted, and so then it becomes something that anybody can look at."Looney said because of the sensitive nature of her courses, she will ban any form of recording lectures and distributing course content outside of the class."All class meetings will be held synchronously (in real time), and students will log onto Zoom through the course Canvas website...no one (neither the students nor the professor) will record class meetings," Looney's syllabus reads. "No one will circulate course readings, handouts, notes, or other materials to anyone outside of the class."Looney acknowledged the difficulty of enforcing such a policy and added another provision that students who do not feel comfortable during the lecture can mute their video or change their name."It [is] an honor code violation if anyone records the meeting. The difficulty with that is, of course, I can't enforce it. As the meeting host, I cannot record myself. I can tell students not to record, but I don't know if somebody is sitting here with their phone recording or using some other device to record," Looney said in an interview with The Hoya. "An additional step is if students would like to refrain from using the video function or refrain from using their real name, then they have that option."The dangers of online learning are not limited to faculty and students involved with classes about China, according to Millward. Students and faculty taking classes about other authoritarian countries may also be at risk.Georgetown's Chief Information Officer Judd Nicholson said the university has implemented a few policies to help protect students and faculty while learning online. The university is requiring students to sign up for Duo, a password authentication system, and has recommended methods to improve Zoom security."Some individuals have reported that following best security practices related to Zoom, NetID accounts, and device hygiene are sufficient to assuage those fears," Nicholson wrote in an email to The Hoya. "Other individuals have reported that the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) may better address some of these challenges."Millward said the university has improved its virtual security measures by realizing there is a need for classes to be both convenient and secure, but it needs to take more public steps to protect and warn the community about the potential dangers of virtual learning."We need to maximize accessibility where necessary by recording Zoom classes and other things and sending them out or making them available in the cloud to students, wherever they are," Millward said. "But they're afraid to mention that, you know, there is a danger - hard to quantify - but there is a risk to our students in authoritarian countries. They don't want to put that down."Looney does worry some of the warnings about security risks may scare students away or cause them to self-censor. As a result, she decided to omit some of the more extreme risks from her syllabi."I don't want it to have a chilling effect on the class and really compromise academic freedom or free speech, and I do think that the probability of somebody being targeted by the Chinese government is low," Looney said. "But the problem is we have no idea how these new policies are going to be enforced because they were just implemented. So, I have to err on the side of caution and try to protect everybody's safety, while at the same time maintaining academic freedom, and it's a really difficult balance."Load-Date: August 29, 2020End of Document

What is WeChat and why does Trump want to ban it?CNN WireAugust 7, 2020 Friday 1:42 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 764 wordsDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  President Donald Trump wants to ban WeChat, dramatically escalating tensions with China. But what is WeChat, and why is it so controversial?The popular Chinese messaging app is used across the Chinese diaspora but may be unfamiliar outside of those circles.So what is it?WeChat, called Weixin in China, functions like Facebook, LinkedIn, Uber, Instagram and several other apps all at once. For many Chinese people, WeChat is an indispensable app for staying in touch across the world.Some of that success has been aided by the government. China blocked many American apps including Facebook, Google and Twitter, so state-sponsored apps have become the norm.WeChat is owned by Tencent, China's biggest tech company and the world's largest gaming company. In March, Tencent reported that WeChat has nearly 1.2 billion monthly active users. The company does not disclose user numbers by country, but industry analysts say the vast majority of them are in China.The app has been subsidized by the Chinese government since its creation in 2011.What can you do on WeChat?WeChat has a lot more functionality in China than it does in the United States. While in America, you can hail a cab, play mini games, post to your "story" and send money.By comparison in China, where stores regularly accept WeChat Pay as a form of payment and QR codes are all over cities, the sky's the limit. Inside WeChat, you can pay bills, check out restaurant menus, find local hangouts, book doctor appointments, reach out to new business contacts, file police reports, read the news and access bank services.What does Trump want to do?President Donald Trump issued executive orders late Thursday night that would ban WeChat and TikTok, the short-form video app owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, from operating in the United States in 45 days if they are not sold by their parent companies.According to the order, a ban would apply to "any transaction that is related to WeChat" made by any person or "any property" subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.I heard Trump wanted to ban TikTok, but why now WeChat?Trump wrote in his executive order, "Like TikTok, WeChat automatically captures vast swaths of information from its users. This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information."He continued, "The United States must take aggressive action against the owner of WeChat to protect our national security."WeChat has a reputation for being heavily monitored. That's despite Tencent's attempts to convince users to "rest assured, respecting user privacy has always been one of WeChat's most important principles," as the company wrote in a 2018 blog post. In an 2016 Amnesty International report on user privacy, Tencent scored a zero out of 100 for WeChat's lack of freedom of speech protection and lack of end-to-end encryption. Tencent doesn't disclose when the Chinese government requests user data and gives no detail about the kind of encryption, if any, it employs.Who would the ban affect?The hit to Tencent so far would be mostly symbolic, given the small market share WeChat has in the United States. But if it expands into gaming apps, a massive part of the company's business, that could be a big problem.Tencent owns Riot Games, the maker of the world's biggest PC game "League of Legends," and has a stake in Epic Games, parent company of "Fortnite." It also has a huge mobile games business and is working with the Pokémon Company to make what looks to be a cross between "Pokémon" and "League of Legends," called "Pokémon Unite." The game was announced in June and has no release date yet. It would arrive on Nintendo Switch and mobile.Tencent has dealt with government restrictions before, when the Chinese government stopped approving new games for nine months in 2018. Tencent stock lost 25% of its value in that the time period.How are WeChat and China responding?China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday said it "firmly opposes" the executive orders targeting WeChat and TikTok."The United States is using national security as an excuse and using state power to oppress non-American businesses," ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said during a daily press briefing, accusing the United States of "political manipulation and oppression."A Tencent spokesperson said the company "is reviewing the executive order to get a full understanding."CNN Business' Sherisse Pham contributed to this report.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

What a WeChat ban would mean for AmericansCNN WireAugust 8, 2020 Saturday 6:32 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 842 wordsDateline: (CNN Business) Body (CNN Business) --  For Zhang Lianping, a 72-year-old retired small business owner in College Park, Maryland, WeChat is a lifeline for staying in touch with relatives, old classmates and friends spread across Beijing, Shandong and Liaoning provinces in China."If we don't have WeChat, we're really going backward 40 years," she said, in comments translated from Mandarin Chinese.Tencent's popular messaging app could now be banned in the US if the company doesn't agree to sell it by mid-September, as required by an executive order issued Thursday. WeChat is the latest target in President Trump's rapidly escalating tech war with China, which has also put short-form video app TikTok under fire. The news has shaken Chinese Americans and anyone with ties to China who rely on the app as the main way of keeping in touch with family and friends there.WeChat, called Weixin in China, functions like Facebook, LinkedIn, Uber, Instagram and several other apps all rolled into one. For many Chinese people, WeChat is an indispensable app for connecting with the world."Everybody in China uses WeChat. It's hard to appreciate how important it is for reaching people in China," said Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School focused on technology and management. "It appears like [the US] is trying to drop an Iron Curtain between the countries so that people can't communicate with each other." The app is common especially among older generations of immigrants who left China many decades ago but still want to stay connected. And during the pandemic, when traveling back to China is complicated, expensive and involves an extra period in quarantine, many are staying put, making WeChat even more essential."I still want WeChat. It's cheaper. Phone calls [to China] are expensive," Zhang said.Zhang immigrated to the US in 1989 and began using WeChat over the past few years. Without WeChat, she envisions having to mail photos since she doesn't know how to use a computer, and making phone calls to family and friends abroad. But with the large time difference between the East Coast and China, leaving messages on WeChat has been much more convenient, she said.In the decades since she's left China, her friends and family there keep her posted by sending photos of new skyscrapers emerging from old roads, vacations and the births of grandchildren. When her daughter delivers a baby in October, Zhang plans to send photos using WeChat to her siblings and old classmates. Without it, she said, she'll have to use snail mail.Ken Xiao, 63, who is retired but works as a calligraphy teacher in San Diego, said the Chinese community has heard rumors of a WeChat ban in the US for weeks and had discussed it on ... WeChat.Xiao immigrated to the US from Yunnan Province in 1989 and started using WeChat about four years ago. He now calls his parents every Monday evening using the app."I am really disappointed to hear this executive order," he said. Trump wrote in his executive order, "Like TikTok, WeChat automatically captures vast swaths of information from its users. This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information."He continued, "The United States must take aggressive action against the owner of WeChat to protect our national security." A Tencent spokesperson said the company is "reviewing the executive order to get a full understanding."Xiao and other Chinese Americans CNN Business spoke with conceded that they didn't know whether the Chinese government could read their messages. They said they exercise caution when communicating with contacts, making sure not to delve too deeply into politics."As regular people, most of us Chinese people, including me and my students, we do not talk about anything related to the sensitive, political topics," he said. "We can use [WeChat] as a regular life communication platform, so we don't worry about anything else."If WeChat were to be banned in the US, Harvard's Shih said Americans would likely have to resort to email to reach people in China, a mode of communication that isn't as widely used in the country. "If I send an email, I might not get a response for weeks, or the likelihood is I'll never get a response," Shih said.For Emily Kuo, 56, a business owner in San Diego, who immigrated from Guangdong Province in 1982, WeChat is a way to communicate with her tenants in her retail shopping center in California and talk to family and friends in China, including her son in Shanghai."You can leave long messages, very detailed messages. You can post, let's say like a worksheet or a traveling itinerary. It's very powerful. It's really a very good communication tool," Kuo explained."To me [the ban] is super inconvenient socially, but I think to many, many Americans who do business with Chinese in China, it would be a great interruption. It would be very inefficient," she added. "I feel so sorry for them and for myself."TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

New Light Consulting Issues Public Comment on DOE NoticeTargeted News ServiceAugust 18, 2020 Tuesday 12:03 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1489 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, Aug. 18 -- Matthew J. Moynihan of New Light Consulting LLC, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has issued a public comment on the Department of Energy's notice entitled "Cost-Sharing Partnerships With the Private Sector in Fusion Energy". The comment was written on May 9, 2020, and posted on Aug. 7, 2020:* * *I am urging the US Department of Energy to strong consider implementing the 20-million-dollar cost-sharing program, as proposed by the Fusion Industry Association. I have been involved with the fusion field since 2006 in various capacities - graduate student, consultant, blogger, podcaster etcetera. As this letter will show - there is a strong argument that the United States has seeded its' competitive edge in fusion to China and we must increase our efforts in this area to maintain our technological edge. This cost sharing program will create conditions for a fusion industrial base to develop, which is critically needed if the United States is to lead in this emerging field.Fusion technology has been evolving swiftly - both inside foreign nations and within private companies - and the US government has been slow to react. There are many reasons for this: the public widely considers fusion to be decades off; US fusion funding has been low and lopsided for several decades; and the fusion scientific communities have self-siloed themselves, limiting cross-pollination. Complete metrics on private fusion are difficult to come by, but in December of 2019, I was tracking 27 private groups employing 1,000 employees and with 2.05 billion USD in capital among them. These numbers were confirmed by Commonwealth Fusions' staff, which did a similar assessment. Aside from mature technologies like ICF and tokamaks, roughly a dozen less mature approaches are developing in the wings. Certainly, some of these approaches are dead ends, but a broad range of schemes are being pursued. Teams are advancing old concepts by integrating new technologies like superconductors, modern controls, supercapacitors or plasma switches. Other teams are creating hybrid approaches like PJMIF, MagLIF or EBF. By combining these older ideas, startups are trying to reap the benefits, while minimize the pitfalls. In all cases, researchers are trying to optimize a system with competing physical mechanisms. This technology growth has gone unnoticed by policymakers or the general public.Unfortunately, Chinese groups have recently been more receptive and aggressive in fusion research. The most alarming of these Chinese groups has been ENN Energy. ENN is a multi-billion-dollar, private Chinese energy company located in Langfang. Since late 2017, ENN has constructed a 1-MegaAmp spherical tokamak, a device which got first plasma in August of 2019 (see Figure 1). I interfaced directly with ENN representatives at the 2019 APS DPP conference. Their fusion group has likely hired over 100 staffers; with a focus on poaching US-trained researchers. The company also built a complete replica of the Princeton Field Reversed Configuration (PFRC) in about three months - a staggering achievement. This is an illustrative example of how Chinese groups differ from the US government in approaching fusion. The Princeton machine has set a world record, for the longest stable particle confinement of any Field Reversed Configuration (300 microseconds in 2017). Princeton's machine has better stability than Tri Alpha Energy; a private company which has taken in over 600 million in investment. But when I visited the PFRC laboratory to interview their PI, their budget was only a few hundred thousand per year and the team only has a handful of staffers. It seems that ENN Fusion has recognized the technological value here - while the US government has not. ENN is moving to capitalize on this research, while the US is letting it languish. This is not an isolated example either; it is part of a larger trend. Fusion teams have had major achievements, but the US government has ignored them and cut funding. Past examples include the Levitating Dipole Experiment (LDX), the Large S Experiment (LSX) and the Magnetic Mirror Test Facility (MFTF). In all cases, funding was pulled after a critical milestone was met.See figure here (https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOE-HQ-2020-0021-0005/attachment_1.pdf)Figure 1. ENNs' Spherical Tokamak EST50, under construction in, from June of 2019. This facility was built by a company - not a government lab.Broadly, China is advancing by poaching US talent, leapfrogging over legacy systems and increasing its' government support. It is known that China poaches American scientists, and this does not preclude American fusion scientists. The most recent example was Dr. Francis Thio. Dr. Thio was a program manager at the Department of Energy for 14 years and was recently the CEO of HyperJet. HyperJet is a Virginia-based fusion startup which developed in the worlds' best plasma cannons. Chinas' likely purpose for hiring Dr. Thio was to steal this technology. HyperJet had taken six million in private capital. Its plasma cannons are being used to construct the Plasma Liner Experiment at Los Alamos. The cannons are a critical part of Plasma Jet Magneto-Inertial-Fusion. PJMIF is a fusion approach which the US only recently started to fund. China is pressing another advantage: it does not need to support legacy systems. For example, the country is sidestepping Inertial Confinement Fusion for power applications, because of the failure of the National Ignition Facility to get ignition. Instead, it can funnel resources into more advanced concepts like Lockheed Martin's Compact Fusion Reactor, Mirror Machines such as the Gas Dynamic Trap and Magnetic Reconnection-based fusion approaches. Finally, the Chinese government has also increased its support for fusion. Critically, their government can layout institution funding in five year increments. These activities are centered at China's INEST office in Hafei. INEST houses over 500 doctoral-level researchers with an average age of 33 (see Figure 2). The office is run out of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and is specifically focused on advanced fusion and fission technologies. The US has no parallel; the new US GAIN program is our closest facsimile - but it is smaller, not classified and not centralized.Figure 2. A picture of the Staff of the Chinas' INEST office from December 2017. INEST a Key National Laboratory run by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Hafei.I have had a front row seat to many of these actives over past few years and, as their scale and tempo have risen, I have increasingly felt that the US Government has not kept pace. My view has been cemented through conversations with officials at ARPA-E, the DOE, the National Laboratories and the Nuclear Navy. The refrain has been relatively universal. Fusion is widely considered impossible. Consequently, there is a real lack of breadth or depth of knowledge within the federal bureaucracy. Moreover, historically low funding has exacerbated these problems. It is for these and other reasons that would like to strongly urge the Department of Energy to support this cost-sharing program.Sincerely,Dr. Matthew J MoynihanNew Light Consulting, LLC.Pittsburgh PA, 15221* * *About the Author:Dr. Matt Moynihan promotes nuclear fusion as an energy source.

Chinese restrictions complicate TikTok saleCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 31, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 350 wordsBodyNEW YORK (AP) — The Chinese government is complicating the sale of assets from the U.S. government-desired TikTok app.China introduced Friday export restrictions on artificial intelligence technologies, apparently including the technology TikTok uses to decide which videos will be available to its users. This implies that the Chinese company that owns TikTok, ByteDance, must obtain a license to export technology to a foreign company.The U.S. government has threatened to ban TikTok in mid-September and has ordered ByteDance to sell its U.S. units, claiming they are a threat to national security because it fears that user data will fall into the hands of the Chinese government. TikTok denies being a threat to national security and has filed a lawsuit against the threat to ban it.Potential buyers of TikTok's U.S. assets include Microsoft and Walmart, and apparently also Oracle. Oracle has so far declined to comment.On Saturday, Chinese news agency Xinhua quoted Chinese government trade adviser Cui Fan, according to which Bytedance should consider ending negotiations to sell TikTok."As with any international transaction, we will abide by the relevant rules that in this case cover those of China and the United States," said Erich Andersen, director of ByteDance's legal department.China's new restrictions "could be an attempt to inflate the value" of TikTok, said Alex Zukin, an RBC Capital Markets analyst, who predicted an agreement "relatively soon."The Wall Street Journal reported last week that ByteDance is demanding $30 billion for its U.S. operations, but has run into resistance from potential buyers. The newspaper said the negotiations "have been bogged down."Microsoft and Walmart declined to comment on Monday.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany during a white house briefing on Monday did not respond directly whether the administration would accept a sale of U.S. assets from TikTok if the deal was subject to approval by the Chinese government. "Negotiations are ongoing on the sale of TikTok, so we're not going to interfere in those negotiations," he said.Load-Date: September 1, 2020End of Document

Cheng is named as a professor in the Artie McFerrin Department of Chemical Engineering at Texas A&M, as of Monday, and has two Chinese universities listed as his educational background prior to attending Princeton University. He is alleged to have hidden ties with Guangdong University in China, among others. While accepting funds, Cheng allegedly had access to NASA resources like the International Space Station. He also participated in the People's Republic of China Talents program, also known as the Thousand Talents Program, a Chinese-government talent recruitment program that in some cases has resulted in violations of U.S law, including espionage, theft of trade secrets and grant fraud and is designed to recruit high-level scientific talent to benefit China's development and national security. Texas A&M has not responded to a request for comment in time for publication.“China is building an economy and academic institutions with bricks stolen from others all around the world,” said U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick for the Southern District of Texas. “While 1.4 million foreign researchers and academics are here in the U.S. for the right reasons, the Chinese Talents Program exploits our open and free universities.”Federal charges have been leveled against numerous individuals suspected of hiding their ties with the Chinese Communist Party while accepting taxpayer-funded grants at U.S. universities and sharing classified information with the Chinese government. (RELATED: Former CIA Officer And FBI Linguist Arrested For Sharing Top Secret Info With Chinese Government)Song Guo Zheng, who was an employee at the Ohio State University among other American universities, was arrested in May and charged with lying about his ties with China while accepting grant funding, Zheng was also a participant of the China Talents Program. Only a few months prior, former Emory University professor Dr. Xiao-Jiang Li was sentenced after failing to report foreign income he earned from two Chinese Universities while applying for funding from the National Institute of Health.

Taiwan Accredits Surge of Foreign Reporters, Some Fleeing ChinaASEAN TribuneAugust 28, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 ASEAN Tribune All Rights ReservedLength: 759 wordsBody 28 August 2020 (VOA) Taiwan has registered 22 newly arrived foreign journalists so far this year, including some barred from working in China, a political rival of Taipei, which lures them with media freedoms.The journalists registered 'because we provide for freedom of speech and press and respect these rights in practice,' Taiwan's foreign ministry said Thursday in a statement for VOA. China monitors journalists, censors the internet and expelled several American reporters earlier this year.Seven of the 22 had been based before in China, excluding Hong Kong, including some who were expelled from Beijing in March over published content that the Chinese government resented. The expelled journalists had worked for The New York Times and Wall Street Journal.'As a result of the expulsion order by the Chinese government, we have relocated some affected correspondents in various locations in the region, including Taipei,' said Danielle Rhoades Ha, New York Times Co. communications vice president.China and Taiwan struggle to get along. Each is self-ruled, but China claims sovereignty over Taiwan, and it has threatened use of force to make the two sides unify.Covering ChinaForeign correspondents normally prefer a Beijing base as a news hub for Chinese government announcements and major diplomatic events. Reporters in Taiwan would have to cover China using internet tools and occasional travel, as allowed.Both locations are in the same time zone and a flight from Taiwan to China takes as little as 80 minutes. Flights from Taipei to major cities in Southeast Asia take two to four hours each. Japan and South Korea are each about three hours away.'Even when they're away from China, they can still do a lot of research interviews on the internet,' said Ku Lin-lin, associate journalism professor at National Taiwan University.Reporters in China risk being tracked by police and sometimes detained as they work on politically sensitive stories. The Communist Party and Chinese government agencies 'have long sought to influence public debate and media coverage' of their country 'through obstruction of foreign correspondents,' the Freedom House advocacy group said in a study this year. The past 10 years have seen a 'dramatic expansion in efforts to shape media content,' the study says.Chinese authorities sometimes secretly assign people to follow foreign correspondents, said George Hou, mass communications lecturer at I-Shou University in Taiwan.'They will assign some people to supervise you or to monitor you,' Hou said.As a democracy, Taiwan legally allows reporters to cover any topic and interview anyone. The 2020 Freedom House report on global freedom ranks Taiwan among the freest places in Asia.'It wants to present itself as a value-based country and the values around democracy and human rights have been articulated, and not just for itself,' said James Gomez, regional director at the Bangkok-based think tank Asia Center.'I think it also wants to set an example for others, so it kind of wants to walk the talk,' he said.A total of 114 journalists from 68 foreign media outlets are now based in Taiwan.Hong Kong risksMedia outlets that focus on Asia news traditionally station Asia correspondents in Hong Kong, Bangkok or Singapore, except for those covering Japan or the Koreas, Gomez said. Those three cities are likely to stay ahead of Taiwan, he said, although reporters shy away from covering Thailand or Singapore when based there - in line with those governments' expectations.Foreign reporters in Hong Kong risk being denied visas by a new national security unit under the Chinese territory's Immigration Department, media outlets in the territory have reported.'You could be ousted anytime,' said Cedric Alviani, East Asia bureau director with the advocacy group Reporters Without Borders. 'Your visa renewal might be denied. This is a major threat for the stability of the operation.'However, many people in Taiwan lack the English skills and widespread international awareness that have drawn journalists to places such as Hong Kong and Singapore, Ku said. And Taiwan may need new legislation to smooth the legal process for media outlets hoping to open news bureaus, Gomez said.Reporters covering China from Taiwan will eventually find their work hobbled by lack of face-to-face encounters with sources in China unless they visit the other side periodically, Ku added. Those without Chinese visas would need to apply for them outside Taiwan, which lacks Chinese consular services, and risk being rejected.Load-Date: September 1, 2020End of Document

TikTok Is Correct to Sue the U.S. GovernmentRealMoneyAugust 24, 2020 Monday 8:25 AM EDTCopyright 2020 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1275 wordsByline: Alex Frew McMillanHighlight: The forced sale of TikTok as a purported national-security threat is simply a move by U.S. politicians to cash in on parental concern, and votes.BodyI'm not surprised that TikTok is going to sue the Trump administration. And I won't be surprised if it wins.TikTok correctly says it has been unfairly targeted as a national-security threat by U.S. President Donald Trump, whose two executive orders against it would force TikTok's sale into U.S. hands. The short-video app says it has been deprived of due process, and I think it's right.TikTok plans to file suit this week, as early as Monday. I said at the time of Trump's August 6 order that I thought it  , a move to tackle a hyper-popular app that just happens to be Chinese-owned. That order, which bans dealings with TikTok by U.S. companies within 45 days, was followed on August 14 by another executive order mandating that TikTok and its American operations be sold within 90 days.TikTok's lawsuit would target the first executive order,  , which first reported the pending lawsuit. The order marks the first use against a tech company of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which has mainly been used by past presidents to target terrorists, hostile governments and drug kingpins.TikTok will argue that it does not deserve to be classed a national-security threat, Reuters reports, citing "sources familiar with the matter." It will also claim the order deprives it of due process. It's not yet clear in which court TikTok will sue.Like most tech, TikTok could be used inappropriately. But it's of limited if any threat to U.S. home security or its military capabilities. Inappropriate language and lewd dance moves, and tension at home, are the more likely result of its heavy use.TikTok says it tried "for nearly a year" to negotiate with the U.S. government "in good faith" to solve its concerns. "What we encountered instead was that the Administration paid no attention to facts, dictated terms of an agreement without going through standard legal processes, and tried to insert itself into negotiations between private businesses."Sounds about right.U.S. President Donald Trump on August 6 issued separate executive orders against the U.S. operations of both TikTok and the chat app WeChat, which is run by Tencent Holdings (TCEHY). Essentially, those are the two most-popular Chinese-owned apps. If the U.S. businesses weren't sold off, U.S. companies had to stop doing business with them.Trump has even said that the U.S. government should get a "substantial portion" of the proceeds of any TikTok sale. Quite where he gets the idea that the U.S. government should be getting a finder's fee for, presumably, using its powers equitably and fairly is anyone's guess.The price thrown around for TikTok's U.S. operations is US$30 billion, when earlier estimates suggested it would be worth at least US$50 billion. It's likely that left to its own devices, TikTok would have gone public as a separate entity comprised of its operations outside China.The rushed nature of the sale leaves the company less time to find its preferred partner. Knowing it was under pressure, the company  that all U.S. data is held outside China, in the United States with backup in Singapore.Microsoft  and the enterprise software company Oracle  are the frontrunners in the bidding. But TikTok's original backers, including the venture capital companies Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic, had also been preparing an offer, with little word on how that has advanced.TikTok was the world's most-popular app in 2018 and 2019. It has been downloaded around 1.5 billion times worldwide and by 175 million people in the United States. It ramped up overseas after buying the U.S. lip-synch app Musical.ly in 2018.In a sign of how influential TikTok has become, it announced a deal last week with indie music distributor UnitedMasters to distribute music through the app to streaming services. The move helps the artists go straight to the consumer and to streaming charts without ever using a record label. TikTok has been instrumental in helping artists like Lil Nas X and StaySolidRocky go viral.TikTok of course has a Chinese parent, ByteDance. But it has been doing plenty to separate its international business from its domestic one, where it runs an equally popular Chinese-language version of TikTok, called Douyin.It is a sign of that startup's efforts to distance itself from China that it has shortened its name to ByteDance Ltd., from its original Beijing ByteDance Technology Co.In May, ByteDance hired the head of the streaming business at Walt Disney  , Kevin Mayer, as COO of the entire company, and CEO of TikTok. Mayer, who had been passed over in February for the CEO role at Disney, remains based in Los Angeles, working on the company's global expansion. I've heard here that Chinese executives have left the company in Beijing, fearing their roles are being sidelined.If all the TikTok data is stored outside China, it is not subject to Chinese law, and out of the spying eyes of the Communist Party. TikTok says it never removes material because it is sensitive to China. The U.S. government could ensure the data storage and use claims are true without forcing a sale.TikTok has found itself in Trump's sights simply because it is so successful. Trump knows that many parents are concerned about their teens (and pre-teens who lie about their age) spending time on TikTok. Parents being parents, they don't really know what's going on on the app.It's mainly lip synching and dancing. Yes, TikTok data could be harvested and provided to the Chinese government, allowing them to track people's movements, although that would mainly be movements to Drake tunes. The data could be fed into artificial intelligence programs and used to develop facial recognition.But frankly the Chinese government has plenty of other much more efficient ways of getting its hands on that kind of information. It could equally be mining public images on Facebook  or any other popular app. Facebook has taken up the time-honored Chinese practice of imitation, rolling out in June via Instagram its TikTok competitor Reels.U.S. tech companies such as Amazon.com  , Facebook and Microsoft have all developed businesses in which they sell artificial intelligence. The Facebook function Deeptext deciphers the content posted on its sites, then uses that to send users ads based on their conversations. I have friends who swear those companies are listening through their phones to their voice conversations and doing the same...Is U.S. Big Tech discerning about where it sells its wares? Not always. In June, Amazon said it would pause a program in which it had been selling its facial-recognition tool to U.S. police forces.Microsoft's M12 Ventures private-equity arm was forced to sell off its investment in the Israeli facial-recognition company AnyVision. But only after it became public knowledge that its technology was being used by the Israeli government to surveil people movements in the West Bank.ByteDance, founded in 2012, is the world's most-valuable "unicorn" tech startup. In mulling an IPO of the entire business, it was looking at a valuation of US$150 billion to US$180 billion. Now it faces losing the crown jewel in its international empire at a cut-rate price.TikTok is to 2020 what Juul was to 2019. A fad that's super-popular with teens and very worrying to parents. That attracts the attention of vote-seeking politicians.TikTok's not a national security threat any more than any other app, foreign-owned or not. It's being hustled by the U.S. government, and I agree that's not fair.(Microsoft, Disney, Amazon, and Facebook are holdings in Jim Cramer's  .

Texas A&M professor, NASA researcher charged with hiding ties to ChinaUPIAugust 25, 2020 Tuesday 2:01 AM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 628 wordsByline: DARRYL COOTEDateline: Aug. 25 BodyThe Justice Department has charged a Texas A&amp;M University professor and NASA researcher with lying about his affiliations with Chinese universities, institutions and a government program that recruits foreign nationals with knowledge of U.S. technology and intellectual property.Zhengdong Cheng, 53, of College Station, Texas, was charged with conspiracy, making false statements and wire fraud in a criminal complaint unsealed Monday, the Justice Department said in a release."Once again, we have witnessed the criminal consequences that can arise from undisclosed participation in the Chinese government's talent program," Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers said.According to the complaint, Cheng is accused of participating in a scheme with individuals known and unknown to defraud NASA and gain access to unique resources, including those of the International Space Station, to further research at Chinese institutions and enhance his standing in a Chinese government program that incentivizes foreign Chinese nationals to steal international technology and intellectual property for Beijing.Cheng, arrested Sunday, is the latest person to be charged as part of the Justice Department's so-called China Initiative crackdown on those engaged in trade secret theft, hacking and economic espionage for Beijing. It also targets those who pose threats to U.S. infrastructure through foreign investment and supply-chain compromises.Dozens, many professors, have been charged under this initiative since its first arrest in April 2018."China is building an economy and academic institutions with bricks stolen from others all around the world," U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick for the Southern District of Texas said in a statement. "While 1.4 million foreign researchers and academics are here in the U.S. for the right reasons, the Chinese Talents Program exploits our open and free universities. These conflicts must be disclosed, and we will hold those accountable when such conflict violates the law."Cheng was hired by Texas A&amp;M in May 2004 and was part of a research team that received government grants, including a nearly $750,000 grant to conduct research for NASA, the complaint said.During the application process for this grant, Cheng hid his many paid affiliations with Chinese universities and institutions from NASA and his university. He also failed to disclose that he had taken part in China's River Talent Plan and was an applicant for its Thousand Talents Plan."Through these plans, the Chinese government has created a significant financial incentive for foreign, talented individuals to transfer international technology and intellectual property to China, licitly or otherwise," the complaint said.China uses the information these assets give it for scientific development, economic prosperity and national security, prosecutors said.If NASA knew of Cheng's Chinese affiliations, the complaint states, the grant would not have been awarded."NASA's funding restrictions are in place to protect taxpayer-financed research dollars and intellectual property," said Special Agent in Charge Mark Zielinski of the NASA Office of the Inspector General. "We will continue to pursue anyone who attempts to circumvent these guidelines and conceal affiliations with Chinese institutions and companies in order to obtain NASA grant money."The Justice Department said about 80% of all economic espionage prosecutions in the United States accuse the suspect of working for China.Cheng's arrest came less than a week after the Justice Department announced that former CIA officer Alexander Yuk Ching Ma, 67, had been charged under the China Initiative for communicating classified information to intelligence officials in Beijing.Load-Date: August 25, 2020End of Document

WECHAT 'EXTENDS CHINA'S INTERNET' TO WHEREVER USERS ARE IN THE WORLDStates News ServiceAugust 11, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1075 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Tencent's WeChat social media app has been described by human rights activists as a "prison" that keeps users within reach of the Chinese Communist Party's censors and law enforcement operations far beyond China's borders.Concerns are growing over overseas censorship and surveillance via Tencent's WeChat social media app, with the U.S. banning business with its parent entity, and rights activists describing it as a "prison" that keeps users within reach of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)'s censors and law enforcement operations far beyond China's borders.Launched by Tencent in 2011, WeChat now has more than 1.1 billion users, second only to WhatsApp and Facebook, but the company keeps users behind China's complex system of blocks, filters and human censorship known as the Great Firewall, even when they are physically in another country.The app is also used by China's state security police to carry out surveillance and harassment of dissidents and activists in exile who speak out about human rights abuses in the country, or campaign for democratic reform.And it's not just Chinese nationals who are being targeted.In May 2020 , researchers at CitizenLab at the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto warned that anyone using WeChat, even if they have lived their whole lives outside China, is "subject to pervasive content surveillance that was previously thought to be exclusively reserved for China-registered accounts."Documents and images transmitted entirely among non-China-registered accounts undergo content surveillance wherein these files are analyzed for content that is politically sensitive in China, the report, titled "We Chat, They Watch," said."International users must consider an ethical issue: whenever they use WeChat, they are actually helping to train algorithmic robots to help oppress domestic users in China," CitizenLab director Ron Deibert told RFA.He said there are "very serious" security and privacy issues associated with WeChat and other Chinese apps, and called on app stores to highlight risks to users before they download such apps.Cultural cleansingU.S.-based rights activist Zhou Fengsuo said Chinese censorship has been allowed to flourish on American soil, in spite of the relative freedom of the online environment outside of China."The United States' mistake has been that its free and open internet has allowed the CCP to occupy territory here, and build [virtual] fortresses that treat people as [virtual] slaves," Zhou said."WeChat is extending the boundaries of the Chinese internet overseas," he said. "It is unprecedented to use a country's freedom in the interests of a country that restricts freedom.""It's a kind of [cultural] cleansing. It makes me very angry to see it," he said.Wang Yaqiu, a China researcher at the New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW), said the use of WeChat by Chinese nationals even when overseas means that they have access to a less free version of the internet, even when outside China."For us, [WeChat] is like the Berlin Wall, or a prison," Wang told RFA. "It's very common for material posted on WeChat by Chinese overseas to be censored by the Chinese government."A source who has worked in online surveillance in China told RFA that any social media platform operating overseas are strictly regulated by the ministry of public security's online supervision department, according to provisions in China's national security legislation requiring Chinese companies to cooperate with security services at all times.The source, who gave only a surname, You, said apps are only allowed to be developed in the first place through a strictly controlled system of licensing, meaning that the technical features of any software are also subject to technical input from the ministry."The Chinese authorities don't allow apps to set up large user databases privately in overseas markets," You said. "They can only send the data back to China."TikTok data fearsSuch apps are also banned from cooperating with similar data requests from security and law enforcement agencies in other countries, he said."If that happens, they have to notify the Chinese government first, and then the data [must be destroyed]."U.S. President Donald Trump last week issued a ban on U.S. transactions with Tencent and ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of video-sharing app TikTok, citing a security threat posed by the transfer of data belonging to U.S. citizens to China."The spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China (China) continues to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States," Trump said in the order targeting TikTok says, noting that the app has been downloaded more than 175 million times in the U.S.The order also highlighted reports that the app censors content China deems politically sensitive, including protests over issues of autonomy in Hong Kong and Beijing's abuses of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), and said it could be used to spread disinformation to benefit the CCP.Canada-based lawyer Zhu Keliang said there are some security concerns, but that he and around 200 other Chinese-American lawyers are filing a legal challenge to the order because they rely on WeChat to stay in touch with loved ones back home."There is some truth to the concerns, and there are many problems with WeChat, but other apps such as Facebook ... in the U.S. have issues related to data security and monopoly too," Zhu told RFA. "But Americans should have the right to decide whether or not they will use it.""I don't think President Trump has the right to do that for us," Zhu said, adding that he believes that the move is disproportionate.He said the lawyers are thinking about filing lawsuits in Washington State and California, and applying to the court for a temporary injunction to suspend the implementation of the executive orders, which are due to take effect on Sept. 20, 2020.According to NBC, TikTok has also filed a lawsuit challenging the order at a federal court in southern California.Tencent and ByteDance hadn't responded to requests for comment by the time of writing.Reported by Jane Tang for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Ma Lap-hak and Wu Hoi-man for the Cantonese Service.

Take a look at the markets in Asia where the best performer was Japan; Nikkei average up 1.75%.Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning. The gloves are off, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris slamming President Trump on the economy during their first appearance as running mates.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL nominee: Donald Trump is on track to break another record, on track to leave office with the worst jobs record of any American President in modern history.SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Trump is also the reason millions of Americans are now unemployed. He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: President Trump firing back saying that the stock market is rebounding and recovering stronger than competitors, and the economy is coming back.

This follows similar moves from the Big Ten and Pac- 12. The Big 12, ACC and SEC still plan on playing as regular.Investors are looking at market that is under some selling pressure this morning. Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading, but technology led another rally yesterday, stocks closing near the highs of the day yesterday.The S&P 500 is now just 6 points away from an all-time closing high. That high hit before the height of the pandemic. Dow Industrials yesterday up 289 points and NASDAQ up 229 on the session, the S&P was up almost 50 points.Joining me right now is Lebenthal Global Advisors' President, Dominick Tavella; also joining the conversation this morning is Fox Business' Dagen McDowell; Strategic Wealth Partners' President and CEO, Mark Tepper; and Forbes Media Chairman and former Republican presidential candidate, Steve Forbes.Great to see everybody this morning. Thank you so much for being here.STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good morning.MARK TEPPER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS: Good morning. Thank you.BARTIROMO: And Dominick, let me kick it off with you. Yes, we've got some weakness this morning, but this market is on fire. More record highs that we are looking at, very close to it where the markets closed yesterday. What is powering this market? Even as we've got the shutdown still in place, even as we've got the fights about stimulus going on continuing in Washington.DOMINICK TAVELLA, PRESIDENT, LEBENTHAL GLOBAL ADVISORS: I have to tell you Maria, if somebody would have told me two, three months ago that the virus would still be here and that we would have some states shutting down or reverting back to where they were, and the S&P would be hitting an all-time high, I'd say you're out of your mind.But we have a lot of liquidity out there. Money market funds are sitting between $4 trillion and $5 trillion, bank deposits are in all-time high in large part due to stimulus that came out of Washington. We have very low interest rates. Lot of people got out of the market as we have talked in past shows, got out of the market in March, and it's just fear of missing out, so they started to pile back in.So there is a lot of liquidity and cash coming back into these markets, maybe not in an opportune time, but it's definitely coming back into these markets.BARTIROMO: So it's all about really no alternatives to rock-bottom rates. Steve Forbes, jump in here.FORBES: Well, I'm wondering when the markets are even with all that liquidity going to take account of the fact that even though Harris is being portrayed as a moderate, she is only a moderate by far-left standards of the Democrats.When the markets are going to factor in things like 40% possibly capital gains tax and massive tax increases, markets try to anticipate the future, the Democrats could win the White House, they could win the Senate. 40% capital gains tax a feature of Joe Biden, that can't be good for the markets. When are they going to factor these things in, these negatives in?TAVELLA: So Steve, if you look at those kind of numbers, right now the S&P estimates for next year, we are probably about 20 times multiple of earnings next year. Clearly, and we saw that during the Trump administration when they cut the corporate taxes, if we saw a significant capital gains tax increase, they are talking about a significant corporate tax increase, earnings would have to go down. It's just math. And then the multiples get out of hand, right.So I think as we approach November and the election, people will start really looking at these kind of numbers and maybe readjust their earnings. I think that's when they are going to focus on it. We will get a little closer.BARTIROMO: So do you think maybe Wall Street hasn't really come to a belief that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will win this thing? I mean is that why do you think markets start getting unnerved about these policies? This $2 trillion Green New Deal, Medicare for All, higher taxes, defund the police, are all of these things going to start becoming a market mover once Wall Street expects them to win? Do you think Wall Street understands or has an expectation of who is going to win this election yet?TAVELLA: I don't think they've put a full waiting on it just yet. I mean we've all seen the polls, right, and this looks like Biden is going to win this thing and maybe by a large amount. But I think those polls are dead wrong.And I speak to clients every day all over the country, there is a lot of Trump supporters out there that just rather quietly go live their lives right now. The atmosphere is not that great. So they are not out there publicly.I don't think the polls are being accurate about what they are saying. I think this election is a lot closer than people think or the polls think. And wasn't it Gunlock yesterday that announced that Trump was going to win this thing outright. So I think it's still in play. I think this election is a long way off and it's still in play.BARTIROMO: Well, that's the thing. I mean it feels like Wall Street doesn't believe that Joe Biden is going to win, otherwise we would see a different market performance. Democrats.TAVELLA: Totally agree, Maria.BARTIROMO: .and the GOP are still battling over the stimulus relief, meanwhile. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says that the negotiators remain miles apart. How much of a market mover is a new stimulus plan? How is this delay affecting the economy, Dominick?TAVELLA: Look, right now, I believe the markets do think at some point down the road, this is politics and this political season they will come up with some kind of compromises. It's kind of almost hard to believe that they won't. They both have something that they want to hang their hat on.So I think the markets - Wall Street believes that some level of stimulus is going to come in. And of course, President Trump did step in with temporary measures here. So I think something does get done, politics forced them to do it.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Dominick, good to see you this morning. Thank you so much.TAVELLA: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: We appreciate it. You want to look at our morning mover this morning. Your morning mover is Cisco, the stock tumbling nearly 6% ahead of the open. Take a look at Cisco at $45.30. Company reporting its first annual decline in revenue in three years and its first quarter guidance missed expectations; the coronavirus pandemic forcing Cisco's clients to hold back on spending. It also laid out a restructuring plan, which includes layoffs and a voluntary early-retirement program.Company CFO, Kelly Kramer, also announcing her retirement at Cisco. Investors reacting this morning.We are just getting started this morning. A big three hours coming up. Stay with us. We got a Fox Business exclusive at 7:30 a.m. Eastern when I speak with President Donald Trump. Coming up, we will cover everything from the 2020 race, new COVID guidelines to getting kids back to school, as well as origins of the Russia probe. Don't miss a moment of it, it's coming up.And then a first, Next Digital founder Jimmy Lai is here in a first on Fox interview, speaking out since his most recent arrest in Hong Kong. What does the national security law in China mean for Hong Kongers?Then it's a power hour at the 8:00 a.m. hour. California Congressman Devin Nunes is here with the latest on the Michael Flynn case, and new documents related to FBI corruption. Plus, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul joining me to talk about the stimulus stalemate and the latest on the 2020 race.Don't miss a moment of it. You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Jimmy Lai is speaking out. The Next Digital founder and pro-democracy advocate released on bail in Hong Kong days after being taken into custody on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces; the arrest falling under Hong Kong's controversial new national security law.Joining me right now in a first on Fox Business is Next Digital founder Jimmy Lai live right now. Jimmy, thank you so much for joining us.First off, are you okay? Can you tell us what happened to you?JIMMY LAI, FOUNDER, NEXT DIGITAL: Well, I was taken by the police handcuffed day before yesterday and detained me for 40 hours. The charges is, under the national security law, collusion with foreign powers and all that, because of the interviews that I had and all that. So that's it. I don't know what happened. I was really surprised that they let me have a bail out. I thought that I won't have the bail until the trial. That is something that is quite lending (ph) of them to let them out.And - but I was not afraid of being sent to China, because when the police came to my house, like - almost like 20 of them inside. I don't know how many outside. None of them speak Mandarin; they are all Hong Kong Police. So I was at least reassured that they won't take me to China. The Hong Kong Police is still at least in control of the National Security Department and that was it. I don't know what is going to happen later. I don't know what the exact charge will be, but whatever comes, it will be OK. You know, I'm ready for it.BARTIROMO: So just to be clear, they did not take you across the border to China because this new national security law allows them to do such that they can - it's so open-ended and broad-based, they could take you.LAI: Right.BARTIROMO: .across the border and torture you. Did they do that to you, Jimmy?LAI: No, no, no. They didn't. They just - they took me to the station and put me in the temporary holding place for overnight and they did treat me quite politely, you know, because I was a criminal. So they can't treat me like a gentleman, they had to treat me like a criminal. For the treatment of a criminal, they have been very polite and very civil. So, I was not mistreated, no.BARTIROMO: So, do you fear that this could be the case in the future, Jimmy? I mean, tell me what they told you and what your plans are after this? What is this, the third or fourth arrest, Jimmy, at this point?LAI: Well, I think that this charge will last a long time. I think the most important intention for them is to retain me in Hong Kong, not allow me to travel, because I have a case coming up on the 22nd and 23rd. So, you know, that case is a charge that I don't think that - I don't think that I will lose. So they are afraid that if I win that case, they will have to let me out.I was actually quite surprised that they arrest me so quick, because I thought they would realize that the national security law they implemented in Hong Kong was a blunder given that strong reaction from the international community. And also, the unraveling of a lot of business people's sentiment in Hong Kong according to a poll, recent poll, that 30% of business leaders are planning or already moving their business away from Hong Kong, and 40% of them said that they are thinking of immigration.BARTIROMO: Right.LAI: So, they knew that the whole international financing center that they still treasure is unraveling because 65% of the direct investment in Hong Kong - in China has to be executed in Hong Kong because the rule of law here that they get protection.So, but I - maybe they think that they need to have the law, the national security law in active but not common. So they have to enact, to make sure people realize that the law will be enact, but I think after that they will let the law low profile, make sure that they appease the business people, the international community so nothing changes. Hong Kong goes on as before and I think this is the intention that the reason they arrest me is to make sure that everybody understands the intimidation is alive and is there.So, they would enact it any time they need to. I think this is the reason they arrest me.BARTIROMO: Yes. But that's the point. The law is still in place and they can do whatever they want at any time at another time. We have Hong Kongers gathering at shopping malls overnight to demand press freedom. The people are still on the streets. Tell me what you want to see from the international community.This has become China versus the free world. You're seeing what they've done in terms of invading India, trying to target the Senkaku Islands in Japan, militarizing the South China Sea, overreaching in Hong Kong.Have you seen the response from the international community? We are going to be speaking with President Trump in a couple of minutes. He's coming on live in about an hour on this program. What do you want President Trump to understand about the situation you find yourself in, Jimmy?LAI: Well, I think, the international community has done exactly, they are waking up to China that they think eventually will be more like them now is very different from what they expect. I think the whole world, the free world, has waking up to it. So, once they are waking up to it, they know how to deal with it, because we need China as a partner in the world, because this is beneficial to the world, both to the world and to China. The only thing we need is to have China assimilate into the values of the world and they have to realize that.I think the international community has to make sure China will have to understand that when they deal with the outside world, they have to deal with the civilized west values. It's not that their dictator values, because China is becoming so big and even eventually will be the biggest economy in the world, we have to make sure that they understand that to deal with the world, the world can only keep peace if China becomes a peaceful partner. And I think that is what the world has to let China know.BARTIROMO: Yes. But at the same time, they're not following the international rules of the road, Jimmy. They are disappearing people; they are stealing intellectual property; they are breaking promises in terms of militarizing the South China Sea and invading other countries. So, what is it going to take for China to start playing by the rules of the international fairness of the road?LAI: I think they realize that they are now facing a world very different from more than 40 years the world have allowed them to prosper in and to make business. That's why recently you can see that their rhetoric has become more consolation, naturally (ph) without that on rhetorics. You know, they have become more friendly and try to reconcile with the world, and I think this is a good sign.I hope that they just go on to realize that, China is see of all (ph) country, as Li Keqiang says that 600 million people still earning RMB 1,000 which equal to $130. So they can't just be - have the ambition to dominate the world. They have to follow the rules of the world and they will become prosperous and big, and be welcomed by the world. And that's good for the China, that's good for China and that's good for the world. I think they have to realize that. I think Mr. Trump can talk to them and have them realize that.BARTIROMO: Yes. Tell us what's happening on the ground in Hong Kong, Jimmy, the way you see it. In the last couple of weeks before you were detained, what does the sentiment feel like on the ground in Hong Kong right now? Tell the rest of the world what you're seeing.LAI: Well, I think the national security law has definitely had a very effective intimidation on the people. It's all quiet. People are thinking of immigrations. I talked to people. People are thinking of immigrations and people actually react very strongly to my arrest.The whole, the emotion of the city was overwhelming. And people were very angry, so you know the people, they are not accepting this. But they are staying low profile because they cannot do anything, because the national security law is so draconian, any time they can take you to China for 10 years or for life. That's something very dreadful and a lot of people are very afraid.BARTIROMO: Right.LAI: Even those executives who were arrested with me, some of them came back really shaken. They were very afraid. So, people are really scared now.BARTIROMO: Jimmy, do you think that China will change? Do you think that China will understand that the rest of the world, the free world, will not tolerate this behavior?LAI: Well, I hope they can, because a lot is at stake, especially in China, OK. But it's difficult for them to change, especially when Xi Jinping is the President. Xi Jinping is totally the Mao Zedong kind of hardcore communist. He wants to bring China back to the Mao kind. All the control that he's increasing is exactly the way that Mao was controlling the country. So, it is not hopeful that they can change.But they need to change and they know that now.BARTIROMO: But, but--LAI: So how they come out with it, we don't know.BARTIROMO: But the Chinese government has elevated - the Chinese government has elevated Xi Jinping to the same status that Mao had, which is dictator for life.LAI: Right.BARTIROMO: Is that when everything changed, Jimmy?LAI: Well, unless they change Xi Jinping which is not impossible, because Xi Jinping - since his ascendance, the whole country is facing problems they never had to face in the 40 years of the economic opening. China has become the second biggest economy of the world just because America has been very friendly with them, the world has been very friendly with them.Now, all of a sudden, everybody turned their face against China and they should realize that that is not a good sign. It's going to make China's dealing with the world very difficult and if just for instance, the U.S. sanctioned the chips to China, it has so much damaged the economy already. So, let alone all the other sanctions and all that, I'm sure they want to find way to step down and the world can help them to do so with some agreement.But, also at the same time, can the world trust CCP when they violate so many of the promises? It's something the world has to crack this nut. The world has to solve this problem with china because without solving the problem with China, we won't have peace - the world won't have the peace. Because China -BARTIROMO: Right.LAI: We can't have a hot war with China, even a cold war with China.BARTIROMO: Right.LAI: We cannot decouple commercially with China because they are very efficient and big manufacturers, and a big market.BARTIROMO: Yes.LAI: So, we have to find a way. The world has to find a way to reconcile with China and China with the world.BARTIROMO: Jimmy, you make so many important points. We are so happy to see that you are safe and we will continue to talk with you as much as we can. We need the rest of the world to make sure to see you safe, Jimmy Lai. So, we are going to keep turning the camera on you to make sure that we understand what's going on and how China is behaving. Jimmy Lai, thank you for your courage and leadership. Thanks for being here this morning.LAI: Thank you. Thank you so much.BARTIROMO: We'll be watching. That I assure you.LAI: Thank you for having me (ph).BARTIROMO: Alright, Jimmy. Thank you, Jimmy. Jimmy Lai, joining us live from Hong Kong. What a compelling interview and commentary he just made.Coming up, we've got an exclusive interview coming up with President Donald Trump. We are set to cover a slew of topics, including Hong Kong. We will also talk about new COVID guidelines as schools look to reopen. Don't miss it; this exclusive interview with the President, coming up in one hour's time. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Thursday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, August 13th. Let's take a look at markets right here, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast. Futures are fairly flat ahead of initial jobless claims, they're due out in 2-hours time, we will get those numbers at 8:30 a.m., Dow Industrials right now down 14 points, Nasdaq down 10, S&P 500 down 3.5.Markets rally big time yesterday, the S&P 500 closed about 6 points shy of a fresh record high. It was up 200 -- the S&P was up 46 points yesterday, the Nasdaq, look at that, was up 229 points with technology continuing to lead this market, up 2 percent on the Nasdaq, the Dow is up better than 1 percent, 289 points higher yesterday at 4 O'clock on Wall Street. Global markets this morning mostly lower, European indices red across the board.Take a look at the FTSE 100 down 58, the CAC Quarante in Paris down 9, the Dax Index in Germany lower by 32. The U.S. announcing it is keeping tariffs on $7.5 billion of European and U.K. products due to state aid being given to Airbus. In Asia overnight, markets were mostly higher. Take a look at the best performer there being -- I believe it was Japan, Nikkei Average up 1.78 percent overnight.And now there's this, Uber and Lyft may be closing up shop in California. For now, Cheryl Casone with the details there, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: That's right, Maria. All of this after the state actually ruled earlier this week that ride-sharing drivers must be classified as full-time employees. Both companies are trying to appeal this decision. If they lose, their CEOs both say they may have to pull drivers off the road for several months. And the companies would then need voters in California to support proposition 22 in November, that would allow ride- sharing drivers to work as independent contractors.A lot of talk about this on Lyft's call -- earnings call last night. Lyft is unchanged in the pre-market, Uber is slightly down. Well, nine major tech companies are working with the federal government on how to handle misinformation during the election. The group which includes Facebook, Reddit, Google and Twitter met with officials yesterday to discuss, quote, "preparations for the upcoming conventions and scenario planning related to the election results." Big-tech partnership was formed in the wake of the 2016 election when Ford meddling interfered with the process.Well, way to go in Florida. Starting November 6th, United is adding 28 daily nonstop flights to the sunshine state. Those trips are going to originate in non-United hub cities like for instance, New York's LaGuardia Airport, Boston, Cleveland, but United says it's going to scale things back if Florida cases in Florida do remain high -- by the way, Maria, some of these flights are under 200 bucks round trip because maybe I was checking a few moments ago. Anyway, there's United right now, it's down more than 1.5 percent.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you. Good stuff. Stimulus showdown meanwhile, it continues. Lawmakers remain stalled after failing to agree on further coronavirus aid last week. Republicans and Democrats are divided on how much money to spend. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says negotiators are "miles apart", quote, unquote. President Trump weighed in on the stimulus fight yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They turned down this bill because they want radical-left agenda items that nobody in their right mind would approve. So they want $25 billion for the Post Office, they want $2.5 -- or $3.5 billion for universal mail-in, $3.5 billion, and the bill is not going to happen because they don't even want to talk about it because we can't give them the kind of ridiculous things that they want that have nothing to do with the China virus.It has nothing at all to do with China virus, much of what they're asking for.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Texas Congressman, House Financial Services Committee member Roger Williams. And Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. What are the sticking points --REP. ROGER WILLIAMS (R-TX): Good to see you --BARTIROMO: What are the Democrats pushing for that are no-goes for the Republicans?WILLIAMS: Well, I think the president said it right. I mean, we want a package that's going to have mainstream America, but when you look at things like they always throw the life issue in there and they throw famous illegal immigrants, and this sort of thing has nothing to do with what we're trying to accomplish. You get money out in main street, but we still have money out there about a $100 million in the PPP program that we can use and some other money out there.But when they throw these other things in, it makes it really hard to vote for it, and it's not anything to do with helping the economy.BARTIROMO: So, I mean, what are the priorities then? What do you believe is needed to get the economy moving again and get people at home feeling confident to go back to work?WILLIAMS: Well, I think the economy is ready to go, Maria. I mean, you look at the lowest interest rates we've seen in years, the lowest tax rates, there's money in the system. Look at the stock market. I think we could make it pretty simple. As a business owner for 50 years, I think we need to cut regulations and we need to -- we need to pass liability insurance for big business, small business, main street America, so we can do business and not worry about being sued out of business. Just look at the college football yesterday.A lot of these -- a lot of these conferences I think entertain the liability issue and just being the -- more than what they wanted to deal with. So that's how you fix the economy and get it going again. Let entrepreneurship work, let main street America get going and not have to worry about the liability issue with the virus.BARTIROMO: So do you -- do you want to see further tax cuts? I mean, putting the stimulus aside, looking forward as this economy recovers from this shutdown, congressman, what are the tools you'd like to see used in terms of fixing this and bringing us back to where we were?WILLIAMS: Well, like I said earlier, I think we're on -- I think we're just around the edge of the economy breaking loose again. If we cut regulations, then we do need to cut taxes. We created the lower -- the greatest tax cuts in the history of our country. We saw what it did, it put money in the system, got money out of the hands of the government. But we need -- we could cut taxes even more, pass liability insurance and turn it finally back over to main street America and let us hire people and get back to the numbers --BARTIROMO: Yes --WILLIAMS: We were at in January.BARTIROMO: Mark Tepper, jump in here.MARK TEPPER, PRESIDENT & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS: Yes, the economy definitely needs to reopen. I mean, we were literally on the ropes about 6 months ago. We've done a great job rebounding, but we still have a lot of ways to go. I agree, I think liability protection is one of the most important things. I personally know a lot of business owners who are concerned, you know, people that own restaurants who are concerned about how many people they can fit inside and things like that.So liability protection is important, but we just also have to continue with the reopening effort, right? We need to get the American public back out there doing what we were doing in 2019 --BARTIROMO: Yes --TEPPER: And then the third thing is, you know, the unemployment insurance, that extra $600 a week which is now over and done with, that was disincentivizing quite a bit of workers from going back to work and making their contribution to getting our economy back to whole.BARTIROMO: Yes, congressman, you agree with all that?WILLIAMS: Totally. And I can tell you the unemployment insurance, I mean, of course, it's ended now. We're starting to see our unemployment numbers drop because people are going back to work. You know, people don't come to America, they don't come to Texas to draw unemployment, they come here to get a paycheck and work. And, you know --BARTIROMO: Yes --WILLIAMS: Like we said, let's -- you know, quit paying people to not work, let's cut regulations, let's cut taxes, let's provide liability insurance, and then you've got a formula for a heck of a good economy and a comeback. I can tell you, 50 years being in business, I've seen --BARTIROMO: So --WILLIAMS: A lot of things happen, and this economy is ready to go.BARTIROMO: So what do you want to say then to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris who were out and about yesterday holding their first appearance as running mates, and both took the opportunity to slam the president, slam his handling of the economy, and, you know, said that he drove it into the ground. What are your answers to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on that?WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think driving an economy to the ground as when you've got more jobs than people. You've got the lowest tax rates as we've said earlier, you've got the lowest unemployment, we're talking about January and February, that's not driving it to the ground. And the interesting thing is, that's coming from people who have never run a business, never met a payroll, never had to draw in a line of credit.And so naturally, I guess that's the thing they would say because they can only go back to what would government do? President Trump, people like myself and others, we go back, what we do in business, what we do to hire people. So this is going to be the debate, and this is going to be the debate of big government against main street America and they're going to think big government does it better, and that's what the election is going to be about.And I would say the American public are not stupid and they're going to see what their 401ks, what the stock market has done, and I think they're going to go with less government and more opportunity.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, you can't hide the fact that before this coronavirus, we had the best economy and jobs market in a generation if not ever, certainly in my lifetime. What was your reaction to Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's pick? What does she bring to the table, congressman?WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, that was his decision, but what he did, he did not pick a moderate. He picked a person, I think maybe has the most liberal voting record in the Senate. Again, she has no experience. She's been 3 years in the Senate. That's not experience to run the country. She's never run a business, never met a payroll and she's not going to be able to learn how to do it because the fellow she's going to be working with has never done that either.So, I think it's a really big contrast Americans will see, Americans will make. And like you say, January, February, best economy I've ever seen. And we can get back to that. I think we can see growth in the fourth quarter if we do the things we talked about this morning with liability protection for small businesses, cut taxes, cut regulations and let main street go.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. We will watch this development, congressman, it's good to see you this morning sir, thank you.WILLIAMS: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Congressman Roger Williams joining us this morning. We will take a break, when we come back, President Donald Trump will join me live in less than an hour for an exclusive interview, we will talk about the latest coming out of Hong Kong, and of course, the 2020 race as well. Stay with us, back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, back to school uncertainty. Parents waiting to see if their children will return to the classroom, as schools struggle to figure out how to return safely. President Trump is pushing for students to go back to school in person.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Virtual learning is not like being in the classroom, and we've learned that I think very strongly in almost all cases. And people thought for a long time that would be the answer, but it's -- that's not the answer. The answer is an old-fashioned one, isn't it?(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The White House issuing guidelines yesterday which encourage the use of face masks and social distancing in the classroom. Joining us right now is Professor at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, Med Page today editor-in-chief and Fox News medical contributor, Dr. Marty Makary. Dr. Makary, great to see you, thanks very much for joining us. What are the most important safety protocols, do you think we can get back to school in the Fall?MARTY MAKARY, PROFESSOR, JOHNS HOPKINS SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: Well, good morning, Maria, I think it's important to put things in perspective. If we just look at the data, 105 children using a very broad definition of children, that is kids 0 to 20 years of age, 105 have died to date from COVID out of the 165,000 deaths. My concern is that we are closing schools that should not be closed. That is a public health hazard, it's had its implications for nutrition, substance abuse.There's pods for example, so if one kid gets infected, it doesn't take down the whole school, some staggering stats. Look, Santa Barbara schools are not the same as Baltimore schools where I practice medicine. So, we've got to really tailor the practices to that individual community based on the background level of infection.BARTIROMO: So, what are the -- what are the risks of kids not learning in the traditional way in the school, in the classroom? You know, there have been lots of discussion about the cost of this, and one is that they're losing earnings once they do get to go to work because -- get a job because of all of this missed schooling. What in your view are the most important risks that children are not getting because they're not in school?MAKARY: Well, we have to remember that most kids that get -- for example, mental health help in some way, some medical mental health treatment get it through the school system. And so it's not only important for development, it's important for the health of the kids. Now, we know that the American Academy --BARTIROMO: Yes --MAKARY: Of Pediatrics felt strongly about this before it was politicized. So if we listen to the experts, it's pretty clear there's a lot developmental and economic benefits long-term.BARTIROMO: Yes, so one Georgia school district reopening then quickly quarantining more than 900 students and staff because of fears of coronavirus. How do we make sure that, that doesn't happen across the country?MAKARY: Well, I think it's important that schools not close or plan to be close based on fear. You really can't know how you're doing too far in advance. We can look at the 5 and 7-day moving averages, we can probably predict about a week or two out. So when schools make long decisions -- long-term decisions about the entire year or the entire calendar year, it really makes no sense whatsoever. Think about a hurricane or snow days, you might be able to predict --BARTIROMO: Yes --MAKARY: That a couple of days or even a week in advance, but you've got to make real-time decisions, so when there's an active outbreak, that's when the schools need to be closed. When several kids test positive, that's when you need to make a decision, but these are game-day decisions.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there, Dr. Marty Makary, we'll keep watching it, thanks very much for being here this morning sir, we appreciate your insights --MAKARY: Thank you, Maria --BARTIROMO: Coming up, President Donald Trump will join me in an exclusive interview coming up this morning at 7:30 a.m. Eastern, we are talking about the economy, the growing tensions with China among other topics, don't miss it. Coming up, in 30 minutes time, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Jimmy Lai speaking out in his first interview since being released on bail in Hong Kong. The democracy advocate at the center of Hong Kong's fight against China and its authoritarianism, he told me earlier this hour that everything changed amid Xi Jinping's rise to power. And that it might be time for the world to push him out. Steve Forbes, your reaction to what Jimmy Lai just said to us.STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Well, I think what we see here is a version in Hong Kong of Alexander, social needs him. The great Soviet decedent who did more than anyone else to focus on the Gulak system, they eventually had to exile him and he helped undermine Soviet support around the world. Jimmy Lai is doing the same thing here.They thought they could do a cheap arrest and intimidate him and others, it backfired and they're going to finally have to figure out, well, how do we go from here. And they're also going to find out, Maria, that hard power is one thing, but also international public opinion which is easy to dismiss is a real factor. It helped undermine the Soviet Union and Jimmy Lai here is doing it right here. Xi Jinping has got to really answer some hard questions about where is China today vis-a-vis 5 or 10 years ago in its quest for world dominance. He has really set them back, and Jimmy Lai with soft power is amazing what he's been doing.BARTIROMO: Well, you're right and the Chinese government has lifted Xi Jinping to the same status as Mao, but the free world has reacted, Steve, and this is not the U.S. versus China, this is China versus the free world. Look at how people reacted to how they invaded India, 20 soldiers dead, how they're now targeting Senkaku Islands in Japan. Dagen McDowell, also overreaching in Hong Kong, disappearing people and, of course, stealing intellectual property which has been their MO for decades.MCDOWELL: I listened here and listened to Jimmy Lai and watched Jimmy Lai and see what he's done, and I just think everybody, particularly in this country taking our great freedoms for granted. Needs to look in and ask themselves, would you have that strength and determination and fearlessness faced with a communist government that is trying to basically do away with you, and do away with whatever -- everything that you believe in.I think that, that's the message, and are we going stand up as a nation to China in the months and years to come.BARTIROMO: That's right. And a lot of people are comparing this to 1939 Europe that you don't want to be an enabler of this kind of behavior. We'll keep watching this. Straight ahead, my Fox Business exclusive with President Donald Trump, he will join me live in just about half an hour's time. We'll talk about Hong Kong, the economy, China, the 2020 race and beyond, don't miss a moment of it. It all starts next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live on Fox Business.Load-Date: August 13, 2020End of Document

Chinese govt complicates TikTok sale ordered by US govtAssociated Press Financial WireAugust 31, 2020 Monday 6:29 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 369 wordsByline: TALI ARBEL and ZEN SOO, AP Technology WritersDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) — The Chinese government is complicating the U.S.-government-ordered sale of U.S. TikTok assets.China on Friday introduced export restrictions on artificial intelligence technology, seemingly including the type that TikTok uses to choose which videos to spool up to its users. That means TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, would have to obtain a license to export any restricted technologies to a foreign company.The Trump administration has threatened to ban TikTok by mid-September and ordered ByteDance to sell its U.S. business, claiming national-security risks due to that Chinese ownership. The government worries about user data being funneled to Chinese authorities. TikTok denies it is a national-security risk and is suing to stop the administration from the threatened ban.Prospective buyers for U.S. TikTok assets include Microsoft and Walmart and, reportedly, Oracle. Oracle has declined to comment.On Saturday, Chinese state-owned media outlet Xinhua News Agency quoted government trade adviser and professor Cui Fan, who said that Bytedance should consider whether it should halt negotiations to sell TikTok in the U.S.“As with any cross-border transaction, we will follow the applicable laws, which in this case include those of the U.S. and China,” said ByteDance General Counsel Erich Andersen.The Chinese government's new restrictions may be a “tactic to drive up valuation” of TikTok, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Alex Zukin, who still expects a deal announcement “relatively soon." The Wall Street Journal reported last week that ByteDance is asking for $30 billion for the U.S. operations, but has faced resistance from bidders. The Journal said in a Sunday story that deal talks had "slowed."Microsoft and Walmart declined to comment on Monday.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, during a White House briefing, did not directly answer whether the administration would accept a sale of U.S. assets of TikTok if the deal were subject to Chinese government approval. “Negotiations are ongoing on a sale of TikTok so we are not going to get in the way of those negotiations,” she said.—Associated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed to this report from Washington.Load-Date: August 31, 2020End of Document

Trump bans deals with TikTok and WeChat ownersCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 319 wordsBodyNEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump on Thursday ordered an unspecified ban on "transactions" with Chinese owners of the TikTok and WeChat apps.The two decrees— one for each application — will come into force in 45 days. They ask the Commerce Secretary to have prohibited transactions defined by that date. The language of executive orders is vague, but leaves open the possibility that the ban could include the availability of apps in Apple and Google stores.Trump had threatened to "close" TikTok if Microsoft or "someone else" did not buy it before September 15. TikTok, Microsoft and Tencent, owner of WeChat, did not respond at the moment to requests for comments.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that he would expand the U.S. beating against Chinese technology to personal applications, arguing alleged security threats and pointing to TikTok and WeChat by name. Analysts questioned Wednesday the legal basis for an application ban.The decree issued by Trump on Thursday night claims to have legal authority to do so based on the International Emergency Economic Colleges Act and the National Emergency Act.TikTok is a video sharing app that is extremely popular with young people in the United States and other countries. It is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, which operates a separate version for the Chinese market. TikTok insists that it does not store information from US users in China and would not share it with the Chinese government.WeChat and its sister Weixin app are very popular messaging apps in China; Many Chinese expats use WeChat to stay in touch with friends and family in their country. The apps are owned by Tencent, a Chinese digital conglomerate.WeChat also says that it does not share information with the Chinese government and has never done so, and does not store international user information in China. Information from U.S. users is saved in Canada.Load-Date: August 8, 2020End of Document

REPS. JOHN JOYCE AND ADAM KINZINGER: COMMUNIST CHINA PUTS OUR TECHNOLOGY AND SAFETY AT RISK EVERY DAYStates News ServiceAugust 4, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 819 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Pennsylvania Rep. John Joyce:Communist China Puts Our Technology and Safety At Risk Every DayReps. John Joyce, M.D. and Adam KinzingerJuly 31, 2020It's been a long time coming, but more and more Americans are waking up to the threat of Chinese influence in our technology. This is a reality we must face as a nation and one we need to get a handle on before it's too late.The FBI is currently investigating more than 1,000 cases of Chinese technology theft. And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently highlighted the dangers of TikTok, a popular video-sharing platform that has gained influence with young Americans. While the lip-syncing videos on TikTok may appear harmless, this company's data harvesting on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP, is far from innocuous.The CCP's ever-expanding influence in global technology poses a grave threat to America and our allies every single day.And yet this isn't a new problem. For years, the Chinese government has stolen data and information as it seeks to achieve global dominance in technology and military capabilities. More than a decade ago, Chinese hackers targeted Google, Adobe and other high-profile tech firms to steal intellectual property and personal data. Though it wasn't the first cyberattack to originate in China, "Operation Aurora" demonstrated the severity of this threat back in 2009.As brazen as that breach was, China continued to up the ante. A series of high-profile cyberattacks on major international retailers and U.S. defense contractors was followed by a devastating 2014-15 breach of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. Communist China got its hands on the records of 19 million Americans who had applied for national security jobs a document trove said to be the "crown jewels" of spycraft. The federal government's response was insufficient, and the CCP escalated their attacks and fine-tuned their methods even further.American institutions are targeted by these sophisticated attacks daily as the CCP looks to steal our intellectual property, our state secrets and our personal information.The coronavirus crisis, fueled by the CCP's lies at the onset of the outbreak, has further exposed these threats. The CCP threatened to withhold medical supplies as well as certain pharmaceutical ingredients that are used to manufacture critical medicines Americans rely on and use regularly. And the Department of Homeland Security has caught Chinese-affiliated hackers attempting to steal U.S. research on a coronavirus vaccine.While cases of this virus continue to grow across the country, Americans are eagerly looking toward our science and technology leaders for a solution. As researchers work on finding effective treatments and developing a coronavirus vaccine, the U.S. must protect this research from China and other bad actors across the globe.China's more recent technological power not only endangers America's national security, it also poses a serious threat to the human rights of Chinese citizens and freedom-loving people around the world. Communist governments do not tolerate any form of dissent, and Beijing routinely uses technology to surveil, silence and threaten its critics. Huawei, another company with ties to the Chinese government, regularly comes under fire for its blatant disregard of human rights. Time and time again, the CCP has demonstrated it will use malicious tactics to exert its power and to hide its missteps from the world.The CCP has managed to fuel its own technological abilities by using cyberattacks that stranglehold their targets. And it's time we push back on the power grabs and address the reality of these threats by Communist China. We cannot cede any further ground to this hostile regime.In Congress, we have presented commonsense solutions that address overreach by the CCP. As members of the China Task Force, we are working to expose the CCP's interference in our technology and develop pragmatic solutions to bolster our defenses. Our team is working on proposals that will secure American research and punish bad actors who steal intellectual property paid for by American taxpayers.Additionally, the China Task Force is focused on equipping our scientists to win the race to 5G and remove Chinese telecom infrastructure from the United States. To achieve lasting progress, America must continue and expand its prohibition of dangerous technologies originating from China, like Huawei and ZTE, and create incentives for our allies to follow suit.In the 21st century, the United States simply cannot afford to fall behind China's technology momentum. For the sake of our national security and the good of the American people, we must once again lead in innovation and ensure security for our telecommunications.Read the full op-ed in Roll Call, and learn more about Dr. Joyce's work on the China Task Force.###Load-Date: August 4, 2020End of Document

CHINA 'WILL END' MONGOLIAN-LANGUAGE EDUCATION STARTING THIS SEMESTER: REPORTSStates News ServiceAugust 24, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1219 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:China's ruling Communist Party is to end Mongolian-medium education in the northern region of Inner Mongolia, which borders the independent country of Mongolia, according to an overseas-based rights group.Hundreds of teachers in Tongliao and Ulaanhad cities have been called to urgent, secret meetings at primary and secondary schools in recent days, where they were told that the Chinese government has ordered them to switch to Chinese-medium education from Sept. 1, the New York-based Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center (SMHRIC) said in a report on its website."The fate of Mongolian language education seems to be sealed," an ethnic Mongolian teacher said in an audio statement quoted by SMHRIC. "This not only is unconstitutional but also is a flagrant violation of the basic human rights of the Mongolian people from a universal human rights perspective," the teacher said, adding that they had been forced to sign non-disclosure agreements before leaving."All teachers were warned not to raise any questions or opinions of opposition," it quoted a second teacher as saying via WeChat.Government censors have also shut down a popular Mongolian-language social media platform and censored comments on the policy on WeChat, the report said."Southern [Inner] Mongolia has quickly become a police state again in the past few days as the tension has risen between the government and the Mongolians who are about to be deprived of their last symbol of national identitythe Mongolian language," ethnic Mongolian blogger Nasandelger posted to the social media platform WeChat.SMHRIC said ethnic Mongolians have been protesting in recent days after a government document detailing the plan was leaked.The authorities responded by targeting the Mongolian-language social media app Bainuu, the group cited activists as saying."The systematic crackdown really started [with] the total shutdown of all Bainuu chat groups last Wednesday around 4:00 p.m. local time," the group quoted Bainuu user Dugar Zaisan as saying."Then almost 72 hours later, around 4:00 p.m. Saturday local time, the timelines and walls of all Bainuu users became unavailable," the message said.WeChat discussions and posts on the changes, which are euphemistically referred to in official documents as "bilingual education," are being deleted in large numbers, while hundreds of WeChat users have received visits and warnings from state security police, SMHRIC said."At least 28 people in our WeChat groups, mostly consisting of concerned parents and students, were either summoned or visited by state security personnel in a single day," the group cited an ethnic Mongolian user Oyuungerel as saying via WeChat.Users warnedThe group said some 450 Southern Mongolian WeChat users have been warned by local State Security and Public Security authorities either over the phone or in-person not to spread information about the "bilingual education" program online.Writer Sechenbaatar told SMHRIC he had received a visit from government officials and state security police officers two days ago, during which they warned him not to speak out on the language policy on social media."Seventy years of killing and political oppression do not seem to be enough," Sechenbaatar said in an audio message posted online."Now the Chinese are about to cut our tongues off, too! Feet shackled and tongues cut off, our nation and our people are soon to be pushed into a dark and bottomless grave," he said.SMHRIC quoted a third ethnic Mongolian teacher from Tongliao as saying that there is an official directive from Beijing with its characteristic red letterhead circulating among schools in the area, although teachers weren't allowed to read it directly."Yes, there is a secret official document from the central government," the teacher told SMHRIC. "The school authorities and the personnel from the Bureau of Education showed us the red letterhead of the official document but declined to show us the contents."An official who answered the phone to SMHRIC in the Heshigten Banner education bureau near Ulaanhad city confirmed the reports."[Ethnic] Mongolian students in elementary schools must start learning Chinese from first grade as opposed to second grade starting this September," he said in an audio interview posted to WeChat.Political studies will be taught in Chinese from Sept. 1 in Mongolian-medium schools with further subjects to follow in the next two years."[This comes] directly from the central government," he said.The news comes after a visit by Ge Weiwei, a high-ranking Communist Party official in charge of ethnic minority education policy, to Tongliao on June 3.Strong oppositionThis change has met with strong opposition among ethnic Mongolians, the SMHRIC said."Mongolians from ordinary herders to prominent intellectuals, from students to professors, have all expressed their opposition to the new policy through China's only available social media outlet, WeChat," it said."If our language is wiped out, we as a distinct people will also cease to exist," it quoted Chimeddorj, a professor at Inner Mongolia University, as saying in a video statement.Parent Nasanbayar commented via WeChat that he would take his children out of school rather than allow them to lose their Mongolian identity."The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government decided to implement a policy to ban Mongolian language education completely starting September 2020," Chogt Oghonos, ethnic Mongolian professor at Shizuoka University in Japan, said in a video statement referring to the changes as "cultural genocide."SMHRIC director Enghebatu Togochog said the policy is the culmination of three decades of discriminatory policies in the region."Rural Mongolian schools have already been wiped out and the number of students taught in Mongolian has declined by 80 percent since the early 1980s," he said. "Our traditional way of life has been completely destroyed and our identity obliterated. Now, if we lose our language, then we have nothing else to lose.""[This is] the finishing touch on China's cultural genocide in Southern Mongolia."Call for independenceThe new policy sparked immediate calls for independence for Inner Mongolia from China, including by ethnic Mongolian rights activist and former political prisoner Hada."Even if this round of our resistance moment ends up with failure in the face of China's brutal crackdown, the moment itself will help lay the firm foundation of our future movement for independence," Hada said in a statement posted online.One parent from Left Ujumchin Banner, a county-like administrative division of Inner Mongolia, recorded his conversation with state security police, who warned him off commenting on the language policy."Let me make myself clear to you. If I were afraid of speaking, I would have not spoken," Suhee is heard telling police on the recording posted online."If you want to arrest me, go ahead and have [the police] arrest me, and throw me into your jail as political prisoner," he tells them. "I am not afraid of dying now."Mongolian wrestlers said they would be going on strike in protest at the policy, SMHRIC said.Reported by RFA's Mandarin and Cantonese Services.

"We cannot let our home be taken by Beijing"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 22, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1891 wordsBody40 days after their enactment by the Chinese government, Hong Kong journalistic and academic guilds show their outrage at the national security law imposed on them. It's an assault on democracy, they say, trying to end the opposition movement that kept local government in check in 2019. Despite the arrests of recent days, activists say they will not let their home be taken by Beijing.MEXICO CITY (Process).– On 30 June, the Beijing government enacted the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Safeguarding of National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which tightens measures against those who express some form of non-conformity or openly disagree with the authorities of former British government.Today, who rides slogans such as "Free Hong Kong; the revolution of our times" or use objects with the phrase "Independence of Hong Kong" can be arrested for promoting the country's alleged secession and even going to prison for three years if the crime is criminalized, or life imprisonment if serious, in accordance with the new rule.The punitive measure passed in secret in Beijing was extended to schools, where students are asked to stop the proliferation of slogans in classrooms or sing songs containing political messages, according to a communication sent by Hong Kong Education Secretary Kevin Yeung to lawmaker Ip Kin-yuen on 8 July last.After the enactment of the controversial law, the volumes of pro-democracy activists, such as Joshua Wong and Tanya Chan, disappeared from local bookstores.Nathan Law, an iconic opposition figure, decided to flee town. There are 12 other democratic candidates who are prohibited by the authorities from participating in parliamentary elections that were scheduled for next September but postponed for a year - citing security measures by the covid-19 pandemic - according to a statement issued on 30 July.The repressive escalation hit Jimmy Lai, founder and president of the Beijing government critic Apple Daily, on Monday 10. In a statement, the Foreign Correspondents Club in Hong Kong reported that the tycoon was arrested at home, while 200 policemen raided the newspaper's newsroom and offices.The operation was recorded and streamed live through the newspaper's Facebook account. Lai is accused of alleged collusion with foreign forces, an act that is punished by the new law.Local government upholds legislation. Regina Ip, a former security secretary and current member of the Executive Board and legislative council, told the China Global Television Network that the law is necessary because it blocks some loopholes in Hong Kong law to protect the territory; it is an action that will help the city "restore order."The governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Canada and Taiwan, as well as members of the European Union, launched the war against the controversial law.The United Kingdom even put together a plan so that those born in Hong Kong before 1997 – when the territory was still a British colony – can use their overseas passport and emigrate freely for the opportunity to acquire new citizenship after five years of residency.Academics and activists warn that the future of the pro-democracy movement and freedom of expression are being violated by the national security law, which will bring drastic changes.Sharron Fast, deputy director of the master's program in journalism and professor at the University of Hong Kong's Center for Journalism and Media Studies, tells reporter:"I am sure that, historically and geographically, the law is the most aggressive and systematic attack on freedom of expression ever seen. It is so fast, fast and severe, it will be a humanitarian crisis."The national security law was enacted from Beijing, which surpassed the Hong Kong legislature. The four crimes punishing the new rule are: secession, subversion, terrorist activities and collusion with a foreign country or external elements to endanger national security.Anyone who engages in these acts, even if they are not a resident of Or committed outside the territory, may break that law which, according to Sharron Fast, has "global jurisprudence".The days of resistanceIn June 2019, nearly 2 million people protested against a bill purporting to legitimize extraditions to mainland China, i.e. the territory that does not include Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, as reported by the Civil Human Rights Front, organizer of that mobilization.Hong Kong is part of China, but operates under a "one country, two systems" principle and, according to its Basic Law – the equivalent of a constitution – will have autonomy from Beijing for 50 years from the time the United Kingdom returned excolony to China in 1997.This allows the Hong Kong authorities to have an independent judiciary than Beijing, as well as other everyday freedoms, such as open internet and press freedom, without having a government accreditation to work.The 2019 protests advanced towards a pro-democracy movement that flew five main demands, including universal suffrage in Hong Kong.Some subsequent mobilizations – which continued until earlier this year and dissipated by the coronavirus – showed violent clashes between citizens and the police.Keith Richburg, director of the Center for Journalism and Media Studies at the University of Hong Kong, explains in interview that the 2019 protests "greatly frightened China," whose government had already tried to establish a national security law.Richburg, who worked for The Washington Post for more than 30 years, argues that Beijing had no complete control over Hong Kong because it did not have a strong national security apparatus as in other parts of the country; in fact, he says, he used the protests as an excuse to implement this legislation.Bruce Lui, a professor of journalism at Hong Kong Baptist University and who was a correspondent for Hong Kong Cable Television Limited and TVB in China for 12 years, comments in interview that the latest interpretation of these crimes is authorityous in the mainland and unprotects freedom of expression.And he says: "I think that, for advocates of independence and localism, and also for people planning to organize protests, there are very clear effects that that freedom of expression cannot be protected."Richburg argues, for his part, that this law is used in mainland China to punish dissidents and that these laws are deliberately vague, so that it is easier to convict any act."You have to see how they use that law in China, and they're not using it to go against terrorists. They don't use it to go against people like Al Qaeda or the Islamic State, who threaten to plant bombs on Beijing subway stations; no, they're using it to go against people who criticize the Communist Party," he says.After the first day of enacting the new rule, some Hong Kongers began to eliminate their social media accounts for fear of reprisals.Fast, Richburg and Lui consider the guidelines for crimes sanctioned by the security law unclear. It is established,for example, Says Fast, that "complex cases" will be dealt with in mainland China; terms such as "state secrets" are even included, but these are not defined."When you are unclear what can and cannot be done, people cannot 'play in safe territory' and then they only have to self-censorship," Lui abounds.Moreover, the process of enacting the law was not transparent. Not even Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam - the head of the executive branch in the territory - was aware of what the law was saying, Fast says."No one knew what the law said. Imagine the president of Mexico sitting, waiting on his computer, pressing the keyboard to update every five minutes, waiting for a law to be enacted and passed from Beijing!" says the law and human rights specialist.There are also unknowns about the future of freedom of expression in Hong Kong. Articles 9 and 10, for example, provide that the territory shall take the necessary measures to strengthen the communication, guidance, supervision and regulation of issues involving national security, including media and the Internet, and that it may "promote" national security education through these channels.Fast explains that this is problematic because it has never been a journalist's duty to be a "spokesman" for the government. Lui warns that some guidelines may be finalised in the future for the media.Union convictionBy a statement, the Foreign Correspondents Club in Hong Kong condemned Jimmy Lai's arrest and break-in to apple Daily headquarters on Monday 10, and mentioned that this represents a direct assault on the city's press freedom.Chris Yeung, president of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, told the press on the same day that journalists are preparing for the worst, Radio Television Hong Kong reported.China ranks 177th out of 180 in the Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index 2020, just three places above North Korea, which ranks last.Nathan Law, co-founder of the Demosisto party, dissolved after the enactment of the national security law, went into exile in the UK, Chinese media reported. From there he tells the reporter that he will continue his struggle, as he considers it necessary that there be voices abroad who advocate for justice in Hong Kong."Under the new law, if I say that countries should sanction China or impose more restrictions on it, I would be violating it; you could have years' sentence. One of the main purposes of that law is to restrict defense work on the international front," he says.As for the continuation of pro-democracy representation in Hong Kong following the disqualification of 12 of its candidates for the next election, Law foresees further disqualifications.The elections were scheduled for September, but were postponed for a year, local media reports, such as Hong Kong Free Press.Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam cited public health reasons for this delay, but the opposition is confident that this is because they fear that the pro-Chinese wing will lose the election."In this year-long gap, Beijing will definitely try to manipulate elections and make them unfair," Says Law.With the delay in the future election, the worst-case scenario is already happening for Hong Kong, she sees Fast, although she anticipates that the next steps will be the first cases of transgressors sent to mainland China.For those who took part in the 2019 mass demonstrations, there is little chance of taking to the streets for now.June Ho, who completed her bachelor's degree in studiesmedia-related at the City University of Hong Kong and participated in the protests, he says in interview that restrictions on the meeting – by the coronavirus – of groups of people on the streets prevent mobilizations.Hong Kong is currently passing through its third wave of SARS-CoV-2 contagions.Ho details that several of his colleagues continue to compose songs and images online with hidden messages; others feel that this is to be silent in the face of repressive measures against freedom of expression. However, he says they will continue to believe in their principles."It's pretty hard for the people of Hong Kong to win this war. Hong Kong is our home; I think we can't just see it taken over by Beijing," she sums up.Report published on August 16 in the 2285 edition of the journal Proceso.       Load-Date: August 23, 2020End of Document

Trump wants 'unsafe' Chinese apps removed from U.S. app storesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 6, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 625 wordsBodyThe Donald Trump administration wants to remove "unsafe" Chinese technology apps like TikTok and WeChat from U.S. app stores. This was assured Wednesday night by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who detailed the U.S. government's plans to curb potential national security risks under a program he called "Clean Network," which will also affect Chinese telecommunications companies.Pompeo noted during a press conference that applications such as TikTok and WeChat (owned by Chinese giant Tencent) and others based in China are "a significant threat" to the personal data of U.S. citizens, not to mention tools for censorship of Content of the Chinese Communist Party."According to cnBC, Pompeo also noted that the State Department would work with the Department of Commerce and the Department of Defense to limit the ability of Chinese cloud service providers to collect, store, and process data in the U.S.This announcement comes days after the U.S. president threatens to ban TikTok in the country from September 15 after accusing the social network of microvideos of providing data about its users to the Chinese government. A lasttum that has led TikTok to negotiate the sale of its U.S. operations to Microsoft.Inside Microsoft's conversations to buy TikTok's U.S. businessChinese newspaper holds China won't accept TikTok 'theft'The White House is unclear if it will receive a portion of the TikTok saleIn an interview with Chinese state news agency Xinhua, China's foreign minister Wang Yi said the U.S. "has no right" to establish that "Clean Network" program and said Washington's actions are "a case of bullying book," Reuters reports. "Anyone can clearly see that America's intention is to protect its monopoly position in technology and rob other countries of their own right to development," Wang added.Multiple voices believe that Bytedance like Huawei are victims of the technological war that pits the two powers, the US and China, who are living through one of the most tense moments in decades. There are also analysts who stress that while some Chinese tech titans have expanded globally after copying some Western platforms and becoming strong in China, TikTok's success has been the product of its own innovation. And now it's Facebook that copies it, after seeing how more than 800 million people have become fans of the app.BeyondThe measures announced by Pompeo, with Trump's approval, don't stay there. The Secretary of State has also announced that they are working to ensure that "unreliable" Chinese phone manufacturers such as Huawei cannot pre-install secure apps or make them available for download through their app stores and that Chinese operators are not connected to U.S. telecommunications networks, affecting China Telecom and other telecos.Pompeo also indicated that they are working to ensure that China cannot compromise information carried by undersea cables connecting the U.S. to the global internet.The U.S. government has long complained that Chinese intellectual property theft has cost the economy billions of dollars in revenue and thousands of jobs and threatens national security. For this reason, Pompeo indicated thatare making every effort to protect U.S. citizens' data and intellectual property, including research into Covid-19 vaccines, by preventing access to cloud-based systems managed by companies such as Alibaba, Baidu, China Mobile, China Telecom and Tencent, Reuters adds.The Trump administration's move, which also arrives in the midst of a U.S.-China clash over the coronavirus pandemic, doesn't seem to help soften the crunch. Beijing continues to ensure that it has not participated in intellectual property theft or uses the aforementioned companies to carry out espionage actions.Load-Date: August 7, 2020End of Document

New level of tension between US and China over technology and TaiwanCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1020 wordsBodyPEKON.- Tension between China and the US reached new heights today after the Trump Administration added another giant, Tencent, to its campaign against Chinese technology on the eve of a U.S. politician's highest-ranking visit to Taiwan over the past 41 years.US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order banning any transaction or business with China's ByteDance, developer of TikTok, and Tencent - owner of the popular weChat social network - within 45 days "to protect national security."That deadline goes a little beyond the september 15 date that the president himself gave TikTok this week to sell his business or leave the United States, but it also affects Tencent, an even more important company for Beijing than ByteDance, with countless international investments.The creator of WeChat, a must-have social network in China with more than 1.2 billion users, thus becomes - after Huawei and ByteDance - The third piece of Washington's big game in the fight for technological supremacy that pits the two major world powers."A SHAMELESS ACT OF HEGEMONY"Beijing reacted verbally to the US ban on business with Chinese companies, although it continues to take no similar action for the moment in reciprocity.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin called Trump's order "shameless act of hegemony in full display" and called on Washington to "stop politicizing economic affairs and oppress business."According to Wang, the US uses national security "as an excuse to abuse state power and curb business without any basis" for political purposes."The United States will ultimately prove the bitter fruit of choosing self-interest over market principles and international rules, which will only lead to a decline in its morality, national image, and international trust," he said.Beijing, he said, will defend the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, and the United States must "assume the consequences of its actions," although it did not provide further details on possible retaliation.TIKTOK TO GO TO US JUSTICE IF TRUMP DOESN'T TAKE THE VETOTikTok said today that they will do everything they can to reverse Trump's decision and that if Washington refuses to do so, they will go to U.S. Justice."We will use all (legal) remedies available to us to ensure that the rule of law is not discarded (...), if not with the Administration, it will be with the courts of the United States," he said in a statement alleging that Washington is "creating a dangerous precedent for freedom of expression."The social network, which has about 100 million users in the US country, believes that due procedures have not been respected and the law has never been respected, and that the US government has never lent itself to seeking a "constructive solution".TikTok asserted that the user data it collects falls within the "industry standard for thousands of mobile applications worldwide" and insisted that it has never shared data with the Chinese government or censored content at Beijing's request."We have even expressed our readiness to agree on a full sale of our U.S. business to a U.S. company," the platform said, referring to open negotiations with Microsoft that, if closed, could allow it to remain active in the US, where it is of great popularity.TAIWAN, THE RED LINE FOR BEIJINGBut while Beijing seems willing toStoically enduring Trump's onslaught against his tech companies until the November US presidential election, America's 41-year highest-ranking visit to Taiwan, which will begin next Monday, appears to raise more blisters in the Chinese government.U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar will arrive in Taipei on Sunday and from Monday will begin his official agenda, which includes meetings with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, and several ministers.Beijing has reiterated that the issue of Taiwan, an island it considers a rebellious province that must return to its sovereignty, is a "red line", the "most sensitive and important" in its relationship with Washington.In an unusual phone conversation last night with Pentagon chief Mark Esper, Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe, urged him to "avoid dangerous movements" that could lead to escalation of tensions in the South China Sea.It was the first time since last March, unless it is known, that the chief military leaders of the two great world powers maintain direct contact; The conversation lasted about an hour and a half and remained at Esper's initiative, according to the official Chinese agency Xinhua.Wei defended China's "position of principles" on issues such as the South China Sea or Taiwan and called on the US to "stop its erroneous words and deeds" and "improve maritime risk management and control," while Esper - according to Xinhua - opted for dialogue to "manage, avoid misunderstandings and reduce risks."A subsequent Pentagon statement stated that both agreed to "keep the communication channels open and develop the systems needed for crisis communication and risk reduction.""A CRISIS OF CONSIDERABLE PROPORTIONS MAY BE GOING ON"For Spain's Xulio Ríos, director of china's Policy Observatory, the steps Washington is taking to weaken the challenge to its technological dominance reveal that China "is progressing rapidly and its capacity for innovation and competitiveness is clearly outperforming the US."In any case, in his view, that challenge "will go in crescendo" and Trump's measures "affect but do not block the Chinese rise."Rios points out that Azar's visit to Taiwan "is not an isolated event" and believes that "a crisis of considerable proportions may be taking place: "It is not a matter to be taken lightly. The sign of the 21st century may be decided around Taiwan's future in Asia and the world," he says.The US Secretary of Health will conclude his visit next Wednesday, the first that a post of that level performs to Taiwan since 1979, when Washington established relations with the People's Republic of China and went on to have them only informally with the island, where Chinese nationalists left after losing the civil war against the Communists.Load-Date: August 8, 2020End of Document

He said I've notified my staff to continue working on an executive order with respect to a payroll tax cut, eviction protections, unemployment extensions and student loan repayment options.President Trump laying out six promises to American workers during a visit to a Whirlpool manufacturing plant in Ohio yesterday. The President said this, defeating COVID-19, rebuild American manufacturing, make America the centre of medical manufacturing and move millions of manufacturing jobs back to America.These are the President's promises, use tariffs to fight for fair trade and put workers first, said the President. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine tested negative for COVID-19 last night, just hours after testing positive before he was set to greet President Trump at the Cleveland airport.

Good morning gang. Basically we've been seeing a 10 percentage point improvement in the second quarter earnings, which were expected to be down almost 46% year-on-year. Now it's likely to be off about 36%.The only two areas that are showing improvement, meaning positive year-on- year changes have been healthcare and technology, not only in the earnings space but in the revenue area as well, with technology actually showing a 7% gain in the second quarter in earnings. So this year now is likely to be less dire than anticipated and we're still up toward a 30% gain expected for all of 2021.BARTIROMO: What, 30% gain for all of 2021 in terms of earnings or in terms of GDP, Sam, what are you saying 30% gain?STOVALL: 30% gain for the S&P 500 in terms of earnings. When you look to the mid-cap stocks, that's expected to be closer to a 50% gain, and small cap stocks are expected to be up more than 100%.So that's the reason that I think investors are optimistic is because they are looking across the Valley. They acknowledge that 2020 is going to be a kitchen sink year. Companies write down everything, but the bounce-back will take place next year.BARTIROMO: I see, OK. So those are really good numbers. But of course, Dagen McDowell, that coming obviously from the no foot traffic shutdown numbers, so just sheer arithmetic takes you to a huge bounce in 2021. Dagen jump in.MCDOWELL: I'm going to ask Sam something that you asked me yesterday that I didn't give him a very good answer to, not to revisit that. But the expectation is, Maria brought up the issue of when we get a vaccine, are you going to see a selloff in treasuries and longer term bonds in that part of the market?Because I was looking at the ten year, the ten year is very, very close. The yield is to the low hit in March of this year. I think it's kind of a flat half of one percent is the low. But nevertheless, Sam, one of these markets, the stock market versus the treasury market has it wrong. Which one is it?STOVALL: Well I think that you can even add gold in there as well, because when I think of what is driving gold and I am answering your question, believe it or not, I look to the letter CIDD, I look to COVID or the worry about the COVID situation and a flight to safety, I for interest rates, D for the dollar, and then D again for a deficit, all of the spending that is going on.So I wouldn't necessarily say you're going to likely to see a very sharp sell-off in treasuries. You could see a rotation because of the safety trade possibly being lifted, but with the potential for anywhere from a $1 trillion to a $3.5 trillion stimulus package, that could end up being approved today. That is on top of the $3 trillion plus already extended by US Congress. So the big worry is that inflation is something that is likely to be creeping higher in the quarters ahead.BARTIROMO: Yes, and we've seen some price hikes in certain commodities just in the last year, like meat and chicken, et cetera, things like that. Sam, you mentioned stimulus. Let me ask you your thoughts on what's going on in Washington right now, because they cannot agree on a package.The Democrats want a $3 trillion phase four, the Republicans want $1.1 trillion, and there's a real pushback on money for states and cities, as well as the checks going out to Americans. What if they don't get something done today? How significant is that going to be for the economy in your view?STOVALL: Well, I think we all know that Washington constantly teaches Hollywood a thing or two about drama. And so today, it seems to be the cut- off date that they have to actually come to some sort of an agreement, and I think they will. I think by the 11th hour, they will come up with something. If it's not by today, at least it's by the weekend and that they will have something to announce as we start next week.BARTIROMO: Alright, we will look for that. Sam, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much. Have a great weekend.STOVALL: My pleasure.BARTIROMO: Sam Stovall joining us. The morning mover this morning, Uber, the ride hailing giant reporting a wider than expected loss last night. Revenue did come in above expectations, but you can see how the coronavirus seriously hit demand here for this entire industry, ride sharing. Uber's food delivery business more than doubled however in the second quarter. Despite the challenges, Uber is standing by its goal to be profitable by the end of next year. The stock this morning is down, better than 4% on our morning mover.We're just getting started this morning. Coming up at 7:00 a.m. Eastern, we've got the Word on Wall Street coming up, what investors are watching as we await the July jobs report. Former Senior Advisor to the Clintons and Stagwell Group President Mark Penn is here on the impact of Kanye West Presidential run, and who Joe Biden may choose as his vice Presidential candidate. We're going to learn that soon.And then Uber losing on earnings, going inside the numbers and the lone bright spot for the company amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, food delivery. At 8:00 a.m. Eastern, we have Ohio Congressman House Intelligence Committee Member Brad Wenstrup on the stimulus battle with the two sides very far apart and ahead of an important meeting for General Flynn next week.And then jobs in America, full coverage of the July employment numbers out in 2.5 hours from now, don't miss it. You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Unrest in Portland, protests erupting in front of the Portland Police Bureau's East Precinct last night. This is the 70th night of demonstrations in the city. The protests coming after police classified Wednesday's East Precinct demonstration as a riot. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler spoke out yesterday saying that protesters are only hurting their cause by using violence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TED WHEELER (D) MAYOR OF PORTLAND: Don't think for a moment that if you are participating in this activity, that you are not being a prop for the re- election campaign of Donald Trump, because you absolutely are. You are creating the B-roll film that will be used in ads nationally to help Donald Trump during his campaign. You don't want to be part of that? Then don't show up.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And the B-roll clearly shows violence, people throwing bricks, people breaking windows, Dagen McDowell. These are not peaceful protests. So yes, this video is going to be shown. I don't know if it's necessarily a video and used as props as much as it's just reality of what's taking place in Portland, and you don't have anybody stopping it on the Democrat side.MCDOWELL: I think the expression on my face at what the Mayor said really says more than what's the words that are going to come out of my mouth. What kind of idiotic narrative is that? Oh, violence is bad because it could help President Trump get re-elected. That's the best you got?How about standing up for the people who live in your city and all the businesses that have been destroyed? How about you have twiddled your thumbs while your city burns and you had the audacity to blame federal agents who came in legally to protect your courthouse for the reason behind the violence?Now they're gone and your city is still ablaze. There's still violence. They're still anarchy. There's still unrest. It's still just mayhem everywhere. That's the best you got? That is the most outrageous thing that I have ever heard. And by the way, I just want to point out some of the cities that are bringing federal agents in, not in this way, but as part of Operation Legend. They are coming in to help with investigations and help local police combat the dramatic rise in shootings and murders.The list grows. Operation Legend is now Chicago, Kansas City, Albuquerque, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, Memphis, and St. Louis. The Mayors of those cities know that they cannot stand by and watch their residents terrorized and businesses destroyed. But these morons in Portland and in Washington and some of them in Seattle, they are perfectly happy to stand back, because again, if you're anti-Trump and that Trump's fighting crime.BARTIROMO: That's right. And Dagen, this has been going on now for his entire term, OK. It doesn't matter that this is serious damage to the city and serious damage to people's lives. It's about Trump. So what? Let it go on. It doesn't matter that an FBI agent changed a document and changed evidence to the FISA Court so that they could wiretap an innocent American citizen.Who cares that it's going against the constitution? It's Trump. It doesn't matter that we created a story of collusion and got the whole country up in arms for two and a half years. So what? It's Trump. It's this obsession with losing their grip on power. That's all it is. And it's outrageous and everybody should be outraged by this.MCDOWELL: So these people are so anti-Trump, they are pro-crime. How does that make any sense in any world?BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true. We're going to keep talking about this and we're going to call it out every time.Coming up, the legal threat to the National Rifle Association. New York's case against the NRA is coming up next. And then, the art world down under. Australia's new museum with a location unlike any other. Wait till you see this. We're going to check it out, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Taking on the National Rifle Association, Attorneys General in New York and Washington DC announced yesterday that they filed lawsuits against the NRA and its top leaders for diverting funds for personal use and granting contracts to allies.New York Attorney General Letitia James is also seeking for the NRA to be disbanded. Joining me right now on the phone is Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Doug Burns. And sir, it's good to have you on the program, your reaction to all of this?DOUGLAS BURNS, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY: Thank you. Well look, Maria, I've said it a hundred times, politics and law don't mix, OK? This is a highly politicized situation obviously.I actually spent a little time and went through the 168 page complaint which is absurdly long, if you think about it. It's like reading a book for crying out loud, but the reality is that it's just a highly, highly political thing.You look at this timing of it obviously, heading into the three month stretch run, I'll call it, into the election. But at the same time, I don't prejudge a lawsuit. They say that funds were mismanaged and mishandled. OK. That'll come out throughout the litigation. It'll be closely analyzed and debated and litigated.But also, the other point that it behooves me to make very important is that the dissolution notion is very extreme, OK, and a quick crystal ball in my view, the organization is not going to be dissolved by a court, Maria.BARTIROMO: Right. So this is just more politics. You see this as just laced with politics?BURNS: I do, yes. I mean, this particular prosecutor, if you look at some aspects of her track record, had raised issues about the NRA and made it part of sort of a platform. But again, when you're a prosecutor as I was for nine years, that type of stuff shouldn't enter in.I'm not sitting here saying it's a completely invalid civil lawsuit. That's not my point at all. But what I'm saying is that, in the current climate that we're in, there's no question that we are in a full frontal assault on the First Amendment. And now this action is a frontal assault on the Second Amendment. That's what's going on. And so, the viewers - your viewers have to sort of see the forest for the trees. We are in an unbelievably toxic political environment and this lawsuit is partially a reflection of that and a continuation of it. That's my point.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. First, the First Amendment, now the Second Amendment. Dagen McDowell, what do you think?MCDOWELL: Doug, I'll just point out what I think you're saying. It's the remedy that the Attorney General here is going for and that's a death penalty to essentially shut the NRA down.The Wall Street Journal editorial page writes about this today and asks the question, how does dissolving the nonprofit deliver relief or justice to gun rights donors or their cause? Instead, what the Attorney General is trying to do is shut down a political opponent or a major opposition political force right ahead of election.I want to add that this Attorney General in a magazine interview a couple of years ago referred to the NRA as a terrorist organization, so just to be clear about where the Attorney General is coming from.BURNS: First of all, it's such a great point, Dagen, because here's the thing. When we look at these types of situations from a legal lens, a lot of times the motivations give themselves away. So you made a key point, which is that, I've been in cases for 30 years over and over where corporate executives, people in charities, I was involved in charity, brought cases as a prosecutor and as a defence lawyer. And you say, OK, monies were used for personal expenses. OK. Those are very common cases unfortunately we could say. But the point is, this dissolution completely gives it away that it's a highly politicized move, and you're 1000% correct, Dagen, to highlight that.BARTIROMO: Alright, Doug, it's great to get your insights this morning. Thanks so much. We'll be watching.BURNS: My pleasure.BARTIROMO: Doug Burns joining us there. Quick break, and then time is running out for TikTok. I'll be speaking with the senior State Department official next about President Trump's executive order on the social media app. Where are the vulnerabilities?And then 'Dirty Dancing' makes a comeback. Details on the upcoming sequel coming up right here. Stay with us.MARIA BARTIROMO, ANCHOR, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Welcome back, good Friday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is jobs Friday, August 7th. Let's take a look at markets this morning at 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Futures are under pressure this morning ahead of the important July jobs report out in two hours time. The Dow futures are down 137 points, the Nasdaq down 54 and the S&P futures lower by 16.5.This after the markets ended yesterday near session highs, there's been another rally underway with the Nasdaq scored its 32nd record close of the year. How do you like that with another 110-point rally on the Nasdaq. Yesterday, the Dow Industrials were up 185 points at 4 O'clock on Wall Street. Global markets this morning, it is red across the board in Europe, look at this, Germany showed some signs of economic recovery in industrial output. Industrial output was up 8.9 percent in the month of June in Germany fueled by a rise in exports.As you see, the German-Dax index flat this morning, down just 2 points, the other majors also lower by just by fractions. In Asia overnight, markets were mostly lower, following President Trump's executive orders targeting the Chinese apps. The Shanghai Composite down about 1 percent. Meanwhile, trade tensions are growing between the United States and Canada now. Cheryl Casone with those details. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: That's right, Maria. Just weeks after the new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico went into effect, President Trump reimposed a 10 percent tariff on Canadian aluminum to help protect American producers. The president says U.S. aluminum companies are being decimated by Canada. The White House also saying that certain types of Canadian aluminum were surging into the U.S., and that was depressing the industry here.Canada plans to retaliate. Well, a dire warning, 2020 hurricane season expected to be extremely active. That is according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The agency is predicting as many as 24- named storms including 12 total hurricanes and 5 major hurricanes within that. The season already two weeks ahead of record pace and we're only one- third of the way through.Colorado state says 75 percent chance that cat 3 or greater is going to hit the U.S. coast, and national officials say it's one of the most active seasonal forecast NOAA has produced in 22 years. Finally, here's a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. Mortgage rates in the U.S. fell to a record low for the eighth time this year, bringing the average home mortgage to 2.88 percent. Wow. Tom Brady and Michael Strahan teaming up on a new sports media venture called Religion of Sports.And finally, General Motors unveiling its new all electric Cadillac Lyriq SUV set to hit U.S. showrooms, 2022. And Maria, those are your headlines from the newsroom, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you. There are escalating tensions with China as you know, President Trump issued executive orders last night on Chinese apps TikTok and WeChat, the order bans any U.S. transactions with the parent companies ByteDance and Tencent, it will go into effect in 45 days. Joining me right now is the Undersecretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment, Keith Krach. And Keith, it is great to see you this morning, Secretary, thank you so much for being here.KEITH KRACH, UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH, ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT: Great to be here, Maria, thanks for having me back.BARTIROMO: Walk us through some of these threats and why TikTok and WeChat are making Americans vulnerable? Give us the backdrop?KRACH: Sure. So, Maria, the first thing is, it's not just about two companies. It's about the CCP's -- the Chinese Communist Party's surveillance say this is an extension of that. You've talked a lot about Huawei on your show, and if you look at it, Huawei is the backbone to this surveillance state, and then there's all these different appendages, and like WeChat, like TikTok. And Secretary Pompeo announced this on Wednesday in terms of the clean network. And the clean network is the administration's comprehensive approach to protecting data privacy, security, it also deals with human rights and collaborative -- you know -- from an economic standpoint. So this is all about that.And if you look at what the Communist Party has been doing, they've been collecting our citizens' data, and these are two big sources of that.BARTIROMO: Yes, I've been -- I've been writing about this in my upcoming book, Keith, and I've got a list in front of me from the book research of literally 25 arrests just in 2020, whether it'd be Chinese hackers working to steal COVID-19 research or Charles Lieber from Harvard running the chemistry department there and also taking money from the CCP, Arkansas, Harvard, Cleveland Clinic, the list goes on. How are we going to stop this? I mean, clearly, when the president for three years went back and forth with Chinese officials about getting a phase one trade deal done.The intellectual property theft was the one thing that the Chinese government said, no, we're not going to stop. We're not even admitting that we're doing it. So what's the long term plan here in terms of getting the CCP to stop stealing intellectual property as a goal for growth. I mean, this is their strategy for growth, theft.KRACH: You know, you are absolutely right, that they stealing intellectual property at massive scale. And as you know, I spent 30 years in Silicon Valley. It's the reason why I came to the government because I had a chance to experience it firsthand. And now being here, I see that they're doing it absolutely on a massive scale. So, one of these things, one of the of course, strategies is the clean networks.Because with that -- and you heard Secretary Pompeo announced that in the launch of five new clean initiatives. So, it's clean carrier, clean cloud, clean store, clean app, and also clean cable, undersea cables where they collect at hyper scale. So, I think it's a combination of protecting ourselves on that digital front and also bringing along our allies. And as Secretary Pompeo said --BARTIROMO: Yes --KRACH: An alliance of democracy is on that. So that's a -- that's a key part of it. Because if you look at the way they capture information, it's not just Huawei, it's the entire system. And then in terms of --BARTIROMO: Yes --KRACH: The infiltration by -- you know, the Thousand Talent program, all those things that you've talked about on your show, we really need to be vigilant, and you're right, I mean, vary in our healthcare system, they're in our universities. And I think the first step is really to wake up the American citizens, and President Trump has done that. And now citizens all over the world are waking up to this malign regime --BARTIROMO: Yes --KRACH: And they see that the pandemic is a result of the concealment of the virus, they see Hong Kong's freedom being totally eviscerated. They see the human rights --BARTIROMO: Right --KRACH: Abuse in Xinjiang, and it's given the political will to government leaders and corporate CEOs all around the world.BARTIROMO: So, you know, Peter Navarro made a really interesting comment last week when I spoke with him, and he said, look, the Chinese are gathering all these information and they could use it as blackmail. They could try blackmailing people. So, I want you to speak to this influence going on right now from the CCP on government officials, because as I understand it based on my original reporting, the CCP right now is trying to influence members of Congress. Is that true?KRACH: Well, by the way, they're trying to influence everybody. And if you look at the Communist Party's doctrine, it is seduced with money and reinforced with intimidation and retaliation. So they not only do that to countries, they do it to companies, they do it to individuals. By the way, it's part of their --BARTIROMO: OK --KRACH: Economic war-craft strategy.BARTIROMO: All right, how do you expect the Chinese to respond because they are talking about retaliating. They're calling this new effort, quote, "a textbook case of bullying". The U.S. quote, "has no right to set up the clean network." That's what the CCP is saying this morning and they are promising retaliation. So what would you expect in that regard?KRACH: Well, you know, they're a bully. And when you confront a bully, they'll back down. And they really back down if you confront their bully and you have all your friends around you. And by the way, it's about time we stood up to the Communist Party. You saw when Boris Johnson for about four months ago said we're going to reconsider that Huawei decision. And you know, you know --BARTIROMO: Yes --KRACH: Beijing threaten HSBC, and you saw the Chinese ambassador over there in the U.K. say we're going to pull back that $100 billion investment on that railway. And president -- and Secretary Pompeo stood up and said, look, we stand with our allies, we're standing up to that China bully. And so, it's basically --BARTIROMO: Yes --KRACH: Freedom against authoritarianism, Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes, right, well, that's what we're calling it here, we're calling it China versus the free world because it does appear that much of the free world is aligning with the United States on this issue. Got to wonder, do you want a communist country the dominant country in the world? I think most countries would say no. Undersecretary Keith Krach, it is good to have you this morning, we so appreciate your insight -- final word, sir, go ahead.KRACH: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon, thank you so much, Keith Krach joining us there. Coming up, former Vice President Joe Biden's mea culpa again. The presumptive Democratic nominee facing backlash over comments about diversity now. And then this "Dirty Dancing" makes a comeback, details on the upcoming sequel ahead -- wait until you see this, and it is time for you to ask the questions, "ASK THE PANEL" will debut later this month.So send us a video question to Maria at foxbusiness.com. We want to hear what you want to ask the panel and we'll put it on the air. You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business. Next week on MORNINGS WITH MARIA, Monday, will Capitol Hill gridlock hit you in the wallet, Mick Mulvaney reacts. Tuesday, Congressman Doug Collins on why the Durham investigation must be released before election day.Wednesday, we are counting down to the Republican National Convention with RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel. Thursday, the inside's union to allocate capital with the word on Wall Street. And Friday, crime surging across America's biggest cities. Former NYPD Commissioner Bernard Kerik weighs in. That's all right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Former Vice President, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is walking back comments this morning that he made yesterday, comparing black and Hispanic voters, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What you all know, but most people don't know, unlike the African-American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Biden responding to backlash over his statements on Twitter, then he wrote this, "earlier today, I made some comments about diversity in the African-American and Latino communities that I want to clarify. In no way did I mean to suggest the African-American community is monolithic, not by identity, not on issues, not at all."Joining me right now is Republican strategist Jonathan Madison and Northern Starr Strategies founding partner and Democratic strategist Michael Starr Hopkins. And it is great to see everybody this morning, thank you, gentlemen, for being here. Michael, I want to kick it off with you. What is your take on Joe Biden's condition? Frankly, I think it's really -- you know, disappointing that anybody would put him out in this condition. It's very sad to see.MICHAEL STARR HOPKINS, FOUNDING PARTNER, NORTHERN STAR STRATEGIES & DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I mean, I feel perfectly fine with Joe Biden's condition, especially running against Donald Trump. You know, I think that his comments were inarticulate but, you know, what I'm really focused on is the president's failed response to the coronavirus, and the fact that in the nation's capital, 30 percent of all African-American children are testing positive for coronavirus.That in the country, African-Americans are two times more likely to have the coronavirus. So as the country gets 160 --BARTIROMO: Hold on, 30 percent of African -- hold on, you said 30 percent of African-American children are testing positive for coronavirus? Where are you getting the stats? I don't know, I have not seen that, so I don't know -- I can't say that that's true. I have no idea where you're getting that.HOPKINS: OK, so last night, "NBC" for the local affiliate here producer report that said that 7 percent of white children, 30 percent of African- American children, and that's directly tied to the president's failed corona response. That's what I'm focused on right now.BARTIROMO: Look, I understand we're in an election year, and I understand there's a lot of politics going around, but for you to say that you're perfectly fine with Joe Biden's performance, and you're more interested in the way --HOPKINS: I am --BARTIROMO: Donald Trump has handled the coronavirus is really -- is really stunning. For you to say that Joe Biden's condition, there's nothing wrong, there's a gaffe every day, there's clearly a cognitive issue here.HOPKINS: Maria, listen --BARTIROMO: We know that Joe Biden has one brain aneurysm -- and I think it's two actually, but to put him out the way the Democrats are putting him out.HOPKINS: Putting it out --BARTIROMO: Is just --HOPKINS: First of all, Maria, that is --BARTIROMO: Out --HOPKINS: Not a fact. We do not -- there's no evidence that Joe Biden has had multiple brain aneurysms, I think that's irresponsible to report that.BARTIROMO: I didn't say multiple, I said two --HOPKINS: But when you talk about politics --BARTIROMO: I said two --HOPKINS: That's irresponsible --BARTIROMO: He's already spoken about one -- OK, he's already spoken about one, and we know that he has one, but there could be two which is what I've heard.HOPKINS: But here's the great thing about our democracy --BARTIROMO: I'm not going to say whom I saw --JONATHAN MADISON, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Maria, if I can chime in hereBARTIROMO: I'm sorry?HOPKINS: All right, chime --MADISON: If I could chime in here. You know, those are interesting talking points --BARTIROMO: True --MADISON: To Michael. I know it's an election year, but you know, we're here to debate the merits of the Vice President's statements, and for you to just say that, well, look, how bad the current president is, don't look at how bad the Vice President's statements are with regard to African- Americans. It's highly and wholly offensive and insensitive to African- Americans around the country.You know, this is the second bite at the apple that Joe Biden has had to actually say something meaningful towards the African-American community. I guess you found it appeasing when he actually told African-Americans that you ain't black if you didn't vote for him, and now that he's saying that the Latino community is far more diverse than the African-American community, and you're saying it's just inarticulate.I think that's inarticulate for what you just said. We know that he's had several bites at the apple now, he just went on national TV recently when somebody asked him if he had a cognitive issue or if he would get cognitively tested, his response was, that's equivalent to cocaine testing. So I don't think we can sit back here and say, oh, well, just look at how bad the current president is.We need to evaluate every presidential candidate regardless of the merit and regardless of their race. And so, for you to sit here and say that --(CROSSTALK)I find that highly offensive. We need to hold every member accountable including the vice president.HOPKINS: Well, I'm glad you think that because we should look at records. I mean, when you look at records, Donald Trump has been sued multiple times for not allowing African-Americans to live in his apartments. Donald Trump has been sued multiple times for not allowing African-Americans to work at his casinos. When you look at Joe Biden's records, the same isn't true --MADISON: We're talking about vice president, Michael, you haven't said one good thing --BARTIROMO: Yes, again --MADISON: About the vice president. We could talk about --HOPKINS: And we're talking about --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes --HOPKINS: Records matter --MADISON: We could talk about the president --(CROSSTALK)We're talking about the vice president --BARTIROMO: Just to be fair, to be fair, Jonathan, should the president have dealt with coronavirus differently? Now, he did on January 31st stop travel into the United States which was a big deal and which by the way, Joe Biden said that it was the wrong move and that it was, you know, him acting prejudice by doing that. So, we know that. So that was a smart move of the president, but should the president have acted any more aggressive, Jonathan? So, let's be clear.I'm not giving anybody off the hook here, but Michael, the fact that you would not acknowledge what Joe Biden has been saying. I mean, yesterday, he called that interview, he asked him if he was a junky, where did that come from?HOPKINS: Yes, I have no problem saying that Joe Biden was too flippant in that interview, that's something he's admitted. And I think that the fact that he's willing to admit that he made comments that were inappropriate --BARTIROMO: And you believe he is -- and you believe --HOPKINS: Shows presidential leadership --BARTIROMO: And you believe he is in a position to run the free world? You believe, Michael Starr Hopkins that Joe Biden is in a position to be president?HOPKINS: I have no problem with Joe Biden being president, and I'm excited to vote for him come November.BARTIROMO: Jonathan, final word.MADISON: Yes, you know, if anything, I just like to conclude by saying, you know, Joe Biden -- I've had great respect and admiration for him as a vice president and a former vice president, but there's no excuse, no excuse for him to make several comments about condescending in the African- American community. Making condescending remarks about --BARTIROMO: All right --MADISON: How to vote for the most part, so that's all I would say. We need to evaluate every presidential candidate --BARTIROMO: Gentlemen, thank you --MADISON: We don't need to sit here with talking points.BARTIROMO: Thank you so -- that's right, thank you so much.

How to Stop China From Imposing Its ValuesAtlantic OnlineAugust 2, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1218 wordsByline: Anthony VinciBodyOn their own, few countries are powerful enough to stand up to bullying by China, and the existing security alliances upon which the world's major democracies depend weren't built to address the economic threats now emanating from Beijing. This spring, shortly after Australia called for an international investigation into the origins of COVID-19, the Chinese ambassador to that country threatened an economic boycott, declaring that the Chinese public could go without Australian wine and beef, among other products. Since China is Australia's largest export market, this was no small threat. Subsequently, China blocked imports from major Australian meat producers and placed tariffs on Australian barley. More and more, China is using its massive economic weight to threaten countries that challenge its actions, criticize its leaders, or express sympathy for people whom it considers dissidents or separatists.In April, Chinese officials threatened the European Union with unnamed repercussions if an official EU report described a Chinese "global disinformation campaign" related to COVID-19. (The EU toned down the report.) Beijing has threatened economic harm to German automakers if Germany attempts to exclude equipment made by the Chinese telecom giant Huawei from its 5G networks. Last year, China also threatened to impose trade restrictions on Sweden after a Chinese Swedish author was awarded a prize for persecuted writers by the Swedish chapter of the group PEN International. These moves represent a kind of economic imperialism. The Chinese Communist Party, which suppresses dissent at home, is trying to force other countries to abide by its authoritarian norms and use its preferred company to build their own essential communications networks.[Lindsay Gorman: 5G is where China and the West finally diverge]In the United States, suspicion of the Chinese government is a bipartisan matter, but no consensus exists about just what to do. The Trump administration has implemented a variety of hawkish policies, including restricting semiconductor sales in China and stopping a U.S. government retirement fund from investing in stocks there, and the president himself vowed Friday to ban TikTok, a popular app owned by a Chinese company. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called in a recent speech for "a new alliance of democracies" to counter the emerging superpower, although few details were offered. The draft of the 2020 Democratic Party platform broadly vows to "rally friends and allies across the world to push back against China or any other country's attempts to undermine international norms."The problem is that the United States and its allies currently lack the ability to respond to the type of geo-economic threats that China is making. Specifically, they need a means of taking collective action when Beijing attempts to use economic power as a tool of political coercion. No country should face such threats alone.[Peter Beinart: Democrats are letting Trump frame the debate about China]Many of America's most important Cold War"era institutions, especially NATO, were designed to deter a primarily military threat from the Soviet Union. But back then, Moscow-unlike Beijing now-had limited economic leverage against the West. Global economic institutions such as the World Trade Organization were narrowly focused on trade agreements and rule-making to ensure fair economic competition, but did not consider the possibility of economic warfare or the danger of economic threats to force political concessions. Indeed, none of these alliances or institutions has been any help in addressing the Chinese economic threats against Australia, Germany, Sweden, or other nations.Those threats also harm the United States. If China forces U.S. allies to use Huawei's technology in their information networks, American communications that go through those networks could be exposed to the Chinese Communist Party's infiltration. And China's rulers have sought to enforce the party line on Americans. Last year, Beijing punished the NBA's Houston Rockets when the team's general manager offered support for Hong Kong's prodemocracy protesters on Twitter, a platform blocked in China. The regime will likely grow bolder as China's economic might grows.[Jemele Hill: Et tu, LeBron?]New threats demand new responses. During the Cold War, the U.S. created not just NATO but also the CIA and the Air Force to respond to Soviet threats. The period brought about a wholly new form of intelligence competition between the West and the Soviet Union. This led the U.S., Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand to enter into the alliance commonly known as Five Eyes, which allowed unprecedented intelligence sharing among nations in peacetime. This approach would have been unimaginable before the Soviet geopolitical threat.Similarly, a new kind of alliance-like NATO, but for economic rather than military threats-is needed to respond to the kind of statecraft that China is practicing. Under such a system, participating nations would provide mutual support when China threatens one or more members with economic repercussions for political actions. That assistance could involve the imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods by all member nations; the creation of a pool of capital to help a targeted nation withstand Beijing's pressure; the release of strategic reserves of essential materials, such as rare-earth metals, that China produces and could withhold; and other forms of collective economic defense.When China targets Australian barley and beef to mute criticism of Beijing's handling of COVID-19, members of the economic alliance could all impose tariffs or other forms of economic weapons to force China to back off. If China continued to threaten German automobile exports to force concessions on 5G, alliance members might ease the pain by reducing their own tariffs on Volkswagens and BMWs.This alliance would be open to any nation that wanted to maintain free markets and political autonomy. Use of its tools would have to be narrow: It should act only in cases where economic warfare is used as a means of political coercion. It would not replace NATO or other military alliances. Nor would it replace the WTO. In fact, it would be complementary, and provide a means of safeguarding the WTO's goal of free trade, by countering attempts to turn trade into a geopolitical bargaining chip.The United States needs to develop policies toward China that are largely consistent from one administration to the next. A NATO-like economic-security alliance could support a bipartisan consensus on China policy. It is compatible with the nationalist approach championed by the Trump administration-but also with the more traditional policy objectives of Democrats, including Joe Biden, who believe in building global alliances and protecting the human and political rights of smaller nations.Up to this point, the United States and other democracies have tightly integrated their economies with China's without fully planning for the problems that the arrangement presents. China has used this economic integration for geopolitical gain. Just as the U.S. needed alliances to deter military threats after World War II, it needs alliances that deter economic threats from Beijing now.Load-Date: August 3, 2020End of Document

Senate Homeland Security Committee Issues Report on No Tik Tok on Government Devices ActTargeted News ServiceAugust 15, 2020 Saturday 8:47 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2214 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, Aug. 15 -- The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee issued a report (S.Rpt. 116-250) on the No Tik Tok on Government Devices Act (S. 3455), which aims to prohibit certain individuals from downloading or using TikTok on any device issued by the U.S. or a government corporation. The report was advanced by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, on Aug. 10.I. Purpose and SummaryS. 3455, the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop standards and guidelines, consistent with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2014, to remove the TikTok application from Federal information technology devices and platforms. The standards and guidelines developed by OMB must be developed in consultation with the General Services Administration (GSA), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), and the Department of Defense (DoD). The bill includes an exemption for law enforcement activities, national security interests and activities, and security researchers.II. Background and the Need for LegislationIn November 2017, a Beijing-based media and technology company, ByteDance Limited (ByteDance), acquired a Shanghai-based social media company, Musical.ly, Inc. (Musical.ly) for approximately $1 billion./1/ At the time of acquisition, Musical.ly's flagship web application included a user base of over 60 million in the United States and Europe and its offices were located in Shanghai and Santa Monica, California./2/ In August 2018, ByteDance merged Musical.ly's web application with its own social media short-form video app, TikTok, managed by its subsidiary TikTok, Inc./3/ TikTok is estimated to have a global audience of approximately 800 million active users./4/--/1/Liza Lin and Rolfe Winkler, Social-Media App Musical.ly Is Acquired for as Much as $1 Billion, Wall St. J.

Legislative HistorySenator Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced S. 3455, the No TickTok on Government Devices Act, on March 12, 2020, with Senator Rick Scott (R-FL) and Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR). The bill was referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), John Kennedy (R-LA), and Martha McSally (R-AZ) later joined as cosponsors.The Committee considered S. 3455 at a business meeting on July 22, 2020. Senator Hawley offered a substitute amendment that specifies that OMB, within 60 days of passage, shall issue standards and guidelines to Executive Branch agencies regarding the removal of the TikTok application from information technology (rather than previous language that would have banned the use of the application by Federal employees but without specific direction from OMB on how to do so), and makes minor technical corrections. The bill was ordered reported favorably as modified by the Hawley amendment by voice vote en bloc. Senators present for the en bloc vote on the amendment and the bill as amended were Johnson, Portman, Paul, Lankford, Romney, Scott, Enzi, Hawley, Peters, Carper, Hassan, Harris, and Rosen.IV. Section-by-Section Analysis of the Bill, as ReportedSection 1. Short titleThis section established that the bill may be referred to as the "No TikTok on Government Devices Act".Section 2. Prohibition on the use of TikTokSubsection (a) defines the terms "covered application", "executive agency", and "information technology." Subsection (b) requires the Director of OMB, in consultation with the Administrator of GSA, the Director of CISA, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Secretary of Defense, and consistent with the information security requirements of FISMA, to develop standards and guidelines for the removal of covered applications from information technology.This subsection also includes directs OMB to include in its standards and guidelines exemptions for law enforcement activities, national security interests and security researchers.V. Evaluation of Regulatory ImpactPursuant to the requirements of paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Committee has considered the regulatory impact of this bill and determined that the bill will have no regulatory impact within the meaning of the rules. The Committee agrees with the Congressional Budget Office's statement that the bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments.VI. Congressional Budget Office Cost EstimateU.S. Congress, Congressional Budget Office, Washington, DCAugust 5, 2020Hon. Ron Johnson, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DCDear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 3455, the No TikTok on Government Devices Act.If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Matthew Pickford.Sincerely, Phillip L. Swagel, DirectorEnclosure.S. 3455 would require the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in consultation with other government agencies to develop guidelines that would require the removal of the social networking service TikTok from any executive branch information technology.Several federal laws, regulations, and policies prohibit the use of government property for unauthorized purposes. S. 3455 would expand those prohibitions to include TikTok or any successor service provided by its developer. Some federal agencies including the Department of Defense have already banned TikTok from their devices. Based on the cost of similar requirements, CBO estimates that implementing S. 3455 would cost less than $500,000 over the 2020-2025 period, subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Those costs would primarily be for administrative expenses at OMB to develop the guidelines and for other government agencies to comply with the new restriction.Enacting S. 3455 could affect direct spending by some agencies that are allowed to use fees, receipts from the sale of goods, and other collections to cover operating costs. CBO estimates that any net changes in direct spending by those agencies would be negligible because most of them can adjust amounts collected to reflect changes in operating costs.The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Matthew Pickford. The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of Budget Analysis.VII. Changes in Existing Law Made by the Bill, as ReportedBecause this legislation would not repeal or amend any provision of current law, it would not make changes in existing law within the meaning of clauses (a) and (b) of paragraph 12 of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate.TARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

Trump's TikTok power play may fall shortPolitico.comAugust 17, 2020 Monday 10:23 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1342 wordsHighlight: The proposed deal between Oracle and the Chinese-owned video app isn't the outright sale the president demanded. And it may not resolve U.S. security concerns.BodyPresident Donald Trump aimed for a clear-cut win over China when he demanded that TikTok's Beijing-based parent sell the popular video-sharing app to an American company or be banned from operating in the United States.Now he may have to settle for less.The proposal put before his administration this weekend wouldn't sell the company outright. It's unclear if it will resolve national security concerns about China's access to data on TikTok's 100 million U.S. users, or Chinese control of the algorithm that fuels the app. And the deal came together only after Beijing pulled a power move of its own, by expanding its authority to veto transactions that give up Chinese intellectual property.The president must now decide whether to accept the proposed deal, which would create a tech partnership between TikTok and Oracle, a California-based company closely aligned with Trump. If he rejects it, TikTok could have to cease doing business in the U.S. come Sunday under an order he signed last month.Terms of the proposal were still unclear Monday, although Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said they came with a promise of creating thousands of new American jobs. Also undefined: whether the companies will meet Trump's demand in August that the U.S. Treasury be "well compensated" for making the deal possible.The outcome has symbolic importance for Trump, who has portrayed his reelection as crucial for U.S. hopes of countering China's rise to global dominance."You have the president wanting to be tough on China, not wanting to back down on this ban threat, and so he's kind of painted himself into a corner," said Paul Triolo, a longtime government analyst who now heads the Eurasia Group's geo-technology practice. Meanwhile, he noted, Xi Jinping's government has no desire to be seen "allowing Washington to dictate the sale of a big, important Chinese tech company.""This isn't something that can be solved with the political wave of a magic wand," Triolo added. "The details are going to have to make sense to both sides."One of Trump's congressional allies, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), urged the administration to "promptly reject" the proposal, saying it fails to satisfy concerns about China's influence over the app."An ongoing 'partnership' that allows for anything other than the full emancipation of the TikTok software from potential Chinese Communist Party control is completely unacceptable," Hawley said.TikTok has denied that it's tied to the Chinese government and has said it would refuse any request by Beijing for its users' data.Oracle and ByteDance have disclosed no details of the deal. But they confirmed Monday that they've put forward a proposal for TikTok's future in the U.S. that must now win the Trump administration's blessing.That could be a difficult sell, China watchers warned. Accepting anything short of a sale would contradict Trump's own demands for TikTok. Just Thursday, he told reporters that the company had two options: "We'll either close up TikTok in this country for security reasons or it'll be sold." China hawks say that choice was based on the notion that TikTok's data would be safer in the hands of a U.S. company. So any deal that doesn't resolve the underlying fear about U.S. data being funneled to Beijing shouldn't win the president's approval."If the plan as described for Oracle doesn't meet that objective, then it shouldn't go forward," said Klon Kitchen, director of the Center for Technology Policy at the Heritage Foundation. "The idea of selling to a U.S. company, that was just one of the solutions short of just an outright ban, but the sale itself to U.S. company isn't the objective."Mnuchin told CNBC on Monday that the administration received a proposal over the weekend that purports to address security concerns and, among other provisions, would create a global headquarters for TikTok in the U.S. and generate about new 20,000 jobs. TikTok now runs its U.S. business from Los Angeles and previously pledged to create 10,000 jobs in the U.S. over three years.Mnuchin said the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., an interagency group that examines business deals for national security implications, will review the proposal this week and plans to make a recommendation to Trump.Mnuchin said the administration's priority remains protecting the data of TikTok's U.S. users from being passed along to the Chinese government. "We'll be looking to have discussions with Oracle over the next few days with our technical teams," he said.The arrangement with Oracle first came to light Sunday after Microsoft announced that ByteDance had rejected its competing bid to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. Microsoft previously said it had been in talks to acquire TikTok since earlier this summer, and CEO Satya Nadella spoke with Trump in early August to convince him of the sale's merits.Just days later, Trump issued an executive order requiring ByteDance to cease transactions in the U.S. effective Sept. 20 because of concerns about its ties to the Chinese government. He later signed a separate executive order giving the company 90 days to sell TikTok to a U.S. company, adding that the deal would need the administration's approval.As negotiations between ByteDance and potential suitors were underway, the Chinese government issued regulations of its own. The Ministry of Commerce added algorithms and artificial intelligence technologies, such as those that power TikTok, to an export control list, meaning the government must approve any sale before it can be completed. The Chinese government has since indicated via state media reports that it would not support a forced sale of TikTok to a U.S. buyer.The Chinese government hasn't said whether it consented to the Oracle deal, though ByteDance has said it would "strictly comply" with Chinese regulations.The deal would have one advantage going for it in Washington: In selecting Oracle, ByteDance has picked a partner that has made no qualms about cozying up to the Trump administration. Even as other Silicon Valley heavyweights kept interactions with the president to a minimum, Oracle executives have become close allies of the president and helped fuel his reelection campaign.Oracle's billionaire chair, Larry Ellison, hosted a high-dollar fundraiser for Trump in February at his Rancho Mirage, Calif., home and the company's CEO, Safra Catz, shelled out $125,000 to back the president's re-election effort in May, campaign finance records show.Trump's actions come amid broader political and economic tensions with China that have dominated Trump's time in office and become crowd-rousing rhetoric on the campaign trail. He has touted a trade deal with China as a key success of his administration and blamed Beijing for the United States' failure to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic, which Trump has repeatedly called the "China virus.""I took the toughest-ever action to stand up to China's rampant theft of American jobs," Trump said at a Nevada rally Sunday night, while adding a shot at Democratic challenger Joe Biden. "Biden's agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in the U.S.A."The TikTok deal is the latest result of Trump taking aim at a Chinese technology company from the Oval Office based on accusations that its ties to the government pose a national security threat.Trump has achieved some success driving the Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE out of U.S. wireless networks and pressuring American allies not to use Chinese-made gear for next-generation 5G networks. He also issued an executive order Aug. 6 banning transactions with the messaging app WeChat, which is owned by the Chinese conglomerate Tencent."This administration has been somewhat trigger happy on the use of executive orders to target Chinese companies and I think going into November, going into the election, we are going to see more and more sanctions against Chinese companies," said Samm Sacks, a cybersecurity policy and China digital economy fellow at New America, a Washington-based think tank.Load-Date: September 15, 2020End of Document

Who Is The Chinese Billionaire That Owns The Boat Steve Bannon Was Arrested On?The Daily CallerAugust 22, 2020 Saturday 12:05 AM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: USLength: 515 wordsByline: Varun Hukeri, Reporter, varun@dailycaller.comBodyLink to ImageFormer White House strategist Steve Bannon was arrested Thursday by federal agents while onboard a yacht owned by Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui off the coast of Westbrook, Connecticut.The U.S. Coast Guard detained Bannon while on the “Lady May,” a 151-foot yacht estimated to be worth around $28 million. The mega yacht is owned by Guo and became a sensation among Westbrook residents after it dropped anchor off a local beach last week, the Hartford Courant reported.Bannon has appeared on the yacht before and it was reported that the two are business associates who formed a media venture called GTV Media, according to The Wall Street Journal. The venture is reportedly being investigated by federal and state authorities.Link to ImageFormer White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon greets fugitive Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui  (Don Emmert/AFP via Getty Images)Guo is a real estate developer who left China in August 2014 after his associates were targeted by an anti-corruption campaign led by Chinese president Xi Jinping, the Associated Press reported. He currently lives in a Manhattan luxury apartment where he rails against the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on various social media platforms.Guo was estimated to be worth $1.1 billion in 2015 and his most valuable asset was reportedly Pangu Plaza, a seven-star hotel in Beijing, according to Forbes.Chinese state-backed media outlet Xinhua News Agency described Guo as one of China's most wanted fugitives in 2017. He has been accused of bribing Chinese government officials and embezzlement, according to Xinhua.Guo's lawyer told the Associated Press in 2017 that he applied for political asylum in the U.S. after the Chinese government requested an international arrest warrant for him. (RELATED: The Funny Business Of Interpol's 'Red Notice')Three employees in one of Guo's companies were sentenced to prison in 2017 for allegedly falsifying financial documents to obtain loans from a state-owned bank, the Associated Press reported.Former Trump aide Sam Nunberg also filed a federal lawsuit against Guo for defamation, alleging that the billionaire slandered him “with malicious false lies,” NBC News reported.Guo's lawyers wrote in court papers that he “is a pioneer of using YouTube and Twitter to fight for the rule of law, human rights, freedom and democracy in China.” His lawyer further added that Guo was working to expose “widespread corruption” in the CCP, according to NBC News.Chinese real estate developer SOHO sued Guo in 2017 after he accused the company of boosting its property values through improper regulatory changes, the Associated Press reported. SOHO dropped its complaint in 2018 but Guo countersued. A judge dismissed the countersuit in 2019.One of Guo's former assistants filed a civil complaint with the New York Supreme Court in 2017 alleging that Guo raped her, Reuters reported.

China flys threat to boycott AppleCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 28, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 355 wordsBodyChina could boycott Apple's products in the country if the U.S. bans Chinese application WeChat,a Chinese government spokesman warned Friday, against a backdrop of rising tensions between the two powers.US President Donald Trump,who signed earlier this month a decree banning the Chinese video-sharing app TikTok,accused of spying for the Chinese government, could do so with the widely used WeChat platform in China, which belongs to the giant Tencent."If they ban WeChat (in the United States) there will be no reason for the Chinese to keep their iPhone and Apple products," a spokesmanfor Chinese chancellery Zhao Lijian told Twitter.It's a much more direct statement than Zhao made the day before when he said that "many Chinese say they could stop using iPhone if WeChat was banned."The Trump administration's decree threatens to prohibit a US entity's financial transactions with WeChat, which could in fact force Apple to remove the app from its AppStore platform.On Friday, the issue was being widely discussed on social media in China."I use Apple, but I also love my country," said one internet user on the Twitter-like Weibo platform,which is banned in China."It doesn't matter what Apple's quality is, (an iPhone) it's just a phone and can be replaced. But WeChat is different,"commented another internet user.Known as Weixin in Mandarin, WeChat has 1.2 billion active users. They are mostly Chinese, even though the app is available in twenty languages.Initially it was an instant messaging app similar to the American WhatsApp, but currently WeChat offers a wide range of services in China such as pay-per-phone, news, video games, hotel or travel reservations.Apple products, from iPhone to iPad, are very popular in China, one of the main markets of the American group outside the United States.Apple accounted for 8% of the Chinese smartphone market in the second quarter,well behind Huawei's national leader, according to Counterpoint Research.Apple products, manufactured in China, are a major job nursery in the Asian country, which has undoubtedly deterred Beijing from hindering the activities of the US company.Load-Date: August 29, 2020End of Document

China state media accuses US of trying to steal TikTokCNN WireAugust 4, 2020 Tuesday 9:24 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 789 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Chinese state media this week is blasting Washington for what it calls the United States' "nasty" treatment of TikTok --- the wildly popular video-sharing app that has become emblematic of worsening US-China relations. "The US' decoupling from China starts [with] killing China's most competitive companies," wrote the Global Times, a state-run tabloid, in an editorial published Monday. "In the process, Washington ignores rules and is unreasonable."A weekslong debate about the future of TikTok --- which is owned by Bejing-based tech firm ByteDance --- came to a head over the weekend when US President Donald Trump threatened to ban the app from operating in the United States. Policymakers have repeatedly expressed concern that TikTok could pose a threat to national security should the data it collects on its US users end up in the hands of the Chinese government. TikTok, though, has said it stores its data outside of China and that it would resist any attempts by Beijing to seize the information.By Monday, Trump said he would be open to allowing a US company to buy TikTok, albeit with the unusual caveat that any deal would have to include a "substantial amount of money" coming to the US Treasury. Washington State-based Microsoft has emerged as a potential buyer, and has said it is pursuing a purchase. The dispute has drawn ire from state-run Chinese media outlets, whose editorials are often looked upon as a barometer of sentiment among senior officials.The state-run newspaper China Daily, for example, dismissed a potential sale of the app as a "smash and grab" raid orchestrated by the US government. "The US administration's bullying of Chinese tech companies stems from data being the new source of wealth and its zero-sum vision of 'American first,'" the English-language newspaper wrote in an editorial Monday. "China will by no means accept the 'theft' of a Chinese technology company."TikTok's troubles in the United States have also prompted debate in China about how the app's treatment compares to the way Beijing works with American tech firms. Many services provided by prominent companies like Google and Facebook are blocked entirely in mainland China. (Microsoft services, including its Bing search engine and Skype video calling platform, are notably available in the country.)"China does not actually ban American websites or software --- it only requires them to 'be Chinese' as they operate in China," wrote Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of the Global Times, in a post on the Chinese social media website Weibo. "TikTok fully complies with US laws ... but the US government still wants to ban it.""The US approach is much more determined and tough compared to the Chinese approach," he added. Former Google China president Kai-Fu Lee made similar arguments in a WeChat post about TikTok that was reported widely in Chinese media, saying that Chinese laws are clear about what foreign companies can do to operate in China. In TikTok's case, though, the company was left no choice but to consider a forced sale.And Liu Hong, deputy editor-in-chief for the Globe --- a magazine run by state-owned Xinhua News Agency --- recently called the TikTok saga "too nasty." "It's not just a shotgun wedding. But also a power grab," he wrote in a post Sunday on the social media website WeChat. The post was later promoted by the People's Daily, the official mouthpiece of the ruling Chinese Communist Party. "This is really sad for Bytedance."In an internal memo sent to employees on Monday, ByteDance CEO and founder Zhang Yiming acknowledged that the "past few months have been a challenging time for us all.""We initiated preliminary discussions with a tech company to help clear the way for us to continue offering the TikTok app in the US," Zhang wrote in the memo, which ByteDance provided to CNN Business. "We do not yet know the exact details of what our end solution will be," he added. "Candidly, it is unlikely that the level of interest and speculation around TikTok will cease in the short term, and I recognize that this can be very distracting."Chinese media has lamented ByteDance's struggles in the United States. The national newspaper Guangming Daily on Monday held up the debate over TikTok as emblematic of the kind of experience that might await other Chinese companies with plans to expand beyond mainland China."Who is TikTok dancing for?" the newspaper asked in an editorial, adding that ByteDance's "fortunes can't be reversed by any business strategy and marketing approach.""It's an object of reference for any Chinese company that wants to go global," the paper added.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Heritage Foundation Report: 'Chinese-Made Drones - A Direct Threat Whose Use Should Be Curtailed'Targeted News ServiceAugust 20, 2020 Thursday 9:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1520 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Heritage Foundation issued the following report entitled "Chinese-Made Drones: A Direct Threat Whose Use Should Be Curtailed". Here are excerpts of the report issued on Aug. 19 and co-authored by John Venable, senior research fellow for defense policy, and Lora Ries, senior research fellow for homeland security:SummaryThe vast majority of commercial drones used in the U.S. are manufactured in China, and their operating systems are impressive and worrisome. The technology is advancing rapidly, and the capabilities currently found in large drones is now being miniaturized and will likely migrate to smaller drones in the near term, which will significantly broaden the threat. However, the understanding of the risk and/or the willingness for state and local agencies to thwart those drones from collecting sensitive data is limited--at best. The United States government needs to address and stop the collection and transfer of data by drones to any foreign-based corporation before this incredible capability is turned against us.* * *Key TakeawaysDrone use in the U.S. is increasing rapidly, but this raises substantial privacy and security concerns, especially concerns about data falling into the wrong hands.Chinese drones dominate the U.S. market--despite minimal data protections, data transfer to Chinese firms, and mandatory data-sharing with the Chinese Government.The U.S. must stop unauthorized data collection and transfer to foreign-based corporations or governments before it is used to threaten U.S. citizens or interests.* * *Commercial drone use is exploding in the United States, particularly with city, county, and state governments. These systems offer shorter response times, greater utility, and markedly lower costs to acquire and operate than manned helicopters. Moreover, the technology and associated capabilities are advancing so rapidly that even facial recognition is now included in many off-the-shelf systems. With miniaturization, those systems may soon have the ability to instantly determine the identity of people in crowds using a database of billions of social media images currently found on sites like Facebook and YouTube. The potential to exploit that data goes well beyond marketing and, in the wrong hands, could harm national security. The United States government needs to address and stop the collection and transfer of data by drones to any foreign-based corporation before this incredible capability is turned against us.Drone Types and CapabilitiesUnmanned aircraft systems (UAS) or "drones" come in four weight-based sizes with capabilities that increase with each increment of scale.* Small drones are the most common and weigh less than 20 pounds. The vast majority of drones employed by civilian and government users at and below the state level fall into this category.* Medium drones weigh less than 55 pounds and are limited to an altitude of 3,500 feet above the ground.* Large drones (up to 1,320 pounds) and very large drones (greater than 1,320 pounds)/1 are almost exclusively used by the federal government and U.S. military.While the technology embedded in the latter two may seem excessive to state and local governments and private users, miniaturization will undoubtedly allow many of their capabilities to migrate into the medium and small drones over the decade ahead./2In commercial drones, the video cameras, the images they collect, and the data they produce are the value center of the devices, and full-motion video (FMV) is the most widely available sensor on drones of all sizes./3 These video surveillance systems generally have telescopic/zoom-in features with small drone daylight cameras that currently offer up to 30x optical and an additional 6x digital zoom for a total magnification of 180x./4 Nighttime options are equally impressive and include thermal imaging and low-light cameras with 20x zoom and 1080-pixel high definition./5 These off-the-shelf, commercially available drones have the ability to collect surprisingly detailed information on surveilled areas and subjects of interest, and they can transmit that real-time video feed directly to the Internet through a 4G connection or through base stations that are connected to the Internet./6To complement those capabilities, facial recognition and artificial intelligence (AI) software are now available in drones priced as low as $600./7 While those capabilities are relatively rudimentary and limited in function,/8 the technology surrounding facial recognition has exploded over the past several years. Clearview AI, a U.S. start-up company, introduced technology in 2019 that uses artificial intelligence to compare an uploaded photo against a database of billions of images compiled from social media sites, like Facebook and YouTube, to find a match, often in milliseconds./9 It has since been used by the U.S. Departments of Defense (DOD) and Homeland Security (DHS), the FBI, and hundreds of state and local police agencies, and the entire process can be accomplished on a smartphone./10With a connection to the Web, commercial drones will soon be able to exploit the kind of AI now being developed for government agencies,/11 and with miniaturization, the collection capabilities currently found on larger drones will likely migrate to the small-drone market over the next decade. As such, it is useful to briefly explore the open-source capabilities now being fielded on large UAS platforms.Finding points or subjects of interest in the field-of-view (or "soda straw") coverage offered by FMV cameras significantly limits the surveillance capability of any drone. In an effort to expand both the field of view and operator situational awareness, the military developed and acquired wide-area surveillance capabilities and wide-area motion imagery (WAMI) sensors.WAMI systems are very large video cameras capable of recording the activities and movements within city-sized areas in high resolution. The Air Force's Gorgon Stare carried by MQ-9 Reapers is one such system. It can track thousands of targets simultaneously and conduct several surveillance operations on separate targets concurrently. This system allows analysts to play back the video of a person of interest (POI) to see where he lives, who his friends are, and then, in turn, who those friends associate with/12--a feature similar to a modern digital video recorder found in most homes. This high definition monitoring is streamed in real time/13 to analysts and systems that can process the images of the POI for identification.The weight of Gorgon Stare and similar state-of-the-art surveillance systems is significant, but technological advances continue apace, and their weight and size are dropping rapidly. For example, CorvusEye 1500 is a relatively new WAMI system that provides surveillance over an area three kilometers in diameter--and it weighs just 83 pounds./14 This year, Logos Technologies introduced a new system called Redkite that quadruples CorvusEye 1500's surveilled area to 12 kilometers and, at 30 pounds, can now be carried on medium-sized drones. With the number of companies working to take the lead in this growing business area, there is little doubt that efforts to miniaturize that technology will continue and, if it follows the path of cell phones,/15 the weight will drop to allow small drones to readily carry and employ WAMI systems.The capabilities associated with Clearview, WAMI, and Gorgon Stare are not currently known to be available in small drones. However, with Internet connectivity and advances in miniaturization, the potential benefits these systems will bring to state, city, and county agencies are significant--as are the potential negative impacts.https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/2020-08/BG3521.pdf* * *ConclusionThe U.S. faces a growing national threat from Chinese drones. The vast majority of commercial drones used in the U.S. are manufactured in China, and their operating systems are impressive and worrisome. The technology is advancing rapidly, and the capabilities currently found in large drones is now being miniaturized and will likely migrate to smaller drones in the near term, which will significantly broaden the threat. The federal government has recognized the threat and put the brakes on procuring or using such risky technology--but the understanding of the risk and/or the willingness of state and local agencies to thwart those drones from collecting sensitive data is limited at best. It is time for state and local agencies to be informed of, and recognize, the threats involved in using Chinese-manufactured drones and immediately move to mitigate them.* * *John Venable is Senior Research Fellow for Defense Policy in the Center for National Defense, of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy.

Pompeo says Trump to take broad action on Chinese softwareAssociated Press InternationalAugust 2, 2020 Sunday 7:55 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 587 wordsByline: CATHY BUSSEWITZ, AP Business WriterDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump plans to take action on a what he sees as a broad array of national security risks presented by software connected to the Chinese Communist Party, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday.Pompeo’s remarks followed reports that Microsoft is in advanced talks to buy the U.S. operations of TikTok, which has been a source of national security and censorship concerns for the Trump administration.“These Chinese software companies doing business in the United States, whether it’s TikTok or WeChat — there are countless more ... are feeding data directly to the Chinese Communist Party, their national security apparatus,” Pompeo said on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.”“Could be their facial recognition patterns. It could be information about their residence, their phone numbers, their friends, who they’re connected to. Those — those are the issues that President Trump has made clear we’re going to take care of," he said.TikTok’s U.S. user data is stored in the U.S., with strict controls on employee access, and its biggest investors come from the U.S., the company said Sunday. “We are committed to protecting our users’ privacy and safety as we continue working to bring joy to families and meaningful careers to those who create on our platform,” a TikTok spokesperson said.Trump had said on Friday that he would soon ban TikTok in the United States. A federal committee is reviewing whether that's possible, and its members agree that TikTok cannot remain in the U.S. in its current form, because it "risks sending back information on 100 million Americans,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.“We all agree there has to be a change ... everybody agrees it can’t exist as it does," Mnuchin said Sunday on ABC's “This Week.”As speculation grew over a ban or sale of the social media's U.S. business, TikTok posted a video on Saturday saying: “We’re not planning on going anywhere.”TikTok's catchy videos and ease of use has made it popular, and it says it has tens of millions of users in the U.S. and hundreds of millions globally. Its parent company, Bytedance Ltd., launched TikTok in 2017. It bought Musical.ly, a video service popular with teens in the U.S. and Europe, and combined the two. It has a similar service, Douyin, for users in China.But TikTok's Chinese ownership has raised concern about the potential for sharing user data with Chinese officials as well as censorship of videos critical of the Chinese government. TikTok says it does not censor videos and it would not give the Chinese government access to U.S. user data.“The President, when he makes his decision, will make sure that everything we have done drives us as close to zero risk for the American people,” Pompeo said. “That’s the mission set that he laid out for all of us when we get — we began to evaluate this now several months back. We’re closing in on a solution. And I think you will see the president’s announcement shortly.”The debate over TikTok parallels a broader U.S. security crackdown on Chinese companies, including telecom providers Huawei and ZTE. The Trump administration has ordered that the U.S. stop buying equipment from those providers to be used in U.S. networks. Trump has also tried to steer allies away from Huawei over concerns that the Chinese government has access to its data, which Huawei denies.___Follow Cathy Bussewitz on Twitter at www.twitter.com/cbussewitz___AP Business Writers Anne D'Innocenzio and Tali Arbel contributed to this report.Load-Date: August 2, 2020End of Document

China and THE US to resume trade contacts "in the near future" telematicallyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 20, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 552 wordsBodyU.S. and Chinese delegations will resume telephone contacts "in the near future" to assess the progress of the first-phase trade agreement that was initialled by both countries on January 15, despite US President Donald Trump on Tuesday's readiness to cancel the negotiations.A spokesman for China's Ministry of Commerce has assured in press conference that the two countries "agreed to discuss the matter in the near future" by questioning the date for the two powers to assess the situation after exceeding the first six months since the signing of the agreement.   U.S. President Donald Trump had stated earlier in the week that he was unwilling to continue arguing with China, going so far as to say that he had canceled the talks.   However, sources close to the White House tenant told The Wall Street Journal that the president did not refer specifically to the first-phase agreement, but spoke more generally.   The two sides were scheduled to meet on 15 August to carry out an assessment of the progress of their first-stage trade agreement, although the talks were postponed and no date has yet been set for resuming them.China, ready to "safeguard the legitimate rights and interests" of its companies The Chinese Ministry of Commerce has also regretted that the US has long resorted to national 'security' and 'emergency' to restrict or even prohibit Chinese companies from making normal investments and business activities in the country, imposing vetoes on transactions with Chinese companies for unjustifiable reasons."There is no factual or legal basis, which seriously damages the legitimate rights and interests of companies and seriously violates the basic principles of the market economy. This is not good for China, it is not good for the United States and it is not good for the whole world," the ministry's spokesman Gao Feng said at a press conference."The Chinese government is determined to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of domestic companies"In this regard, the Chinese official has warned that The measures taken by Washington will affect investor confidence in investing in the United States and has pointed out that China strongly opposes the political use and generalization of the review for national security reasons of investment."The Chinese government is determined to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of domestic companies," he said.In this way, the Ministry's spokesman has urged the United States to abandon its bad practices, stop the unjustified repression of Chinese companies, and work towards economic and trade cooperation between the two nations.Trump signed an executive order on August 14 approving a 90-day deadline for ByteDance, the owner of the TikTok social network, to end its operations in the country and get rid of the data. The US president accuses the application of exposing Americans to the risk of data theft or propaganda by the Chinese-born company.Previously, the US representative had signed an executive order to ban business within 45 days with WeChat, a courier service company of the Chinese company Tencent, as well as the owner of TikTok. These pressures are in addition to those exercised against the activities of telecom equipment manufacturer Huawei.commentsforum0WhatsAppFacebook  Twitter  Linkedin       Load-Date: August 21, 2020End of Document

SENATOR CHARLES GRASSLEY: QANDA: COVID-19 FUELS CHINESE ESPIONAGEStates News ServiceAugust 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 906 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Iowa Senator Charles Grassley:With U.S. Senator Chuck GrassleyQ: What's the latest red flag with regard to China's efforts to steal U.S. research?A: The theft of American ingenuity and know-how by foreign agents is a tale as old as the republic. However, in the global race to find treatments and cures for COVID-19, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is pulling out all the stops. By that, I mean cheating instead of cooperating. The CCP and President Xi have made no bones about their plans to dominate the 21st century global economy. Its Communist government regime will stop at nothing to "become the world's biggest superpower." In fact, intellectual property (IP) theft is effectively a government-dictated policy and an entrenched way of doing business. According to the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, IP theft costs U.S. companies hundreds of billions of dollars a year. These crimes put America's economic and national security interests in serious jeopardy. Stealing valuable IP even happens in the farm fields of Iowa. In 2016, a Chinese citizen was sentenced to prison for conspiracy to steal trade secrets from DuPont Pioneer and Monsanto after a years-long investigation that started in an Iowa seed-testing field. America's spirt of enterprise and innovation has propelled our economy to the frontiers of science and technology, telecommunications, artificial intelligence, medicine and more. Our research and academic institutions also have a red bulls-eye painted on their backs by foreign spies. The federal government must do more to combat economic espionage targeting U.S. businesses, industries and academia. From my leadership positions in the United States Senate, I'm dialing up my efforts to increase public awareness, strengthen enforcement and crack down on foreign criminal piracy that steals investment and research from under our noses. The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated China's shameless approach to win at all costs. Its abject negligence to come clean about the virus in 2019 has cost countless lives and wreaked havoc across the world. I'll continue working with the Trump administration to act decisively and root out China's economic espionage before it's too late.Q: How would your bills help lower health care prices?A: I've introduced bipartisan legislation that would make foreign nationals deportable from and inadmissible to the country if they are found to have violated our laws preventing the export of certain goods, technology, or sensitive information, or laws relating to economic espionage and the theft or misappropriation of trade secrets. For too long, the Chinese Communist regime has sought to lie, cheat and steal its way to prosperity. Not surprisingly, China is targeting U.S. researchers and scientists to hijack or disrupt COVID-19 vaccine development. Our academic and research institutions are especially vulnerable to infiltration by foreign nationals abusing immigration and employment laws. The U.S. State and Justice Departments are ramping up enforcement efforts to stop IP theft, cybercrimes, visa fraud and economic espionage. I'm keeping close watch to ensure the executive branch fully enforces U.S. intellectual property protection laws already on the books and working to enact stronger laws to thwart cyber-thieves and keep bad actors out. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I convened an oversight hearing on foreign threats to taxpayer-funded research in June 2019. I also wrote to the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, Health and Human Services Inspector General, and the Department of Defense relating to foreign threats to taxpayer-funded research. A Government Accountability Office review, which I requested, found that federal agencies need to be doing more to protect against foreign theft of U.S. research. As part of my oversight work, I've also sought a GAO review of the government's use of conflict of interest policies regarding taxpayer-funded research. What's more, I'll continue to expose and stop the orchestrated efforts to plant pro-China propaganda across U.S. college campuses. For example, I issued a warning earlier this year to more than 70 colleges, universities and school districts who have an active Confucius Institute on campus. These Chinese-government-backed entities are a front for the Communist regime to infiltrate and influence our academic environment by spreading pro-Communist Party propaganda. The U.S. Justice Department and FBI officials have confirmed that China is fully engaged in non-traditional espionage to steal taxpayer-funded research with immersion into our labs, academic institutions and defense systems. That's why I'm working to strengthen the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) to strengthen reporting and disclosure requirements. Americans who work and interact with foreign nationals must do so with their eyes and ears wide open. Understanding Chinese propaganda, keeping thieves out of the country and exposing malicious foreign influence for what it is will help prevent the Communist regime from leveraging cultural exchange of ideas, diplomacy and research for criminal economic advantage. Once and for all, America needs to wake up about China's efforts to take advantage of our intellectual property, infringe upon our academic freedom and take U.S. taxpayers for a ride.-30-Load-Date: August 7, 2020End of Document

All Rights ReservedSection: WORLDLength: 625 wordsByline: Varun Hukeri, Reporter, varun@dailycaller.comBodyLink to ImageHong Kong police reportedly arrested medial mogul Jimmy Lai for suspicion of foreign collusion and raided the office of his pro-democracy Apple Daily newspaper Monday under a national security law implemented earlier this year.Around 200 police officers raided the newspaper's office and arrested at least nine men including Lai and other senior executives, Reuters reported. Lai is suspected of “collusion with a foreign country/external elements to endanger national security” and other crimes, the police said.Apple Daily posted videos of the incident on its Facebook page which appear to depict police officers escorting the 71-year-old Lai out of the building and roaming through the newsroom searching files.

City-wide demonstrations and hundreds of arrests followed the implementation of the law.Lai has been a prominent democracy activist in Hong Kong and the Apple Daily is known for its anti-government and pro-democracy positions, according to Reuters. Apple Daily chief editor Ryan Law called the arrests “business as usual” and told Reuters the paper would not be intimidated.The self-made millionaire Lai was smuggled from mainland China at the age of 12 and became politically active after Beijing's crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, according to The Washington Post.Lai traveled to Washington, D.C. in July 2019 to meet with Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to discuss the political situation in Hong Kong, the Post reported.Pompeo said he was “deeply troubled” by the arrest in a tweet Monday. He added that the move was proof the Chinese Communist Party had “eroded the rights of its people.” I'm deeply troubled by reports of the arrest of @JimmyLaiApple under Hong Kong's draconian National Security Law.

Taiwan announces ban on Chinese streaming services Tencent and iQiyiCNN WireAugust 19, 2020 Wednesday 11:03 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 646 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Taiwan is preparing to ban iQiyi and Tencent from operating streaming video services on the island, the latest in a series of moves by governments around the world against Chinese tech giants. Tencent Video and iQiyi have been "operating illegally" in Taiwan by partnering with local broadcasters and distributors to provide their video content through streaming services, according to a government notice published online Tuesday. To put a stop to that, Taiwan's National Communications Commission announced new rules that would prohibit Taiwanese individuals and companies from providing services to mainland Chinese streaming operators and distributing their content, according to the notice. The regulator's decision is provisional pending a 14-day public comment period. The rules are set to take effect on September 3. Tencent declined to comment, while iQiyi did not immediately respond to questions from CNN Business. Taiwan is a self-governing democracy which Beijing continues to view as part of its territory. With a population of around 24 million people, the damage to the Chinese companies will be limited. But the proposed ban is further evidence of the growing backlash against China's tech champions in global markets. Relations between Beijing and Taipei have been souring ever since the election of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen in 2016, who was perceived by the Chinese government as being in favor of the island's formal independence. Washington has also moved closer to Taiwan. US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar's historic visit last week was intended to convey President Donald Trump's support for the democratic island. Taipei also finds itself in an increasingly precarious position in the US-China tech war, as the world becomes ever more dependent on Taiwanese company TSMC for the most advanced semiconductors. Tencent Video and iQiyi both offer services that are similar to Netflix. They stream licensed content, and also produce original television shows and movies that have become popular with Mandarin-speaking audiences. In earnings reports last week, Tencent said its video service had 114 million subscribers and iQiyi reported nearly 105 million. The vast majority of those subscribers are in mainland China, according to analysts. Trump earlier this month threatened to ban Tencent's popular messaging app WeChat and TikTok, the wildly popular video sharing platform owned by China's ByteDance. Trump last week also ordered ByteDance to divest interest in TikTok's US operations within the next 90 days. Earlier this week, the Trump administration further restricted Huawei's access to advanced semiconductors, a move analysts called "a lethal blow" to the Chinese tech firm's smartphone and telecommunications equipment business. British officials last month cited the disruption to Huawei's supply chain as a key reason it banned the company from the United Kingdom's 5G network. The Indian government in recent months has also banned TikTok and WeChat, as well as dozens of other popular Chinese apps. Government officials often cite national security concerns for the restrictions, although companies such as Huawei and ByteDance have repeatedly denied that their apps pose a national security risk. Financial regulators are also taking a much closer look at Chinese companies listed on global markets. US regulators are probing iQiyi after a short-seller in April accused the company of vastly overstating its subscriber numbers and revenue. iQiyi pushed back on the allegations at the time, asserting in a statement that "the report contains numerous errors, unsubstantiated statements and misleading conclusions and interpretations."--- Steven Jiang, Vanesse Chan and Ben Westcott contributed to this report.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Trump steps up escalation against China by banning transactions with TikTok and WeChatCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 911 wordsBodyOne more episode adds to the escalation of tensions between Beijing and Washington that have long been heading for a new Cold War. U.S. President Donald Trump signed Thursday night two executive orders banning U.S. companies from transacting with Chinese companies ByteDance, which owns the TikTok short video platform, and with Tencent, to which the WeChat messaging app belongs. The presidential decree, which takes effect in 45 days, has been justified by the White House as a measure of protection for America's "national security, economy, and foreign policy."The move is a further step in the rapid deterioration experienced in recent weeks by the bilateral relationship between the two powers, which is going through its most powerful moment since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1972. Trump has recently accused Chinese diplomatic headquarters of spying on U.S. territory and has now opted to point out the Asian giant's technology that has gained popularity among Americans, from every November election. China, for its part, has denied the accusations of the U.S. president, but has responded with equally harsh measures.Trump has gone from holding a trade war with Beijing to setting his sights on Chinese platforms. "The United States must take aggressive action against the owners of TikTok to protect our national security," the order signed by the president said. Last week, Trump threatened to ban the use of TikTok in the United States by claiming that the app was stealing user data to be delivered to the Chinese government. Something the company and Beijing have denied. Following the warning, Microsoft raised his hand to negotiate the purchase of the platform and his lean advisor, Satya Nadella, stood on the phone with Trump to communicate to the tech's intentions to safeguard app information in the United States.The new order increases pressure for Microsoft and ByteDance to reach an agreement soon, setting a date for the cessation of Chinese firm's U.S. firm operations Trump has drawn up his experience as a real estate entrepreneur and put a couple of conditions on tech: that some of the proceeds of the transaction go to the U.S. Treasury and reach a decision no later than 15 September. In the case of WeChat the surprise has been greater. This veto is a strong blow to this ubiquitous metaplataform in China, which channels much of the communication with communities in the diaspora, one of the few digital bridges stretched between the Asian giant and the rest of the world."An obvious act of intimidation that we strongly oppose." So the Chinese government has called the ultimatum launched by Trump, a threat that could be replicated by China and deepen the global fragmentation of the Internet. "Under the pretext of national security, the United States frequently uses national power to irrationally repress foreign companies," said Wang Wenbin, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at the institution's daily press conference.Donald Trump, during a visit to a Whirlpool plant in Clyde, Ohio. On video, Trump accuses Joe Biden of going "against God" during his visit to Ohio. PHOTO: AP/VIDEO: REUTERSThe spokesman has criticized the manoeuvre because it involves "meaningless political manipulation" that "damages America's image and moral position in the international community." He has also defended Chinese companies, ensuring that they "carry out their business activities in compliance with the principles ofmarket economy and complying with the laws and regulations of the country." "We urge the U.S. to correct these incorrect practices, refrain from politicizing economic problems, stop cracking down on relevant companies, and provide a fair and non-discriminatory environment," Wang said.In a report released on Friday, the consultancy Eurasia noted that the Chinese response to vetoes may occur in the form of retaliation such as "the use of antitrust or cybersecurity regulations (...), supply chain security reviews or new research on business practices", all in order to "host U.S. companies" operating in its territory.China's official press, for its part, has harshly criticized the US administration. In an article published on Friday, the Global Times tabloid has called Trump a "modern pirate" and the maneuver, "equivalent to a robbery." Significantly, for the first time in recent months the attacks personally point to the president rather than members of his administration, which until now had been interpreted as a sign of containment.In a statement, ByteDance has stated that "the executive order (...) has been issued without respect for the procedure" and has threatened to take legal action. "We will pursue every possible solution to ensure that the rule of law is not violated and that our company and users are treated fairly, if not by the Administration, at least by the courts of the United States," the text read.Losses on the Hong Kong Stock ExchangeThe shares of Tencent, WeChat's parent company and seventh market capitalization company in the world, fell to 10% on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and closed at losses of -5.04%. However, this measure is not expected to have a strong impact on its income statement, given that the overwhelming majority of its operations take place within China. The US authorities have clarified that, in principle, the measure will only affect WeChat and not other divisions of the firm, a leader in the video game industry in China.Load-Date: August 8, 2020End of Document

U.S.-China conflict could fracture the InternetCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 27, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 783 wordsBodyWASHINGTON — China and the United States once acted as polar opposites when it came to dominating the Internet.Beijing imposed a heavy hand. He blocked major foreign sites, protected Chinese tech firms while developing alternatives to Western rivals, and maintained fierce control over what people said online.The U.S. advocated a global opening that helped a generation of Internet colossus dominate globally.However, when President Donald J. Trump issued executive orders that could result in a veto in September to two of the world's most popular Chinese-made apps, TikTok and WeChat, the White House showed a new willingness to adopt Beijing's exclusionary tactics.Then Trump went further, ordering That ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, would give up his U.S. assets and all the data TikTok had collected in the U.S.The government also took strong action against Huawei by restricting The Chinese tech giant's ability to acquire foreign-produced computer chips using U.S. technology.That came after an initiative to start removing Chinese apps and telecommunications companies from U.S. networks, claiming they posed a security threat.Together, the measures herald a new and more invasive American philosophy of technological regulation that more closely resembles Chinese protectionist norms. The change could affect US cyber colossus like Facebook and Google, as well as Chinese Internet powers like Tencent and Alibaba, who have sought to expand into the West.If more countries imitate Trump by basing digital controls on diplomatic loyalties, protectionist goals, or new concerns about the security of their citizens, the internet could become a landscape of fiefdoms."A large-scale veto would undoubtedly detonate retaliation and could contribute to the kind of internet fracture we've seen in recent years, preferring authoritarian governments," said Ron Deibert, director of the Citizen Lab research group at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy at the University of Toronto.The White House's orders to TikTok and WeChat, which are expected to take effect on September 20, appear to stem from the idea that China should be punished for violating democratic norms. This principle of reciprocity has guided the Trump administration's recent confrontations with Beijing.However, when applied to the internet domain, reciprocity could be priced high for the U.S. While few countries have fully embraced the Chinese approach to cyberspace, many governments are uncomfortable with the dominance of US colossus such as Facebook,Google and Amazon within their borders, and are considering new taxes and restrictions on their operations.Vietnam and Turkey have already strengthened control over American social media. China has years of working to expand its influence in Africa, Latin America and the Middle East, and Chinese producers of smartphones and telecommunications equipment have already taken hold there.China's digital separation dates back to the late 1990s, when it began developing the Great Firewall, a sophisticated set of cyber controls. Beijing censored online content and blocked Google searches, social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, and news portals.Matt Perault, an academic at the Center for Scientific and Technology Policy at Duke University in North Carolina, said he was "disturbingto see the U.S. engage in a trade war that is in the hands of China's practices."Previously, U.S. policies sought to offer the world an alternative model to China,he noted.On other fronts, the Trump administration is still pushing for a more open Internet and opposes other countries' efforts to regulate the digital economies of American tech powers.This includes an offensive against new or proposed taxes on digital services in countries such as France, Britain, Italy and India, which could fall heavily on Google and Amazon.The administration has also opposed European efforts to address security concerns by blocking the flow of consumer data to the U.S.On its executive orders restricting WeChat and TikTok, the White House aimed at a recent action from India for vetoing the two apps. To some in Washington, that seemed a strange logic, given how the U.S. has criticized India's use of protectionist policies in other areas.Others said that total vetoes, if not accompanied by more significant rules, could backfire."A strong argument can be made that China's Great Firewall was the first salvo in this battle," said Samm Sacks, a researcher at the New America expert group in Washington. "My answer to that is: is reproducing the Chinese government's approach the right thing to do? Is he even going to make us safer?"© 2020 The New York Times       Load-Date: August 28, 2020End of Document

TikTok goes for Donald Trump: what the lawsuit against the U.S. government saysCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 25, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 934 wordsBodyTikTok,the social video sharing network, on Monday filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government for "highly politicized" decisions due to President Donald Trump's executive order to block the Chinese social network, in case it did not sell its assets to companies such as Microsoft or Oracle.As tensions escalated between the world's two largest economies, President Trump signed an executive order on August 6 giving Americans 45 days to stop doing business with TikTok. At the same time, it set deadline until November for the forced sale of the application to a US company.Thus, the government threatened the company to block it in the United States after the deadline if it did not dispose of the network or did not liquidate its operations in the country.For TikTok, the US administration did not take into account any of its transparency and communication efforts, but its decisions are "highly politicized."What TikTok's lawsuit against the U.S. government saysIn the 39 pages of the petition, obtained by Chinese agency Xinhua, US President Donald Trump, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and the U.S. Department of Commerce are listed as defendants.In the document, TikTok accuses the US authorities of depriving the company of its rights without evidence to justify this extreme action and of issuing the order without due process set forth in the Fifth Amendment, by outlawing it without notice or opportunity to be heard.In addition, he cites Trump's comments on this issue, including his election statement at a press conference in which he said that TikTok "has no rights" and would ban popular software if the company did not pay money to the government to secure the approval of any kind of sale. These claims are unconstitutional, detailingthe lawsuit."By requiring plaintiffs to pay the U.S. Treasury as a condition of the sale of TikTok, the president took ownership of the plaintiffs without compensation,in direct violation of the Fifth Amendment," the document reads."With this executive order that threatens to ban our operations in the United States, which by the way eliminates the creation of 10,000 jobs in the United States and irreparably harms the millions of Americans who turn to this app for fun and take advantage of a particularly vital medium during the pandemic, we simply have no choice," they added from ByteTikTok argues that other presidents used the power authorized by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to protect the country from external threats, including terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but this order seeks to use it against a U.S. company with hundreds of employees nationwide and to destroy an online community that shares videos of millions of Americans.The short video application that became popular in the coronavirus pandemic was downloaded 175 million times in the United States alone and more than a billion times worldwide.The executive order, which is issued in the IEEPA, was issued"for political reasons and not for an 'unusual and extraordinary threat'to the United States, a condition for the president to exercise his authority," TikTok notes.The plaintiffs, TikTok Inc. and ByteDance Ltd., seek to achieve a judgment and an order that invalidates and prohibitsthe executive order and any implementing regulations subsequently issued by the Department of Commerce."The president's executive disposition is unconstitutional, ultra vires (beyond his powers) and must be outlawed," it reads in the document.The company strongly disagrees with the Trump Administration's claims that the company is a threat to national security and had previously stated this.Over the past two years, U.S. officials have repeatedly spread rumors that, since TikTok is owned by Beijing-based technology company ByteDance, it could pass the data it collects from us videos to the Chinese government."Thereis no connection between TikTok and the Chinese government,nor does the Chinese government have any control over TikTok through ByteDance," the company said, adding that TikTok's top managers, including its CEO and head of Global Security, are Americans.TikTok content moderation in the U.S. is led by a team based in that country and operates independently of China, while the popular application stores data from U.S. users on servers located in the United States and Singapore, detailed.The company complains that it has often provided this evidence to the US authorities, which dismissed it in a rough manner, and has therefore been forced to file the lawsuit.He has also suggested that the Trump Administration imposed extreme restrictions on the company for political reasons.The Future of TikTok According to reports from various media, Microsoft and Oracle are potential suitors to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. The first had even recognized contacts in that regard, but from the video app soon after, she had announced that she was in the United States "to stay".In the case of Oracle, whose President Larry Ellison has raised millions in funds for the Republican campaign for Trump, he was weighing an offer for TikTok's operations in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.The conflict is in the context of growing diplomatic and trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.But moreover, these measures come before the November 3 election in which Trump seeks re-election and appears in the polls behind his Democratic rival Joe Biden, so he seems to appeal in his campaign to an increasingly strident message against the Beijing government.With information from Xinhua and AFPLoad-Date: August 26, 2020End of Document

Trump's push for TikTok sale to Microsoft draws ire in ChinaUPIAugust 4, 2020 Tuesday 11:25 AM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 353 wordsByline: CLYDE HUGHESDateline: Aug. 4 BodyReaction in Beijing has been fierce to the Trump's administration move for the owners of China-based video-sharing app TikTok to sell to Microsoft, with some comparing it to "robbery" and "theft."U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday gave Microsoft and TikTok's parent company until Sept. 15 to work out a deal or the platform could be banned in the United States.TikTok has an estimated 100 million users in the United States, but officials worry that users' personal information could be accessible by the Chinese government.State-run China Daily wrote the proposed sale would amount to "theft" and a "smash and grab" effort and denounced the U.S. administration for "bullying" Chinese tech companies."Since 2017, the United States has investigated [TikTok] parent company] ByteDance over its acquisition of a social media app ... which was fully rebranded as part of TikTok in 2018. Yet the White House has found no evidence indicating violation of any regulations by the Chinese company," added state-run Xinhua."By slapping a deadline on the potential deal, Trump has effectively turned transaction into a fire sale, further pressuring Beijing-based ByteDance to give up its business interests and intellectual property at a discounted rate," the state-run Global Times wrote.Trump said the U.S. Treasury Department should also receive a substantial cut from any deal for TikTok, because it created conditions for the sale."This is an open robbery," Global Times editor-in-chief Hu Xijin tweeted. "The world is watching and God is watching how President Trump is turning the once great America into a rogue country."Xinhua wrote that the national security grounds cited for the proposed U.S. ban is an "excuse widely used to discriminate against Chinese companies and investment."Vanessa Pappas, the U.S. general manager for TikTok, said the company has received an "outpouring from support" since Trump proposed the ban."We're not planning on going anywhere," she said. "When it comes to safety and security, we're building the safest app because we know it's the right thing to do. We're here for the long run."Load-Date: August 4, 2020End of Document

China says US damaging global trade with Huawei sanctionsAssociated Press Financial WireAugust 18, 2020 Tuesday 11:17 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 706 wordsByline: JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) — China accused Washington of damaging global trade with sanctions that threaten to cripple tech giant Huawei and said Tuesday it will protect Chinese companies but gave no indication of possible retaliation.Rules confirmed Monday by the Commerce Department block suppliers from using U.S. technology to produce processor chips and other components for Huawei. The company, China's first global tech competitor, is the biggest supplier of switching equipment for phone companies and a leading smartphone brand.The foreign ministry demanded the Trump administration “stop suppressing Chinese companies.”Huawei Technologies Ltd. is at the center of a worsening row between Washington and Beijing over technology and security. U.S. officials say Huawei is a security risk, which the company denies, and are lobbying European and other allies to avoid its technology as they upgrade to next-generation networks.The conflict has spread to include Chinese-owned short video app TikTok and messaging service WeChat, which the U.S. government has declared security risks that might give personal information about American users to Chinese authorities. The Trump administration is pressing TikTok's owner to sell it and has ordered American companies to stop dealing with WeChat.The United States is “violating international trade rules, and undermining the global industrial chain, supply chain, and value chain,” said a ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian.Beijing will “take necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies,” Zhao said. Chinese officials frequently use that phrase during trade disputes but it often has been followed by no official action.Huawei declined to comment on the latest U.S. action.The president of its consumer unit, Richard Yu, said this month Huawei is running out of processor chips for its smartphones. Huawei designs its own chips but Yu said production of the most advanced, the Kirin series, would stop Sept. 15 because the company relies on outside manufacturers that use American technology.Huawei removed U.S.-supplied components from its main products following earlier sanctions that blocked access to American technology. This week's sanctions extends those controls to Asian and European components if their manufacturing process uses U.S. technology, which is common.Earlier U.S. sanctions block Huawei from loading Google's popular music and other services onto its smartphones. That has hurt their ability to compete in markets outside China.Huawei passed Samsung and Apple to become the biggest-selling smartphone brand for the first time in the three months ending in June thanks to strong sales in China's populous market, according to Canalys. Sales abroad fell 27% from a year earlier.Huawei, founded in 1987 by a former military engineer, denies accusations it might facilitate Chinese spying. Chinese officials accuse Washington of using national security as an excuse to stop a competitor to U.S. tech industries.“The more hysterical the U.S. suppression of Huawei and other Chinese companies, the more it proves the success of these companies and the hypocrisy and arrogance of the United States,” said Zhao, the foreign ministry spokesman.“We urge the United States to immediately correct its mistakes, stop slandering China and stop suppressing Chinese companies,” he said. “The Chinese government will continue to take necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.”Vendors including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., the biggest contract chip producer, have been scrutinizing their supply and manufacturing lines since the latest U.S. restrictions were proposed in May.Huawei is one of the biggest customers of U.S. and other suppliers of chips and components. They stand to lose billions of dollars in potential sales.Nicole Peng of industry research firm Canalys said vendors she contacted Tuesday were still examining their supply lines and whether they could do business with Huawei. She said some rely on the Chinese company for up to half their sales.“I would guess many are really worried,” said Peng. “In general, there is a lot of uncertainty, and they need time to respond.”Load-Date: August 18, 2020End of Document

U.S. and China dig trenches on the internet about TikTokCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 5, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1087 wordsBodyNew York/Beijing, 5 Aug (EFE).- The battle for TikTok, a Chinese app that has only set itself to the level of Instagram or Twitter, is the latest episode of the "cold war" between the United States and China that can turn upside down the two big sides that shape the internet, build digital walls and affect one of the few sectors with a promising future in a world in crisis.At a meeting tuesday with employees, the TikTok Dome, owned by China's ByteDance, assumed that a forced-sell agreement will have to be agreed to continue to operate, something that could be resolved by September 15, the deadline given by President Donald Trump for sale if they do not want to be exposed to a total ban in the United States.As reported today by the specialized medium The Information, TikTok's CEO, formerDisney Kevin Mayer, assured employees at a teleconference that the company will emerge stronger from the acquisition, although he noted that the outcome of that negotiation is still in the air.TikTok's is just the latest episode of a conflict that intensified more than two years ago on the commercial level and which is already an open struggle for technological supremacy in which digital walls are building between two powers that, even if they claim victory, will have lost out.Both American and Chinese experts agree that the new batch of Chinese digital entrepreneurs do not want to enter to play in the trade, ideological and geopolitical war between Washington and Beijing, and prefer to dedicate themselves to mastering the internet with apps that attract teens, 'influencers' and advertisers globally.Trump has repeated throughout this week the threat of closing TikTok for a national security reason steming from the fact that its capital is Chinese and there are misgivings about protecting American data and whether the Beijing government can influence how the social network shapes the perception of the reality of its 100 million American users.The Trump Administration's decision could have longer-term consequences on the definition of the internet, by resorting to a practice of "nationalization" of foreign investment, common in the Chinese regime but unprecedented in the Us open and democratic internet and which has ignored Bytedance's repeated attempts to show itself as a technology company that looks in the Mirror of Silicon Valley.To ban TikTok, an app where most of the content is for teenagers or celebrities dancing, Trump will have to resort to a national emergency statement and go to one of the laws that allow the executive to act in the event of flagrant cases that endanger national security, something unprecedented."While there are significant reasons to worry about TikTok's security, privacy and relations with the Chinese government, we should resist the government's powers to ban a popular means of communication and expression," an Electronic Frontier Foundation spokeswoman, fighting for an open and transparent internet, told Efe.ByteDance founder and CEO Zhang Yiming in an internal letter to his employees said they "have always pledged to protect user data and maintain TikTok's neutrality and transparency," while speculating that the ultimate goal is to unsover TikTok, priced at $30 billion.Zhang, whoever turned 37 into one of China's richest men, believes that if Trump tries to ban TikTok, they will not have the capacity to oppose it.DESMONETIZE THE 'COOL'California's cool kids did not expect to be victims in the U.S.-China Cold War now being wagedon the internet at the count of TikTok, an application that for many teenagers is not only the focus of their attentions, but also a mine in which they nurture their popularity and current accounts.For 18-year-old musician, actor and influencer Bryce Xavier, the end of TikTok would be the end of his days in a mansion in Los Angeles that he shares with several other teenagers who are dedicated to choreographing dances of a few seconds, taking selfies and lying in the sun in front of the screen of his mobiles.Trump, another influencer, could force the work of dozens of celebrities who, thanks to TikTok, have amassed tens of millions of followers and signed juicy contracts.Social video applications, similar to TikTok, have started an aggressive campaign to capture users and "creators" in the face of the possibility that the social network will end up disappearing or without a clear course.Facebook, which Mark Zuckerberg, 36, created in 2007 to become the world's big social network, today announced the release of Reel within Instagram, a service that replicates TikTok's recipe for TikTok's success: focus on consuming celebrity content, music and dances as a central motif and promoting "creators."THE CHINESE INTERNET LOOKS AT SILICON VALLEYChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Webin on Tuesday called the U.S. campaign against The Application of ByteDance "pure manipulation" and warned the Trump Administration not to "open Pandora's box" or prepare to "suffer the consequences."Wang accused the United States of "using its state power to violently attack companies in other countries" and warned that "any country will be able to take similar measures against any U.S. company based on national security."According to China's private economic newspaper Caixin, ByteDance's relationship with the Beijing government is "not good" and TikTok has been rather a source of concern for Communist Party censors, who find it difficult to control such social media.Zhang is made from another pasta., this electronic engineer who in just eight years has built a $100 billion empire, worked at Microsoft and does not have the official profile of other tech tycoons, such as Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, 75, an exficial of the People's Liberation Army and a member of the Chinese Communist Party (PCCh)TikTok has decided to soak up Silicon Valley's technological values at a time when "Big Tech" is questioned in Washington - Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon - for their monopoly and dominant position, and in Europe they are subjected to new rules to avoid the uncontrolled use of their users' personal data to expand their profits.At the same time, TikTok has succumbed to its meteoric success, as Chinese internet giants like Alibaba or Tencent continue to fuel their global ambitions away from the spotlight, as their American rivals try, as Zuckerberg said last week to Congress, that Washington's political power does

Donald Trump redoubles china offensive with sanctions on Hong Kong authoritiesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 8, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 704 wordsBodyThe U.S. escalated its clash with China on Friday by sanctioning top authorities in Hong Kong, after ordering heavy restrictions against Chinese-owned social media giants TikTok and WeChat.In the Trump administration's toughest decision regarding Hong Kong since Beijing imposed a strict security law on that territory, the Treasury announced the freezing of every U.S. asset by Chief Executive Carrie Lam and 10 other senior officials.The measure also penalizes any U.S. financial transaction with the 11 officers,including Hong Kong Police Commissioner Chris Tang and Luo Huining, the director of the Liaison Office, a Beijng leg at the international financial center."Today's measures send a clear message that the actions of the Hong Kong authorities are unacceptable," said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.Pompeo noted that the law, considered by activists to be a legal weapon to silence dissidents, violated China's promises before the UK returned the colony in 1997.The Treasury said Lam "is directly responsible for implementing Beijing's policies of repression of freedom and democratic processes."The security law was imposed in late June in Hong Kong after massive, and sometimes destructive, pro-democracy protestslast year.Since then, the authorities have delayed the elections, arguing the coronavirus crisis and, according to the Chinese government, issued arrest warrants against six pro-democracy activists in exile.Against TikTok and WeChatThe new offensive against Beijing comes after On Thursday night, Trump set up significant restrictions in the United States against TikTok short video and WeChat messaging apps.By decree, the white house chief gave Americans 45 days to stop doing business with those platforms.The president cited "national security risks" to justify the measures, which also called into question the U.S. operations of WeChat's parent company, Tencent, a powerful player in the video game industry and one of the world's richest companies.China reacted by denouncing "arbitrary political manipulation and repression" by the United States, according to Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wengbin.The spokesman accused Washington of "overlapping selfish interests above market principles and international standards."Users of the social network Weibo, a Chinese equivalent of Twitter, lamented the action taken against WeChat."How are students going to be contacted abroad with their families when they veto WeChat?" said one.The new restrictions sank Tencent's shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange, which collapsed by 10% before ending with a 5.04% drop, erasing nearly $50 billion from its market capitalization.Trump's decree states that TikTok, whose video clips range from hair dye tutorials to dance routines and jokes about everyday life, could be used by China to track down U.S. federal employees, put together files on people to blackmail them, and perform corporate espionage.TikTok, who has repeatedly denied sharing data with the Chinese government, said he was "shocked" by the decree "issued without due process."The application owned by ByteDance, based in China, promised to search for "all available solutions" forensure that the law is enforced and threatened to take legal action.WeChat is a messaging, social media and electronic payment platform that reports having more than one billion users, and many prefer it to email.Controversial measuresDaniel Castro of the Washington-based Foundation for Innovation and Information Technology (ITIF) said the U.S. measures are likely to backfire."Accusations of security risks must be backed up by strong evidence, not unsubstantiated innuendo," he said."U.S. tech companies may lose significant market share if other countries follow a similar standard and block them from their markets because of concerns about U.S. government surveillance," he added.Trump set the deadline for mid-September for TikTok to be acquired by a U.S. company or its operation to be banned in the United States, leading Microsoft to accelerate its conversations to buy it.Washington has also clashed with Huawei, the Chinese telecom and smartphone giant, which the Trump administration accuses of being a Beijing spy tool.Source: AFPLoad-Date: August 9, 2020End of Document

Chinese hackers infiltrated some 6,000 email accounts from ten Taiwan government agenciesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 20, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 365 wordsBodyChinese hackers infiltrated at least 10 Taiwanese government agencies and gained access to some 6,000 email accounts in an attempted data theft, Taiwanese authorities said Wednesday.The damage caused was not "small," according to a senior cyber official in Taiwan, who said the total impact was still being assessed. Taipei has accused Beijing of stepping up a cyber campaign since 2016, when Taiwan elected President Tsai Ing-wen, who refuses to recognize Beijing's insistence that the self-governing democratic island is part of "one China."Tsai, who considers Taiwan to be de facto independent, won re-election by an overwhelming majority in January in what was considered a strong rebuke to Beijing's campaign to influence the island.According to taiwan's Bureau of Research Research, two known Chinese hacker groups - Blacktech and Taidoor - have been attacking government departments and information service providers since 2018. "We know for sure that these 6,000 emails have been compromised. We're still assessing the extent of the damage. As far as we know, the damage caused by this infiltration is not small," the deputy director of the office, Liu Chia-zung, told the AFP."We do this public because we want to alert everyone to the threat and prevent further damage," Liu added.The announcement comes a week after US health secretary Alex Azar concluded a historic trip to the self-governing island, as China warned Washington not to "play with fire."Beijing has intensified diplomatic and economic pressure on Taiwan, as well as increased military exercises near the island, including its aircraft that have penetrated Taiwan's air defense zone with unprecedented frequency in recent weeks.With information from AFPMORE ON THIS TOPIC:The chain of concealments between military and Communist Party of China officials who spread the coronavirusU.S. students to start using anonymous aliases and chats to protect themselves from China's Security ActEcuadorian Navy continues to monitor Chinese fishing fleet that stalks the Galapagos IslandsDonald Trump supported Oracle's bid to buy TikTok: "It's a great company"Kim Jong-un ordered to confiscate all dogs in North Korea's capitalLoad-Date: August 21, 2020End of Document

China accuses US of 'intimidation' over forced sale of TikTokCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 4, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 603 wordsBodyThe fight between China and the United States over TikTok is far from coming to an end. After U.S. President Donald Trump himself said he was going to ban enforcement last Saturday - ultimately not to - the Chinese government accused the United States on Tuesday of "pure and simple intimidation."China's stance was known after Donald Trump ordered the sale by mid-September of the very popular social network TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance.The scenario is as follows: TikTok will close in the United States on September 15 "unless Microsoft ?or someone else can buy it and come to an agreement". That's what Trump announced Monday referring to the app that has nearly 1 billion users worldwide, mainly teenagers.In a context of political and trade tensions with China, Washington has been accusing the platform of being used by Chinese intelligence services for surveillance purposes for months.And China reacted. Upon consulting on the announcement of Donald Trump, a spokesman for Chinese diplomacy, Wang Wenbin, accused the United States of regularly attacking foreign companies by abusing the notion of national security."This goes against the principles of the market economy and the principles of openness, transparency and non-discrimination of the WTO," the spokesman released the press. "It's about pure and simple intimidation. China strongly opposes it," he added.Without going until the announcement of retaliatory measures, Wang estimated that Washington was opening "Pandora's box.""If everyone imitates the United States, any country will be able to take similar action against U.S. companies in the name of national security," he warned."Let him prepare for more difficulties in the future"In a letter sent Tuesday to ByteDance employees, its founder Zhang Yiming suggested that america's intention was to ban the application rather than force a sale.Zhang told staff to "prepare for more difficulties in the future," and I assure you that anti-China sentiment "has grown significantly in many countries."While the company denies that its users' data is handed over to the Chinese government, ByteDance's founder acknowledged in another internal letter on Monday to be under pressure and noted that they work 24 hours a day "to get the best possible exit.""We are always committed to ensuring the security of user data as well as the neutrality and transparency of the platform," Zhang told employees in that internal statement, according to Chinese media.However, he said, TikTok faces "increasing complexities across the geopolitical landscape and significant external pressure," and that he is studying to "relocate headquarters in another large market outside the United States."According to The Sun, ByteDance is considering moving TikTok's global operations to the UK, now based in Los Angeles.America's "fear": private informationVery popular with young people, Tiktok allows users to create and share videos up to 60 seconds, often funny but also serious and even artistic.According to the head of American diplomacy, Mike Pompeo, companies like TikTok may be getting information from citizens such as their "facial recognition pattern," "residence," "phone numbers," "friends, " and "who they contact."In announcing a deadline for the sale of the app, Trump also released asurprise new condition, noting that the transaction would result in a significant payment to the U.S. Treasury.Microsoft did not comment on Monday,but in a statement Sunday, he said that if he made the acquisition, he pledged to "provide the economic benefits to the United States, including the Treasury."PJBLoad-Date: August 5, 2020End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 28 of 402Center for Strategic & International Studies: Tech Crisis With China  Page 33 of 402Clandestine labs, neglect and thousands of deaths: Alarm grows over China's little cooperation to stem the rise of fentanyl epidemic  Page 39 of 402CSIS: From Competition to Confrontation With China - Major Shift in U.S. Policy  Page 42 of 402WECHAT IS A TRAP FOR CHINA'S DIASPORA  Page 48 of 402Chinese Stocks Era May 'TikTok' Down For American Investors As U.S.-China Rift Grows  Page 50 of 402U.S. warns of malware used by Chinese government  Page 52 of 402US warns about Traidoor, a malware used by the Chinese government  Page 54 of 402Tension worsens: China denounced US government 'bad intentions'  Page 68 of 402Rising Crime in U.S. Cities; HHS Secretary Alex Azar is Interviewed about Telehealth, Coronavirus, China, Vaccines; Demand for Cloud Technology Grows During Pan....  Page 81 of 402Court to investigate release of George Floyd's body-camera video; Officials say diesel soot is the cause of the apple fire in southern California; FAA outlines ....  Page 85 of 402In China's Xinjiang, forced medication accompanies lockdown  Page 87 of 402Filing: Kansas prof's prosecution criminalizes job disputes  Page 89 of 402TECH COMPANIES SHOULD STAND UP TO CHINA'S BULLYING  Page 106 of 402Congressional Research Service Report: 'Emerging Military Technologies: Background & Issues for Congress'  Page 108 of 402KENNEDY INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO PROTECT AMERICAN CITIZENS, BUSINESSES, SECURITY INTERESTS FROM COMMUNIST CHINA  Page 111 of 402Microsoft has a long history in China.
