Sens. Portman, Carper: Bipartisan Report Reveals How Three Chinese Government-Owned Telecoms Operated in U.S. for Nearly 20 Years With Little-to-No Oversight From Federal GovernmentTargeted News ServiceJune 10, 2020 Wednesday 9:01 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3164 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, issued the following news release on June 9:U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Tom Carper (D-DE), the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), released a new bipartisan report detailing how the federal government provided little-to-no oversight of Chinese state-owned telecommunications carriers operating in the United States for nearly twenty years. As demonstrated in recent PSI investigations, China routinely exploits the American education and scientific research sectors to further its national interest and engages in cyber-attacks against U.S. companies, like Equifax and Marriott. This report reveals how the telecommunications industry has been similarly targeted.In May 2019, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) denied China Mobile USA's application to provide international telecommunications services. The FCC found that because of its Chinese government ownership, allowing China Mobile USA to operate in the United States would create an unacceptable risk to our national security. This marked the first instance in which the FCC denied an application on national security grounds.The Subcommittee reviewed three other Chinese government-owned telecom companies, all authorized by the FCC to provide similar services China Mobile USA applied (and was denied permission) to provide. The Subcommittee's year-long investigation found that the FCC and "Team Telecom"-- an informal group comprised of officials from the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and Defense -- have failed to monitor these three Chinese government-owned carriers. China Telecom Americas, China Unicom Americas, and ComNet USA have been operating in the United States since the early 2000s. The Subcommittee's report documents how Team Telecom had little engagement with China Telecom Americas and ComNet USA, until recently. Team Telecom has only visited the two carriers twice in more than a decade. The Subcommittee also found that Team Telecom had no oversight of or interaction with China Unicom Americas since the FCC authorized it to provide international telecom services in 2002."This bipartisan report demonstrates that federal agencies have done little to protect the integrity of U.S. telecommunications networks and counter national security threats from China," said Senator Portman. "The Chinese Communist Party uses its state-owned enterprises to further its cyber and economic espionage efforts against the United States, and they've been exploiting our telecommunications networks for nearly two decades while the federal government historically put in little effort to stop it. In recent months, and in response to this investigation, the federal government has begun to do more, including an important Executive Order by the President to ensure foreign-owned carriers are properly monitored and reviewed. I am encouraged by these efforts, and I look forward to working with Senator Carper on legislation to ensure federal agencies have the oversight and enforcement tools necessary to protect our telecommunications networks going forward.""Our bipartisan report reveals how little oversight has been done of Chinese telecommunications carriers that operate here in the United States," said Senator Carper. "Work Senator Portman and I have done at PSI over the years has revealed how the Chinese government has launched cyber-attacks against our businesses and government agencies and worked to get ahead militarily and economically with stolen American research and intellectual property. Today's report highlights how we've allowed Chinese government-owned companies gain a foothold in our telecommunications industry while their American competitors face significant barriers to entry in China. It makes clear that more has to be done to protect our national security against foreign spies and hackers, and I look forward to working with Senator Portman to do just that."The report's key findings include:- The Chinese government exercises control over China's telecommunications industry and carriers. The Chinese telecommunications market is the largest in the world, in terms of number of subscribers. The Chinese government views the telecommunications industry as critical and has set goals for the industry to "enter the ranks of powerful countries." To achieve this goal, the Chinese government exerts control over the domestic telecommunications market, including restraining foreign investment.- China does not provide U.S. telecommunications companies reciprocal access to the Chinese market and requires foreign carriers seeking to operate in China to enter into joint ventures with Chinese companies.- The Chinese government encourages Chinese companies to take advantage of more open international markets.- The Chinese government engages in cyber and economic espionage efforts against the United States and may use telecommunications carriers operating in the United States to further these efforts. The U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center and the Director of National Intelligence have warned that the Chinese government is likely to use its state-owned carriers to assist in its espionage efforts because the carriers "provide valuable services that often require access to the physical and logical control points of the computers and networks they support." In fact, public reports allege that at least one Chinese carrier--China Telecom-- and its affiliates have hijacked and rerouted data through China on a number of occasions since 2010. China Telecom and its affiliates, including its U.S. affiliate, China Telecom Americas, denies the public reports.- The FCC regulates foreign carriers seeking to provide international telecommunications services between the United States and foreign points, but historically relied on Team Telecom to assess the national security and law enforcement risks associated with a foreign carrier's proposed services.- The FCC is not required to review a foreign carrier's authorization after it has been granted. Authorizations effectively exist in perpetuity despite evolving national security implications.- Team Telecom was an informal group, with no statutory authority. As a result, its review of foreign carriers' applications was ad hoc, leading to delays and uncertainty. Throughout its existence, Team Telecom operated under no formal legislative or regulatory authority. Instead, it reviewed foreign carriers' applications at the request of and under the powers of the FCC. The lack of statutory authority resulted in a disorganized, haphazard, and lengthy review process that has been heavily criticized and referred to as an "inextricable black hole." Team Telecom had no deadlines by which it needed to make recommendations to the FCC, meaning the review of an application could--and often did--last years.- Team Telecom had insufficient resources. DOJ and DHS dedicated fewer than five employees to monitoring compliance with the more than 100 security agreements currently in effect.- The lack of statutory authority also prohibited Team Telecom from conducting meaningful oversight of foreign carriers authorized by the FCC.- The FCC has authorized three Chinese state-owned carriers to provide international telecommunications services between the United States and foreign points. These three Chinese state-owned carriers have operated in the United States for decades: China Unicom Americas and China Telecom Americas obtained authorization in 2002; ComNet first obtained authorization in 1999.- Team Telecom has had no interaction with China Unicom Americas since the FCC's authorization.- Team Telecom entered into security agreements with China Telecom Americas and ComNet, but conducted just two site visits in more than 10 years.- The FCC and Team Telecom have recognized the national security risks posed by Chinese state-owned carriers operating in the United States. In particular, in connection with China Mobile USA's application, the FCC, Team Telecom, and other Executive Branch agencies cited three areas of concerns: (1) China Mobile USA could be exploited, influenced, and controlled by the Chinese government; (2) China Mobile USA could gain access to U.S. networks through interconnection arrangements with U.S. carriers; and (3) due to its Chinese government control and access to U.S. critical infrastructure, China Mobile USA could help the Chinese government in its cyber and economic espionage or other malicious activities. Team Telecom argued that, if authorized to provide international telecommunication services, China Mobile USA would have been able to monitor, degrade, and disrupt U.S. government communications. And, as a Chinese state-owned company, it must legally comply with requests made by the Chinese government and could not be expected to act against the interests of the Chinese government.- The national security concerns outlined with respect to China Mobile USA apply to the other Chinese state-owned carriers operating within the United States. The carriers are ultimately owned by the Chinese government, and therefore subject to exploitation, influence, and control by the Chinese government. They may be forced to assist in cyber and economic espionage activities targeted at the United States, as they are similarly bound by Chinese national security laws. Further, the carriers have established relationships with major U.S. carriers, including AT&T, Verizon, and Centurylink--all of which serve government entities, as well as private customers.The report makes the following recommendations:- The FCC should complete its review of China Telecom Americas, China Unicom Americas, and ComNet in a timely manner. Team Telecom has recommended that China Telecom Americas' authorizations be revoked because of "serious and substantial" national security concerns. The FCC should expeditiously review the authorizations of China Telecom Americas and the other Chinese state-owned carriers to ensure our national security and communications networks are not unnecessarily put at risk. As part of its review of China Unicom Americas' and ComNet's authorizations, the FCC should seek the recommendation of the newly established EO Telecom Committee as to national security and law enforcement concerns associated with the carriers' authorizations. The analysis should also include a decision as to whether risks can be mitigated--through the existing security agreements or new agreements.- The FCC should establish a clear standard and process for revoking a foreign carrier's existing authorizations. Currently, there is no clear standard or process for revoking a foreign carrier's existing authorizations. Telecommunications companies must understand the circumstances under which authorizations could be revoked and be afforded due process to challenge potential revocation. Team Telecom officials indicated that they do not know what the FCC considers a "sufficient" basis for a revocation. Thus, while government officials may believe revocation is warranted, they may not recommend revocation without additional guidance. A formal standard and revocation process would provide clear guidance to both the government and industry as to when revocation of an existing authorization is warranted.- Congress should require the periodic review and renewal of foreign carriers' authorizations to provide international telecommunications services. Currently, these authorizations can exist in perpetuity. Although the recent Executive Order allows the EO Telecom Committee to review existing authorizations, it does not mandate periodic review or renewal. Considering the limited resources DOJ and DHS dedicated to Team Telecom's review of foreign carriers' applications, it is unlikely that they will review many existing authorizations. National security and law enforcement concerns, as well as trade, and foreign policy concerns, however, are ever evolving, meaning that an authorization granted in one year may not continue to serve the public interest years later. Requiring a periodic review and renewal of authorizations would ensure that the FCC and the Executive Branch continually account for evolving national security, law enforcement, policy, and trade risks.- Congress should statutorily authorize the EO Telecom Committee. The Administration established the EO Telecom Committee, which formalizes Team Telecom, but the EO Telecom Committee still has no governing statutory authority. Team Telecom's historical lack of statutory authority led to a review process criticized by many as "opaque" and "broken." The recent Executive Order is a positive step, but formal legislative authority will provide for greater oversight over the telecommunications industry.- Congress should preserve the role of other relevant Executive Branch agencies. Team Telecom was comprised of DOJ, DHS, and DOD officials. These agencies are also the primary components of the newly established EO Telecom Committee. Historically, the FCC has sought input on a foreign carrier's application from other Executive Branch agencies, including the Department of State, Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Trade Representative. The recent Executive Order makes these agencies, and others, advisors to the EO Telecom Committee. These agencies provide invaluable input and their role in the review process must be accounted for in any formal legislation.- Congress should set deadlines by which decisions on FCC-related application reviews must be made. Team Telecom had no set deadlines by which it needed to complete its review of a foreign carrier's application pursuant to FCC's request. Further, Team Telecom's already limited resources were often focused on actions related to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ("CFIUS"). This resulted in protracted reviews and business uncertainty. Setting deadlines will imbue trust back into the review process. The recent Executive Order imposed certain timelines, but it allows for the EO Telecom Committee to seek extensions, which could draw out the review process, especially if resources remain limited.- Congress should provide sustained resources necessary for the EO Telecom Committee to effectively assess foreign carriers' applications and to monitor foreign carriers operating in the United States. The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 provided CFIUS agencies specialized authority to hire staff to ensure agencies can manage CFIUS filings. EO Telecom Committee agencies should be provided a similar authority to ensure it is able to effectively and efficiently review foreign carriers' applications and monitor foreign carriers' operations.- Congress should require the EO Telecom Committee to formally coordinate reviews of foreign carrier applications with CFIUS. The EO Telecom Committee's component agencies are members of CFIUS. CFIUS's and the EO Telecom Committee's processes overlap when a foreign investor seeks to acquire control of a U.S. telecommunications operator or infrastructure owner. These applications already undergo extensive review by CFIUS. Requiring formal coordination between CFIUS and the EO Telecom Committee will streamline the regulatory clearance process while meeting national security, law enforcement, trade policy, and foreign policy objectives.- Congress should provide the EO Telecom Committee with authority to recommend revocation of a carrier's authorization, even where no security agreement exists between it and the carrier. Where no security agreement existed, Team Telecom did not interact with the foreign carrier. Although certain government officials believed that Team Telecom could review an existing authorization, even where no agreement existed, there is no formal, legal basis for such review. Combined with a requirement to periodically renew authorizations, affording the EO Telecom Committee the authority to review and recommend revocation of existing authorizations, even without a security agreement in place, allows the EO Telecom Committee to better respond to the evolving nature of national security risks.- Congress should require the periodic review and renewal of security agreements between the EO Telecom Committee and foreign carriers. Team Telecom officials told the Subcommittee that, even if it believed that a security agreement is not comprehensive to address all risks associated with a foreign carrier's operations, it had little leverage to update the agreement. This means that certain risks, which could otherwise be mitigated, may go unaddressed. Requiring a periodic review and renewal of security agreements provides the EO Telecom Committee yet another tool to ensure that national security and other risks are regularly assessed and addressed.- The EO Telecom Committee should establish formal, written policies and procedures governing its monitoring of compliance with security agreements. Team Telecom had no formal, written processes governing its monitoring of a foreign carrier's compliance with a security agreement. It relied on written correspondence and site visits, but there was no clear method as to when these mechanisms were used or why. The EO Telecom Committee should document and formalize Team Telecom's processes, which will provide for more streamlined and consistent review of foreign carriers' operations in the United States.- Congress and the Administration should take steps to ensure reciprocal access to the Chinese telecommunications market for U.S. companies. In those aspects of telecommunications in which China officially permits foreign participation, China requires forced technology transfers and imposes discriminatory regulatory processes and burdensome licensing and operating requirements. This results in a highly asymmetric playing field in which U.S. companies face immensely restrictive policies in China, while Chinese companies are not equally restricted in the United States.NOTE: On April 9, 2020, the Executive Branch, led by Team Telecom, recommended that the FCC revoke China Telecom Americas' authorizations to provide international telecom services because of "substantial and serious national security concerns." Senators Portman and Carper applauded the agencies' exercise of their oversight responsibilities and encouraged the FCC to use its enforcement authority to protect U.S. communications networks. On April 24, 2020, the FCC ordered the Chinese carriers to demonstrate why the FCC should not initiate proceedings to revoke the existing authorizations. The FCC is currently considering the carriers' responses and whether to proceed with revocation.- View the complete report here: (http://xitenow.com/browse.php?u=j8p0Fr90wrCsS7E73iQEWONFMPf5r3fkDXzrF8xzLI%2FnsNYwskgFoZPZTYQAHRapPt7BIuKP7cAAGJR4wE1XsvlfytuWNobd14byxSA7NfW9ZfK1SHsDbP%2BKHMhiBSBy5hzhyNAcag%3D%3D&b=5)Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7137631 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: June 10, 2020End of Document

DIRECTOR WRAY DISCUSSES THREAT POSED BY CHINA TO U.S. ECONOMIC AND NATIONAL SECURITY NEWSStates News ServiceJuly 7, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 3859 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the FBI:The Threat Posed by the Chinese Government and the Chinese Communist Party to the Economic and National Security of the United StatesRemarks as delivered.Good morning. I realize it's challenging to put on an event like this under the current circumstances, so I'm grateful to the Hudson Institute for hosting us today.The greatest long-term threat to our nation's information and intellectual property, and to our economic vitality, is the counterintelligence and economic espionage threat from China. It's a threat to our economic securityand by extension, to our national security.As National Security Advisor O'Brien said in his recent remarks, we cannot close our eyes and ears to what China is doingand today, in light of the importance of this threat, I'll provide more detail on the Chinese threat than the FBI has ever presented in an open forum. This threat is so significant that the attorney general and secretary of state will also be addressing a lot of these issues in the next few weeks. But if you think these issues are merely a government problem, or just an intelligence issue, or a nuisance largely just for big corporations who can take care of themselvesyou couldn't be more wrong.FBI Director Christopher Wray discusses the threat China poses to U.S. economic and national security during a July 7, 2020 video event at the Hudson Institute in Washington, D.C.It's the people of the United States who are the victims of what amounts to Chinese theft on a scale so massive that it represents one of the largest transfers of wealth in human history.If you are an American adult, it is more likely than not that China has stolen your personal data.In 2017, the Chinese military conspired to hack Equifax and made off with the sensitive personal information of 150 million Americanswe're talking nearly half of the American population and most American adultsand as I'll discuss in a moment, this was hardly a standalone incident.Our data isn't the only thing at stake hereso are our health, our livelihoods, and our security.We've now reached the point where the FBI is opening a new China-related counterintelligence case about every 10 hours. Of the nearly 5,000 active FBI counterintelligence cases currently under way across the country, almost half are related to China. And at this very moment, China is working to compromise American health care organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and academic institutions conducting essential COVID-19 research.But before I go on, let me be clear: This is not about the Chinese people, and this is certainly not about Chinese Americans. Every year, the United States welcomes more than 100,000 Chinese students and researchers into this country. For generations, people have journeyed from China to the United States to secure the blessings of liberty for themselves and their familiesand our society is better for their contributions. So, when I speak of the threat from China, I mean the government of China and the Chinese Communist Party.The Chinese Regime and the Scope of Its AmbitionsTo understand this threat and how we must act to respond to it, the American people should remember three things.First: We need to be clear-eyed about the scope of the Chinese government's ambition. Chinathe Chinese Communist Partybelieves it is in a generational fight to surpass our country in economic and technological leadership.That is sobering enough. But it's waging this fight not through legitimate innovation, not through fair and lawful competition, and not by giving their citizens the freedom of thought and speech and creativity that we treasure here in the United States. Instead, China is engaged in a whole-of-state effort to become the world's only superpower by any means necessary.A Diverse and Multi-Layered ApproachThe second thing the American people need to understand is that China uses a diverse range of sophisticated techniqueseverything from cyber intrusions to corrupting trusted insiders. They've even engaged in outright physical theft. And they've pioneered an expansive approach to stealing innovation through a wide range of actorsincluding not just Chinese intelligence services, but state-owned enterprises, ostensibly private companies, certain kinds of graduate students and researchers, and a variety of other actors working on their behalf.Economic EspionageTo achieve its goals and surpass America, China recognizes it needs to make leaps in cutting-edge technologies. But the sad fact is that instead of engaging in the hard slog of innovation, China often steals American intellectual property and then uses it to compete against the very American companies it victimized, in effect cheating twice over. They're targeting research on everything from military equipment to wind turbines to rice and corn seeds.Through its talent recruitment programs, like the so-called Thousand Talents Program, the Chinese government tries to entice scientists to secretly bring our knowledge and innovation back to Chinaeven if that means stealing proprietary information or violating our export controls and conflict-of-interest rules.Take the case of scientist Hongjin Tan, for example, a Chinese national and American lawful permanent resident. He applied to China's Thousand Talents Program, stole more than $1 billion worth of trade secrets from his former employer, an Oklahoma-based petroleum company, and got caught. A few months ago, he was convicted and sent to prison.Or there's the case of Shan Shi, a Texas-based scientist, also sentenced to prison earlier this year. Shi stole trade secrets regarding syntactic foam, an important naval technology used in submarines. Shi, too, had applied to China's Thousand Talents Program, and specifically pledged to digest and absorb the relevant technology in the United States. He did this on behalf of Chinese state-owned enterprises, which ultimately planned to put the American company out of business and take over the market.In one of the more galling and egregious aspects of the scheme, the conspirators actually patented in China the very manufacturing process they'd stolen, and then offered their victim American company a joint venture using its own stolen technology. We're talking about an American company that spent years and millions of dollars developing that technology, and China couldn't replicate itso, instead, it paid to have it stolen.And just two weeks ago, Hao Zhang was convicted of economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, and conspiracy for stealing proprietary information about wireless devices from two U.S. companies. One of those companies had spent over 20 years developing the technology Zhang stole.These cases were among more than a thousand investigations the FBI has into China's actual and attempted theft of American technologywhich is to say nothing of over a thousand more ongoing counterintelligence investigations of other kinds related to China. We're conducting these kinds of investigations in all 56 of our field offices. And over the past decade, we've seen economic espionage cases with a link to China increase by approximately 1,300 percent.The stakes could not be higher, and the potential economic harm to American businesses and the economy as a whole almost defies calculation.Clandestine EffortsAs National Security Advisor O'Brien discussed in his June remarks, the Chinese government is also making liberal use of hacking to steal our corporate and personal dataand they're using both military and non-state hackers to do it. The Equifax intrusion I mentioned a moment ago, which led to the indictment of Chinese military personnel, was hardly the only time China stole the sensitive personal information of huge numbers of the American public.For example, did you have health insurance through Anthem or one of its associated insurers? In 2015, China's hackers stole the personal data of 80 million of that company's current and former customers.Or maybe you're a federal employeeor you used to be one, or you applied for a government job once, or a family member or roommate did. Well, in 2014, China's hackers stole more than 21 million records from OPM, the federal government's Office of Personnel Management.Why are they doing this? First, China has made becoming an artificial intelligence world leader a priority, and these kinds of thefts feed right into China's development of artificial intelligence tools.Compounding the threat, the data China stole is of obvious value as they attempt to identify people to target for secret intelligence gathering. On that front, China is also using social media platformsthe same ones Americans use to stay connected or find jobsto identify people with access to our government's sensitive information and then target those people to try to steal it.Just to pick one example, a Chinese intelligence officer posing as a headhunter on a popular social media platform recently offered an American citizen a sizeable sum of money in exchange for consulting services. That sounds benign until you realize those consulting services were related to sensitive information the American target had access to as a U.S. military intelligence specialist.Now that particular tale has a happy ending: The American citizen did the right thing and reported the suspicious contact, and the FBI, working together with our armed forces, took it from there. I wish I could say that all such incidents worked out that way.Threats to AcademiaIt's a troublingly similar story in academia.Through talent recruitment programs like the Thousand Talents Program I mentioned a moment ago, China pays scientists at American universities to secretly bring our knowledge and innovation back to Chinaincluding valuable, federally funded research. To put it bluntly, this means American taxpayers are effectively footing the bill for China's own technological development. China then leverages its ill-gotten gains to undercut U.S. research institutions and companies, blunting our nation's advancement and costing American jobs. And we are seeing more and more of these cases.In May alone, we arrested both Qing Wang, a former researcher with the Cleveland Clinic who worked on molecular medicine and the genetics of cardiovascular disease, and Simon Saw-Teong Ang, a University of Arkansas scientist doing research for NASA. Both were allegedly committing fraud by concealing their participation in Chinese talent recruitment programs while accepting millions of dollars in American federal grant funding.That same month, former Emory University professor Xiao-Jiang Li pled guilty to filing a false tax return for failing to report the income he'd received through China's Thousand Talents Program. Our investigation found that while Li was researching Huntington's disease at Emory, he was also pocketing half a million unreported dollars from China.In a similar vein, Charles Lieber, chair of Harvard's Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, was indicted just last month for making false statements to federal authorities about his Thousand Talents participation. The United States has alleged that Lieber concealed from both Harvard and the NIH his position as a strategic scientist at a Chinese universityand the fact that the Chinese government was paying him, through the Wuhan Institute of Technology, a $50,000 monthly stipend, more than $150,000 in living expenses, and more than $1.5 million to establish a laboratory back in China.Malign Foreign InfluenceThere's more. Another tool China and the Chinese Communist Party use to manipulate Americans is what we call malign foreign influence.Now, traditional foreign influence is a normal, legal diplomatic activity typically conducted through diplomatic channels. But malign foreign influence efforts are subversive, undeclared, criminal, or coercive attempts to sway our government's policies, distort our country's public discourse, and undermine confidence in our democratic processes and values.China is engaged in a highly sophisticated malign foreign influence campaign, and its methods include bribery, blackmail, and covert deals. Chinese diplomats also use both open, naked economic pressure and seemingly independent middlemen to push China's preferences on American officials.Just to take one all-too-common example, let's say China gets wind that an American official is planning to travel to Taiwanthink a governor, a state senator, a member of Congress. China does not want that to happen, because that travel might appear to legitimize Taiwanese independence from Chinaand legitimizing Taiwan would be contrary, of course, to China's One China policy.So what does China do? Well, China has leverage over the American official's constituentsAmerican companies, academics, and members of the media all have legitimate and understandable reasons to want access to Chinese partners and markets. And because of the authoritarian nature of the Chinese Communist Party, China has immense power over those same partners and markets. So, China will sometimes start by trying to influence the American official overtly and directly. China might openly warn that if the American official travels to Taiwan, China will take it out on a company from that official's home state by withholding the company's license to manufacture in China. That could be economically ruinous for the company, would directly pressure the American official to alter his travel plans, and the official would know that China was trying to influence him.That would be bad enough. But the Chinese Communist Party often doesn't stop there; it can't stop there if it wants to stay in powerso it uses its leverage even more perniciously. If China's more direct, overt influence campaign doesn't do the trick, they sometimes turn to indirect, covert, deceptive influence efforts.To continue with the example of the American official with travel plans that the Chinese Communist Party doesn't like, China will work relentlessly to identify the people closest to that officialthe people the official trusts most. China will then work to influence those people to act on China's behalf as middlemen to influence the official. The co-opted middlemen may then whisper in the official's ear and try to sway the official's travel plans or public positions on Chinese policy. These intermediaries of course aren't telling the American official that they're Chinese Communist Party pawnsand worse still, some of these intermediaries may not even realize they're being used as pawns, because they too have been deceived.Ultimately, China doesn't hesitate to use smoke, mirrors, and misdirection to influence Americans.Similarly, China often pushes academics and journalists to self-censor if they want to travel into China. And we've seen the Chinese Communist Party pressure American media and sporting giants to ignore or suppress criticism of China's ambitions regarding Hong Kong or Taiwan. This kind of thing is happening over and over, across the United States.And I'll note that the pandemic has unfortunately not stopped any of thisin fact, we have heard from federal, state, and even local officials that Chinese diplomats are aggressively urging support for China's handling of the COVID-19 crisis. Yes, this is happening at both the federal and state levels. Not that long ago, we had a state senator who was recently asked to even introduce a resolution supporting China's response to the pandemic.The punchline is this: All these seemingly inconsequential pressures add up to a policymaking environment in which Americans find themselves held over a barrel by the Chinese Communist Party.Threats to the Rule of LawAll the while, China's government and Communist Party have brazenly violated well-settled norms and the rule of law.Since 2014, Chinese General Secretary Xi Jinping has spearheaded a program known as Fox Hunt. Now China describes Fox Hunt as an international anti-corruption campaignit's not. Instead, Fox Hunt is a sweeping bid by General Secretary Xi to target Chinese nationals whom he sees as threats and who live outside China, across the world. We're talking about political rivals, dissidents, and critics seeking to expose China's extensive human rights violations.Hundreds of the Fox Hunt victims that they target live right here in the United States, and many are American citizens or green card holders. The Chinese government wants to force them to return to China, and China's tactics to accomplish that are shocking. For instance, when it couldn't locate one Fox Hunt target, the Chinese government sent an emissary to visit the target's family here in the United States. The message they said to pass on? The target had two options: return to China promptly, or commit suicide. And what happens when Fox Hunt targets refuse to return to China? In the past, their family members both here in the United States and in China have been threatened and coerced; and those back in China have even been arrested for leverage.I'll take this opportunity to note that if you believe the Chinese government is targeting youthat you're a potential Fox Hunt victimplease reach out to your local FBI field office.Exploiting Our OpennessUnderstanding how a nation could engage in these tactics brings me to the third thing the American people need to remember: China has a fundamentally different system than oursand it's doing all it can to exploit our openness while taking advantage of its own, closed system.Many of the distinctions that mean a lot in the United States are blurry or almost nonexistent in Chinadistinctions between the government and the Chinese Communist Party, between the civilian and military sectors, and between the state and private industry.For one thing, an awful lot of large Chinese businesses are state-owned enterprisesliterally owned by the government, and thus the Party. And even if they aren't, China's laws allow its government to compel any Chinese company to provide any information it requestsincluding American citizens' data.On top of that, Chinese companies of any real size are legally required to have Communist Party cells inside them to keep them in line. Even more alarmingly, Communist Party cells have reportedly been established in some American companies operating in China as a cost of doing business there.These features should give U.S. companies pause when they consider working with Chinese corporations like Huaweiand should give all Americans pause, too, when relying on such a company's devices and networks. As the world's largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer, Huawei has broad access to much that American companies do in China. It's also been charged in the United States with racketeering conspiracy and has, as alleged in the indictment, repeatedly stolen intellectual property from U.S. companies, obstructed justice, and lied to the U.S. government and its commercial partners, including banks.The allegations are clear: Huawei is a serial intellectual property thief, with a pattern and practice of disregarding both the rule of law and the rights of its victims. I have to tell you, it certainly caught my attention to read a recent article describing the words of Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei, about the company's mindset. At a Huawei research and development center, he reportedly told employees that to ensure the company's survival, they need toand I quotesurge forward, killing as you go, to blaze us a trail of blood. He's also reportedly told employees that Huawei has entered, to quote, a state of war. I certainly hope he couldn't have meant that literally, but it's hardly an encouraging tone, given the company's repeated criminal behavior.In our modern world, there is perhaps no more ominous prospect than a hostile foreign government's ability to compromise our country's infrastructure and devices. If Chinese companies like Huawei are given unfettered access to our telecommunications infrastructure, they could collect any of your information that traverses their devices or networks. Worse still: they'd have no choice but to hand it over to the Chinese government if askedthe privacy and due process protections that are sacrosanct in the United States are simply non-existent in China.Responding Effectively to the ThreatThe Chinese government is engaged in a broad, diverse campaign of theft and malign influence, and it can execute that campaign with authoritarian efficiency. They're calculating. They're persistent. They're patient. And they aren't subject to the righteous constraints of an open, democratic society or the rule of law.China, as led by the Chinese Communist Party, is going to continue to try to misappropriate our ideas, influence our policy makers, manipulate our public opinion, and steal our data. They will use an all-tools and all-sectors approachand that demands our own all-tools and all-sectors approach in response.Our folks at the FBI are working their tails off every day to protect our nation's companies, our universities, our computer networks, and our ideas and innovation. To do that, we're using a broad set of techniquesfrom our traditional law enforcement authorities to our intelligence capabilities.I'll briefly note that we're having real success. With the help of our many foreign partners, we've arrested targets all over the globe. Our investigations and the resulting prosecutions have exposed the tradecraft and techniques the Chinese use, raising awareness of the threat and our industries' defenses. They also show our resolve, and our ability to attribute these crimes to those responsible. It's one thing to make assertionsbut in our justice system, when a person, or a corporation, is investigated and then charged with a crime, we have to prove the truth of the allegation beyond a reasonable doubt. The truth mattersand so, these criminal indictments matter. And we've seen how our criminal indictments have rallied other nations to our causewhich is crucial to persuading the Chinese government to change its behavior.We're also working more closely than ever with partner agencies here in the U.S., and our partners abroad. We can't do it on our own; we need a whole-of-society response. That's why we in the intelligence and law enforcement communities are working harder than ever to give companies, universities, and the American people themselves the information they need to make their own informed decisions and protect their most valuable assets.Confronting this threat effectively does not mean we shouldn't do business with the Chinese. It does not mean we shouldn't host Chinese visitors. It does not mean we shouldn't welcome Chinese students or coexist with China on the world stage. But it does mean that when China violates our criminal laws and international norms, we're not going to tolerate it, much less enable it. The FBI and our partners throughout the U.S. government will hold China accountable and protect our nation's innovation, ideas, and way of lifewith the help and vigilance of the American people.Thank you for having me here today.Load-Date: July 7, 2020End of Document

A.G. Barr Issues Remarks on China Policy at Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum on July 16Targeted News ServiceJuly 16, 2020 Thursday 1:47 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 5548 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: GRAND RAPIDS, Michigan BodyAttorney General William P. Barr issued the following remarks at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum regarding China policy:Thank you, Andrew for that very kind introduction and for the excellent work that you and your team have done in protecting the people of the Western District of Michigan. I would like to thank the leadership and staff of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum -- especially Director Elaine Didier -- for hosting today's event. I'd also like to offer a special thanks to the Ford Presidential Foundation and Executive Director Joe Calvaruso. Even under normal circumstances, hosting an event can be a challenge, but these days, I know it is especially challenging. Thank you for accommodating us. I am also grateful to you, the audience, for honoring me with your presence today.It is a privilege to be here to speak about what may prove to be the most important issue for our nation and the world in the twenty-first century -- that is, the United States' response to the global ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP rules with an iron fist over one of the great ancient civilizations of the world. It seeks to leverage the immense power, productivity, and ingenuity of the Chinese people to overthrow the rules-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship. How the United States responds to this challenge will have historic implications and will determine whether the United States and its liberal democratic allies will continue to shape their own destiny or whether the CCP and its autocratic tributaries will control the future.Several weeks ago, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien spoke about the CCP's ideology and global ambitions. He declared, and I agree, that "[t]he days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People's Republic of China are over."[/1] Last week, FBI Director Chris Wray described how the CCP pursues its ambitions through nefarious and even illegal conduct, including industrial espionage, theft, extortion, cyberattacks, and malign influence activities.[/2] In the coming days, you will hear from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who will sum up what is at stake for the United States and the free world. I hope these speeches will inspire the American people to reevaluate their relationship with China, so long as it continues to be ruled by the Communist Party.It is fitting that we are here today at the Ford Presidential Museum. Gerald Ford served at the highest echelons of our government at the dawn of America's reengagement with the People's Republic of China, which began with President Nixon's historic visit in 1972. Three years later, in 1975, President Ford visited China for a summit with PRC leaders, including Mao Zedong.At the time, it was unthinkable that China would emerge after the Cold War as a near-peer competitor of the United States. Yet even then, there were signs of China's immense latent power. In the joint report of their visit to China in 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and then-Minority Leader Ford wrote: "If she manages to achieve as she aspires, China in the next half century can emerge a self-sufficient power of a billion people .... This last impression--of the reality of China's colossal potential--is perhaps the most vivid of our journey. As our small party traveled through that boundless land, this sense of a giant stirring, a dragon waking, gave us much to ponder."[/3] It is now nearly fifty years later, and the prescient ponderings of these two congressmen have come to pass.Deng Xiaoping, whose economic reforms launched China's remarkable rise, had a famous motto: "hide your strength and bide your time."[/4] That is precisely what China has done. China's economy has quietly grown from about 2 percent of the world's GDP in 1980 to nearly 20 percent today. By some estimates, based on purchasing power parity, the Chinese economy is already larger than ours. The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, who has centralized power to a degree not seen since the dictatorship of Mao Zedong, now speaks openly of China moving "closer to center stage," "building a socialism that is superior to capitalism," and replacing the American Dream with the "Chinese solution."[/5] China is no longer hiding its strength, nor biding its time. From the perspective of its communist rulers, China's time has arrived.The People's Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg--an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world's preeminent superpower. A centerpiece of this effort is the Communist Party's "Made in China 2025" initiative, a plan for PRC domination of high-tech industries like robotics, advanced information technology, aviation, and electric vehicles. Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, this initiative poses a real threat to U.S. technological leadership. Despite World Trade Organization rules prohibiting quotas for domestic output, "Made in China 2025" sets targets for domestic market share (sometimes as high as 70 percent) in core components and basic materials for industries such as robotics and telecommunications. It is clear that the PRC seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies, but to replace them altogether."Made in China 2025" is the latest iteration of the PRC's state-led, mercantilist economic model. For American companies in the global marketplace, free and fair competition with China has long been a fantasy. To tilt the playing field to its advantage, China's communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics: currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisitions, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks, and espionage. About 80% of all federal economic espionage prosecutions have alleged conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and about 60% of all trade secret theft cases have had a nexus to China.The PRC also seeks to dominate key trade routes and infrastructure in Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific. In the South China Sea, for example, through which about one-third of the world's maritime trade passes, the PRC has asserted expansive and historically dubious claims to nearly the entire waterway, flouted the rulings of international courts, built artificial islands and placed military outposts on them, and harassed its neighbors' ships and fishing boats.Another ambitious project to spread its power and influence is the PRC's "Belt and Road" infrastructure initiative. Although billed as "foreign aid," in fact these investments appear designed to serve the PRC's strategic interests and domestic economic needs. For example, the PRC has been criticized for loading poor countries up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms, and then taking control of the infrastructure itself, as it did with the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota in 2017. This is little more than a form of modern-day colonialism.Just as consequential, however, are the PRC's plans to dominate the world's digital infrastructure through its "Digital Silk Road" initiative. I have previously spoken at length about the grave risks of allowing the world's most powerful dictatorship to build the next generation of global telecommunications networks, known as 5G. Perhaps less widely known are the PRC's efforts to surpass the United States in other cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence. Through innovations such as machine learning and big data, artificial intelligence allows machines to mimic human functions, such as recognizing faces, interpreting spoken words, driving vehicles, and playing games of skill such as chess or the even more complex Chinese strategy game Go. AI long ago outmatched the world's chess grandmasters. But the PRC's interest in AI accelerated in 2016, when AlphaGo, a program developed by a subsidiary of Google, beat the world champion Go player at a match in South Korea. The following year, Beijing unveiled its "Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan," a blueprint for leading the world in AI by 2030. Whichever nation emerges as the global leader in AI will be best positioned to unlock not only its considerable economic potential, but a range of military applications, such as the use of computer vision to gather intelligence.The PRC's drive for technological supremacy is complemented by its plan to monopolize rare earth materials, which play a vital role in industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware. According to the Congressional Research Service, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States led the world in rare earth production.[/6] "Since then, production has shifted almost entirely to China," in large part due to lower labor costs and lighter environmental regulation.[/7]The United States is now dangerously dependent on the PRC for these materials. Overall, China is America's top supplier, accounting for about 80 percent of our imports. The risks of dependence are real. In 2010, for example, Beijing cut exports of rare earth materials to Japan after an incident involving disputed islands in the East China Sea. The PRC could do the same to us.As China's progress in these critical sectors illustrates, the PRC's predatory economic policies are succeeding. For a hundred years, America was the world's largest manufacturer -- allowing us to serve as the world's "arsenal of democracy." China overtook the United States in manufacturing output in 2010. The PRC is now the world's "arsenal of dictatorship."How did China accomplish all this? No one should underestimate the ingenuity and industry of the Chinese people. At the same time, no one should doubt that America made China's meteoric rise possible. China has reaped enormous benefits from the free flow of American aid and trade. In 1980, Congress granted the PRC most-favored-nation trading status. In the 1990s, American companies strongly supported the PRC's accession to the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade relations. Today, U.S.-China trade totals about $700 billion.Last year, Newsweek ran a cover story titled "How America's Biggest Companies Made China Great Again."[/8] The article details how China's communist leaders lured American business with the promise of market access, and then, having profited from American investment and know-how, turned increasingly hostile. The PRC used tariffs and quotas to pressure American companies to give up their technology and form joint ventures with Chinese companies. Regulators then discriminated against American firms, using tactics like holding up permits. Yet few companies, even Fortune 500 giants, have been willing to bring a formal trade complaint for fear of angering Beijing.Just as American companies have become dependent on the Chinese market, the United States as a whole now relies on the PRC for many vital goods and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown a spotlight on that dependency. For example, China is the world's largest producer of certain protective equipment, such as face masks and medical gowns. In March, as the pandemic spread around the world, the PRC hoarded the masks for itself, blocking producers -- including American companies -- from exporting them to countries in need. It then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, shipping limited quantities of often defective equipment and requiring foreign leaders to publicly thank Beijing.China's dominance of the world market for medical goods goes beyond masks and gowns. It has become the United States' largest supplier of medical devices, while at the same time discriminating against American medical companies in China. China's government has targeted foreign firms for greater regulatory scrutiny, instructed Chinese hospitals to buy products made in China, and pressured American firms to build factories in China, where their intellectual property is more vulnerable to theft. As one expert has observed, American medical device manufacturers are effectively "creating their own competitors."[/9]America also depends on Chinese supply chains in other vital sectors, especially pharmaceuticals. America remains the global leader in drug discovery, but China is now the world's largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, known as "APIs." As one Defense Health Agency official noted, "[s]hould China decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs to the [United States]," it "could result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses."[/10]To achieve dominance in pharmaceuticals, China's rulers went to the same playbook they used to gut other American industries. In 2008, the PRC designated pharmaceutical production as a "high-value-added-industry" and boosted Chinese companies with subsidies and export tax rebates.[/11] Meanwhile, the PRC has systematically preyed on American companies. American firms face well-known obstacles in China's health market, including drug approval delays, unfair pricing limitations, IP theft, and counterfeiting. Chinese nationals working as employees at pharma companies have been caught stealing trade secrets both in America and in China. And the CCP has long engaged in cyber-espionage and hacking of U.S. academic medical centers and healthcare companies.In fact, PRC-linked hackers have targeted American universities and firms in a bid to steal IP related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines, sometimes disrupting the work of our researchers. Having been caught covering up the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing is desperate for a public relations coup, and may hope that it will be able to claim credit for any medical breakthroughs.As all of these examples should make clear, the ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards. But in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you. As a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report put it, "[t]he belief by foreign companies that large financial investments, the sharing of expertise and significant technology transfers would lead to an ever opening China market is being replaced by boardroom banter that win-win in China means China wins twice."[/12]Although Americans hoped that trade and investment would liberalize China's political system, the fundamental character of the regime has never changed. As its ruthless crackdown of Hong Kong demonstrates once again, China is no closer to democracy today than it was in 1989 when tanks confronted pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. It remains an authoritarian, one-party state in which the Communist Party wields absolute power, unchecked by popular elections, the rule of law, or an independent judiciary. The CCP surveils its own people and assigns them social credit scores, employs an army of government censors, tortures dissidents, and persecutes religious and ethnic minorities, including a million Uighurs detained in indoctrination and labor camps.If what happened in China stayed in China, that would all be bad enough. But instead of America changing China, China is leveraging its economic power to change America. As this Administration's China Strategy recognizes, "the CCP's campaign to compel ideological conformity does not stop at China's borders."[/13] Rather, the CCP seeks to extend its influence around the world, including on American soil.All too often, for the sake of short-term profits, American companies have succumbed to that influence--even at the expense of freedom and openness in the United States. Sadly, examples of American business bowing to Beijing are legion.Take Hollywood. Hollywood actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit. And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood's ideals of social justice. But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world's most powerful violator of human rights. This censorship infects not only versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in American theaters to American audiences.For example, the hit movie World War Z depicts a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus. The original version of the film reportedly contained a scene with characters speculating that the virus may have originated in China. (In the novel, Patient Zero is a boy from Chongqing.) But the studio, Paramount Pictures, reportedly told producers to delete the reference to China in the hope of landing a Chinese distribution deal. The deal never materialized.In the Marvel Studios blockbuster Dr. Strange, filmmakers changed the nationality of a major character known as the "Ancient One," a Tibetan monk in the comic books, from Tibetan to Celtic. When challenged about this, a screenwriter explained that "if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he's Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people."[/14] Or, he continued, the Chinese government might say "[w]e're not going to show your movie because you decided to get political."[/15]These are just two examples of the many Hollywood films that have been altered, one way or another, to conform to CCP propaganda. National Security Advisor O'Brien offered even more examples in his remarks. But many more scripts likely never see the light of day, because writers and producers know not to even test the limits. Chinese government censors don't need to say a word, because Hollywood is doing their work for them. This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party.The story of the film industry's submission to the CCP is a familiar one. In the past two decades, China has emerged as the world's largest box office. The CCP has long tightly controlled access to that lucrative market--both through quotas on American films, imposed in violation of China's WTO obligations, and a strict censorship regime. Increasingly, Hollywood also relies on Chinese money for financing. In 2018, films with Chinese investors accounted for 20 percent of U.S. box-office ticket sales, compared to only 3.8 percent five years earlier.But in the long run, as with other American industries, the PRC may be less interested in cooperating with Hollywood than co-opting Hollywood--and eventually replacing it with its own homegrown productions. To accomplish this, the CCP has been following its usual modus operandi. By imposing a quota on American films, the CCP pressures Hollywood studios to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, who then gain access to U.S. technology and know-how. As one Chinese film executive recently put it, "[e]verything we learned, we learned from Hollywood."[/16] Notably, in 2019, eight of the 10 top-grossing films in China were produced in China.Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC. America's big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence.In the year 2000, when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton hailed the new century as one in which "liberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem."[/17] Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies such as Cisco helped the Communist Party build the Great Firewall of China--the world's most sophisticated system for Internet surveillance and censorship.Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP. For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China, after the Chinese government complained about coverage of the Hong Kong democracy protests. Apple also removed apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the Great Firewall, and eliminated pro-democracy songs from its Chinese music store. Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, despite concerns that the move would give the CCP easier access to e-mails, text messages, and other user information stored in the cloud.The CCP has long used public threats of retaliation and barred market access to exert influence. More recently, however, the CCP has also stepped up behind-the-scenes efforts to cultivate and coerce American business executives to further its political objectives -- efforts that are all the more pernicious because they are largely hidden from public view.As China's government loses credibility around the world, the Department of Justice has seen more and more PRC officials and their proxies reaching out to corporate leaders and inveighing them to favor policies and actions favored by the Chinese Communist Party. Their objective varies, but their pitch is generally the same: the businessperson has economic interests in China, and there is a suggestion that things will go better (or worse) for them depending on their response to the PRC's request. Privately pressuring or courting American corporate leaders to promote policies (or politicians) presents a significant threat, because hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence and put a "friendly face" on pro-regime policies. The legislator or policymaker who hears from a fellow American is properly more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner. And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result, if its lobbying were exposed.America's corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists. You might think, for example, that cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship is just part of the "guanxi" -- or system of influential social networks--necessary to do business with the PRC. But you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act. FARA does not prohibit any speech or conduct. But it does require those who are acting as the "agents" of foreign principals to publicly disclose that relationship and their political or other similar activities by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating its credibility.[/18]These requirements are designed not to stifle your rights to free expression, which are protected by the First Amendment, but rather to ensure that the American public and their legislators can discern what or who is the true source of speech on matters of public concern.By focusing on American business leaders, of course, I don't mean to suggest that they are the only targets of Chinese influence operations. The Chinese Communist Party also seeks to infiltrate, censor, or co-opt American academic and research institutions. For example, dozens of American universities host Chinese government-funded "Confucius Institutes," which have been accused of pressuring host universities to silence discussion or cancel events on topics considered controversial by Beijing. Universities must stand up for each other; refuse to let the CCP dictate research efforts or suppress diverse voices; support colleagues and students who wish to speak their minds; and consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the price of appeasing the CCP's demands.In a globalized world, American corporations and universities alike may view themselves as global citizens, rather than American institutions. But they should remember that what allowed them to succeed in the first place was the American free enterprise system, the rule of law, and the security afforded by America's economic, technological, and military strength.Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom. A world marching to the beat of Communist China's drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas.There was a time American companies understood that. They saw themselves as American and proudly defended American values.In World War II, for example, the iconic American company, Disney, made dozens of public information films for the government, including training videos to educate American sailors on navigation tactics. During the war, over 90 percent of Disney employees were devoted to the production of training and public information films. To boost the morale of America's troops, Disney also designed insignia that appeared on planes, trucks, flight jackets, and other military equipment used by American and Allied forces.I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day. When Disney produced Kundun, the 1997 film about the PRC's oppression of the Dalai Lama, the CCP objected to the project and pressured Disney to abandon it. Ultimately, Disney decided that it couldn't let a foreign power dictate whether it would distribute a movie in the United States.But that moment of courage wouldn't last long. After the CCP banned all Disney films in China, the company lobbied hard to regain access. The CEO apologized for Kundun, calling it a "stupid mistake."[/19] Disney then began courting the PRC to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai. As part of that deal, Disney agreed to give Chinese government officials a role in management. Of the park's 11,000 full-time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party. They reportedly display hammer-and-sickle insignia at their desks and attend Party lectures during business hours.Like other American companies, Disney may eventually learn the hard way the cost of compromising its principles. Soon after Disney opened its park in Shanghai, a Chinese-owned theme park popped up a couple hundred miles away featuring characters that, according to news reports, looked suspiciously like Snow White and other Disney trademarks.American companies must understand the stakes. The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarterly earnings report. But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive.During the Cold War, Lewis Powell -- later Justice Powell -- sent an important memorandum to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He noted that the free enterprise system was under unprecedented attack, and urged American companies to do more to preserve it. "[T]he time has come," he said, "indeed, it is long overdue--for the wisdom, ingenuity and resources of American business to be marshaled against those who would destroy it."[/20]So too today. The American people are more attuned than ever to the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses not only to our way of life, but to our very lives and livelihoods. And they will increasingly call out corporate appeasement.If individual companies are afraid to make a stand, there is strength in numbers. As Justice Powell wrote: "Strength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations."[/21] Despite years of acquiescence to communist authorities in China, American tech companies may finally be finding their courage through collective action. Following the recent imposition of the PRC's draconian national security law in Hong Kong, many big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zoom, and LinkedIn, reportedly announced that they would temporarily suspend compliance with governmental requests for user data. True to form, communist officials have threatened imprisonment for noncompliant company employees. We will see if these companies hold firm. I hope they do. If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party's corrupt and dictatorial rule.The CCP has launched an orchestrated campaign, across all of its many tentacles in Chinese government and society, to exploit the openness of our institutions in order to destroy them. To secure a world of freedom and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, the free world will need its own version of the whole-of-society approach, in which the public and private sectors maintain their essential separation but work together collaboratively to resist domination and to win the contest for the commanding heights of the global economy. America has done that before. If we rekindle our love and devotion for our country and each other, I am confident that we--the American people, American government, and American business together--can do it again. Our freedom depends on it.[1/] Robert C.

THUNE: COUNTRIES SHOULD ABANDON 5G INFRASTRUCTURE MADE BY COMPANIES BEHOLDEN TO CHINESE GOVERNMENTStates News ServiceJune 3, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1660 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by South Dakota Senator John Thune:U.S. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), chairman of the Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet, today discussed his Network Security Trade Act, legislation that would make telecommunications security a key objective when negotiating future trade deals. Thune also discussed how the COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed China's lack of transparency, which underscores the need to make sure that countries around the world abandon 5G infrastructure made by companies beholden to the Chinese government. Huawei, a Chinese government-supported company, is currently one of the biggest suppliers of 5G equipment worldwide.Click here or on the picture above to watch Thune's speech.Excerpt of Thune's remarks below:"Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago, I came down to the floor to talk about how coronavirus has highlighted the importance of strong internet networks."Despite the surge in internet traffic coronavirus has produced with Americans using the internet for everything from work to school to family dinners U.S. networks have held up tremendously well."Americans have been able to enjoy the same speed and streaming quality they typically enjoy something that hasn't happened in a lot of other countries."And that's a direct result of the United States' light-touch approach to internet regulation, which has encouraged American companies to invest in the latest communications infrastructure and new technologies to make more efficient use of spectrum."Our nation is currently preparing for the widespread adoption of the next generation of internet technology 5G."We need to make sure that our 5G networks will be as strong as our current networks."But we still have some work to do to get to that point."I've frequently come down here to the floor to discuss that work which includes paving the way for the widespread installation of the "small cells" necessary for 5G networks, enhancing the availability of the mid-band spectrum necessary for 5G deployment, and investing in a 5G workforce."But there's also another aspect we need to think about when it comes to 5G, which is sometimes not talked about as much."And that is network security."With its incredible speed and connectivity, 5G will usher in a new era of innovation."Advances in medical care, the large-scale deployment of precision agriculture, safer transportation technologies ... 5G will bring all of these things, and more."But like any new technology, 5G networks will present new risks and vulnerabilities."And because 5G will mean a vastly greater number of connected devices, the risks with 5G will be greater."That's why an essential part of deploying 5G networks has to be looking at how we can mitigate security risks."We need to ensure that the component parts of our devices and, critically, the component parts of telecommunications networks, like cell towers and the small cells that will be required for 5G are secure."And a primary way to do that is by ensuring that 5G equipment comes from trusted vendors."Currently, one of the biggest suppliers of 5G equipment worldwide is a Chinese company Huawei which is supported by the Chinese government."China's 2017 National Intelligence Law requires Chinese companies to support the Chinese government's intelligence activities."And American security officials have raised concerns that much of Huawei's equipment is built with "backdoors" giving the Chinese government access to global communications networks."Mr. President, I don't need to tell anyone that we should be wary of China's motives, and that China's interests are frequently opposed to those of the United States."China's handling of the coronavirus is a striking current example of the Chinese government prioritizing its own interests or pride over the public good."As a New York Times article noted in February, "The [Chinese] government's initial handling of the epidemic allowed the virus to gain a tenacious hold. At critical moments, officials chose to put secrecy and order ahead of openly confronting the growing crisis to avoid public alarm and political embarrassment.""Whether it was driven by the hubris of the Communist Party, or merely the callous indifference the communist state has for the wellbeing of its own citizens, China was not transparent about the grave danger of COVID-19."It failed to release accurate information about the nature and spread of the virus."And it took active steps to make sure the truth did not get out in other ways."Whistleblowers were punished, dissenters were censored, and journalists were expelled."And despite the fact that its negligence undoubtedly contributed to the global spread of COVID-19, China still continues to be less than forthcoming about the virus."Unfortunately, this is run-of-the-mill governing in China, as we saw with the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s and as we have seen in many other instances."And not content with its role in aggravating the spread of coronavirus, the Chinese Communist Party has also taken advantage of the pandemic to strip Hong Kong of its autonomy and freedom."China's hope is that our nation is too preoccupied with this pandemic to notice its efforts to undermine what should be Hong Kong's autonomy under the one state, two systems construct."But we have noticed."And as many of my colleagues and I have expressed, we stand with Hong Kong."And we must carefully consider an appropriate response one that will rebuke the Communist Party of China, without negatively affecting the people of Hong Kong, their wellbeing, and their democratic aspirations."Mr. President, we didn't need COVID-19 or China's recent actions in Hong Kong to know that giving the Chinese government a backdoor into American communications networks is a bad idea."But it certainly underscores the need to make sure that 5G infrastructure is not made by companies beholden to the Chinese government."The United States has taken a number of steps to prevent equipment from Huawei and another suspect Chinese company, ZTE, from being used in U.S. communications networks."But these companies still pose a risk to the U.S."For starters, some U.S. broadband providers often in rural areas still have equipment from Huawei and ZTE in their communications networks."And a number of our allies and trade partners entities with whom we regularly share information, including sensitive national security information have used or are using technology from Huawei and ZTE."So what can we do?"Well, an initiative is already underway to replace suspect telecommunications components in U.S. networks with hardware from trusted companies."In March, the president signed legislation developed by Commerce Committee Chairman Roger Wicker the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act to help speed up this process."This legislation, which I co-sponsored, will help small telecommunications providers with the cost of replacing network components that pose a security risk."Also in March, I introduced legislation to help address the other part of the problem the use of Huawei technology by our allies and trading partners."We regularly exchange information, including sensitive national security information, with our allies and trading partners, and this information can only be secure if networks on both ends are secure."That's why the U.S. has called for other countries to reject telecommunications technology from Huawei and ZTE."A number of countries have committed to using trusted companies to build out their telecommunications networks."But other countries are still planning to make use of Huawei's technology."My legislation, the Network Security Trade Act, would make telecommunications security a key objective when negotiating future trade deals."We should be using trade agreements to push for enhanced network security globally which would benefit not only our country but every country with which we do business."We recently opened negotiations on a new trade deal with the United Kingdom, which has been using Huawei technology to build its 5G networks."I'm pleased that it now looks like the UK is reconsidering its use of Huawei components."I hope they'll decide to reject this suspect technology."And I hope trade negotiators will emphasize the importance of using trusted companies to build out the UK's telecommunications networks."The security of our communications with our trading partners and allies particularly close allies like Britain needs to be a priority."Mr. President, as we move forward into the 5G future, we need to make sure that our technological advancements are matched with advancements in network security."And that starts with keeping Huawei and other suspect technology out of our networks and, if at all possible, out of the networks of our allies."I will continue to do everything I can to ensure that we have not only the infrastructure but the security needed to keep American networks at the forefront of the telecommunications revolution."Mr. President, before I close, let me just say one more word about China."As I said earlier, China's coronavirus deception is undoubtedly partly responsible for the fact that this virus has now spread to every corner of the world."And China's recent actions with regard to Hong Kong underscore the hostility of the Chinese government to the values freedom-loving countries hold dear."China has a lot of work to do if it ever hopes to rebuild trust with other nations."At a bare minimum, we expect China to uphold its recent trade commitments, which are critical to America's hard-hit farmers and ranchers."I will be looking and our entire government will be looking to see if China's word on trade agreements can be relied on."I hope the Chinese government will live up to its commitments."Mr. President, I yield the floor."Click play to view the video or

ON SENATE FLOOR, PORTMAN HIGHLIGHTS NATIONAL SECURITY THREATS POSED BY CHINA AND UPCOMING BIPARTISAN SAFEGUARDING AMERICAN INNOVATION ACTStates News ServiceJune 18, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 4444 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Ohio Senator Rob Portman:Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman, as chair of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), highlighted various PSI investigations that he has led that have shown China's pervasive national security threats. Portman also discussed his upcoming bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act, legislation that will crack down on the theft of intellectual property at federally funded research institutions and universities by China and America's global competitors. Portman led a year-long investigation into this issue culminating in a bipartisan report and hearing that detailed how American taxpayers have been unwittingly funding the rise of China's military and economy over the last two decades while federal agencies have done little to stop it. Starting in the late 1990s through its "talent recruitment programs", China began recruiting U.S.-based scientists and researchers to transfer U.S. taxpayer-funded IP to China for their own economic and military gain. This legislation is the product of that investigation and will ensure that the federal government is taking decisive action to safeguard American innovation.This legislation also addresses the findings of PSI's February 2019 report, which highlighted the Department of Education's lack of enforcement of foreign gift reporting at U.S. colleges and universities, which the department admitted was "historically lax." This bill gives the department increased authority to enforce foreign gift reporting rules and lowers the reporting threshold to increase transparency and prevent foreign interference on U.S. campuses.In addition, Portman discussed PSI's bipartisan investigation and report detailing how the federal government provided little-to-no oversight of Chinese state-owned telecommunications carriers operating in the United States for nearly twenty years. As demonstrated in recent PSI investigations, China routinely exploits the American education and scientific research sectors to further its national interest and engages in cyber-attacks against U.S. companies, like Equifax and Marriott. This PSI investigation revealed how the telecommunications industry has been similarly targeted. The Subcommittee's year-long investigation found that the FCC and "Team Telecom" an informal group comprised of officials from the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and Defense have failed to monitor three Chinese government-owned carriers -- China Telecom Americas, China Unicom Americas, and ComNet USA -- that have been operating in the United States since the early 2000s. The Subcommittee also found that Team Telecom had no oversight of or interaction with China Unicom Americas since the FCC authorized it to provide international telecom services in 2002.A transcript of his remarks can be found below and a video can be found here:"I'm here on the floor this evening to talk about China and to talk about how we can have a better relationship with China, one that's fair and equitable. I'm going to talk specifically about some of the investigations and reports that we have worked on here in the United States Congress over the past couple of years. I'm going to be talking about four specific reports that came out of what's called the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. I chair that Subcommittee. It's under the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and it's a committee that takes these investigations seriously. We do a fair, objective, thorough job. All of our investigations are bipartisan.And I'm going to talk a little about why these investigations that we have done have led me to the conclusion that we need to do much more here in this country to be able to respond to China and to be able to have the kind of fair and equitable relationship that we should all desire."A lot of China critics talk about the fact that China needs to do things differently, and I don't disagree with most of that. But the reality is there's much we can do right here in this country to create a situation where we do not have the issues that I'll talk about tonight, some of the unfair activities that have occurred here in this country. Frankly, I think we've been naive and not properly prepared. And I'll talk about some legislation that we are proposing tomorrow morning which focuses on how to make America more effective at pushing back against a specific threat to our research and our intellectual property. Our goal is not to have China as an enemy. Our goal is to have China actually as a strategic partner, where there is a fair and equitable and sustainable relationship. But it's going to require some changes, and again, I'm going to focus tonight on some changes we need to make right here, changes within our control. Our investigations have been thorough and fact-driven. And our reports have been objective, bipartisan, and eye-opening. And I encourage you to go on the PSI website, https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/subcommittees/investigations and check it out."Our first report was in February of 2019. It detailed a lack of transparency and reciprocity, among other concerns, with the Confucius Institutes that China here operates in this country. These Confucius Institutes are at our colleges and universities. Some people are aware of that and some may not be aware they're also at our elementary schools, middle schools and high schools. Our reports showed how these Confucius Institutes have been a tool to stifle academic freedom where they are located, toeing the Chinese Communist Party line on sensitive issues like Tibet or Taiwan or the Uighurs or Tiananmen Square. And, by the way, when I talk about China tonight, I hope people realize I'm not talking about the Chinese people. I'm talking about the Chinese government and, therefore, I'm talking about the Chinese Communist Party. And as an example with regard to the Confucius Institutes which are spread around this country, ultimately they report to a branch of the Chinese government that is involved with spreading propaganda, positive propaganda about China, ultimately controlled by who? The Chinese Communist Party. So I hope the comments I make tonight will not be viewed as comments that are regarding the Chinese people as much as a small group in China, the Chinese Communist Party that, with regard to the Confucius Institutes and other approaches they have taken to the United States, have led to these issues."By the way, thanks to our report and the broader scrutiny that followed about the lack of academic freedom and the fact that history is taught a certain way in the Confucius Institutes -- also by the way, we pointed out that the Chinese language is taught, and that's a good thing to have this intercultural dialogue and the opportunity for people to learn more about China -- but it needs to be, again, an understanding and a history of China that is fair and honest and that does include discussions of what happened in Tiananmen Square or what's happening today with regard to the Uighurs, a minority group in China that's being oppressed. In the year that followed our scrutiny, so really in the last year and a few months, 23 of the roughly 100 Confucius Institutes on college campuses in America have closed and others have made some positive changes as to how they operate. So I believe our report made a significant difference in terms of how we relate to the Confucius Institutes."I said earlier that one of my concerns about the Confucius Institutes is the lack of reciprocity. When our State Department has attempted to set up something comparable on Chinese university campuses, they're unable to do so. In fact, whereas the Confucius Institute employees and members of the Chinese government are able to come on our college campuses, we are told that U.S. government officials, and for that matter, private citizens cannot go on Chinese campuses without a minder, somebody to be there to monitor what they're doing, and that sometimes they're not permitted to go at all. So that goes to the lack of reciprocity. But my goal really is again to talk tonight about what we can do here, and I would urge those tonight who are watching, who are connected with the colleges and universities that still have a Confucius Institute, or a high school or middle school or elementary school, check it out, check out our report where we have many instances of where the students, American students, who are learning there are not getting the full story. That may not be true in the case of all Confucius Institutes, but I would recommend that you do the research yourself."Then in March of 2019, after the Confucius Institute report, we reported into the Equifax data breach here in America. We showed how China has targeted private U.S. companies and stolen the information of millions of Americans. In the Equifax data breach of 2017 which we studied, which is one of the largest in history, the personal information of 147 million Americans was stolen by IP addresses originating in China. So we should just be aware of that, and we should take precautions here and protections and encryptions and security measures here to avoid it. Again, this is about us doing more here in this country to be prepared for the reality of the 21st century."Then in November of last year, we released another eye-opening report, this one detailing the rampant theft of U.S. taxpayer-funded research and intellectual property by China by way of their so-called talent recruitment programs, meaning they systematically find promising researchers doing work on research that China is interested in, and they recruit them. These programs have not been subtle. The Thousand Talents Plan is the most understood of these programs, although there are a couple hundred others. But we showed in studying the Thousand Talents Plan how this problem has been ongoing for two decades in this country, and much of what through this program China has taken from our labs and taken to China has gone directly toward fueling the rise of the Chinese economy and the Chinese military. Again, this is about China but it's really about us."How have we let this happen? Specifically, we found that the Chinese government has targeted this promising U.S.-based research and researchers. Often this research is funded by U.S. taxpayers. We spend as taxpayers $150 billion a year on research to places like the National Institutes of Health or the National Science Foundation or the Department of Energy for basic science research. It's been a good investment because we have discovered through some of these investments cures to cancer and particular kinds of cancer and technologies that have helped our military. But it's not good if the U.S. taxpayer is paying for this research and then China is taking it. China has not just taken some of this research funded by U.S. taxpayers, but they have paid these grant recipients to take their research over to China at Chinese universities, again, universities affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party. This is not about the people of China. This is about the Chinese Communist Party. They have been very clever. They want to make sure that China is a stronger competitor against us and so they take the research delivered from the United States to a lab in China where they try to replicate the research, provide the money to these researchers."Just last week we released a fourth PSI report that shows that this problem of China not playing by the rules extends to the telecommunications space as well. Let me explain that situation, and then I'll go back to the Thousand Talents Program. You may remember that in May of last year the FCC prohibited a company called China Mobile, and their U.S. subsidiary from providing telecom services from the United States on the grounds that doing so was jeopardizing our national security, the first time such a ruling had been issued. The fact that this was only the first time that a foreign telecommunications company had been denied approval to operate in the U.S. on national security grounds prompted us to investigate other Chinese state-owned carriers that were already authorized to operate in the United States, and we asked an important question -- why was China Mobile USA any different than these other three Chinese companies? We discovered in our report, which, again, we issued just a month ago, that it wasn't different."We conducted a year-long investigation into the government processes for reviewing, approving, and monitoring Chinese state-owned telecommunications firms operating here in the United States, and we found once again over the years that the federal government had been lax when it comes to securing our telecommunications networks against risks posed by Chinese state-owned carriers. Again, it's what we can do here in this country that we haven't done. In fact, three Chinese state-owned carriers have been operating in the U.S. for nearly 20 years, but it's only been in recent years that the FCC, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security have focused on the potential risks these firms bring when they operate in the United States. What we didn't know 20 years ago, we do know today. And we should use that information to protect ourselves."We now know that the Chinese government views telecommunications as a strategic industry and has expended significant resources to create and promote new business opportunities for its state-owned carriers. We also learned in our investigation and said in our report that Chinese state-owned telecommunications carriers are, 'Subject to exploitation, influence, and control by the Chinese government and can be used in the Chinese government's cyber and economic espionage efforts aimed at the United States.' This isn't a surprise. We have seen this time and time again, that the Chinese government targets the United States through cyber and economic espionage activities and enlists its state-owned entities in these efforts. The Chinese telecommunications firms have been part of our U.S. telecommunications industry as a result. And of course, that's critical to our everyday life. Its services from cellular networks to broadband internet connections, helps break down barriers between people, nations, and continents. That's good. It's helped our economy and the economies of many other countries grow immensely -- we all benefit when telecommunications are global. It makes sense then that our federal government has tasked the FCC with ensuring that foreign telecommunications companies can establish a foothold in the United States, but only if it's done in a fair and a safe manner. Again, what we've learned is that the FCC and other federal agencies have been slow to respond to the national security threats these telecom companies can pose in terms of cybersecurity and economic espionage."As we detail in our report, the FCC, which lacks the national security and law enforcement expertise required to assess these risks, has turned to other executive branch agencies to assess them. Specifically, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense, a group commonly known as the Team Telecom. But Team Telecom was an informal arrangement and has lacked formal authority to operate, making it overall an ineffective solution to assessing these risks. The informality has resulted in protracted review periods and a process FCC commissioners have described as broken and an inextricable black hole that provided, 'No clarity for the future.' For example, Team Telecom's review of China Mobile USA's application lasted for seven years. This points to a troubling trend we have found in all of these reports -- how, frankly, our government and our institutions over a space of time, the last couple of decades, have permitted China to take advantage of lax U.S. oversight, be it on our college campuses, our research labs, or in cyberspace."At our PSI hearing on the Thousand Talents report, the FBI witness before us acknowledged as much, saying, and I quote, 'With our present-day knowledge of the threat from Chinese talent plans, we wish we had taken more rapid and comprehensive action in the past, and the time to make up for that is now.' That's our own Federal Bureau of Investigation. Again, we wish we had taken more rapid and comprehensive action in the past. They don't say that often, but it's true, and I commend them for saying it and the hearing, and for starting to make up for it now, because they have made a number of arrests just in the past few months with regard to the talents program. It's my hope that the PSI has opened the eyes of the government to the systemic problems. And I think that's what we have seen in the Trump Administration is they have taken a firmer stance to the Chinese government in every one of the four areas I have talked about."As PSI was nearing the end of its telecoms investigation, for example, the responsible federal agencies announced that they would review whether these Chinese state-owned carriers we were studying should continue to operate in the U.S., given the national security threats. The Trump Administration also recently issued an executive order to establish Team Telecom as a formal committee, which is a good idea, as well as addressing many of the issues the Subcommittee report identified in Team Telecom's processes. Again, these are good steps, and I'm pleased to say that they were prompted by the thorough and again objective, nonpartisan inquiry that we made through PSI. These four investigations combined show us that China, frankly -- and again, the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party, not the people of China -- is not going to play by the rules unless we require it. Until we start to clean up our own house and take a firmer stance on foreign influence here in this country, we're not going to see much improvement."Rather than pointing the finger at China, we ought to be looking at our own government and our own institutions and doing a better job here. Along those lines, I found it interesting that just last week, 54 NIH-funded researchers nationwide have resigned or been fired because they had been found to be hiding their ties to foreign research institutions as part of an NIH investigation into this problem. So, again, after our PSI investigation, talking about how the Thousand Talents Program and other programs work, there are now 54 people just last week who have been fired or have resigned. Of the cases NIH has studied, 70 percent of the researchers failed to disclose foreign grant funding while more than half failed to disclose participation in foreign talent programs like Thousand Talents. By the way, the FBI just recently warned universities across the country that China may be attempting to steal our research on the coronavirus. Therapies, antiviral therapies, vaccines, other research. So this problem is ongoing. I think in a fair and straightforward manner, we have got to insist that there be a level playing field. We've got to insist that there be fairness and accountability. Again, in an objective manner and a straightforward manner."At the same time, our law enforcement officials and other federal entities that are working to hold China accountable are limited in the actions they can take. That's part of cleaning up our own house. We need to make some changes around here, including in our laws, which has to come through this body. In the case of the Thousand Talents Plan, we have seen the first-ever arrest related to Thousand Talents recently. They followed our investigation, our report, and our hearings. We even saw it in my home state of Ohio. All of the arrests in connection with the Thousand Talents plan, by the way, have been related to peripheral financial crimes like wire fraud and tax evasion, not the core issue of the conflict of commitment, the taking of American taxpayer-paid research. Why? Because amazingly, it's not currently a crime to fail to disclose foreign funding of the same research on federal grant applications. In other words, if you are doing research and paid by the taxpayer of the United States to do the research and also being paid by China to do the same research and to have that research go to China, you don't have to disclose that under law. So these arrests that have been made haven't been about that core issue. They have been about other things like tax evasion or wire fraud. Kind of like they went after the gangsters in the old days on tax evasion because they couldn't get them on a RICO statute. We need to change the laws so that we can give our law enforcement community the tools they need to be able to do the job that all of us expect is being done."It's incumbent upon Congress to work in a bipartisan manner to pass those laws to put a stop to this behavior. This shouldn't be a partisan issue, and it isn't. It's about defending the interests of the United States, and that's something we should all agree on. The good news is we're starting to do just that. Tomorrow, we plan to introduce bipartisan legislation called the Safeguarding American Innovation Act based on recommendations from our Thousand Talents report from late last year to protect U.S. taxpayer-funded research. First and foremost, our bill is going to help the Department of Justice go after Thousand Talents participants by holding them accountable for failing to disclose their foreign ties on federal grant applications. Again, it's a tool that they desperately need. Our bill goes directly to the root of the problem and makes it punishable by law to knowingly fail to disclose foreign funding on federal grant applications. This isn't about more arrests. We should all agree that transparency and honesty on grant applications are critical to the integrity of U.S. research and the U.S. research enterprise. These provisions will help promote those principles as well. Our bill also makes other important changes from our report. It requires the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, to streamline and coordinate grant-making between the federal agencies so there is more continuity and accountability and coordination when it comes to tracking the billions of dollars of taxpayer-funded grant money that's being distributed. This kind of transparency is long overdue."We have worked closely with the National Science Foundation, with the National Institutes of Health, with the Department of Energy, and others on this legislation, and they agree this is very important. Our legislation also allows the State Department to deny visas to foreign researchers who they know are seeking to steal research and intellectual property by exploiting exemptions in our current export control laws. This may surprise you, but the State Department can't do that now. Career foreign service officers, employees at the State Department, have asked us to please provide them this authority. They testified before our hearing, asking us to help them to be able to do what they know needs to be done. Our bill also requires research institutions and universities to provide the State Department basic information about sensitive technologies that a foreign researcher would have access to. Providing this information as part of the visa process should help streamline the process for the State Department and for these research institutions. This allows for college campuses to rely on the State Department to do some of the vetting for these applicants and to help keep bad actors off the campus. This is why many research institutions and universities will be endorsing our legislation tomorrow because we've worked with them on this issue and others, including new transparency standards for universities."They are now going to be required to report any foreign gift of $50,000 or more, which is a lower level from the current threshold of $250,000, but it's also going to empower the Department of Education to work with these universities and research institutions to ensure that this can be complied with in a way that doesn't create undue red tape and expenditures. It also allows DOE to fine universities that repeatedly fail to disclose these gifts. We can use this as a model going forward of how we learn the lessons from these, again, objective, straightforward PSI reports to get to the root causes of these cases. We've gotten widespread support across my home state of Ohio, from research leaders, hospitals, colleges, and universities and other stakeholders who want to see us continue to have an open and transparent research system and to have the United States be the center in the globe for innovation and research. But to ensure that can continue to happen, they want to be sure that we're holding China accountable."We are now at work on this legislation to codify into law some of the steps taken by the Trump Administration in response to our new telecommunications PSI report as well. This legislation we will introduce tomorrow will be led by myself and Senator Tom Carper, my colleague from the other side of the aisle from Delaware who was also my partner on this report with regard to the Thousand Talents Program and the hearing. We also have five other Democrats who will be joining us tomorrow, all of whom have an interest and understanding of this complicated issue. We'll also have about an equal number of Republicans joining us. Probably six to eight Republicans. So again, this is going to be a bipartisan effort, I would say even a nonpartisan effort, to ensure that in a smart, sensible, practical way we can respond to the threat that we're facing. In this case, from China taking our intellectual property, our innovations, our ideas, and taking them to China and using them in China, sometimes against the United States."In addition to the four examples we discussed tonight, the Subcommittee will continue its work to shine a light on other examples where China and other countries aren't living by the rules, so we can ensure that with regard to China and regard to other foreign governments, we can create a more durable and a more equitable and a more sustainable relationship between our countries. Again, we don't want to be enemies with China. What we do want is to have a relationship of mutual respect. And we have the right to ask them that they treat us with the same respect that we treat them. At the end of the day, that's what's going to be best for the Chinese people, best for the American people, and best for all of us moving forward."###Load-Date: June 18, 2020End of Document

Nio s future depends more on the Chinese government than everiCrowdNewswire (English)June 8, 2020 Monday 5:18 PM GMTCopyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1599 wordsBodyPhoto by Sean O Kane / The Vergee Chinese EV startup Nio announced its first-quarter results last week and, by most accounts, the Tencent-backed company appears to have weathered the impact of COVID-19.

Continue reading Nio s future depends more on the Chinese government than everPhoto by Sean O Kane / The VergeeChinese EV startup Nio announced its first-quarter results last week and, by most accounts, the Tencent-backed company appears to have weathered the impact of COVID-19. That argument was further bolstered on Thursday when Nio released strong May delivery figures. But Nio also recently finalized a crucially-timed $1 billion bailout from a local government in China, and the price the company had to pay to survive is becoming increasingly apparent.Now Nio   which is billed as an independent startup with ambitions to sell cars in Europe and the US, and even has offices in London, Munich, and Silicon Valley   is more anchored to the whims of the Chinese government than before. And owners of Nio shares that trade on the New York Stock Exchange have had an extra layer of abstraction placed between them and the company s most valuable assets.The cost of the bailoutThe major deal Nio inked was with the city of Hefei, the capital of Anhui province. Announced in February and finalized in April, it involves a group of state-owned or state-adjacent construction, economic development, and investment companies pumping about $1 billion into a subsidiary in China created by Nio called, simply,  Nio China. Nio has committed its  core assets  to this new China-only subsidiaryIn return, Nio had to commit its  core businesses and assets in China, including vehicle research and development, supply chain, sales and services and Nio Power  (that last part being its home charging and battery swap business) into this new subsidiary. Nio also has to invest around $600 million of its own money into Nio China, and has committed to building a new headquarters specifically for the new subsidiary in Hefei.On top of all of that, the Hefei investor group now owns 24 percent of Nio China. The other 76 percent belongs to Nio Inc., the holding company at the very top of the EV startup s corporate structure. Nio Inc. is what trades on the NYSE, and so the company made sure to tell its shareholders on the recent earnings call that they will own the controlling stake of Nio China  for the long term. That reassurance is important because companies like Nio are ostensibly independent from the government in China, at least when compared to outright state-owned enterprises. Yes, they benefit from government subsidies and aggressive electric vehicle policies, but it s not like Beijing is calling the day-to-day shots.But that case will be slightly harder to make following this deal, because the Hefei investor group was granted  voting rights with respect to various significant corporate matters  like changes to Nio China s corporate structure, and its  core business and   articles of association,  which, according to Nio,  may significantly limit our ability to make certain major corporate decisions with regard to  the new subsidiary. And if Nio doesn t hit certain sales benchmarks or take the Nio China subsidiary public on its own within five years, the Hefei investors can cash in their shares at an 8.5 percent premium.What s more, if that happens and Nio is unable to pay them back, the Hefei investors can force Nio to sell its own stake in Nio China.  [w]e may lose control,  the company warned investors in a recent filing. we may lose control Nio didn t have much of a choice but to make this bargain, says Michael Dunne, head of ZoZo Go, an automotive consulting group focused on the Chinese market. At a certain point there comes a day of reckoning where [Chinese companies] are just hungry for cash, and they look around and say,  what are our alternatives here?  And the final backstop is the government,  Dunne says.  China wants to lead the world in electric vehicles, and they have the wherewithal to provide Nio with the cash lifeline to allow it to proceed with its dream. Still, it has some skeptics worried. One investor who is short Nio s stock (meaning he s essentially betting the share price will go down) has called it an  asset strip, and that those concessions the company made in return for Hefei s investment put shareholders at risk.Dunne disagrees, though he admits Nio was  caught in a place where they were vulnerable and they had to lose control of some elements.  Anything is possible in China  Do I think it s some kind of a play? I don t. I think it s a short term improvisation to stay alive, with the hope they can improve performance and reassert control of the venture both inside and outside of China,  he says.But, he adds,  anything is possible in China. When the company you re investing in is also owned by Chinese shareholders, including the state enterprise or the government, all bets are off. Nio s brush with deathThe money came at a particularly crucial time for Nio, as the startup was barreling toward financial catastrophe.Not only has Nio burned through more than $6 billion since its founding in 2014, but it stumbled repeatedly in 2019. Despite it being Nio s first full year of sales, and the company launching a second, more affordable electric SUV, it ultimately delivered half the total number of cars it promised last year.The company s progress was tripped up by a number of things: a battery recall, the Chinese government s reduction of subsidies on expensive electric vehicles, a pre-pandemic slowdown in China s economy, and   by Nio s own admission   five straight years of unchecked growth.Nio needed funding after a really rocky 2019Nio went through multiple rounds of layoffs, delayed a new vehicle, and canceled plans to build its own factory as a result. The company also sold its Formula E electric racing team for $15 million, a figure that has not been previously reported, according to a recent filing.To staunch the bleeding, Nio spent the better part of the last year trying to scare up new funding. That search did not go so well. A proposed $1.45 billion deal with the economic development agency in Beijing never materialized. Instead, Nio wound up taking a $200 million loan from its founder and Tencent in September 2019, and then took on another $435 million worth of debt in early 2020 to fund its operations, before ultimately lining up the deal with Hefei.Then, of course, the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Nio s sales briefly flatlined, as did pretty much every other automaker s. The company went from delivering 8,224 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2019 to 3,838 cars in the first quarter of 2020   putting Nio roughly in line with where it was at in the first quarter of 2019 (3,989 cars delivered) when it had just one model for sale.Nio s first quarter numbers emphasize how existential things got. The startup generated just $177.3 million of revenue on the 3,838 cars it sold in the first quarter, and $193.8 million in total revenue for the quarter. The company ultimately posted a $238.9 million loss, and finished the quarter with just $338.6 million of cash in the bank, which the company said once again  is not adequate to provide the required working capital and liquidity for continuous operation in the foreseeable future    marking the second consecutive quarter that Nio had to issue such a warning.Nio has lost more than $6 billion total since 2014But amidst a recovering new car market in China, Nio delivered 3,436 vehicles in May   nearly as many as it shipped across the entire first quarter. Braced by the optimism around the Hefei investment, analysts at JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have upgraded their ratings of the company s stock. CEO William Li has said he feels confident Nio has enough funding to move forward, and it looks like things are trending back up.If Nio builds on this momentum, the company can still follow through on its ambitions to become a global brand, Dunne says. He s also not concerned those plans would be inhibited by the fact that the local government is now directly involved. The Hefei government would be absolutely 100 percent in support of that direction, to go global, and compete globally, in part because the brand value goes up if it s not a China-only play,  he says. The central government in Beijing is also calling for more exports of Chinese vehicles, according to Dunne, which would bode well for Nio long term.Success at that scale could be a boon to Hefei, a place that was already humming with automaker activity, and one that has only seen its status improve since the ink dried on the deal with Nio. Just last week, Volkswagen announced it s pouring more than $2 billion into state-owned automaker JAC Motors and battery maker Guoxuan High-Tech, two companies located in the capital city of the Anhui province.JAC Motors just so happens to be the company that makes Nio s cars, though Dunne thinks the move will only further bolster each company s prospects.  Anhui province, enjoying apparent powerful godfathers in Beijing, looks hell-bent on establishing itself as a core production hub in China s EV industry,  he says.See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21274457/nio-q1-earnings-deliveries-chinese-government-investment-Contact Information:Sean O'KaneTags:, Artificial Intelligence Newswire, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: June 8, 2020End of Document

FBI Director Says Greatest Long-Term Threat to U.S. is Chinese GovernmentNewsweek.comJuly 7, 2020 Tuesday 1:52 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 500 wordsByline: Jocelyn GrzeszczakHighlight: "The Chinese Communist Party believes it's in a generational fight to surpass our country in economic and technological leadership," said FBI Director Christopher Wray.BodyFBI Director Christopher Wray appealed to the American people during a panel discussion Tuesday, stating that the greatest long-term threat to information and economic vitality in the U.S. is the Chinese government."The Chinese Communist Party believes it's in a generational fight to surpass our country in economic and technological leadership," Wray said during the discussion at the Hudson Institute in Washington D.C.During the event, Wray outlined several ways the Chinese Communist Party is currently engaging in counterintelligence and economic espionage efforts.The Chinese government is actively working to steal American people's data and intellectual property, including that related to the fight against the coronavirus, he said."At this very moment, China is working to compromise American health care organizations, pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions conducting essential COVID-19 research," Wray said, adding that in addition to data, Americans' health, livelihood and security is at stake.All of the agency's 56 field offices are conducting investigations relating to Chinese counterintelligence efforts. Of the nearly 5,000 total active counterintelligence cases, approximately half are related to China, Wray said."We've now reached the point where the FBI is opening a new China-related counterintelligence case about every 10 hours," he said.The news comes amid mounting pressure on the Chinese-owned app TikTok, after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo suggested it could be outlawed in the U.S. over national data security concerns, similar to action previously taken against Chinese tech firms Huawei and ZTE.U.S. officials are "looking at" security concerns relating to TikTok, Pompeo confirmed during an appearance Monday on Fox News' The Ingraham Angle.When asked if U.S. citizens should download and use the app, Pompeo said: "Only if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party." His comments came after India banned TikTok and other apps over security concerns.The Chinese government is engaged in a whole-of-state effort to become the world's only superpower by any means necessary, Wray said Tuesday.Wray repeatedly insisted that the so-called threat is not about the Chinese people or Chinese Americans, acknowledging that the U.S. should not stop doing business with the country or hosting Chinese visitors.Instead, Wray said, it means that the U.S. will not tolerate or enable China to violate American criminal laws and international norms.The intelligence and law enforcement communities are working hard to provide American companies, universities and citizens with the information needed to make informed decisions and protect their most valuable assets, Wray said.The FBI's investigations are having "real success" in identifying, arresting and prosecuting targets relating to Chinese counterintelligence cases, he said.Newsweek contacted the FBI for comment but did not hear back in time for publication.Link to ImageGraphic Christopher WrayMark Wilson/GettyFBI Director is Christopher A.

Combating Chinese Government Efforts to Exploit the COVID-19 Pandemic Goal of New Legislation by Rep. RoseTargeted News ServiceJuly 4, 2020 Saturday 7:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 844 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Max Rose, D-New York, issued the following news release:Congressman Max Rose joined Congresswomen Kendra Horn of Oklahoma and Stephanie Murphy of Florida to introduce legislation yesterday requiring the U.S. government to identify, analyze, and combat efforts by the Chinese government to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic."From the opioid epidemic, to trade, to our intellectual property, China has a long history of trying to rip off America," said Rose, Member of the House Committee on Homeland Security and Co-Chair of the Blue Dog Task Force on National Security. "Why should we think the coronavirus pandemic would be any different? It's not a question of if, but how China is going to use this crisis to its advantage--and we need to be working to prevent that."The legislation, called the Preventing China from Exploiting COVID-19 Act, requires the Director of National Intelligence (DNI)--in coordination with the Secretaries of Defense, State, and Homeland Security--to prepare an assessment of the different ways in which the Chinese government has exploited or could exploit the pandemic, which originated in China, in order to advance China's interests and to undermine the interests of the United States, its allies, and the rules-based international order. The assessment must be provided to Congress within 90 days and posted in unclassified form on the DNI's website."No one should seek to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic for political or economic advantage," said Horn, Co-Chair of the Blue Dog Task Force on National Security. "We must examine whether the Chinese Communist Party has used intellectual cyber-theft, misinformation campaigns, and aggressive territorial maneuvers, among other tactics to take advantage of the pandemic. We need to get to the bottom of where the Chinese government has exploited COVID-19 and undermined our fight against the global pandemic. Where they've crossed the line, they must be held accountable.""Bipartisan concerns in Congress about Chinese government policies have only increased once COVID-19 emerged in China and spread to virtually every country in the world. Since the start of this pandemic, we have witnessed a pattern of alarming behavior from the Chinese government in a range of areas," said Murphy, Blue Dog Coalition Co-Chair for Administration. "This bill would provide U.S. policymakers with an intelligence community assessment of the different ways the Chinese government may be seeking to exploit the pandemic. Armed with this information, we can hold the Chinese government accountable and protect American interests."The Preventing China from Exploiting COVID-19 Act requires the DNI report to examine the following topics, among others:The techniques used by the Chinese government to obstruct or retaliate against nations that have sought a full inquiry into China's role in the emergence and spread of COVID-19, and the Chinese government's motivations for such efforts.The activities undertaken by the Chinese government, like cyber-theft, intended to acquire information and intellectual property related to COVID-19 testing, treatment, and vaccines.The manner in which the Chinese government seeks to advance its foreign policy interests by providing economic aid or medical equipment to nations adversely affected by COVID-19, and the degree to which this aid makes recipient countries more likely to adopt positions favorable to China and detrimental to the United States.The ways in which the Chinese government is using, or may be planning to use, the global disruption and distraction associated with COVID-19 as an opportunity to more aggressively pursue longstanding objectives, including with respect to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Xinjiang, and territorial disputes.The means by which the Chinese government is disseminating misinformation about COVID-19, including on U.S. social media platforms.How all of these activities, taken together, further Chinese interests, and the extent to which they constitute a continuation of the longstanding practices of China or represent an evolution in the foreign policy behavior of China.Rose has continued to be a leader in holding China accountable. Earlier this year, Rose, Chair of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Intelligence and Counterterrorism, and Congressman Mark Walker (R-NC), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, urged the Department of Homeland Security to increase its focus on China and provide the subcommittee with details of its intelligence assessments on China's actions related to the pandemic.Additionally, Rose's bipartisan Fentanyl Sanctions Act was signed into law, which will apply sanctions on drug manufacturers in China who knowingly provide fentanyl to traffickers, transnational criminal organizations like those in Mexico who mix fentanyl with other drugs and traffic them into the U.S. and financial institutions that assist them.Full text of the bill here https://horn.house.gov/uploadedfiles/preventing_china_from_exploiting_covid-19_act.pdf.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7165597 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 4, 2020End of Document

Zoom admits to shutting down activist accounts at the request of the Chinese governmentiCrowdNewswire (English)June 12, 2020 Friday 11:55 AM GMTCopyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1377 wordsBodyZoom,  the wildly successful video chat service that has been a ubiquitous feature of life during the COVID-19 pandemic, said that it shut down three accounts at the request of the Chinese government for holding memorials for the victims of China s violent suppression of peaceful protests at Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.

Continue reading Zoom admits to shutting down activist accounts at the request of the Chinese governmentZoom, the wildly successful video chat service that has been a ubiquitous feature of life during the COVID-19 pandemic, said that it shut down three accounts at the request of the Chinese      government for holding memorials for the victims of China s violent suppression of peaceful protests at Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.As Axios first reported, the accounts of Lee Cheuk-Yan, Wang Dan and Zhou Fengsuo were closed down by the video communication service for planning and holding vigils and events to commemorate      the Tiananmen Square Massacre.According to Zoom s own timeline, the company was notified by the Chinese government about four large, June 4th commemoration meetings that were being publicized on social media. The Chinese      government demanded that Zoom terminate the meetings and host accounts. Responding to the Chinese government s request Zoom determined that three of the four events included participants from      mainland China and were distributing information or discussing events that were illegal under Chinese law.Zoom shut down those meetings.The company also suspended the host accounts, which were located in Hong Kong and the U.S.In its statement, Zoom blamed the decision on the company s inability to block participants by country.  We could have anticipated this need,  the company acknowledged.To correct its error, Zoom said it would be  developing technology over the next several days that will enable us to remove or block at the participant level based on geography. This will      enable us to comply with requests from local authorities when they determine activity on our platform is illegal within their borders; however we will also be able to protect these      conversations for participants outside of those borders where the activity is allowed. Zoom attributed its decision to acquiesce to the Chinese government as a consequence of operating as an international company.  We hope that one day, governments who build barriers to      disconnect their people from the world and each other will recognize that they are acting against their own interests, as well as the rights of their citizens and all humanity,  the company      wrote in its statement.  The reality is Zoom operates in more than 80 countries and continues to expand, which requires compliance with local laws even as Zoom seeks to promote the open      exchange of ideas. This isn t the first time that Zoom s privacy and security policies or the company s potentially too-cozy relationship with the Chinese government has been called into question. The company      also came under fire for routing some of its calls through China, something the company called a mistake, when the practice was first reported in April.The company has previously acknowledged that much of its technology development is conducted in China and security concerns from governments abound. Taiwan and India have both banned the app      for government use, and the U.S. Government and German Ministry of foreign affairs are restricting use of the app for government purposes.Despite all of the security lapses and criticism, usage of Zoom has skyrocketed. It now counts over 300 million users of its streaming video communication services.https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/zoom-calls-routed-china/The company s full statement follows below:We hope that one day, governments who build barriers to disconnect their people from the world and each other will recognize that they are acting against their own interests, as well as the      rights of their citizens and all humanity. The reality is Zoom operates in more than 80 countries and continues to expand, which requires compliance with local laws even as Zoom seeks to      promote the open exchange of ideas. Recent articles in the media about adverse actions we took toward Lee Cheuk-yan, Wang Dan, and Zhou Fengsuo have some calling into question our commitment to being a platform for an open      exchange of ideas and conversations.To be clear, their accounts have been reinstated, and going forward, we will have a new process for handling similar situations.We will do better as we strive to make Zoom the most secure and trusted way to bring people together.Key FactsIn May and early June, we were notified by the Chinese government about four large, public June 4th commemoration meetings on Zoom that were being publicized on social media, including      meeting details. The Chinese government informed us that this activity is illegal in China and demanded that Zoom terminate the meetings and host accounts.We did not provide any user information or meeting content to the Chinese government. We do not have a backdoor that allows someone to enter a meeting without being visible.For one of the meetings, even though the Chinese authorities demanded we take action, we chose to keep the meeting undisturbed because it did not have any participants from mainland China.For two of the four meetings, a U.S.-based Zoom team reviewed the meeting metadata (such as IP addresses) while the meeting was in progress, and confirmed a significant number of mainland      China participants.For the fourth situation, the Chinese government showed us a social media invitation for an upcoming meeting referencing a June 4th commemoration event and demanded we take action. The      Chinese authorities also notified us of a prior meeting under this account that they considered to be illegal. A U.S.-based Zoom team confirmed the attendance of mainland China participants in      that prior meeting.Zoom does not currently have the ability to remove specific participants from a meeting or block participants from a certain country from joining a meeting. As such, we made the decision to      end three of the four meetings and suspended or terminated the host accounts associated with the three meetings.How We Fell ShortWe strive to limit actions taken to only those necessary to comply with local laws. Our response should not have impacted users outside of mainland China. We made two mistakes:We suspended or terminated the host accounts, one in Hong Kong SAR and two in the U.S. We have reinstated these three host accounts.We shut down the meetings instead of blocking the participants by country. We currently do not have the capability to block participants by country. We could have anticipated this need.      While there would have been significant repercussions, we also could have kept the meetings running.Actions We re TakingGoing forward Zoom will not allow requests from the Chinese government to impact anyone outside of mainland China.Zoom is developing technology over the next several days that will enable us to remove or block at the participant level based on geography. This will enable us to comply with requests from      local authorities when they determine activity on our platform is illegal within their borders; however, we will also be able to protect these conversations for participants outside of those      borders where the activity is allowed.We are improving our global policy to respond to these types of requests. We will outline this policy as part of our transparency report, to be published by June 30, 2020.In addition to connecting people for business, education, healthcare, and other professional endeavors, during this global pandemic Zoom has become the platform people all over the world are      choosing for human connection. Zoom is proud of the role we are playing globally and fully supports the open exchange of ideas and conversations that bring communities together to meet,      organize, collaborate, and celebrate.See Campaign:https://crunchbase.com/organization/zoom-video-communicationsContact Information:Jonathan ShieberTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: August 19, 2020End of Document

Rep. Smith Issues Op-Ed: 'Remembering Tiananmen'Targeted News ServiceJune 5, 2020 Friday 7:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1258 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, issued the following op-ed published in the New Jersey Globe:Thirty-one years ago, the world watched with a mixture of hope and anticipation as over a million people gathered peacefully to demand democracy and human rights in the streets of Beijing and over 400 other Chinese cities.The promise of those heady days ended tragically with broken bodies and broken dreams. Dreams that were brutally suppressed by a Chinese Communist Party that will go to any length to keep its grip on power.On that fateful day mothers lost sons, fathers lost daughters, and China lost an incredibly brave and idealistic generation to the tanks that rolled down Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.We solemnly remember the Tiananmen massacre because there is still absolutely no justice for those who lost their lives or suffered imprisonment and torture for peacefully seeking freedom and reform.We commemorate the tragedy of Tiananmen each year because it is an event too important to forget and too dangerous to commemorate in China.For over three decades, the big lie proffered by the Chinese communist government is that no one died on the Square.In December of 1996, Bill Clinton invited Chi Haotien--AKA the Butcher of Beijing- to the White House and honored him with a 19-gun salute and pageantry fit for a king.As operational military commander during the Tiananmen Square democracy protests, General Chi played a major role in the bloodbath. But while on that trip to Washington, General Chi, now defense minister, said "no one died on Tiananmen Square".Outraged, I immediately put together an emergency congressional hearing entitled--Was there a Tiananmen Massacre: The Visit of General Chi and heard from an expert panel that included the Time magazine Beijing bureau chief who saw it all and wrote about the killings and Amnesty International. I also invited Chi or anyone from the Chinese embassy to give an account. Not unexpectedly, he, was a no-show.Despite the decades and rapid change in China, the fundamental brutality of the Chinese Communist government has not disappeared--and in recent years under dictator-for-life Xi Jinping has gotten demonstrably worse.The scope of domestic repression in China is breathtaking, with more censorship, torture, and arbitrary detention than at any time since 1989. Indeed, technology-driven control by the State is greater now than at any point of history.Communist Party officials and their propaganda organs regularly attack "universal values," "Western ideals," and "foreign influence," seeking to blunt criticism of China's human rights record.General Secretary Xi Jinping has pushed through national security laws that legitimize repression of independent religious practice and stifle civil society, expanding censorship of online expression.Rights lawyers are tortured, citizen journalists are jailed and foreign journalists are expelled.Tibetan culture and religion are systematically destroyed and over a million Uyghurs and other predominately Muslim ethnic minorities are interned in concentration camps, forced to labor on goods that end up in global markets--something which stirs up a particularly poignant memory in me, having visited Beijing Prison # 1 in 1991 where I saw gaunt Tiananmen prisoners, heads shaved, stooped over machines while making clothing for export to the United States and other markets.And, as we all know too well, the flame of freedom and autonomy in Hong Kong is being extinguished as we speak.We are truly blind if we don't recognize that there is a direct connection between Beijing's domestic repression and its international aggression. The Chinese Communist government is staging a systematic assault on international norms and rules, exporting its model of censorship and repression to the world's petty-dictators and authoritarians.The U.S. needs to lead a global coalition of the democratic willing to push back against Beijing's ambitions, before the subtle erosion of democratic values and governance models leads to eventual economic domination. This means countries of the European Union must reject offers by Chinese companies such as Huawei to build a 5G network, something which should raise security and privacy concerns.The U.S. and the international community must start to demand transparency, adherence to international rules and norms, and an end to coercive influence operations as a starting point of diplomatic relations. We must shine a light on egregious human rights abuses and attempts to corrupt universal values globally.Because political reforms will only come from the Chinese people themselves, we must stand with them as they face the inevitable repression and assure them, in the loudest voices we can muster, that their sacrifices will not be forgotten.We either stand with Tank Man--the brave Tiananmen protestor who stood up to oppression--or we stand with the tank.Failure to do so only gives the Chinese Communist government license to continue strangling dissent.The Trump Administration has rightly started to reformulate U.S.-China relations as a strategic competition, addressing unfair trade practices and calling out serious human rights abuses, particular the mass internment of Uyghurs. Congress has passed more consequential and bipartisan human rights legislation on China in the past year than at any time before.Nevertheless, the American people need to be educated about the nature of the challenges posed by the Chinese Communist government and clear articulations of the measures needed to meet them.Such messaging must avoid fostering an atmosphere of unfair suspicion of Chinese-Americans, who are often targets of coercive political influence operations by Chinese government officials. In addition, U.S. messaging must clearly differentiate between the people and culture of China and the Chinese Communist Party and government.The road ahead will not be easy. Western nations for too long bought into the fantasy that increased trade and integration into the international system - the so-called "Engagement Theory - would lead to a more democratic and tolerant Chinese Communist government. China is richer now but less tolerant of dissent and more willing to use its wealth to remake the international system to reflect is interests.But failure to integrate values and interests in our China policy is something we can no longer afford.In the end, the health of the U.S. economic and environment, the safety of our food and drug supplies, the security of sensitive personal information and investments, the health of America's citizens, and stability in the Pacific will depend on the Chinese Communist government complying with international law. If they cannot do so, if they continue to refuse to allow the free flow of news and information and the development of an independent judiciary and civil society, the China must be contained and quarantined from the international system, until such time as they do change.It is easy to be pessimistic during the time of Xi Jinping's rule. I am not. The hopes of the Tiananmen protesters survive among the Chinese people today and they continue to seek human rights and political reforms, often at great personal risks.As the late Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo said, "there is no force that can put an end to the human quest for freedom, and China will in the end become a nation ruled by law, where human rights reign supreme."That is the day we must be working toward.Copyright Targeted News ServicesC20-RajeshS-7132987 C20-RajeshSLoad-Date: June 5, 2020End of Document

LANKFORD CAUTIONS VIGILANCE OF CHINA'S AGGRESSIVE AGENDAStates News ServiceJuly 22, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1727 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by Oklahoma Senator James Lankford:Lankford: "When we deal with China, we know what they've done, the predatory tactics they've done, either to their own people or to countries around the world."Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today spoke on the Senate floor to caution our nation about the dangers of China's aggressive and often predatory actions toward the international community and the US. Lankford discussed the escalating tensions in Hong Kong between the people and the government, both the local Hong Kong government and the increasingly intervening Chinese communist government.This week, Lankford and Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) released the Safeguarding Internet Freedom in Hong Kong Act, which pushes back on China's aggressive actions to undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and freedom by bolstering firewall circumvention infrastructure in Hong Kong. In 2019, Lankford sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to push for additional firewall circumvention tools to diversify the technology portfolio and increase the effectiveness of the federal government's efforts.As a commissioner on the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), Lankford has worked to hold China accountable for its human rights abuses and predatory lending practices. Lankford was also a cosponsor of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which was signed into law by President Trump in 2019. Lankford helped introduce the Transparency for Confucius Institutes Act and engaged with Education Secretary DeVos to investigate the Institutes as a way for China to exert undue influence on the American academic community and beyond.TranscriptThe world is watching what's happening with COVID-19. It's affecting every single one of our families in some way. While the world is watching and we're dealing with all the issues in the United States, you can't lose track of what's happening on the world stage because China is using this moment when the world is distracted to be able to push its way into Hong Kong and to break its word. When we deal with China, we know what they've done, the predatory tactics they've done, either to their own people or to countries around the world.In the United States of America, when we do foreign aid, we help other countries gain more security, freedom, economic growth. We don't ask anything in return. We engage to be able to help them. China is working with developing countries around the world by moving into countries and taking collateral of their ports, airports, and establishing military bases around the world when poor countries default on the loans they give them. They're not helping other countries. That's right. They're taking over other countries. They're stepping into country after country and offering them technology from companies like Huawei. But what they're really doing is gathering their people and gathering data on people all around the world. The security systems are not there to set up. They're there for the dictatorship of China to be able to track what's going on there in the emergencies development. We should be aware of what China is doing and we should not ignore this moment for the free people of Hong Kong.Today many Americans are aware of how China has handled the issue of protective equipment, medical equipment that weigh desperately needed in March, April, May, much of it manufactured in China, we could not get because the communist government of China kept the materials from American companies that were manufacturing in China, the Chinese communist government wouldn't allow the export of that. They just took that equipment over, putting all the schedules behind. Suddenly Americans woke up and understood that our supply chains are at risk. Our pharmaceutical supply chains are at risk. Our PPE Supply chains are at risk, and what many people don't know is that our rare earth minerals are at risk. A lot of folks like the solar panels and electric car batteries. Well, great except for the rare earth minerals that are in those are completely dependent on China. And if we don't develop our own sourcing for those rare earth minerals, which we have those same rare earth minerals here. If we don't develop our own supply chain, our own manufacturing for pharmaceuticals and for the precursors of pharmaceuticals, we'll continue to be vulnerable to the Chinese government and at the moment the communist government determines they will take over that supply and we will be at risk.For decades, the Confucius Institutes have thrived on college campuses, spreading a communist philosophy all through our college campuses. It is now at a moment that college campuses and leadership in colleges are starting to wake up to be able to say, why are we allowing communist indoctrination on our campuses? It is a bill that I have pushed, that I will continue to push. It is an issue that I have pushed for years dealing with communist Chinese spying on American technology, stealing technology and also stealing our scientists and inventions.They come over with a grant from the United States and said they're going to send over research and really what they're doing is harvesting research and taking it back to China. They take over any items of production and all the manufacturing that comes to China, they'll then take that same technology, move it to a different factory and literally compete against the first company because to do business in China, you have to turn over all your intellectual property to the communist government, who then takes it an uses it on their own. The Chinese communist government is not the ally of freedom for the world. We should be aware of that. Certainly the people of Hong Kong are aware of that.In 1997, after 150 years as a British territory, Hong Kong became a part of China under the joint declaration. It was had in one country, two systems that Hong Kong for 50 years would remain autonomous and free. Well, just over two decades later, the Chinese government has broken their promise and Hong Kong is no longer free. While the world is consumed with what's happening with COVID-19, the communist government has moved into Hong Kong and has taken it over. They passed a law in Beijing that they sent over and declared into Hong Kong that you can't have anything of what they call subversion, organization and perpetuation of what they call terroristic activities, conclusion with a foreign country or external element, which I'll explain later. This new security law was delivered to the people of Hong Kong at midnight and went into place immediately. The next step was Chinese communist police, military law enforcement moved into Hong Kong to begin to implement this. Threats to free speech immediately stopped.The protesters on the street just wishing to be able to vote and to be able it speak their mind were immediately rounded up. Teachers and academics have been arrested or fired or threatened. Communist Chinese leaders have contacted them to represent them about teaching about human rights in their classroom. Remembering that in Hong Kong it was required. It was a required class in Hong Kong just weeks ago to learn about human rights and freedom and now the Chinese government is removing those teachers and threatening any other teach that teaches about human rights that they will be removed. Faith leaders have been squashed.You see under this security law that is passed, you can't have any external element of collusion. They define external element as any kind of worship of God as well that does not align with the communist government. So any faith-based group that is there in Hong Kong is immediately being squashed. The Muslim Uyghurs are gathered up in communist china and nut in concentration camps to reeducate them on how to be more Chinese. Now the people of Hong Kong are experiencing that same type of oppression as the first step has stepped into to take away their right to free speech, their right to gather and protest and now also their right to be able to have freedom of faith. Leaders of the democracy movement have been rounded up and arrested. This is something we should not ignore. We have said as a world, never again. And we should engage.While I know many people in my state will say we should focus on COVID-19and we should. There is much that needs to be done. We cannot take our eye off of freedom and the world as well and the people of Hong Kong as they lose their freedom, the world loses freedom. And china sees it can move into one more place, one more time. Taiwan is next and they will continue to be able to move in this same way. We should stay engaged.There're multiple bills this body has done on sanctions, and we should continue. We should continue to be able to press in to be able to speak out for those who cannot speak for themselves in Hong Kong, and that are being isolated. Senator Tim Kaine and I just dropped a bill yesterday dealing with internet freedom for the people of Hong Kong, saying that the American government should be engaged in trying to break through what is called the great fire wall in china so we know they will extend this fire wall into Hong Kong as well and will prevent the people of Hong Kong from access to social media, interacting with each other or information on the outside world just like they have with the people of china. But the people of Hong Kong have grown up and lived in freedom. They know what it means to get outside information, and the Chinese government is actually working to shut that down.We should actively work to push back on that to make sure the free people of Hong Kong continue to be able to communicate with each other and the outside world and so that we can stay engaged with that basic function of human rights. It's why senator Kaine and I are so passionate about this. We should engage as a government to make sure they continue to have free speech as we have. When anyone loses their human rights indignities, the world loses human rights and dignities. There are many things that need to happen with COVID-19 right now and we're actively working on those things as well, and should. But we should not lose track of freedom. Freedom is our responsibility to model and to live and to help other free people to guard. Let's stand with the people of Hong Kong.Load-Date: July 22, 2020End of Document

CONGRESSMAN KRISHNAMOORTHI REQUESTS INFORMATION FROM SECRETARY ROSS ON JOHN BOLTON'S ALLEGATIONS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HARMED NATIONAL SECURITY BY BACKING CHINESE TELECOM COMPANIES AT THE URGING OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENTStates News ServiceJune 26, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 2259 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Illinois Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi:Today, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi wrote to Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross concerning allegations recently leveled by former National Security Advisor John Bolton that President Trump harmed United States national security by supporting the Chinese telecommunications companies ZTE and Huawei at the urging of President Xi Jinping, even as officials in his own Administration warned against it. Noting Mr. Bolton's argument that "the most important goal for Chinese 'companies' like Huawei and ZTE is to infiltrate telecommunications and information-technology systems, notably 5G, and subject them to Chinese control," the Congressman requested clarification on whether or not President Trump and, as a result, the U.S. Department of Commerce, made national security decisions based on political calculations rather than for the wellbeing of our country.On the question of the company ZTE, Congressman Krishnamoorthi noted ZTE's long history of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran, its deceptions about addressing those violations, and the bipartisan consensus around holding the company accountable:However, in April 2018, the U.S. government discovered ZTE lied about disciplining numerous employees responsible for previous sanctions violations ZTE had instead rewarded them with bonuses. In response, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security ("BIS") announced a seven-year ban on allowing ZTE to purchase products from American companies, including Qualcomm, a primary ZTE supplier. Because of the vulnerability of ZTE's supply chain from American companies, the ban had the potential to put the company out of business within weeks. Members of Congress from both parties, the U.S. Attorney General, and other national security officials urged President Trump to keep this ban in place.Despite broad support for ZTE facing this penalty for its clear and repeated violations, Secretary Ross announced a more favorable settlement for ZTE which would allow it to continue its dealings with American firms. Mr. Bolton has argued this was due to President Trump's desire to win good will with President Xi Jinping:However, with respect to ZTE and the aforementioned violations, Mr. Bolton writes, "During a conversation on trade with President Xi Jinping of China, Mr. Trump offered to lighten the penalties. Xi replied that if that were done, he would owe Trump a favor and Trump immediately responded he was doing this because of Xi." Mr. Bolton adds that the President regarded this request as "an opportunity to make personal gestures" to President Xi Jinping. Following that encounter in June 2018, you announced that ZTE agreed to pay $1 billion, place an additional $400 million in escrow, replace its senior leadership, and retain a team of compliance officials in exchange for being allowed to continue its business with American companies.To address these questions around the treatment of ZTE, White House involvement in those decisions, and their potential national security repercussions, Congressman Krishnamoorthi requested the following information:Which outcome better protects American national security, a seven-year ban on allowing ZTE to purchase American products, or the settlement your office announced on September 11, 2018? Please explain.What analysis was conducted into how the United States and its security would be better served by the settlement made with ZTE rather than the previously issued ban? Did this include a standard review process?Who, specifically, was responsible for the decision to overturn the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) ban?Was the individual or group of individuals tasked with overturning the BIS ban ordered to carry out this action at the direction of the President?If so, please share all written correspondence between the Executive Office of the President and the individual or group of individuals responsible for implementing the decision to overturn the BIS ban.Is there precedent for a sanction issued by the BIS against a foreign company being lifted after it has been issued?If so, has such a reversal ever followed the request of a foreign official?Did ZTE or the Chinese government compensate the United States government or any individuals for revoking the BIS sanctions in any manner beyond the publicly announced settlement?With regard to the firm Huawei, the Congressman wrote:In another instance, Huawei the world's top seller of telecom equipment faced criminal charges from the Justice Department in 2019. These charges included a decade-long attempt to steal trade secrets, obstruct a criminal investigation, and evade economic sanctions on Iran. Importantly, Mr. Bolton also wrote that the President "offered to reverse criminal prosecution against Huawei for violating sanctions on Iran if it would help in the trade deal which, of course, was primarily about getting Trump re-elected in 2020." Despite the absence of public evidence that Huawei received leniency at the urging of the White House, we are concerned by Mr. Bolton's allegations that the President may have attempted to provide favorable considerations to the company despite overwhelming evidence that it engaged in criminal activity.Did the White House make any requests for greater leniency or additional considerations for Commerce decisions on Huawei?Did Commerce follow up on President Trump's offer of leniency for Huawei in return for any action intended to boost his reelection chances?Congressman Krishnamoorthi requested answers by Monday, July 6, 2020 and a copy of his letter is available here. The text follows below:June 26, 2020Dear Secretary Ross:I write with deep concern about allegations recently leveled by former National Security Advisor John Bolton that President Trump harmed United States national security by supporting the Chinese telecommunications companies ZTE and Huawei at the urging of President Xi Jinping, even as his own advisors warned against it. As Mr. Bolton wrote in a recently publicized excerpt of his new book, "the most important goal for Chinese 'companies' like Huawei and ZTE is to infiltrate telecommunications and information-technology systems, notably 5G, and subject them to Chinese control[1]." In light of these allegations, I am requesting your clarification into whether or not President Trump, and subsequently the U.S. Department of Commerce, in fact made national security decisions based on political calculations rather than for the wellbeing of our country.ZTEFrom 2010 through 2016, ZTE, a Chinese telecommunications company, engaged in a multi-year conspiracy to supply, build, and operate telecommunications networks in Iran using U.S.-origin equipment in violation of the U.S. trade embargo on Iran.[2] In fact, ZTE violated "hundreds of U.S. sanctions violations" by shipping telecommunications parts to North Korea, and the company worked to cover its tracks and construct a fa ade to the U.S. government.[3]The U.S. Department of Commerce ("Commerce Department") responded by instituting a settlement agreement in March 2017. ZTE agreed to pay a penalty of $661 million and agreed that export privileges could be denied if further violations were found.[4]However, in April 2018, the U.S. government discovered ZTE lied about disciplining numerous employees responsible for previous sanctions violations ZTE had instead rewarded them with bonuses. In response, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security ("BIS") announced a seven-year ban on allowing ZTE to purchase products from American companies,[5] including Qualcomm, a primary ZTE supplier.[6] Because of the vulnerability of ZTE's supply chain from American companies, the ban had the potential to put the company out of business within weeks.[7] Members of Congress from both parties, the U.S. Attorney General, and other national security officials urged President Trump to keep this ban in place.However, with respect to ZTE and the aforementioned violations, Mr. Bolton writes, "During a conversation on trade with President Xi Jinping of China, Mr. Trump offered to lighten the penalties. Xi replied that if that were done, he would owe Trump a favor and Trump immediately responded he was doing this because of Xi[8]." Mr. Bolton adds that the President regarded this request as "an opportunity to make personal gestures" to President Xi Jinping[9]. Following that encounter in June 2018, you announced that ZTE agreed to pay $1 billion, place an additional $400 million in escrow, replace its senior leadership, and retain a team of compliance officials in exchange for being allowed to continue its business with American companies.[10]Given ZTE's flagrant disregard for U.S. law and American-imposed sanctions, combined with the national security risks inherent to any Chinese telecommunications company that facilitates its government's espionage, allegations that President Trump complied with President Xi's requests over those of American officials and national security experts are deeply concerning. The allegation that these decisions were intended to advance the President's own personal political agenda is perhaps even more disturbing. In light of these concerns, we request the following information:Which outcome better protects American national security, a seven-year ban on allowing ZTE to purchase American products, or the settlement your office announced on September 11, 2018? Please explain.What analysis was conducted into how the United States and its security would be better served by the settlement made with ZTE rather than the previously issued ban? Did this include a standard review process?Who, specifically, was responsible for the decision to overturn the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) ban?Was the individual or group of individuals tasked with overturning the BIS ban ordered to carry out this action at the direction of the President?If so, please share all written correspondence between the Executive Office of the President and the individual or group of individuals responsible for implementing the decision to overturn the BIS ban.Is there precedent for a sanction issued by the BIS against a foreign company being lifted after it has been issued?If so, has such a reversal ever followed the request of a foreign official?Did ZTE or the Chinese government compensate the United States government or any individuals for revoking the BIS sanctions in any manner beyond the publicly announced settlement?HuaweiIn another instance, Huawei the world's top seller of telecom equipment[11] faced criminal charges from the Justice Department in 2019. These charges included a decade-long attempt to steal trade secrets, obstruct a criminal investigation, and evade economic sanctions on Iran.[12] Importantly, Mr. Bolton also wrote that the President "offered to reverse criminal prosecution against Huawei for violating sanctions on Iran if it would help in the trade deal which, of course, was primarily about getting Trump re-elected in 2020."[13] Despite the absence of public evidence that Huawei received leniency at the urging of the White House, we are concerned by Mr. Bolton's allegations that the President may have attempted to provide favorable considerations to the company despite overwhelming evidence that it engaged in criminal activity. In light of these concerns, we request the following information:Did the White House make any requests for greater leniency or additional considerations for Commerce decisions on Huawei?Did Commerce follow up on President Trump's offer of leniency for Huawei in return for any action intended to boost his reelection chances?Secretary Ross Mr. Bolton writes, "I am hard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my White House tenure that wasn't driven by reelection calculations."[14] We are writing today to understand if the President's actions with regards to ZTE and Huawei were based on these criteria, and were in fact influenced by his "reelection calculations," rather than the economic and national security interests of the United States of America and its citizenry.We look forward to your response to these questions no later than Monday, July 6.Sincerely,Raja KrishnamoorthiMember of Congress[1] https://www.wsj.com/articles/john-bolton-the-scandal-of-trumps-china-policy-11592419564?mod=hp_lead_pos1[2] Perez, B.

Continue reading Zoom plans new blocking features to comply with requests from Chinese governmentZoom says it s working on new features that will allow it to block users based on their geographical location after admitting it recently suspended three user accounts based in Hong Kong and      the US at the request of the Chinese government.The company was widely criticized for suspending the accounts, which were hosting meetings to commemorate the June 4th Tiananmen Square massacre. In a blog post, Zoom said it had reinstated the      accounts and was developing tools to allow targeted blocking. Zoom is developing technology over the next several days that will enable us to remove or block at the participant level based on geography,  said the company.  This will enable us to comply      with requests from local authorities when they determine activity on our platform is illegal within their borders. The announcement will exacerbate concerns that Zoom is happy to block and suspend users in order to comply with the wishes of the Chinese government.One activist called the company s actions  shameful Zoom said it was informed by the Chinese government in May and early June that four meetings commemorating the Tiananmen Square massacre would be taking place. After the company established      that three of the meetings either contained a number of participants from mainland China or were likely to, it decided to end them and suspend the host accounts. Zoom says that these host      accounts have since been reinstated. The company says it took no action against a fourth meeting.According to Zoom, however, it wouldn t have terminated the meetings if it had the ability to block meeting participants based on their location. This new feature, it claims, could allow the      meeting to take place outside of China without any users attending from the country, meaning Zoom would not be obliged to take down the meetings in their entirety. Going forward Zoom will not allow requests from the Chinese government to impact anyone outside of mainland China,  Zoom says.Pro-democracy activists have criticized Zoom s willingness to comply with requests from the Chinese government.  Companies with a conscience should not accept requests from dictatorships,  Wang      Dan, one of the affected activists, told the Financial Times, noting that his team has since switched to using Google for its web calls.  As an American company, Zoom has the responsibility to      defend American values. Another campaigner, Lee Cheuk-Yan, who s based in Hong Kong, told The Guardian that he used Zoom to allow him to reach activists based inside the country.  My purpose on opening Zoom is to      reach out to mainland Chinese, breaking the censorship of the Chinese Communist party. With this policy it defeats my original purpose,  he said, calling Zoom s response  shameful. See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/12/21288995/zoom-blocking-feature-chinese-government-censorshipContact Information:Jon PorterTags:, Artificial Intelligence Newswire, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: August 18, 2020End of Document

CHINA EXPERT WARNS OF COMMUNIST CHINESE CORONAVIRUS DECEPTIONStates News ServiceJune 4, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1311 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Accuracy in Academia (AIA):Spencer IrvineBill Gertz, a noted national security correspondent who has covered Chinese geopolitics for several decades, criticized the Chinese communist government for its ongoing deception about the global coronavirus pandemic.Don Irvine, chairman of Accuracy in Academia, interviewed Gertz on the Accuracy in America live-streamed channel about his new booklet, "How China's Communist Party Made the World Sick." The booklet discusses the origins of the coronavirus pandemic and the communist cover-up of the virus's spread. You can order a copy online at Encounter Books or Amazon.Gertz credited the quick turnaround for the booklet to his publisher, Encounter Books. After Gertz published his latest book in September 2019, "Deceiving the Sky: Inside Communist China's Drive for Global Supremacy," Encounter Books suggested he delve into the coronavirus pandemic and publish a booklet about what he found in his research and through his sources."I had been covering extensively the Chinese mishandling of the virus outbreak in China," Gertz said, "In fact, on January 26, I was the first to report in The Washington Times that the virus may have escaped from the laboratory." Gertz acknowledged that his reporting "drew an immediate attack from the Chinese government as well as a lot of liberal politicians and media outlets here [in the U.S.]." Considering that his critics have yet to discredit his original reporting, Gertz noted that his story is "holding up pretty well."Gertz added that he "also reported that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was linked to China's covert virological weapons program." Until he reported the connection between the pandemic and the Wuhan lab, "we haven't had the information on that." He said his book "is really a close look at how China mishandled the outbreak and really caused devastating damage to the world economy and killed tens of thousands of people." He averred that the pandemic "could have been avoided; it could have been averted if China had taken the proper steps early on in the outbreak." "Instead," Gertz lamented, "as [with] most communists, they lied and deceived their own people and the result was this horrible pandemic that we're now dealing with."For context, as of the publishing date of this article, there were over 100,000 U.S. deaths from the coronavirus, with at least 1 million testing positive for the virus.When asked about China's complicity in the pandemic, Gertz blamed the Chinese government, "The Chinese had been totally, overly secretive, misleading, and deceptive about it." He had traced the origin of the outbreak to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan. According to his research, "an elderly gentleman showed up at the Wuhan Central Hospital with these various pneumonia-like symptoms" that the doctors "recognized as similar to the SARS, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome that originated in China back in 2003." The doctors believed "they were seeing another outbreak of SARS" and began to genome map the virus. "It turns out," Gertz said, that "this was a completely new virus."Despite the Chinese government's "near-totalitarian control on its information," Gertz lauded the efforts of "a few doctors in Wuhan" who were the "real heroes" and warned their colleagues and coworkers about the novel coronavirus. These doctors did their duty despite being "repressed mercilessly" by the government. Gertz praised the efforts of the late Dr. Li Wenliang, who was "actually one of the big heroes" and had fought off Chinese government persecution to bring the world the truth. His unfortunate death from the coronavirus led to the immediate recognition within China of him "as someone who stood up to the Communist Party."Contrary to American media reporting, Gertz believed that the actual coronavirus data in China could be "fifty times higher than" what was reported by the Chinese government. If anything, Gertz said that the global pandemic has been "a wake-up call for the world to understand the nature of this communist regime."During his research and conversations, Gertz was surprised to find out that "Americans are completely uneducated about the communist system in China." Americans "were familiar with the Cold War, and the Soviet Union, but they have not fully understood that this is a new type of communism." As a result of this lack of understanding, the U.S.'s integration with the Chinese economy has backfired due to the pandemic. "My argument has been," Gertz said, "We had a forty-year gamble that if we just traded with China, if we ignored their human rights abuses, if we ignored their arms proliferation around the world, that this would create a moderate, non-communist state. And it's been an utter failure." He concluded, "The forty-year gamble is a real disaster for the United States and the rest of the world."Gertz, in his booklet, recommended two steps for the U.S. government post-pandemic: First, the U.S. government should "launch a full investigation of how the pandemic started and interview doctors, obtain samples and trace the genome map." Second, Gertz recommended that the government should "make sure our supply chains are protected" and not have "our supply chains dependent on China" after China threatened to cut off the U.S. from pharmaceutical supplies made in China.Third, "we've got to stop training Chinese technical and managerial people." Gertz alleged that "the people who run the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control, were trained in the United States and Europe." He said, "We see that they have not been protecting those laboratories from mishaps or leaks, mishandling of deadly packages."The last recommendation is to deal with new international organizations and China's growing influence in them. Gertz claimed that the Chinese government "completely corrupted the World Health Organization, which has one mission, to just deal with pandemics that we have." "Instead," Gertz said, "It's become an organization that followed China's lead. It lied to the world about it early on, about travel from China, including millions of people who included people who were infected and spread the virus to Europe." It is time for the U.S. to evaluate the value of these organizations to American interests and potentially leave them to "create new organizations run by democratic, open, free systems that aren't corrupted by Chinese influence."Gertz blasted liberal politicians for the prolonged economic lockdown across the country. He recently met with several military doctors and they told him that the U.S.'s approach to containing the coronavirus failed the country. To combat a virus, the government has to foster herd immunity, therapies and treatments, and then vaccines. But the current government policy ignored herd immunity, which is important to stop a virus's spread."It's my own view that this is part of the radical equality that the liberals have promoted for so much," Gertz said, "That everyone should sacrifice for a few, rather than the few sacrificing for everyone." He lamented, "Our economy is right now on its knees as a result of the lockdown procedures that have been taken by the states and the federal government." He criticized the overall pandemic approach and said, "Unfortunately, this disease, we have to take care about taking people, but we've got it backwards." In past disease outbreaks, the government did not shut down the economy, Gertz added.He also criticized the media's pandemic coverage, "Most of the people who contract the coronavirus disease don't die from it. They have minor symptoms. It's those older people and those with other conditions that are really facing problems." Gertz said, "This has been the biggest, most self-inflicted wound on our economy that we've ever experienced."Load-Date: June 5, 2020End of Document

Most Scientists Who Lost Jobs At National Institute Of Health Due To Probe Into Foreign Ties Worked For Chinese GovernmentThe Daily CallerJune 15, 2020 Monday 09:57 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc.

When she is not reporting on subjects like religion and culture, she is cooking or writing about cooking.Author ImageBodyLink to ImageMost scientists who've resigned or been fired by the National Institute of Health (NIH) for failing to disclose financial ties to foreign governments were receiving funding from a Chinese institution, an NIH probe found, according to Science Magazine.Nearly 54 scientists have resigned or been fired as a result of the ongoing investigation, which aims to spot foreign funding that could pose a national security risk as the federal government cracks down on Chinese government influence within America's most prestigious institutions. Of those who were fired or resigned, 93% were receiving hidden funding from a Chinese institution, Science Magazine reported.The probe was launched in August 2018 by the NIH, a U.S. government medical research agency, to identify researchers who were receiving funding from the Chinese government. In the vast majority of cases, the person that was investigated on suspicions of foreign government ties has been an Asian man in his 50's, Michael Lauer, NIH's head of extramural research, told Science Magazine.Lauer added that it “is not surprising” that 82% of those being investigated are Asian because “that's who the Chinese target” in their foreign talent recruitment programs. Roughly three-quarters of the people under investigation had active NIH grants, and nearly half had at least two grants, the 285 active grants totaling $164 million, Science Magazine reported.The probe coincides with the Justice Department's investigations into individuals receiving federal grant money while accepting funding from Chinese universities and other government entities. A former employee of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation who had accepted $3.6 million from the NIH and $3 million in research funding from China, Dr. Qing Wang, was arrested and charged in May. (RELATED: Former Nonprofit Researcher Arrested For Hiding $3 Million In Chinese Funding While Accepting US Grants)Earlier this year, Charles Lieber, the chair of Harvard's Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, was charged with a similar crime, aiding the Chinese government and hiding his ties about accepting millions in funding.Link to ImageWinners of the 2012 Wolf Prize present their prize diplomas during an award ceremony in the Knesset (Israeli parliament) in Jerusalem on May 13, 2012.

(MENAHEM KAHANA/AFP/GettyImages)The NIH investigation found that 70% of the researchers had failed to disclose the receipt of a foreign grant, and 54% had failed to disclose participation in a foreign talent program.Foreign talent programs like the Thousand Talents Program, which Lieber was involved in, have resulted in violations of U.S. law, like espionage, theft of trade secrets, and grant fraud. Participants in the program are asked to recruit skilled individuals to the program on behalf of the Chinese government. Of the researchers who were investigated, only 9% had hidden ties to a foreign company, only 4% had an undisclosed foreign patent, and 5% were involved in a violation of the NIH's peer-review system, according to Science Magazine.Although 54 scientists have already lost their jobs due to their foreign government ties, 399 scientists remain “of possible concern” to the NIH, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has spotted 121 of them, or 30%. Of the scientists “of possible concern,” 251 have screened “positive,” 76 have screened “negative,” while 72 are “pending,” Science Magazine reported. Graphic The Chinese national flag flies at half-mast at the Bund to mourn victims of COVID-19 on April 04, 2020 in Shanghai, China.

All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; worldLength: 635 wordsByline: Mary Rose Corkery, Reporter, maryrose@dailycallernewsfoundation.orgBodyLink to ImageHackers linked to the Chinese government have been spying on Uighur Muslims in China since 2013 by hacking cell phone apps, according research from cybersecurity company Lookout. Lookout's research found that legitimate Android apps, such as religious Quran text apps used by Uighur Muslims, were hacked to include malicious code, Lookout security intelligence engineer Apurva Kumar told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an email.Other apps used to collect personal data from Uighur Muslim populations were keyboard, font, file-management and plugin apps, according to the research.Tibetans were also targeted by the same technology disguised as apps, such as a travel application called “Quick-Search Tibet,” Lookout reported. Tibetans are another minority that the Chinese government targets with “counter-terrorism” measures. The eight Android-surveillance technologies frequently hit malicious code in apps to extract information if a user accessed it.Other hacking tools extracted information by turning on location services, call and text tracing, and exported pictures from the cell phones, according to the New York Times. Lookout's research indicates the hacking has advanced and is more aggressive than studies by Google, Volexity and The University of Toronto's Munk School of Public Affairs' Citizen Lab found last fall.Kumar told the Times the malicious code in the applications was like “a predator.”“Wherever China's Uighurs are going, however far they go, whether it was Turkey, Indonesia or Syria, the malware followed them there,” Kumar told the NYT.“It was like watching a predator stalk its prey throughout the world.”Link to ImageAn ethnic Uighur woman walks in front of a giant screen with a picture of Chinese President Xi Jinping in the main city square in Kashgar in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, China September 6, 2018.

Chinese scientist accuses China and WHO of concealing dangers of Covid-19CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 12, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 557 wordsBodyChinese virologist Li-Meng Yan fled to the U.S. and said Beijing lies about covid-19 because it already knew the existence and danger of the new coronavirus, El Mundo reported Sunday.Yan said China and the World Health Organization (WHO) were aware of the existence and danger of the new coronavirus long before they officially announced the outbreak that occurred in Wuhan, China.Li-Meng Yan specializes in virology and immunology. She was one of the virologists tasked with studying coronavirus, until her findings led her to flee China to the United States.The newspaper cites an exclusive interview with Fox News, in which Li-Meng Yan reports on the reason for his departure from China and reveals that the Chinese authorities lied.The epidemiologist at The University of Public Health in Hong Kong planned the flight when she realized she had to escape and tell her everything she knew about the coronavirus and that her country would not leave it, writes El Mundo.Yan said the Chinese government knew of the existence and danger of the new coronavirus long before it officially announced the outbreak in Wuhan.He also reports that his superiors were silent and concealed their investigation in covid-19, whose findings could have helped save many lives, according to the text published in the newspaper."The reason I came to the United States is because I have to tell the truth about covid-19," she told Fox. "If I had told my story in China, I would have been missing or murdered," she said.According to the newspaper, the virologist assures that she was one of the first scientists in the world to study the new coronavirus. In late 2019, she received the mandate of her WHO supervisor and consultant, Leo Poon, who ordered her to conduct a secret investigation into the new SARS-like coronavirus that had appeared in China later that year."The Government of China refused to allow foreign experts, including those from Hong Kong, to investigate in China ... I then turned to my friends to gather more information," he explained.It was then that a friend, a scientist at china's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told him on December 31, 2019 that person-to-person transmission was a characteristic of the new coronavirus, which both China and WHO would recognize long after.A few days later, on January 9, 2020, who issued a statement: "According to the Chinese authorities, the virus in question can cause serious diseases in some patients and is not easily transmitted among people... There is limited information to determine the overall risk of this group."Yan's problems began when he warned the Government of the lethality and dangers of the new coronavirus long before China recognized the problem, the online edition of the newspaper reads."That's how they hid it," the scientist told Fox. From that moment on, he said, they tried to silence her by all means.What the virologist denounces is that the warnings that the world was facing a lethal and very dangerous virus were ignored and silenced by the Chinese authorities and also by the WHO.According to Yan, they both knew the danger long before they issued international alerts.The covid-19 pandemic has claimed more than 561,000 lives and affected more than 12.58 million people in 196 countries and territories, according to a report by French news agency AFP.Load-Date: July 13, 2020End of Document

Senate Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs Subcommittee Issues Testimony From Hudson Institute Fellow MeadTargeted News ServiceJuly 23, 2020 Thursday 8:51 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4442 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs subcommittee on Economic Policy issued the following testimony by Walter Russell Mead, distinguished fellow in strategy and statesmanship at the Hudson Institute, Global View columnist at The Wall Street Journal, and Chace professor of foreign affairs at Bard College, in a remote hearing entitled "U.S.-China: Winning the Economic Competition" on July 22:It is a great privilege to join you today to discuss the economic challenges the United States currently faces and will continue to face with regard to China.Today there is great concern over China's growing strength, its assertive behavior, and its potential to overtake the United States as the preeminent economic power in the world. Rising powers are often the cause of great concern to established powers like the United States. In the 1970's and 1980's, leaders in the United States looked on at Japan's growing economy with worry. The U.S. imposed tariffs on semiconductors and other products that were the focus of dumping allegations. In the run-up to the 1984 presidential election, Walter Mondale asked "What do we want our kids to do? Sweep up around the Japanese computers?" A growing trade deficit with Japan and concerns over the low valuation of the yen amplified worries in Europe and the United States.Unlike Japan, though, China does not accept the basic characteristics of the international system. More importantly, China does not share the same ambitions as Japan. In the recent past, China appeared to many observers to be a capitalist country operating within the global economic system with the common aspiration of expanding its economy and furthering its development. However, China's political and economic apparatus is controlled by the state's Communist Party. China must be thought of not as a developing nation working within the global economic system but as a communist country actively hostile to the current global economic system and world order. Because the Chinese government increasingly deploys the economic and financial tools at its command to undermine and subvert the American-led global system, every economic question about China is also a political one.China's Regression and the Current ThreatThe diagnosis is not in my view that there can be no decent relationship with a China ruled by the CCP. I would say rather that China under Xi Jinping has taken a wrong turn. The CCP has in the past been the instrument of a terrible despotism under Mao, and in the service of Mao's political and economic delusions, China lost several decades on the road to modernization and inflicted horrific suffering on itself.After Mao's death, the CCP leadership drew back from the brink. The fanatics behind the cruelties and distortions of the Cultural Revolution were removed from power, and a chastened CCP leadership took steps to prevent a return to the personalistic dictatorship of Mao even as it abandoned the madness and folly of his economic vision. Realizing that China needed to move toward a market economy and the institutionalization of power, they enacted a series of visionary reforms that raised living standards throughout the country while increasing the personal freedom of the Chinese people.Americans viewed this turn toward a more humane and successful approach to governance with respect and sympathy and hoped that continuing development would open the door to further economic and political development. Many Chinese, including senior figures in the CCP, shared this hope.Unfortunately, in recent years China has taken a different turn. Instead of continuing to evolve away from totalitarianism and personalistic rule, the CCP has regressed. The repression of Tibetans, Uighurs and others recall the atrocities of Mao's time, and the CCP inflicts the kind of degrading and humiliating control of intellectuals and civil society participants that limit China's development and lower its intellectual and cultural standards. Thoughtful voices calling for reform have been forced into silence or marginalized in today's China, but there is an internal opposition to the new hard line that might one day renew the promise of a better future for China's people.Tempted perhaps by the allure of the power that new surveillance technologies make possible, China's leadership seems ready to sacrifice the cultural and economic development of the Chinese people and of China's neighbors to entrench its own power and privilege. Ren Zhiqiang, a member of the CCP who has been known to criticize the state's censorship, has been missing since mid-March after he published an article that criticized Xi Jinping's leadership and referred to him as a "clown." In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has increased its censorship of social media.It is important to make clear that America's goal in our relationship with China cannot be to block its economic development or to dictate the course of its political development. The rise of China is a great moment in human history and we have no desire -- and we have no power -- to prevent more than one billion people from standing up.Nor should American policy be predicated on the destruction of the CCP. While under its present leadership and on its present course, the CCP is a threat to China's development and to world peace, there are healthy elements in the CCP who would like to steer China on a more sustainable course.Policy ConsiderationsThere are ways the United States can work to prevent a worst case-scenario and try to prevent US-China competition from boiling over into an all-consuming contest as difficult, as dangerous and as long as the Cold War, and we should explore them. But at the same time, we cannot delay dealing with the challenges China's behavior currently presents in the hope that American restraint would find an echo in Beijing. Certain changes in Beijing require responses in American policy and both condition and limit the opportunities to engage. There are six areas of concern I would like to highlight for you today.The first is that the CCP leadership not only seems to view harsh and even brutal crackdowns at home as necessary to its survival; it has also adopted international policies that undermine world peace, corrode the international trading system, limit the opportunities for economic development in many countries, and support harsh governments and dictators who need outside support to control their own unhappy people.The CCP leadership envisions Belt and Road as a means to not only offload the excess steel, concrete, and infrastructure that China produces, but also as a means of restructuring the global economic system around China's economic needs. Not only would their success undermine American economic competitiveness, it will also set back the development aspirations of the people in target countries, who will be trapped in a subservient relationship with China.Belt and Road is an extension of the Xi regime's efforts to return back to the Maoist concept of total penetration of the state. The purpose of China's foreign investments and infrastructure projects is to adjust the norms of the current international order to more closely align with the values of the CCP. As Elizabeth Economy noted in 2018, Xi has stated that "China should be capable of "constructing international playgrounds"--and "creating the rules" of the games played on them." Projects in Pakistan include the development of surveillance programs similar to those used in China and ventures to deliver Chinese media to Pakistani citizens. The CCP's goal is to make China indispensable for not just Pakistan's economy, but its security and society too.In 2018, Beijing established the China International Commercial Court (CICC) as part of the BRI to help resolve commercial disputes related to BRI projects. One can interpret this as an effort on the part of the CCP to safeguard its SOE's involved in BRI projects and force partner countries and foreign firms to adhere to Beijing's trade practices. While the BRI is marketed as a series of international development projects, it is clear that the CCP intends to use increased economic integration to challenge the current norms of the global economic order.Debt-trap diplomacy furthers China's efforts at drawing other countries into its orbit. Even before the advent of BRI, China carried out a policy of bilateral and opaque lending programs. According to the International Monetary Fund, the share of poor countries' debt held by China increased from 6.2% in 2013 to 11.6% in 2016. China has lent roughly $1.5 trillion to over 150 countries globally through loans and trade credits. This makes China the largest creditor in the world. However, it is unclear exactly how much China has lent and at what terms because China does not report on its loans and debtor countries often fail to report the data themselves. The Harvard Business Review completed a years-long analysis of China's lending practices and their data show that China lends at market terms, unlike traditional institutions such as the World Bank that offer countries in need easier terms than they can receive elsewhere. Chinese loans are also frequently backed by collateral. HBR found that the average stock of debt owed to China increased from less than 1% of a debtor nation's GDP to over 15% from 2005 to 2017. 12 countries owe 20% or more of their nominal GDP to China. Half of China's loans are unreported.These lending practices should be of great concern to the United States and its allies. Experts note that some BRI projects are unfeasible; Morgan Stanley predicts that by 2027 BRI expenses could reach $1.3 trillion. Poor countries that have accepted loans from China have already faced the consequences of default. Sri Lanka was unable to repay the loan to construct a port in Hambantota and allowed China to sign a 99-year lease for use of the port in exchange. Across Africa, nations in debt distress risk forfeiting strategic assets to China due to its lending practices.The CCP has made inroads into the developed world as well, particularly in Europe. Last year, Italy broke with the G-7 to endorse the BRI. Italy faces a projected GDP decline of 9.1% this year and is dissatisfied with the relief efforts of the European Commission. It is unlikely that, without a major aid package, Italy will reject future Chinese investment. Chinese firms already have a controlling stake in the Greek port of Piraeus and Italian ports, which are desperate to prevent Greece from taking their traffic, could welcome further Chinese ownership.China's Belt and Road Initiative and other predatory lending practices violate the standard and fair practices of development that international institutions such as the IMF and World Bank adhere to. While many of the BRI projects may not be completed, the initiative will, and has already, expand China's influence in poor countries as well as its material holdings. The BRI can be seen as part of the Xi regime's strategy to undermine the established global order and replace it with one that is more favorable to the CCP's principles.One of the great ironies of the post-Cold War era is that China's attempts to maintain state control over its growing economy has created many of the problems that doctrinaire Communists predicted would hasten the downfall of capitalism. Lenin believed that as capitalist countries became wealthier, their domestic economies would become awash with excess capital and production. Banks would chase increasingly precarious investments in factories that could never quite make enough profit to stay solvent, and the resulting economic collapse would pave the way for the revolution to bring true Communism to the industrial world.The only way to stave off the catastrophe was to find new markets for this extra capital and industrial capacity, which for Lenin was the true motive behind capitalist imperialism. The European powers built empires and extended their reach around the world in search of new projects for their bankers and new markets for their goods, but competition for the remaining virgin territories would become more intense, eventually leading to wars between the imperial powers.Capitalism eventually resolved this dilemma by increasing the purchasing power of each consumer and through the creation of a global market, but China has closed off this path to development and now has caught itself in Lenin's trap. Worse, decades of state directed over-investment in both manufacturing and infrastructure producing firms has produced powerful lobbies. Even a ruler as powerful as Xi Jinping can only restructure the Chinese economy away from heavy production and infrastructure spending by alienating powerful factions that could threaten his hold on power. From this perspective, Belt and Road is not just a geopolitical exercise for Beijing, but also a gamble to keep unproductive but important sections of the Chinese economy going as long as possible.In any case, the combination of a Leninist state-guided economy and an imperialist foreign policy forces the United States, among others, to treat China as something other than a "normal" market economy pursuing normal market competition.Under these conditions we can no longer treat trade as a purely economic question. Given China's clear interest in challenging other countries, other countries have no choice but to audit their supply chains for key materials to eliminate any strategic dependence on China and to protect themselves against Chinese technology that may be used for other purposes. Nor can our diplomats simply engage with China as a "normal country." Countries like China - and Russia - who have essentially declared themselves to be actively seeking to undermine American interests and countering American values - need to be taken at their word.The second problem involves the connection between state power and technological development. In a world driven increasingly by the logic and the power of the information revolution, China's attempts to reach technological supremacy through theft, illegal behavior and the elimination of competition pose direct security threats to other countries, including the United States. The CCP requires many foreign companies that wish to sell their products in China to partner with a Chinese firm and transfer their technology to their local partner, who often later becomes their competitor. Hackers and other actors affiliated with the Chinese government actively seek to steal American technology, acquiring everything from information about anti-submarine weapons to kernels of genetically-modified corn. Just yesterday, the U.S. government indicted two hackers for allegedly conspiring with the Chinese government to steal trade secrets related to our national defense and health care.While some have warned against erecting a "digital iron curtain" as tensions between the U.S. and China continue, there are legitimate reasons to be wary of cooperation with China on IT and of Chinese investment in telecommunications initiatives such as 5G in the U.S. and its allies. The CCP has demonstrated its willingness to use surveillance technologies for both espionage and for monitoring its citizens. China's domestic development and foreign investment strategies are both centered on the growth of its high-tech and IT sectors.China's focus on the development of surveillance, communications and artificial intelligence technologies is intimately connected to its ideological project. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has released research stating that "If our Party cannot traverse the hurdle represented by the internet, it cannot traverse the hurdle of remaining in power for the long term." Xi himself has stated his ambition for China to become a "cyber superpower." The ways in which China develops and uses these technologies is then of utmost relevance to how the U.S. should cooperate with or counter China.The use of advanced technologies to exert state control is central to Xi's mission. In 2015 at the World Internet Conference in the Zhejiang province, Mr. Xi called for "cyber sovereignty." Domestically this philosophy has been expressed through increased censorship and monitoring. As China continues to broaden its reach, we should expect CCP attempts to make other states adhere to its philosophy as well. The Chinese government recognizes as legitimate few, if any, restrictions on the state's use of technology to control its people.These threats must be addressed even at significant political and economic cost. China's trading partners must protect themselves against illicit practices by both state-owned and private firms in China, and they are entitled to exact retaliation by placing limits on Chinese business.The third problem posed by communist China's role in the world economy is that under the new system of hyper-centralized control that increasingly and sadly characterizes China today, distinctions between state-owned corporations and private business can no longer be taken at face value. The installation of party committees in both SOE's and private enterprises, in accordance with the 2012 constitution, gives the CCP immense influence. The extent of said influence within private businesses, unfortunately, is impossible to know. In 2017, more than two out of every three private sector companies in China had CCP officials working in their offices overseeing their activities.The Chinese government protects domestic companies from competitors by hamstringing foreign investors that want to invest in Chinese startups that could threaten the court favorites. Demanding hundreds of regulatory documents from potential investors, central and local governments create a complex and foreboding market for FDI. These restrictions are often successful in limiting competition in sectors of particular political interest to the CCP. While foreign investors whose projects are rejected may appeal, all approval authorities and People's Courts are under the control of the CCP. This limits any FDI that may conflict with the CCP's agenda.Chinese business and Chinese investors are under the thumb of the Chinese government. This necessarily reduces the willingness of foreign governments, including the American government, to treat them in the same way governments treat true private actors.The fourth issue that demands a response involves China's open efforts to infringe on the law of the sea and to make illegitimate territorial claims.By now, many are familiar with China's island-building campaign in the South China Sea, which is a vital artery of international commerce. International tribunals have ruled against the Chinese government's territorial claims, but the CCP has ignored those rulings. The Chinese navy, coast guard, and paramilitary naval units also regularly harass and attack civilian vessels in international or disputed waters, attack the naval and coast guard ships of neighboring countries, and further other Chinese attempts to exploit the natural resources of disputed territories at great cost to China's neighbors and the local environment.Creating instability in a region that one-third of global shipping traverses threatens global and American prosperity, but China's ambitions do not stop there. China makes and attempts to enforce territorial claims against other neighboring countries and is trying to claim a stake in theArctic Ocean as well, which could become both an important shipping route and a source of valuable natural resources in the coming decades.The fifth issue is that China's steady military buildup combined with its increased efforts to partner with countries like Russia and Iran have major implications for the American defense budget. We must scale up our efforts to ensure levels of primacy on land, at sea, in the air, in cyber and in space that deter any rivals from contesting. Some of this effort may require restructuring our forces to operate better in the vast and varied Indo-Pacific theater and to respond to new threats, such as the new aircraft carriers China is building rapidly. But other steps need to be taken that will have both military and non-military applications. Among these are investing in research and development to maintain the current American technological lead in fields like artificial intelligence as well as basic sciences in fields like biology that are likely to define the economies of the late twenty-first or even twenty-second centuries.China and Russia are working together to develop their AI capacities. In June of last year during Xi Jinping's visit to Russia, the two states announced a joint investment fund with a focus on funding AI research. It launched in September with a $1 billion budget. In December of 2019 Vladimir Putin signed a decree declaring 2020 "the year of Russian-Chinese Scientific, Technical and Innovation Cooperation." Chinese and Russian firms have cooperated on the development of facial recognition products and other AI technology. Last June, Huawei acquired the rights to Russian firm Vocord's facial recognition technology for $50 million. Vocord's website specifically highlights the surveillance applications of its technology in public spaces, while offering a tool for seeing "which relative your child most resembles." Huawei's vice president Jiang Tao has spoken of the construction of "an AI ecosystem" in Russia.While China and Russia have not announced cooperation on military AI, China has already exported unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) like the Rainbow CH-4 to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and elsewhere in the Middle East. Through its foreign investment strategy China has increased poor nations' dependency on it and increased its own assets including strategically-located ports and military bases. Through the Made in China 2025 strategy Beijing has directed the state-led economy toward high-tech innovation. Beijing now intends to export its products and philosophical model globally. China is furnishing militaries in the Middle East and exporting its surveillance technology to many parts of the world. There is a direct line connecting China's domestic development strategy to its geopolitical strategy that is focused on undermining the liberal order.Unlike the arms race of the Cold War, IT has dual uses. While the civilian applications of emerging technologies are lucrative and private enterprises ought to have the ability to expand their markets abroad, these technologies can be used by militaries and governments for ends that could pose a threat to national security.The sixth issue is that the new levels of repression currently being used against ethnic and religious minorities in China and the prospect of a further extension to other groups as yet only lightly targeted requires an international response. There are many elements of Chinese governance that Americans do not like, but we do not insist that Chinese practice conform to our ways or those of our Atlantic partners and friends in order to have normal relations. However, the systemic destruction of cultures and religious communities crosses a line that neither the United States nor other countries can ignore.China's attempts to silence or eradicate religious and ethnic minorities in China do not merely strengthen the elements within the CCP committed to a brutal and totalitarian vision of their country; they also leave the world poorer by depriving the Chinese and other people of the beauty, insight and wisdom created by these communities, many of which have been a part of China's heritage for centuries, if not longer. The high-tech repression the CCP is perfecting at home now will be used abroad in the future, to the detriment of both Americans and other peoples. Although the United States and its partners should not seek to overthrow the current Chinese government or attempt to force it to make structural changes that will threaten its survival, it is important to raise the costs of Chinese repression and impede its spread outside of China's borders.It is important to remember that the realities of our current conflict with China do not mirror those same challenges we faced in the Cold War the Soviet Union. Unlike with the Soviet Union, the economies of the U.S. and its allies are deeply connected to the Chinese economy. China remains the second largest economy in the world, to completely sever economic relations with it would have devastating implications for the U.S. Rather, we should focus on areas where we have mutual interests. Sectors that involve the production or development of security-sensitive technology should be encouraged to consider their level of interaction with China with care. In other sectors it will remain profitable to cooperate and trade.I would like to leave you with a couple of thoughts. We should take China and the challenges it poses seriously, but we think calmly and rationally about the relationship. China is not ten feet tall. It has achieved some remarkable, even historic, economic growth, but it lacks important factors needed for long term stability and success.Despite the heated, chest-thumping rhetoric from the so-called "wolf diplomats," China's leadership is worried about the future. In developing our policies in response to the China Challenge, we must understand these fears - not only because they point to strategic vulnerabilities which can be exploited, but because more importantly they point to factors and forces which could either prevent a full rupture between China and the United States or ensure that in the event of such a rupture the United States and its associates and allies would prevail.China's recent behavior raises significant concerns for the United States as well as for the global economic system that has raised hundreds of millions out of poverty in just a few decades. In response, the United States and its partners should push back against harmful Chinese actions while also encouraging the CCP to make choices that will enhance both Chinese wellbeing and global peace. China's behavior was more acceptable in the past, which means that it can be in the future. If a new Cold War must come, America can and must rise to the challenge. But we should not abandon all hope that wiser counsels will prevail in Beijing. Our goal is and should remain the construction of a relationship which promotes the prosperity and security of both the American and Chinese peoples.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7184571 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 23, 2020End of Document

AIDDATA SHEDS LIGHT ON CHINESE FOREIGN AIDStates News ServiceJuly 8, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 3832 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: Williamsburg, VA BodyThe following information was released by the College of William and Mary:by Leslie McCullough, University Advancement | July 8, 2020The following story originally appeared in the spring 2020 issue of the WandM Alumni Magazine. - Ed.China has established itself as an economic and military superpower. However, with relatively few formal alliances, it faces some major hurdles to international influence hurdles that it is now quietly working to overcome.AidData, a research lab based at William and Mary's Global Research Institute (GRI), will soon release a new dataset that sheds light on China's vast portfolio of grant- and loan-financed projects around the globe. The numbers are staggering.When Beijing first initiated its going out policy to promote Chinese investments abroad in 1999, it was primarily focused on encouraging Chinese enterprises to conduct business and make investments overseas.However, President Xi Jinping has recently refocused this policy toward high-profile projects that might help China gain a reputational advantage visa-vis other great powers. Now, as the international community struggles to understand the true scale and scope of China's checkbook diplomacy program, AidData is providing vital data and analysis.In 2013, China launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which arguably represents the most ambitious foreign infrastructure investment program in modern history. Many of its overland routes parallel those of the ancient Silk Road trading routes to the Middle East and Europe. BRI also involves a far-reaching set of investments in deep-water ports along the perimeter of the Indian Ocean.In order to fuel the initiative, Beijing has dramatically increased its overseas expenditure. This spending spree has not only created an opportunity to address unmet infrastructure needs in the developing world, but also to win the hearts and minds of citizens of foreign countries.Whether you like it or not, the era of great power competition is back. When the U.S. viewed itself as the only major superpower, it was less concerned about its ability to shape decisions in other countries, says Samantha Custer, director of AidData's Policy Analysis. Now, China is jockeying for influence in many different theaters, and there is substantially greater interest in understanding what it is doing, where and why.China's overseas spending now rivals that of the U.S., but very little was known about how and where this money was spent until AidData launched its research project eight years ago. Beijing considers the details of its overseas grant and loan program to be a state secret, which raises some critical questions: Is BRI a reputational asset or a liability? Does China's spending make U.S. foreign policy more or less effective? What does China's expanding financial footprint mean for the future balance of global power?To address any of these issues, one first needs to be able to answer a more fundamental question: where and how is China spending its international development dollars?Spending shrouded in secrecyIn 2011, when Austin Strange '12 asked this same question, he had no idea the eventual impact it would have on the world. As an undergraduate studying economics and Chinese language at William and Mary, Strange worked as a research assistant at AidData. Since 2004, AidData has facilitated innovative research projects that bring students and faculty together to solve global problems using rigorous methods and cutting-edge tools.AidData's Executive Director Brad Parks '03 and Co-Director of the Global Research Institute Michael Tierney '87 were interested in the same question, and they proposed that Strange pursue an independent study project. The result was the development of an open-source methodology to track international spending by opaque donors and lenders. The Tracking Underreported Financial Flows (TUFF) methodology provides a systematic way of tracking aid and debt from emerging powers such as China.Our team combs through millions of records in nearly a dozen languages to identify and investigate overseas projects funded by government ministries, state-owned banks and enterprises and subnational localities in China, says Parks.Our goal is to triangulate information on each project that the Chinese government is bankrolling with as many reliable sources as possible. We track down the grant and loan agreements published in the official gazettes and legislative repositories. We scrape all of the project-specific information that is posted on Chinese embassy websites. We review aid and debt information management systems of finance and planning ministries in host countries. We correspond directly with government officials, investigative journalists and contractors on the ground with firsthand knowledge about these projects. Then, after standardizing and synthesizing all of this information we're able to see the big picture the known universe of Chinese government-financed projects.Beijing's spending ranges from donations of trash cans and streetlights in Africa to billion-dollar loans to build power plants in Pakistan and Indonesia. All of this information is maintained in a centralized database that AidData manages and makes accessible to journalists, watchdog groups, government officials and anyone else who may want to use it.Initially funded through seed capital from William and Mary, this data collection and research program has attracted substantial funding from USAID, Humanity United, the MacArthur Foundation, Singapore's Ministry of Education and others.Since Austin completed his initial pilot project, AidData has built a team of more than 90 students, faculty and staff who use similar methods to study grants and loans from countries in the Persian Gulf, overseas investments by Russia and Beijing's public diplomacy efforts around the globe.While many countries report detailed information about overseas expenditures to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) in Paris, others, like China and Russia, do not follow the international reporting standards established by DAC.This lack of transparency raises questions about how the money is actually spent, says Parks. William and Mary has become a go-to source of data and analysis about where these donors and lenders are channeling their resources and how the projects that they fund affect socioeconomic, environmental and governance outcomes.New data, new insightsAidData began its research program by documenting China's financial footprint in Africa. Then, in 2017, it released an updated dataset, capturing more than $350 billion in grants and loans that supported approximately 4,300 projects across 138 countries and territories. Several years in the making, the dataset received global media coverage as the most comprehensive source of information on China's global development footprint ever assembled.The benefit of AidData is that it fills the gap between what is announced, what is promised and what gets delivered. I think it is very well recognized by both researchers and practitioners as being a reliable source of information, says former U.S. Secretary of Defense and WandM Chancellor Robert M. Gates '65, L.H.D. '98, who cites AidData's research in his newest book, Exercise of Power, which will be released this June and identifies weaknesses in the way that the U.S. government uses non-military instruments of power. Having a holistic approach to assistance, particularly when it comes to the Chinese, I think is really important.At the end of this year, AidData will release an updated global dataset that captures spending in 180-plus countries and territories through the end of 2018.Data collection is only part of the process. What we do with the data is far more important, says Custer. Much of the policy debate about China is guided by rhetoric and conjecture, not real numbers and facts.Custer believes that it's not AidData's role to provide opinions, but to provide data-driven analysis that allows others to make informed decisions.In the past, China's lack of transparency has forced policymakers in other countries to make decisions based on assumptions and anecdotes. But AidData is now able to fact-check these assumptions against hard evidence, says Custer. The expertise of AidData faculty, staff and students at William and Mary has drawn high-level officials from governments and international organizations around the world to Williamsburg to learn more about the underlying motivations for and impacts of China's global development spending spree.Revealing informationMore than 150 studies have now used data generated at William and Mary to evaluate the effects of Chinese development projects on literacy, infant mortality, economic growth and inequality, environmental degradation, corruption, debt sustainability and public opinion, among other things. Media organizations like The New York Times, NPR and The Economist regularly cite AidData's work. AidData's faculty and staff are frequently called upon to provide private briefings and expert analysis to decision-makers in Washington, D.C., London and Brussels.But some of the other beneficiaries of AidData's work may be surprising.You would think that if anyone knows what China is doing around the world, it would be the Chinese government itself, but Beijing is tight-fisted with information, says Custer. And we know that even government agencies, think tanks and university researchers inside China trust and use our data.With China shielding its project portfolio from public scrutiny, it can also be difficult for international aid agencies outside China to pinpoint areas of unmet need and avoid duplicating efforts. AidData seeks to bridge this informational gap and help governments and international organizations ensure that their resources are effectively and efficiently used.My view is that our own approach to developmental assistance needs to be dramatically revamped. But if we are going to do that, it needs to be based on real data in terms of what works, what doesn't work, what amounts are out there and what almost nobody does is connect what one or another group may be doing on the same problem in the same country, says Gates.Congressman Ander Crenshaw and Congressman Adam Smith, who previously served as the cochairs of the Congressional Caucus on Effective Foreign Assistance, have said that AidData's work to pinpoint the locations of aid projects, identify gaps in service delivery, and prevent duplication across donors is the type of foundational work that will make U.S. foreign assistance more efficient and effective in the long-term.Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has echoed this point, noting that when you look at AidData's spatial maps, you can better tell where aid was needed and change your targeting strategy, instead of funding activities in the same parts of the country, time and time again. The data provides a valuable guide for decision-makers to see where all the work is concentrated so they know where they can have the most impact.AidData's work also assists leaders in low-income and middle-income countries, such as Nepal and the Maldives. China's assistance programs are often highly fragmented across multiple agencies and layers of the government. The data gives those receiving assistance from China more transparent information about the projects it funds.Chinese development finance is extremely complex to navigate. It involves many different projects with varying terms and conditions, says Custer. This complexity, combined with limited transparency, makes it difficult for countries borrowing from China to know exactly how much they owe and opens the door to potential corruption and abuse.In the midst of the global financial downturn stemming from COVID-19, countries may see their economies contract in ways that make servicing their debt burden to China unsustainable. Meanwhile, China's own economic constraints from the crisis may make it less willing to negotiate new terms, which could further exacerbate a potential global depression.Building indebtednessWhile many people assume that China's foreign aid program is new, that is not the case. Dating back to the 1950s, China provided assistance via grants and lowor no-interest loans for smaller projects. But China's overseas development program has now changed in two important ways.AidData has demonstrated that, over the last two decades, China has dramatically increased its spending on big-ticket physical infrastructure projects such as roads, railways, ports, power plants, electricity grids and telecommunication networks.Since many Western aid agencies, like USAID, primarily focus on issues such as public health, democracy and human rights, developing countries increasingly look to China for help with their infrastructure needs. In fact, AidData has shown that nearly 90 percent of China's overseas spending focuses on infrastructure.With nearly 60 variables in its data set, AidData provides unique insight into the ways in which China designs and implements these overseas projects. In addition to information about the size, purpose, location and status of each Chinese project, AidData tracks contractual terms and conditions. For example, if a project is supported by a loan, what is the interest rate? How long does the borrower have to repay the loan? Did the lender agree to a grace period before repayment begins?What you can see in our data is that China has pivoted toward less concessional and more commercially oriented lending, says Custer. It used to mostly offer grants and interest-free loans. But now we are seeing more of an emphasis on lending at market or close-to-market rates.However, while working with China may cost more in financial terms, leaders in lowand middle-income countries still find Beijing to be an attractive partner in two respects. First, China does not demand involvement in the borrowing country's government with regard to the economy, fighting corruption, increasing transparency or protecting human rights. Second, China is one of the few foreign powers that is willing to bankroll large-scale infrastructure projects, which many countries view as critical to spurring the growth of their economies.Yet this growing enthusiasm to borrow from China has also triggered intense debate about the potential downsides for recipient countries down the road. What happens if a country can't repay a Chinese government-backed loan? Sri Lanka's experience in 2017 serves as a cautionary tale. When Sri Lanka had difficulty servicing its debts for the Hambantota Port Development Project, China eventually took over the port and 15,000 acres around it, an arrangement that will be in place for 99 years.Sri Lanka's inability to repay its debts was not solely because of China, but the Hambantota Port story underscores the importance of why leaders and citizens alike need more information about the terms of these deals, says Custer. How many of these loans are backed up by collateral, and if a borrowing country defaults, what happens next? Will China seize strategically important assets?The public backlash around the Hambantota port deal was also a powerful lesson for Chinese leaders that their high-profile infrastructure projects are a double-edged sword. On the one hand, says Custer, these financing deals can give China implicit leverage with foreign leaders when it comes to an important vote in the United Nations or a trade agreement with preferential terms for Chinese companies. On the other hand, local perceptions of China can change dramatically over time if the promised benefits from a project are not delivered or the costs begin to outweigh the benefits.With the data that AidData produces, researchers are beginning to answer key questions.A new colonial power?What is motivating China's growing presence in the development finance market, and what does it get out of it?Some politicians, journalists and scholars argue that China is a neo-colonial power using its economic clout to buy influence with other countries, says Custer. Regardless of whether you buy this argument, it does raise an important question about what China hopes to achieve by backing major development projects in other countries.Through AidData's new dataset, researchers can answer this question by investigating the profiles of countries that seem to get more grants and loans from China.It is not necessarily the case that the poorest countries and subnational localities get the most financial support or the most favorable deals, says Custer. AidData has shown that China finances an unusually high number of projects in the hometowns of presidents and prime ministers. It has also demonstrated that when countries vote with Beijing in the United Nations General Assembly, they get extra cash from China.Beyond its pursuit of commercial advantages and foreign policy concessions, China is clearly interested in winning hearts and minds. It often bankrolls high-profile projects with substantial media fanfare inrecipient countries.These projects have garnered Beijing publicity and praise from citizens and leaders in lowand middle-income countries that view partnership with China as a gateway to economic development. At the same time, a growing number of media articles highlighting waste, fraud and abuse associated with Chinese-government backed development projects have put Beijing on the defense and forced it to justify how its investments benefit local communities.U.S. implicationsChina is now a major player in the international development finance market, but its profile is quite different from that of the United States. The U.S. primarily gives grants to tackle challenges related to public health, disaster response and democratic governance, while China mostly provides loans for big-ticket infrastructure projects.According to Custer, If you look at aid in the strict sense of the term, the U.S. gave four times as much as China to other countries between 2000 and 2014. But when you consider all types of government financing, China and the U.S. look like spending rivals.China provided $354 billion during this period, and the U.S. gave $370 billion.When we update our figures through 2018 at the end of this year, we may see that China is actually outspending the U.S., says Custer.This new reality raises critical questions for U.S. leaders when they think about the future of development assistance as part of America's broader foreign policy toolkit. Are there constructive ways in which the U.S. can engage with China to ensure that its lending maximizes the benefits and minimizes the risks to recipient countries? Or should the U.S. seek to counter or compete with China's growing influence in lowand middle-income countries as a threat to American interests?Regardless of the answer, China's prominence as a player in the development finance market is not something that the U.S. can or should ignore. At a minimum, it needs to learn from what China is doing, but it may also need to rethink its existing strategies.Comparative advantageWe are not in a unipolar world anymore, says Custer. China has clearly demonstrated that it has the means and motivation to deploy the power of its purse to advance its interests in ways that may or may not be aligned with the U.S. and its allies. In practice, this means that U.S. leaders will need to determine how best to engage with China as a financier of development in ways that safeguard U.S. interests and those of developing countries.One potential way forward is to explore avenues for closer cooperation with China, such as through co-financing of development projects in areas of common interest, as a way of nudging Beijing to play by established global standards, rules and accountability systems.If we don't create space for an emerging China to be at the table as an equal player, then they will continue to work around prevailing international rules with limited transparency, says Custer.However, if the U.S. wants to preserve its own influence, it also needs to consider why countries are so keen to work with China. By undertaking surveys of decision-makers in more than 125 countries around the globe, AidData has uncovered evidence that aid donors are more influential when they align their assistance with the priorities of recipient countries. In this respect, the U.S. would do well to be more responsive to the interests of lowand middle-income countries in developing robust infrastructure.At the same time, Custer acknowledges, I don't know that the U.S. is in a position to outcompete China in terms of infrastructure investment, but what it can do is make sure that recipient countries are not opening themselves up to undue influence as a result of runaway debt or projects that inadvertently worsen social and environmental standards. That's not only bad for those countries, but also for U.S. interests.To that end, the U.S. could potentially play a constructive role in helping countries on the receiving end of China's largesse to strengthen their accountability systems to more effectively manage public debt, negotiate deals with more favorable terms and conditions and ensure that infrastructure projects are implemented in careful and sustainable ways. The U.S. could also consider investing in things like a recipient country's independent media that can engage in investigative journalism to open up space for debate and discussion about these agreements and projects.Path forwardSome U.S. politicians emphasize investments in defense at the expense of diplomacy and development, but others argue that this approach is wrongheaded because it will undermine U.S. leadership on the global stage.If we're going to be successful in this long-term rivalry with China . . . we're going to have to redevelop, and in new ways, reimagine these non-military instruments of power in order to compete with things like China's One Belt One Road' plan, says Gates. I think that the biggest concern I have is that even though we now have a bipartisan understanding that China is a challenge for us, we have no strategy. Where do we want this relationship to be in five or 10 or 15 years and, more broadly, how do we counter the Chinese in all the different areas where competition is going to take place?One thing is clear, says Custer. The size of China's overseas development program can't be ignored. If it continues to provide large-scale financing behind closed doors, there are real risks that the U.S. will get displaced and China will have undue influence. It is already beginning to happen and nobody's watching.Until now. The upcoming release of AidData's newest global dataset will shine a bright light on the true scale and scope China's overseas spending and reinforce William and Mary's position as a leader in global development research.Load-Date: July 10, 2020End of Document

Twitter to close thousands of accounts in China and Zoom folds to Beijing demandsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 12, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 620 wordsBodyTwitter announced that it will close tens of thousands of accounts that publish content deemed propaganda and disinformation related to China's government, while its compatriot Zoom acknowledged that it has folded into Beijing's demands to suspend human rights defenders' accounts in the United States and Hong Kong.Twitter, such as YouTube, Google and Facebook, are banned in China, which, with a "great computer wall," blocks undesirable content. But, on the other hand, Chinese diplomats and state media flood these platforms with messages.On Friday, Twitter noted that it had disabled a "core" of 23,750 accounts linked to China and broadcast by another 150,000 accounts that serve as "amplifiers". Its contents have been stored in a database for scientific research, the company noted.The network of Chinese accounts was discovered using tools installed last August to delete Beijing-linked accounts during pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.Read plus: The film "Gone with the Wind" was removed from HBO after protests against racismThat network posted tweets, mainly in Chinese and probably destined for the diaspora, "spreading favorable geopolitical theories to the Chinese Communist Party, while supporting misleading theories about political dynamics in Hong Kong," Twitter explained in an analysis note.These thousands of accounts have also served to promote Beijing's views on the fight against coronavirus and anti-racist protests in the United States, said Australian expert group ASPI, which analyzed the flow of tweets."While the Chinese Communist Party does not allow the Chinese people to use Twitter, our analysis shows that it does not hesitate to use it to spread propaganda and misinformation internationally," said an ASPI manager, Fergus Hanson.Most of the messages were written during Chinese business hours, especially during the week, which "clearly suggests a lack of authenticity and coordination," according to ASPI.This massive account suppression is the second offensive in a year by U.S. tech companies to curb the networks of influence attributed to the Chinese government.Chinese demandsIn August 2019, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter already deleted thousands of accounts to tackle the Chinese authorities' campaign to discredit the pro-democracy mobilization in Hong Kong. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said it was "unaware of the situation."In its announcement on Friday, Twitter also claimed to have closed 7,340 Turkish accounts, a network detected in early 2020 and mostly dedicated to the promotion of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and 1,152 linked to Russia.The position of Western platforms on the demands of authoritarian governments, whose countries also represent important markets, is in the crosshairs of public opinion.The Zoom video conferencing application, which has become popular during the governing imposed by the coronavirus, is at the heart of a debate on freedom of expression.On Thursday night, the U.S. company acknowledged that it bound to the demands of the Chinese government and closed three accounts of prominent human rights militants in the United States and Hong Kong who wanted to use its application to commemorate China's brutal Tiananmen crackdown in 1989.For Zoom, this answer "was a failure" and "noshould have affected users outside mainland China."The accounts were reactivated and Zoom announced that it promises technological tools to limit governments' demands to limit activities they deemed illegal to limit to the territory of the country."Zoom will not allow Chinese government demands to have an impact outside mainland China," he said.Read plus: The film "Gone with the Wind" was removed from HBO after protests against racismLoad-Date: June 13, 2020End of Document

Twitter deletes over 170,000 accounts linked to the Chinese governmentCNN WireJune 12, 2020 Friday 9:27 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 528 wordsDateline: (CNN Business) Body (CNN Business) --  Twitter announced Thursday that it had shut down more than 170,000 accounts tied to the Chinese government. Experts working with Twitter who reviewed the accounts said they pushed deceptive narratives around the Hong Kong protests, Covid-19, and other topics.The company said the accounts were "spreading geopolitical narratives favorable to the Communist Party of China" and were removed for violating its platform manipulation policies. Twitter's takedown is the latest development in Silicon Valley's attempt to thwart governments using social media platforms to push narratives in their favor. Twitter is officially blocked in China, though many people in the country are able to access it using a VPN. Among the targets of the Chinese campaign were overseas Chinese "in an effort to exploit their capacity to extend the party-state's influence," according to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a group Twitter worked with to analyze the accounts. Twitter said the accounts tweeted "predominantly in Chinese languages."Renee DiResta, research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory, who also analyzed the accounts, said that many of those that posted about Covid-19 throughout the spring had only been set up in late January. "Narratives around Covid," the SIO wrote in its analysis, "praise China's response to the virus while tweets also use the pandemic to antagonize the U.S. and Hong Kong activists."Twitter said it had identified 23,750 accounts it described as a "highly engaged core network" that were used to tweet content favorable to Beijing and a further 150,000 accounts that were used to amplify the content, for example, by retweeting content posted by core accounts.The 23,750 accounts collectively tweeted 348,608 times, according to the researchers at Stanford. Twitter said many of the accounts had been identified early and therefore had low follower counts and low engagement. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday questioned the basis for the removal of the accounts."If Twitter really wants to do something they should shut those coordinated and organized accounts that attack and smear China," said Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for the ministry. "China is the largest victim of disinformation, [and] we are against the spreading of disinformation."This is not the first such action taken by Twitter. In August 2019, the company removed just under 1,000 accounts believed to be operating within mainland China for "deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in Hong Kong."The company also announced Thursday that it had shut down accounts tied to Russia and Turkey.Twitter found more than 1,000 accounts that promoted the ruling United Russia party.In Turkey, a network of 7,340 accounts posted content favorable of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's AK Parti. Stanford researchers said the accounts had tweeted 37 million times.Tweets from many of the accounts Twitter shut down will be posted by the company to an archive where they can be studied.-- Isaac Yee contributed to this report.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

How China Steals From the U.S. Right in the OpenNewsweek.comJune 21, 2020 Sunday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 661 wordsByline: Newt GingrichHighlight: The Chinese Communist Party is the number one geopolitical threat for the U.S. in the 21st century.BodyFor years, China has invested in American universities in various ways, donating millions of dollars, collaborating with academics and setting up cultural centers. Each tactic is part of a broader strategy of the Chinese government to compete with the United States by buying influence and conducting espionage at these schools. Many Chinese contributions are listed as coming from anonymous donors, a practice that experts say is an easy tactic that allows Beijing to penetrate America's educational system. The issue of Chinese influence on American campuses through investments is alarming, especially because of the lack of transparency.Fortunately, the U.S. government is ramping up its scrutiny of China's activities at American universities. The results of the Trump administration's ongoing efforts have been crucial but troubling, revealing a nefarious campaign by the Chinese Communist Party. To make matters worse, the American people know very little about what China is doing.I decided to examine this urgent issue in this week's episode of my podcast, "Newt's World." My guest is Andrew Lelling, the U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts. He is at the forefront of the government's efforts to counter the Communist Party's influence at our educational institutions.One of the schools most targeted by China is in Lelling's backyard: Harvard. The elite university has received tens of millions of dollars from China in contracts and gifts in recent years. Just in January, the Department of Justice announced that Dr. Charles Lieber, chair of the department of chemistry and chemical biology, was arrested and charged with one count of making a materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statement about his involvement with China. And            according to a former scholar at Harvard, the school            shut down a panel discussion on human rights in China in 2015 because it was around the same time the president of Harvard was meeting with Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party.China's investments, in both money and time building relationships, seemed to pay off.I recently received a briefing from the team at the Department of Education focusing on these issues and was amazed at the hostility and unwillingness of the universities to release information on who's giving them money. A provision in the Higher Education Act requires universities to report publicly when they receive more than $250,000 from a foreign source. Yet these schools are fighting to avoid following the law, saying such information is confidential and proprietary. As Lelling told me, it is in the public interest to know if a foreign power, especially a hostile one, is pouring money into your local university to gain influence.One of the most challenging things about China's bid for influence at American universities is that most of it is legal. Beijing sees where there's a strategic gap that needs to be filled, especially in a technological field, finds an academic with the right expertise to fill that gap, and offers him or her a ton of money to collaborate on some project. Meanwhile, every institution in China is ultimately controlled by the Communist Party, so whatever expertise this professor provides to some lab will just go to the Chinese government.China's strategy is simple, effective and dangerous. And the Communist Party is implementing it on campuses across the United States.I urge you to listen to this week's episode to learn more about this pressing issue, which threatens both our national security and the integrity of our educational system. And I hope you will listen to my next episode, set to air Wednesday, when I will talk with Congressman Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA) about a new bill he just introduced to counter China's nefarious activities on American soil.To read, hear and watch more of Newt's commentary, visit Gingrich360.com.The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.Link to ImageGraphic Chinese President Xi JinpingAndrea Verdelli/Getty ImagesChinese President Xi JinpingLoad-Date: June 21, 2020End of Document

National Security Advisor O'Brien Issues Remarks on Chinese Communist Party's Ideology, Global AmbitionsTargeted News ServiceJune 27, 2020 Saturday 7:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4421 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: PHOENIX, Arizona BodyThe White House issued the following remarks on June 24 by National Security Advisor Robert C. O'Brien on Chinese Communist Party's ideology and global ambitions:Well, thank you Governor. That was an extraordinarily kind introduction and for thinking of Kayla and her parents. We had them at the State of the Union. That was a very special occasion for the President and for all of us as Americans. What happened to Kayla should never happen to anyone, especially Americans. Thank you for remembering her today and for the support you have given her family. It is great to be here in Phoenix. Congratulations on the TSMC factory that is coming to Arizona. I can tell you there are 49 other governors that are a little jealous of Governor Ducey at this point. What a tremendous accomplishment for your administration and it's great for our national security to bring our supply chain home, especially when we are dealing with critical technology, computer chips, dual-use chips, that are not only important to our civilian world--the phones we use, the computers we use, the dishwashers, the refrigerators we use--but also to our military. You have some great aerospace companies who are doing work in Arizona that are going to benefit from having their suppliers closer to home. Congratulations to the people of Arizona.It is wonderful to be here at the Arizona Commerce Authority. Congratulations to you as well for the excellent support you gave the governor and his administration in not only bringing the Taiwanese here but also many other manufacturing companies returning to America are coming to Arizona--great weather, sunshine. It is wonderful again to be back here on the west coast. Other folks around the world are coming to Arizona and the American West to see there is a whole other part to this country outside of Washington, D.C. and New York. As manufacturing returns to this country, Arizona will be at the top of their list. So congratulations, Governor.I bring you greetings from the 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. I know he was here yesterday. It is privilege to follow in his wake. I think there is some other good news; you will be having the Vice President of the United States Mike Pence, my close friend, whose office is down the hall, will be here next week.I appreciate the kind invitation to come discuss an issue of great importance to American national security with you, Governor and your colleagues here in Arizona:--the challenge the Chinese Communist Party poses to the United States and our allies is of critical importance to us right now. My remarks are the first of several speeches senior Administration officials will give on this matter over the next few weeks. You will soon hear from Secretary of State Pompeo, Attorney General Barr, and FBI Director Chris Wray on the subject.America, under President Trump's leadership, has finally awoken to the threat the Chinese Communist Party's actions and the threat they pose to our very way of life. For decades, conventional wisdom in both U.S. political parties, the business community, academia, and media, has held that it was only a matter of time before China would become more liberal, first economically and, then, politically. The more we opened our markets to China, the thinking went, the more we invested capital in China, the more we trained PRC bureaucrats, scientists, engineers, and even military officers, the more China would become like us.It was under this premise that we welcomed China into the World Trade Organization in 2001 with vast concessions and trade privileges. We downplayed China's gross human rights abuses, including Tiananmen Square. We turned a blind eye to China's widespread technology theft that eviscerated entire sectors of the American economy.As China grew richer and stronger, we believed, the Chinese Communist Party would liberalize to meet the rising democratic aspirations of its people. This was a bold, quintessentially American idea, born of our innate optimism and by the experience of our triumph over Soviet Communism. Unfortunately, it turned out to be very naive.We could not have been more wrong--and this miscalculation is the greatest failure of American foreign policy since the 1930s. How did we make such a mistake? How did we fail to understand the nature of the Chinese Communist Party?The answer is simple: because we did not pay heed to the CCP's ideology. Instead of listening to what CCP leaders were saying and reading what they wrote in their key documents, we closed our ears and our eyes. We believed what we wanted to believe--that the Party members were communist in name only.Let us be clear, the Chinese Communist Party is a Marxist-Leninist organization. The Party General Secretary Xi Jinping sees himself as Josef Stalin's successor. In fact, as the journalist and former Australian government official John Garnaut has noted, the Chinese Communist Party is the last "ruling communist party that never split with Stalin, with the partial exception of North Korea." [1] Yes, Stalin - the man whose brutal dictatorship and disastrous policies killed roughly 20 million Russians and others through famine, forced collectivization, executions, and labor camps. As interpreted and practiced by Lenin, Stalin, and Mao, communism is a totalitarian ideology.Under communism, individuals are merely a means to be used toward the achievement of the ends of the collective nation state. Thus, individuals can be easily sacrificed for the nation state's goals. Individuals do not have inherent value under Marxism-Leninism. They exist to serve the state; the state does not exist to serve them.These ideas sound remote and outdated to us. They are, after all, old ideas--they were born a century and a half ago in Europe. They were implemented a century ago by Russia, and then discarded 30 years ago as the most costly failed political experiment in history. But in China, these ideas remain as fundamental to the Chinese Communist Party as the Constitution and the Bill of Rights do to us as Americans.The Chinese Communist Party seeks total control over the people's lives. This means economic control, it means political control, it means physical control, and, perhaps most importantly, it means thought control."In Classical Chinese statecraft," Garnaut has noted, "there are two tools for gaining and maintaining control over 'the mountains and the rivers': the first is wu (?), weapons and violence, and the second is wen (?), language and culture. Chinese leaders have always believed that power derives from controlling both the physical battlefield and the cultural domain." [2] "For Lenin, Stalin, Mao and Xi," Garnaut writes, "words are not vehicles of reason and persuasion. They are bullets. Words are for defining, isolating, and destroying opponents." [3]Propaganda plays a central political role for the CCP. Beijing's efforts to dominate political thought are stated openly and pursued aggressively. In 1989, the party began organizing itself around 'ideological security,' a term repeated frequently since then by CCP leaders. More recently, in April 2013, the Party issued a policy on what they call the "current state of ideology." [4] It held that there should be, "absolutely no opportunity or outlets for incorrect thinking or viewpoints to spread." [5]So within China, this approach means mandatory study sessions on Communist ideology and the required download and use of smartphone apps that teach so-called "Xi Jinping Thought." It means complete control of all state media. Outside sources of information are banned--from foreign newspapers to Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp. All content generated within China is censored. It means jailing everyone from citizen bloggers, reporters, and lawyers to activists and religious believers for expressing any views contrary to the Party line.And indeed, just recently, between January 1 and April 4 of this year, nearly 500 individuals were charged with crimes just for speaking out about the Wuhan coronavirus, its effects upon the Party, and the Party's cover-up of the disease. [6]The Chinese Communist Party reinterprets religious texts, including the Bible, to support communist party ideology. It locks up millions of Muslim Uyghurs and other minorities in reeducation camps where they are subjected to political indoctrination and forced labor, while their children are raised in Party-run orphanages. This process annihilates family, religion, culture, language, and heritage of the people who are caught up in these camps. Under the Chinese Communist Party, information is tightly controlled and expression is constantly surveilled, so that it can be quashed or shaped by the state.Americans should be concerned. We should not be concerned only for the Chinese people but for ourselves. Xi Jinping's ambitions for ideological control are not limited to his own people. The CCP's stated goal is to create a "Community of Common Destiny for Mankind," and to remake the world according to the CCP. The effort to control thought beyond the borders of China is well under way.Over the past decade, the Party has invested billions of dollars into overseas propaganda operations to great effect.[7] The CCP has moved to eliminate 'unfriendly' Chinese language media outlets worldwide, and is close to succeeding. Nearly every Chinese language news outlet in the U.S. is either owned by, or works closely with the Party--and it is making inroads into English language media as well. There are more than a dozen radio stations in cities across the country where Americans hear subtle pro-Beijing propaganda on their FM radio.Recently, Chinese propaganda persuaded so many Americans that a U.S. solider had brought the coronavirus to Wuhan--as opposed to Wuhan sending the virus to the rest of the world (a complete fabrication by the CCP) that this soldier and her family needed a personal security detail to protect them from death threats. This situation occurred in Maryland.On TikTok, a Chinese-owned social media platform with over 40 million American users--probably a lot of your kids and younger colleagues- accounts criticizing CCP policies are routinely removed or deleted.Last week, Twitter announced the suspension of more than 23,000 CCP linked accounts for spreading propaganda on Hong Kong and COVID-19. This latest suspension was in addition to last August's removal of more than 150,000 CCP linked accounts that were used to spread anti-American disinformation and generate the illusion of popular support for Beijing's policies in the United States. These are just the accounts Twitter caught. How many are still out there undetected?In March, the CCP expelled American journalists working for the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post, almost fully eliminating independent reporting from within China on the Wuhan virus.In addition to influencing what information American citizens receive regarding China, the CCP is increasingly using its leverage to police American speech. When the University of California at San Diego hosted the Dalai Lama as a commencement speaker in 2017, Beijing banned Chinese students from visiting UCSD on government funds.When the general manager of the Houston Rockets tweeted his support for the peaceful Hong Kong protesters, the CCP announced its team's games would not be shown on Chinese TV and used its economic power to pressure others in basketball, including star players, to criticize the tweet on behalf of Beijing.Under pressure from the CCP, Marriott, and American, Delta, and United Airlines all removed references to Taiwan from their corporate websites. Mercedes Benz even apologized for posting an inspirational quote from the Dalai Lama on social media.Beijing has used its financial might and market access to pressure Hollywood into self-censorship, incentivizing directors and producers to avoid topics that might not make it past the country's censors in China. For example, the Japanese and Taiwanese flags were dropped from Tom Cruise's flight jacket in the upcoming Top Gun sequel "Maverick." MGM digitally changed the identities, post-production, of the invading military from China to North Korea in the "Red Dawn" remake.The CCP is seeking leverage over individual Americans as well. The Party is collecting your most intimate data--your words, your actions, your purchases, your whereabouts, your health records, your social media posts, your texts, and mapping your network of friends, family, and acquaintances.The CCP accomplishes this goal, in part, by subsidizing hardware, software, telecommunications, and even genetics companies. As a result, corporations such as Huawei and ZTE undercut competitors on price and install their equipment around the globe at a loss. This has the side effect of putting out of business American manufacturers of telecom hardware and has made it very difficult for Nokia and Ericsson. Why do they do it? Because it is not telecom hardware or software profits the CCP are after, it is your data. They use "backdoors" built into the products to obtain that data.When the Chinese Communist Party cannot buy your data, it steals it. In 2014, the CCP hacked Anthem insurance, collecting sensitive information on 80 million Americans. In 2015, the CCP hacked the Office of Personnel Management, which holds security clearance information, acquiring sensitive data on 20 million Americans who work for the federal government. In 2017, it hacked Equifax, obtaining the names, birthdates, social security numbers, and credit scores of 145 million Americans.In 2019, the CCP hacked Marriot, gathering information on 383 million guests, including their passport numbers. And, in 2016, a Chinese company even bought the dating app Grindr to harvest its data, including the HIV status of users, before the U.S. government forced a divestiture on national security grounds. These are just a few of the instances we know about.How will the Chinese Communist Party use this data? In the same way it uses data within China's borders: to target, to flatter, to cajole, to influence, to coerce, and to even blackmail individuals to say and do things that serve the Party's interests. This is 'micro targeting' beyond an advertiser's wildest dreams. China, unlike advertisers, will not be stopped by government regulations. The Chinese Communist Party simply wants to know everything about you--just as it likes to know almost everything about every individual living in China.In addition to propaganda and influence operations, the Chinese Communist Party uses trade to coerce compliance with its dictates. When Australia called for an independent investigation of the coronavirus' origins and spread, the Chinese Communist Party threatened to stop buying Australian agricultural products and to prevent Chinese students and tourists from traveling to Australia. When Australia refused to relent, Beijing put these threats into force, imposing an 80% tariff on Australian barley exports.International organizations are also part of China's plan. China has sought leadership positions within many global bodies. China now heads four out of fifteen UN specialized agencies, more than the U.S., UK, France, and Russia, the other members of the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, combined. The PRC uses these leaders to force the international bodies to parrot Beijing's talking points and to install Chinese telecommunications equipment in their facilities.For example, since Zhao Houlin of the International Telecommunications Union took his post he began to aggressively promote Huawei sales. Secretary-General Fang Liu of the International Civil Aviation Organization has blocked Taiwan's participation in General Assembly meetings and covered up a Chinese hack of the organization. The Party has used China's membership on the UN Human Rights Council to prevent criticism of its abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.The CCP's reach extends to heads of international organizations who are not themselves Chinese officials. Under Beijing's thumb, and at an unacceptable cost to human life, Director-General Tedros of the World Health Organization dutifully used Chinese talking points on the Wuhan virus. As late as mid-January, he claimed there was no human-to-human transmission of the disease. He opposed international travel restrictions. At the same time, Tedros praised China's own domestic travel restrictions on Wuhan residents. In other words, they could travel overseas, but they could not travel and potentially take the virus to Beijing or Shanghai. These CCP tactics in international organizations, as we have seen with the coronavirus, are a major cause of concern not just for the United States, but to the world.The good news is that under President Trump's leadership, we know what the CCP is doing, we are calling it out, and we are taking decisive action to counter it across the board. [8]First, President Trump prevented certain companies that answer to the CCP's intelligence and security apparatus--such as Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei--from accessing our personal and private data. [9] The Administration also imposed restrictions on U.S. semiconductor technology from going to Huawei.[10]Second, the State Department designated the U.S. operations of 9 Chinese state-controlled propaganda outlets as foreign missions.[11] These organizations are the mouthpieces of the Chinese Communist Party. This designation places reporting requirements and visa restrictions on these so-called media outlets.Third, President Trump imposed export restrictions on 21 Chinese government entities and 16 Chinese companies complicit in China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, forced labor and high-technology surveillance against Uyghurs and other minorities, and we have blocked officials complicit in these abuses from travelling to the United States. [12] The Administration has also stopped the illegal import of goods produced by Chinese companies known to use Uyghur forced labor.[13]Fourth, President Trump left the United Nations Human Rights Council to protest its cooptation by China.[14] He has terminated the U.S. relationship with the World Health Organization, because its response to the pandemic showed that it is beholden to China.[15] Instead of funding the corrupt WHO in Geneva with over $400 million per year, the United States and its generous taxpayers will send that money directly to where it is needed most--frontline healthcare workers serving in developing countries around the world.Fifth, President Trump limited the People's Liberation Army's ability to use student visa programs to place its officers and employees in our colleges and universities to steal U.S. technology, intellectual property, and information.[16]Sixth, the President moved to halt the investment of U.S. federal employee retirement funds into PRC companies, including Chinese military contractors and manufacturers of surveillance equipment used to oppress religious minorities. [17] He is examining the opaque accounting practices of Chinese companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges. [18]This week, the Defense Department is submitting to Congress a list of People's Liberation Army-linked companies with operations in the United States so that the American people are fully informed about exactly with whom they are doing business.Now, these steps are just the start as America corrects 40 years of a one-sided, unfair relationship with China that has severely affected our nation's economic and, recently, political well-being. Just like the tariffs that were imposed by the President on unfair trade practices early in his Administration, there is more to come.President Trump understands that lasting peace comes through strength. We are the strongest nation on earth, and we will not bend to the CCP. As the foregoing actions demonstrate, the Trump Administration is countering CCP malign activity. The Trump Administration will speak out and reveal what the Chinese Communist Party believes, and what it is planning--not just for China and Hong Kong and Taiwan, but for the world.Together with our allies and partners, we will resist the Chinese Communist Party's efforts to manipulate our people and our governments, damage our economies, and undermine our sovereignty. The days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People's Republic of China are over.We will stay true to our principles--especially freedom of speech--which stand in stark contrast to the Marxist-Leninist ideology embraced by the CCP. Under President Trump's leadership, we will encourage diversity of thought, resist efforts to police speech or encourage self-censorship, protect Americans' personal data, and above all, continue to proclaim that all women and men are entitled by right of God to liberty, life, and the pursuit of happiness.As I close, let me be clear - we have deep respect and admiration for the Chinese people. The United States has a long history of friendship with the Chinese nation. But the Chinese Communist Party does not equal China or her people.To the Chinese Communist Party, I say, as the recent Phase One trade deal has shown, it is possible for our governments to have a productive relationship. We want good relationships with China, but we do not want relations on the terms currently on offer from Beijing.As Americans, I am certain that we will rise to successfully meet the challenge presented by the Chinese Communist Party, just as we have responded to all the great crises over our history. President Trump is leading the way. And like President Trump, I firmly believe that our best days as a country remain ahead of us.Again, thank you for joining me here today. It is a privilege to be here in Phoenix, Arizona. May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America.* * *Footnotes[1] John Garnaut, "Engineers of the Soul: Ideology in Xi Jinping's China," January 16, 2019, https://sinocism.com/p/engineers-of-the-soul-ideology-in[2] John Garnaut, "Engineers of the Soul: Ideology in Xi Jinping's China," January 16, 2019, https://sinocism.com/p/engineers-of-the-soul-ideology-in[3] John Garnaut, "Engineers of the Soul: Ideology in Xi Jinping's China," January 16, 2019, https://sinocism.com/p/engineers-of-the-soul-ideology-in[4] "Document 9: A ChinaFile Translation," November 8, 2013, https://www.chinafile.com/document-9-chinafile-translation[5] "Document 9: A ChinaFile Translation," November 8, 2013, https://www.chinafile.com/document-9-chinafile-translation[6] Bradford Betz, "China has arrested hundreds for speaking out about coronavirus, reports show," May 13, 2020, https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-arrested-hundreds-speaking-out-coronavirus/[7] Hoover Institution, 2018, "Chinese Influence & American Interests: Promoting Constructive Vigilance," https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/chineseinfluence_americaninterests_fullreport_web.pdf[8] White House, "United States Strategic Approach to the People's Republic of China," May 20, 2020, https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/U.S.-Strategic-Approach-to-The-Peoples-Republic-of-China-Report-5.20.20.pdf[9] White House, "Executive Order on Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain," May 15, 2019, https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-securing-information-communications-technology-services-supply-chain/ and White House, "Executive Order on Establishing the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector," April 4, 2020,            https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-establishing-committee-assessment-foreign-participation-united-states-telecommunications-services-sector/[10] Department of Commerce, "Commerce Addresses Huawei's Efforts to Undermine Entity List, Restricts Products Designed and Produced with U.S. Technologies," May 15, 2020, https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/05/commerce-addresses-huaweis-efforts-undermine-entity-list-restricts[11] Department of State, "Designation of Additional Chinese Media Entities as Foreign Missions," June 22, 2020, https://www.state.gov/designation-of-additional-chinese-media-entities-as-foreign-missions/[12] White House, "United States Strategic Approach to the People's Republic of China," May 20, 2020, https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/U.S.-Strategic-Approach-to-The-Peoples-Republic-of-China-Report-5.20.20.pdf; also see Department of Commerce, "Commerce Department to Add Nine Chinese Entities Related to Human Rights Abuses in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region to the Entity List," May 22, 2020,            https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/05/commerce-department-add-nine-chinese-entities-related-human-rights[13] U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, "CBP Issues Detention Order on Hair Products Manufactured with Force Labor in China," May 1, 2020, https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-issues-detention-order-hair-products-manufactured-forced-labor; also see June 17, 2020,            https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-issues-detention-order-hair-products-manufactured-forced-labor-0 and October 1, 2019,[14] White House, "President Donald J.

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, July 15th, tax day, finally. Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.No more special status for Hong Kong. President Trump signing an executive order to punish the Chinese Communist Party over Beijing's crackdown on Hong Kong.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Their freedom's been taken away. Their rights have been taken away. And with it goes Hong Kong, in my opinion, because it will no longer be able to compete with free markets.I also signed an executive order ending U.S. preferential treatment for Hong Kong. Hong Kong will now be treated the same as mainland China.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And now here comes China, threatening retaliation. We've got the very latest.Markets are rallying bigtime this morning. A triple digit move at the start of trading is what we're expecting. Upbeat news on Moderna's coronavirus vaccine driving the action. Dow Industrials up better than 350 points right now. That is one and a third percent. The Nasdaq is up 82, about three quarters of a percent, and the S&P 500 up 35 points, better than 1 percent.This on top of a big rally yesterday on Wall Street as well. The major indices finishing near session highs with the Dow Industrials up 556 points at 4:00 on Wall Street.Earnings season also part of this. It is rolling on this morning. Goldman Sachs among the big banks reporting their earnings today. All the numbers as soon as they hit the tape and the impact on markets coming up.And what does your handshake say about your health? Why many experts say a weak grip could be deadly.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.European markets also rallying this morning on the vaccine news we told you about coming out of Moderna. In the U.K. you also have economic data. Consumer prices edged higher than expected last month. But take a look at the FT 100, up 100 points, one and two-thirds percent. The CAC quarante up 109, 2.25 percent, and the DAX index in Germany up 230 points, almost 2 percent higher there as well.In Asia overnight, a little bit of a mixed story. The Bank of Japan cut its growth forecast, but it did keep interest rates on hold and the Nikkei average was up 1.5 percent.Joining the conversation this morning, Joe Concha, Jackie DeAngelis and Mitch Roschelle.Great to see everybody this morning.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning.JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, "THE HILL": Good morning.BARTIROMO: Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning.Right now, President Trump turning up the heat on China. The president signed a bill that imposes sanctions on Beijing after China passed a new national security law aimed at crushing dissent in Hong Kong. The measure sanctions Chinese officials who crack down on Hong Kong residents.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Their freedom's been taken away. Their rights have been taken away. And with it goes Hong Kong, in my opinion, because it will no longer be able to compete with free markets.I also signed an executive order ending U.S. peripheral treatment for Hong Kong. Hong Kong will now be treated the same as mainland China.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Yes, but China is now vowing to retaliate against the United States with sanctions of its own, saying that no foreign country has the right to interfere in Hong Kong affairs.The U.S. now one step closer to a vaccine for Covid-19. Big news this morning. A vaccine developed by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna shows all 45 trial participants developed the antibodies during a study. The final phase of testing will include 30,000 volunteers and the news comes as coronavirus cases are surging in Los Angeles. Moderna stock is up 16 percent this morning. But look at Los Angeles, reporting a new daily high of better than 4,200 infections yesterday alone.Shocking data in Florida as well after a local Fox affiliate learned some labs in the state are not reporting any negative Covid-19 tests, making the positive rate appear much higher. The Florida Department of Health releasing a statement saying it, quote, began working with those labs to ensure that all results were being reported in order to provide comprehensive and transparent data. Yes, that's what we want, transparent data, exactly.The state also broke another record for most of Covid-19 deaths in one day. That was 133 just this Tuesday.New York City police released new surveillance video of two gunmen opening fire at a Brooklyn barbecue over the weekend, killing a one-year-old boy. Davell Gardner Jr. was shot and killed as he sat in his stroller late Sunday night. The gunfire also wounding three adults. Police released a -- the footage as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio reinforces his decision to disband the anti-crime unit.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D), NEW YORK CITY: What we have to do to end the shootings, to bring the community out, to occupy the corners, (INAUDIBLE) the strong and proud community and people will come out to take back the neighborhood. And people will do that all over this city. And that's how we turn this tide.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: How many people will die before doing that?Police are offering a $13,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest. NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea vowing that the shooter will be caught.Today, a convicted Kansas City kidnapper and murderer could become the second death row inmate executed by the federal government this week. Wesley Purkey has avoided the death penalty for nearly 20 years because he suffers from dementia. His lawyers are appealing to the Supreme Court. Purkey is scheduled for execution at the same Indiana prison where Daniel Lee died by lethal injection yesterday. Lee, a convicted killer, was the first federal execution in 17 years. A third inmate is scheduled to be executed on Friday.Time for "Word on Wall Street," the latest on what's driving markets and the economy, plus advice to investors on how to allocate your own money right now.Joining me right now is Portfolio Wealth Advisors President, Chief Investment Officer, Lee Munson, along with Matson Money President and CEO Mark Matson, and Pacers ETF Distributors Sean O'Hara.Great to see everybody this morning. Thank you for being here.First up, markets reacting to Moderna's positive results this morning from the vaccine clinical trials. This news is raising hopes for a quicker economic recovery and a vaccine sooner than later.Mark, it appears every time we get positive news on a vaccine, markets certainly trade up.MARK MATSON, CEO, MATSON MONEY: Well, we do, but I -- I think if investors wait for a final cure to get into the market, I think they could be waiting a very long time. Remember that we've been looking for an AIDS vaccine for over 40 years. Even the annual vaccine only works about 40 percent of the time and the viruses mutate.So I think investors have to stay long-term. And so many people have been panicked out of the market, they need to be in the market long term. Don't avoid equities. And then you have to rebalance on the highs and lows. So my message to investors is, don't try to time it. Get in it right now and stay in it for the long term.BARTIROMO: Yes, that makes a lot of sense.Meanwhile, earnings season is in full swing. Bank of New York Melon and PNC Financial Services Group, along with U.S. Bank Corp reporting in the next hour. Next, we are waiting on Goldman Sachs. Goldman will be out this morning.Lee Munson, what are your expectations here?LEE MUNSON, PRESIDENT AND CIO, PORTFOLIO WEALTH ADVISORS: I don't think we're going to see a disaster from Goldman Sachs. A lot of people are concerned that markets might have loans that are going bad. But when you look at the JP Morgan, the Citigroup from yesterday, it looks good. And I'm not -- I'm never concerned about Wells Fargo because they always disappoint. I think if investors have cash, which we know, especially in the baby boomer generation, they're sitting on a pile of cash. Fidelity came out with some surveys a few weeks ago about how a huge minority who were selling in March and are under-invested, I think you can buy things like the banks right now. There's all sorts of cheap things that are still on sale.Look at the energy, master (ph) limited partnerships. You know, you can buy little baskets of that ETNs. Those are very cheap right now. So you don't have to buy the Nasdaq. You don't even have to buy the S&P. You know, if you just want to buy something basic, like the Russell 1000 value through a cheap ETF, I think you can do that now with a little bit more calm and a confidence. That whole group is down, you know, 10, 15, almost 20 percent. So I also think it's important to say, if this spread between the laggards and the leaders still get bigger and bigger and bigger, that's going to be bearish for the market. So if you have any type of optimism here, I think you look at what happened back in May and you get those cheaper, beaten up stocks, start to catch up.So, remember, you can see the Nasdaq hot stocks kind of falter here and sideline and see everything start to pick up the pace like we did about six weeks ago. I think that's a trade right now. That's how I'm investing new cash. Buy what's on sale. There's no harm in it. And the valuations look a lot better.BARTIROMO: Well, Lee, what about Apple? I mean this is one of those hot stocks that you're referring to and Apple got really big news this morning. A European Union court has decided that Apple does not have to pay that $15 billion in taxes. This is a big deal for Apple. The stock's up 2.5 percent right now. And that is why the Dow futures are actually stepping up into another leg up. We're now up 425 points.Would you buy Apple here on this news from the EU decision?MUNSON: No, I wouldn't. You know, Apple has some issues with not being able to really grow the revenues over the past few years. I would rather stay away from the general FANG stocks right now. I know that makes me very unpopular. But I still maintain the type of momentum you're seeing at that top end, those FANG stocks, I have more concern about that lacking the type of follow-through between now and the end of the year.I mean, how's Apple going to start raising their revenue another 20 percent going forward? Everybody's stuck at home. Everybody's upgrading all their Apple stuff.BARTIROMO: Yes.MUNSON: Again, I'd rather buy what's on sale.BARTIROMO: Yes.MUNSON: But, hey, I own the S&P. That stuff is in there.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true.MUNSON: I'm certainly not selling my Apple holdings.BARTIROMO: Yes.MUNSON: But would I add to it right now? You know, you just let that FANG stuff ride. It's over -- it's 25 percent of the S&P. S&P's our main core holding, so you're getting all that stuff. I would rather commit new capital to what is -- you know, I mean the banks are still down, you know, 15 to 20 percent.BARTIROMO: Yes.MUNSON: So that, I think, is more appropriate today.BARTIROMO: Well, the banks -- the banks are down. You're right, banks are down, Sean O'Hara, but what do you make of these loan losses? When you listen to a JP Morgan, to a Citi, like we did yesterday, this week when the bank earnings came out, what are you hearing from them? You're hearing from them, we're going to raise revenue, we're going to raise money, put it aside because we think we're going to see defaults on loans. We think you're going to see loan losses move up.What do you make of that and what's happening in the ETF world? Are people worried about the valuations in -- for things like Apple? What do they -- do they like the banks? How are you seeing the flows?MUNSON: You know, what I'm seeing in the flows is --SEAN O'HARA, PACERS ETF DISTRIBUTORS: Well, good morning, Maria. Thanks for having me.I think that's -- that's actually a big story right now. I mean the banks wouldn't be --BARTIROMO: Yes, Sean O'Hara, go ahead.O'HARA: Yes, the banks wouldn't be setting aside this capital unless they saw a problem. It's a prudent thing for them to do. It's not only happening on the individual side, but you're starting to see it on the corporate loan side as well. And I think the trend probably continues until we, you know, work our way through this.As far as the overall market goes, as the previous guest said, there's a very, very crowded trade at the top of these broad-based indexes, whether it's the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq 100, where five stocks dominate. If the market's going to have a saving grace going forward, it's going to be the other 495 stocks in the S&P 500 or the other 95 stocks in the Nasdaq 100 that will have to pick up the mantel and carry it from here.But for investors who are concerned about valuations, you know, we just recently rebalanced one of our funds. We select 100 stocks based on free cash flow yield. And the current PE on that portfolio is around 11. So it's about half of the overall market. These are stocks that generate a huge amount of cash. They haven't been popular with investor as we've been chasing the big tech names. But if you wanted to diversify your portfolio going forward, that would be a way to de-risk a little, own some quality stuff, get paid an attractive dividend.And as far as the overall market goes, it's trading on the optimism. We own Moderna, so we're happy to see that they're working on a vaccine and it looks promising. But that will be the driver until we start to see some of the numbers come in, in terms of whether or not the economy goes back to where it was.We're trading at 20 times 2021's earnings, which essentially means that we're trading at a level right now that is -- earnings are based on what they were supposed to be this year for next year's number. And we'll have to see whether or not that makes sense or not as we start to get really get full disclosure on what's happening in the economy.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a great point, 20's up there in terms of a PE for sure. Price to earnings ratio on this market.Lee Munson, Mark Matson, Sean O'Hara, good to see you all. Thank you so much for the "Word on Wall Street."MATSON: A pleasure.BARTIROMO: Just ahead this morning, coming up, former deputy and national security advisor KT McFarland is back to talk about how the Trump administration is holding China accountable for the crackdown on Hong Kong.Also coming up, a warning for all expectant mothers, the first case emerges of a baby contracting Covid-19 while in the womb. Everything you need to know coming up on that.And then the streaming wars. We are taking a look at what NBC is offering with Peacock and the rise in spending on content, all coming up.But first, much more ahead right here.A shakeup at "The New York Times" as a prominent writer, editor resigns over a hostile work environment. We're going to get into it.And then Kanye's presidential dreams dashed already? Why his campaign may be over before it even started.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.A bit of a shakeup at "The New York Times" to report. Opinion editor and writer Bari Weiss resigning, citing a hostile work environment. Weiss writing in her resignation letter, quote, they have called me a Nazi and a racist. I have learned to brush off comments about how I'm writing about the Jews again. Several colleagues perceived to be friendly with me were badgered by coworkers. There are terms for all of this, unlawful discrimination, hostile work environment and constructive discharge. I'm no legal expert, but I know that this is wrong.Wow.Joe Concha, your reaction?CONCHA: My reaction was, this is the greatest resignation letter I think I have ever seen. It was devastating, Maria. It was impactful. And it was inspiring, quite frankly, in its candor.One quote stood out to me. Op-eds that would have easily been published just two years ago would now get an editor or a writer in serious trouble, if not fired. And we saw proof of that just last month where James Bennett, op-ed editor, had the audacity to print an op-ed from Senator Tom Cotton talking about using the military during violent protests, which most polls showed a majority of Americans agreed with, and the woke mob within the paper and on social media made sure that he was eliminated.And that's exactly what Bari Weiss is a centrist, she's not a far right writer by any means, was talking about. So hopefully "The New York Times" gets the message and starts to have a more balanced editorial page, an editorial page, by the way, an editorial board that has not endorsed a Republican president for candidate -- a Republican presidential candidate since 1956. That's 64 years ago. That means they had to have endorsed Dukakis, Carter, McGovern, go down the line.BARTIROMO: Oh, my goodness.So, Joe, with that letter, when you're reading into this letter by Weiss, do you think she's bringing up legalese? I mean she says it's discrimination. Do you see a lawsuit coming?CONCHA: Well, that would be interesting, right? I don't know if it's about that for her. I think she just wanted to do what writers like to do, which is have -- not the diversity that "The New York Times" talks about so much in terms of color of skin, but diversity of thought, which is far more important.BARTIROMO: Of course.CONCHA: But she did talk about bullying. She did talk about harassment. She did say that it was in writing. So, yes, perhaps there is a lawsuit here, but I have a feeling that her and Andrew Sullivan, who just resigned from "New York Magazine," may just get together and say, OK, here's what we have to offer from a right -- center right point of view.BARTIROMO: Yes, well, diversity is incredibly important. So diversity of speech as well. And you just don't get a lot of it. And she's an opinion writer.Now, "The New York Times" declined to comment on specifics, but they did issue the following statement, saying this, we're committed to fostering an environment of honest, searching and empathetic dialogue between colleagues, one where mutual respect is required of all.Jackie, what's your reaction to this response from "The New York Times"?DEANGELIS: I think the response is kind of laughable, Maria. You know, I think the -- the Tom Cotton op-ed situation also shines a light on the fact that if don't subscribe to a certain belief set at "The New York Times," they don't make you feel comfortable there.And this editorial, this letter that she wrote sort of sharing her opinions and her feelings, shining a light on all of this, when did it become a crime to work somewhere and have an honest dialogue and a conversation about so many of the issues that are important to American people, especially as we're moving forward into an election year. It's disgraceful.BARTIROMO: It really is. And that's the whole point. She's an opinion writer. You would think she would give her opinion on these things and we could all have a diverse conversation.Thank you for that.Quick break and then reversing course, the Trump administration is changing its stance on the student visa policy. I'm going to tell you what it means for international students studying here coming up.And then the streaming wars heat up. We are looking at what NBC is offering with Peacock and the rise in spending on content. We'll be right back after this break.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Peacock in the mix. The steaming wars heating up as NBC parent Comcast launches its new streaming service called Peacock to all audiences, offering three different tiers, a free ad supported option with about two- thirds of the content and two premium options with all 20,000 hours of consent, one with ads and one without.Joining me right now to break it all down is the co-founder of Netflix and the first CEO of Netflix of the company, Marc Randolph.And, Marc, it's great to have you here. Thanks so much. Congrats to you.What an incredible idea on Netflix. And look where streaming is today.Can you assess the situation for us first? Characterize the streaming situation as you see it.MARC RANDOLPH, CO-FOUNDER AND FIRST CEO, NETFLIX: Well, Maria, it feels a little bit like "Groundhog Day" to me. It's like another morning and yet another streaming service entering the fray. And, you know, of course I'm glad to see this. It's a validation of what Netflix has largely been doing by itself for a dozen years.But what's funny is that there's an established playbook for launching a streaming service and NBC, I don't think, got the memo. I mean normally you'd come out with your big flagship content. You'd have your free deals with your telcos or your cable companies. You'd have a reasonable price and you'd gradually ratchet up over time. But I don't think we're used to seeing advertising, channels. This is -- this is not your father's streaming service.And the interesting thing here for me is, was this intentional or is they - - are they just playing a bad hand? I mean looking at the premium content, you know, with the addition of brave new world, and maybe the new David Schwimmer series, there really isn't that much coming out due to Covid. And, of course, they planned to make a big splash with the Olympics, and that's out too.You know, on the hardware, they're not out on Roku or Firestick, which is about 70 percent of the streaming devices. So they really, in some ways, it's a come from behind strategy and I think a lot of that is what's driving this free, the free tier.What's interesting for me is to watch this and see, is free really the focus? Is that what they stick to?BARTIROMO: Yes.RANDOLPH: Or is this largely a strategy for the first two years and eventually they end up looking like the rest of the services.BARTIROMO: But, Marc, look at all this spending happening. I mean spending on content has been skyrocketing with a reported $121 billion spent on original content in 2019. I mean, obviously, maybe that spending has slowed down in the face of Covid, but as the streaming wars continue, is this sort of spending sustainable or will some of these guys not be able to make it out? How are you going to spend, what, $10 billion to $12 billion to $13 billion in a year on new content?RANDOLPH: You know, Netflix was slated to spend almost $17 billion in a year. So these are astonishing numbers. I mean even NBC is saying it's going to be a $2 billion spend. But these numbers I can't even imagine how you do that.But, listen, this is not about spending for today's customers. All of these companies are spending for the future customers. And I think all of them believe that in many ways we're just at the beginning. I mean looking at Netflix and what are they going to have at the end of tomorrow when they announce, maybe 190 million subscribers. Now that seems like a huge number. But compare that to a number of monthly YouTube users or FaceBook users, which is about 2 billion. Or the number of Internet assessable smartphones at about 4 billion.So I think what's happening is, we're at the beginning of this huge rollout where these companies aren't competing with each other, they're competing against cable. They're competing against other ways people spend time.BARTIROMO: Yes.RANDOLPH: And I think this spending is really just setting the stage for what's going to be happening for years to come.BARTIROMO: Real quick on Quibi, any -- any thoughts on a faltering there?RANDOLPH: Yes, you know, it's one of the things -- I do a lot of work with young entrepreneurs and one of the most important things you have to realize is it's not about getting flashy numbers of people signing up. The real indication of success is, can you convert people and are they engaged? And, listen, on one hand, for Quibi, I kind of bemoan the whole shortening of the American attention span. I think one of these days there's going to be a service doing nothing but subliminal content.BARTIROMO: Yes.RANDOLPH: But I do have to hand it to them, they're really trying some new things. I mean and it's not just the fact that their content is different. The fact that it's mobile first is quite a step. I mean the fact that you can rotate your phone and get a totally different editing example.BARTIROMO: Interesting.RANDOLPH: But I'm really not so sure how this is going to play. You know, it's a -- but I've got to hand it to them. Good shot.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes. I guess it's still the early days.Marc, it's great to get your insights on this. Thanks so much.Marc Randolph joining us there, co-founder of Netflix.Coming up, holding China accountable.

A very strong number on earnings per share. And then revenue at Goldman Sachs coming in at $13.3 billion, $13.3 billion. The estimate was for $9.75 billion.A couple of strong nuggets here. They increased head count by 2 percent. The company is saying that the economic outlook is uncertain. We heard the same kind of commentary coming from the other banks that we got yesterday. Remember, this is a Dow component and the stock is up 3.5 percent.Also, we were looking for trading revenue numbers coming of here. Quarterly net revenues and equities, $2.94 billion, Maria. That is a 46 percent jump year over year, 46 percent.One more thing on Goldman, then I'll move on to some other of news. Net revenues and investment banking, $2.66 billion, a 36 percent jump year over of year. So some very strong numbers coming in from Goldman Sachs.Again, that Dow component. Dow up 465 right now.Got some other headlines I'm following for you this morning, Maria. This is the big news on the Epstein trial. Ghislaine Maxwell pleading not guilty to sex trafficking charges during her arraignment in New York City. A federal judge called Maxwell an extreme flight risk after denying her request to be released on $5 million bail. She is going to remain behind bars until her trial is set to begin in July of next year. She's accused of recruiting at least three underage girls for Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse.Well, the Trump administration has dropped a plan requiring international students to leave the country if all of their classes are held online. More than 200 universities backed a Harvard and MIT lawsuit seeking to block the change, claiming it would put student's safety at risk and damage the school finances.And, finally, here is a look, Maria, at what's trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. Impossible Foods is partnering with meal kit service Home Chef to offer the Impossible Burger.

The stock is up better than 3 percent.We want to look at holding China accountable now. President Trump signing a law to punish the Chinese Communist Party over the crackdown its taken over Hong Kong. The law moving to sanction Chinese officials who threaten Hong Kong residents' rights to free speech, as well as banks that work with those officials. The president commenting yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This law gives my administration powerful new tools to hold responsible the individuals and the entities involved in extinguishing Hong Kong's freedom. We've all watched what happened. Not a good situation. Their freedom's been taken away. Their rights have been taken away. And with it goes Hong Kong, in my opinion, because it will no longer be able to compete with free markets. A lot of people will be leaving Hong Kong, I suspect, and we're going to do a lot more business because of it, because we just lost one competitor. That's the way it is.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is former Trump deputy national security advisor, she is the author of "Revolution," KT McFarland is here.KT, great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for being here.KT MCFARLAND, FORMER TRUMP DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: A pleasure. Great to be with you and welcome back.BARTIROMO: Let's assess, first, KT, the national security risks around China. You know this better than most. And right now what you're seeing is a string of speeches coming out of this administration --MCFARLAND: Right.BARTIROMO: Whether it's Secretary Pompeo, Robert O'Brien, or, you know, Christopher Wray from the FBI, all talking about the national security risks around China and the Communist Party.How do you see it, KT?MCFARLAND: OK. So what happened is a couple of years ago the Chinese government passed a law saying that all Chinese companies, independent companies, as well as government owned companies, as well as Chinese individuals, have to turn over and cooperate with the Chinese military, the Chinese government, in their requests. So, in other words, there is now no such thing as an independent Chinese company. An independent Chinese student. If the Chinese government says to a student, we want you to go to MIT and spy, well, that's a student who has to do that by law. So that really is the crux of what's happened now is that there is nothing independent about China.And now that Hong Kong, which the Chinese promised to the British and everybody else, China would be one country but it would be two systems. Hong Kong could have its own laws. Well now the Chinese have reneged on that promise as well. Now, in Hong Kong, if you demonstrate, Maria, you are labeled a traitor and you are put in jail for life. So that promise is abdicated.And I think what's happened is, as you pointed out, President Trump, Vice President Pence, Secretary Pompeo, Robert O'Brien, the NSC advisor, they're all full-court press to really -- to help the world come together, free market democracies come together to stand up to China because of property theft, because of the militarization, because of the coronavirus and because of Hong Kong. Hong Kong was the final straw, I think. Hong Kong and the pandemic.BARTIROMO: Yes, I think you're right. And I think at this point you are seeing allies across the world --MCFARLAND: Yes.BARTIROMO: With the United States on this, knowing that this whole civil military fusion idea, which is what you just talked about, the fact that everything first goes to the military and it is Chinese law, you have to follow the CCP when it asks you to do something.But look what just happened in the U.K., KT. Huawei and 5G.MCFARLAND: Yes.BARTIROMO: The United Kingdom has moved to ban the telecom company from -- its telecom companies from purchasing equipment made by Huawei for their 5G networks. All existing Huawei equipment must be removed by 2027. This move could increase pressure on other countries, I guess, to enact similar rules. But Secretary Pompeo came on this program, KT, and he said, look, we cannot share the same level of information with countries that are using Huawei.MCFARLAND: Right.BARTIROMO: So we just -- we can't because it's going back to the Chinese CCP, is that right?MCFARLAND: Yes. I mean, absolutely. And I think the British reversal, the British government decision to ban Huawei from 5G and then take it out of the previous Gs networks is really significant because the British had really fought them. I mean we had urged them for years, oh, please, ban Huawei and they refused. But now they've changed course. They've reversed their decision. They are banning Huawei. And the national security advisor, Robert O'Brien, and his deputy, Matt Pottinger, who has my old job, both men I brought into the Trump administration, by the way, and I'm very proud of, they are going around the European capitals as we speak and they're talking to other countries in Europe, saying, the British are doing it, we're doing it, you should ban Huawei in your systems as well.And they're also trying to assemble a coalition -- O'Brien told me, he said, they're trying to assemble a coalition with the U.S. and the U.K. and other democracies, free market systems, to band together to stand up together to China. That we are such a large trading block, we are such a powerful group, that we can stand up to China over intellectual property theft, over the Chinese militarization and seizure really of the South China Sea, as well as all the other issues we've just talked about. So it's an important step --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCFARLAND: Not noticed by the mainstream media, of course, but really important.BARTIROMO: No, of course not. But, you know, at the end of the day, when you're looking at a party, the Communist Party, that has human rights abuses, that tracks its citizens --MCFARLAND: Yes.BARTIROMO: That disappears people, I would imagine the rest of the world does not want the Chinese Communist Party running the world. But they've made it very clear that this is what their goal is, right, they want to be the number one super power economically --MCFARLAND: Yes.BARTIROMO: The number one super power militarily. It's almost in the U.S.'s and its allies' duty to stop the CCP from running the world.MCFARLAND: Yes. And the Chinese have always had this plan. They plan to get there, to run the world by mid-century. But with the pandemic, they've now -- they've speeded up the timeline. They think they're going to emerge from this crisis a couple of years from now and they will be the dominant world super power. That's why they're making these moves now with Hong Kong. That's why they're making these moves in the South China Sea to -- to basically try to push all the other countries that are around, you know, all the countries that are in that maritime trade route to say, China really controls us.That's why President Trump, in a very significant move that wasn't noted, he put two aircraft carrier battle groups in the South China Sea.Now, I think we only have five operational groups, battle groups. But to put two of them in the South China Sea, what he's basically done is reverse what the Obama administration had really kind of left the South China Sea to Chinese control. We're now back and we're making the statement that we are not leaving the South China Sea. We are a Pacific power. We will band together with our of allies in the Pacific to stand up to Chinese seizure of the most important maritime trade route in the world.BARTIROMO: Yes. You -- I'm really glad you brought that up. We spoke about this earlier with Jonathan Ward, but the U.S.'s position on maritime in the South China Sea, that decision just happening and it was really important.Real quick, KT, before you go. We're waiting of on the John Durham investigation.MCFARLAND: Yes.BARTIROMO: Do you believe we will see indictments? AG Barr told me a couple of weeks ago that we're going to get developments by just around Labor Day, right after Labor Day. You -- you told us your story. You were ambushed the way General Flynn was.MCFARLAND: Yes. Yes, and when I watched that interview with Barr that you conducted, I was a little concerned because then there were stories afterwards in the media --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCFARLAND: That, well, the Justice Department may decide to put off convictions or charging people until after the election. If that happens, that -- that will be buried so deep archeologists never even find it. It's important to have justice denied is -- justice delayed is justice denied. It's important to get that stuff out now because crimes were committed, abuses were committed. And unless those people are held to account, it will happen again and again and again because what effectively they tried to do was undermine the 2016 election.BARTIROMO: Yes. That's right.KT McFarland, great to see you, as always. Thank you so much.MCFARLAND: Great to see you.BARTIROMO: Have a great day. We'll see you soon, KT. Thank you.And stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Goldman Sachs reporting better than expected second quarter earnings just moments ago. Take a look at the numbers. Earnings per share at $6.26, better than the $3.78 estimate on revenue of $13.30 billion, better than the estimate of $9.75 billion. The bank beating on both the top and bottom lines, showing signs of strength in the bond trading business and underwriting business as well. The stock is soaring this morning on the news. Take a look, it's up 4 percent right now on these numbers.Joining me right now is the chief financial strategist of Odeon Capital Group, Dick Bove.Dick, it's great to have you.Your reaction to the Goldman numbers and also want to get you to take a step back and tell me what you're hearing from the banks overall so far in this second quarter.DICK BOVE, CHIEF FINANCIAL STRATEGIST, ODEON CAPITAL GROUP: OK. Well, Maria, thank you.Separating the two issues. First, Goldman Sachs.Basically, that goes back to the Covid virus. In other words, when the Covid virus hit, the Federal Reserve started pumping money at an unbelievable rate. In other words, M1 (ph) at the present time is up 40 percent year over year. That has never happened since they redefined money in 1980. M2 (ph) was up by 24 percent.The second thing that Covid did was it caused panic among corporations that they had to build a cash resources as rapidly as possible to withstand whatever recession would occur. So the net result was you saw massive amount of liquidity pouring into the financial markets and a massive amount of demand for that liquidity. And who was there in the middle to handle that but Goldman Sachs.Goldman Sachs, obviously, was a leader in raising money for corporations. I mean Goldman Sachs was a leader in, if you will, facilitating trading for a wide variety of fixed income and other of commodity, if you will, issues. So the net effect is, Covid is what created, you know, Goldman Sachs' earnings at the present time.And the fact that is really disturbing is that the Federal Reserve can't continue this. In other words, the Federal Reserve cannot continue to grow the money supply at the rate that we've seen since February. The money supply is actually up slightly under $3 trillion in this period. So the net effect is, if, in fact, the Federal Reserve starts to pull back, and, quite frankly, it has. In other words, in the last three weeks, the Federal Reserve has reduced the size of its assets and the size of its balance sheet. If the Federal Reserve starts to pull back, then liquidity starts to dry up a bit and Goldman will not be able to replicate what they did in this quarter in the coming quarters.In terms of the banks and their loan losses, again, we're going back to Covid. What we're dealing with is what I call a synthetic economy. It's a synthetic economy because basically we have the government upping funds into the hands of individuals, households, small businesses. We have, as we've said, the Federal Reserve pumping money into corporations and the financial markets.So we don't really know where we stand in the economy. And what the banks are saying is, what we're seeing is frightening. And what is frightening them is the number of people who are not paying their credit cards, who are not making payments on their mortgages, the corporations that are going bankrupt. So they're -- they're turtling. They're going back into the shell.You know Jamie Dimon perhaps better than anyone.BARTIROMO: Yes.BOVE: And, you know, if you take a look at what he's done, what he's done is he's increasing his common equity, he's hugely increasing his liquidity, he's not increasing loans, he has not been increasing loans for about a year. He's basically taking a defensive stand. He is protecting JP Morgan and so is the other big banks.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, which is why I get worried because if they are having such uncertainty, needing to raise loan reserves so much, what does that tell us about the broader recovery here?Very quickly, Dick, we've got to jump, but would you buy any of these stocks right here?BOVE: Well, I think you would be buying Morgan Stanley today because their earnings will be out tomorrow and they'll be as strong as Goldman Sachs' earnings right here. You know, if you want to protect yourself, you know, buy JP Morgan. But I would not be buying the regional banks because they're going to be producing disappointing numbers.BARTIROMO: OK. We'll leave it there.Dick Bove, always great to get your insights, sir. Thank you so much. We'll see you soon.Coming up, Kanye's presidential dreams have been dashed. Why his campaign may be over before it even started. The buzz is next.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Time for the "Morning Buzz."First up, just like that, Kanye West's quest for the White House could be over. An election strategist hired by Kanye says he is out of the race. Kanye has not yet responded.Mitch, what do you think, is this the end?MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: Well, it was pretty quick from the start to finish.But I think the real issue there is, does his activism resonate with a component of the electorate who ordinarily doesn't vote? Does that drive voter turnout? And, if so, does that benefit the president or Joe Biden? And that remains to be seen.BARTIROMO: Next up, how many hot dogs can you eat? Eighty-four apparently according to researchers. Of course it comes with possible and probable stomach issues. Joey Chestnut holds the record for eating 75 hot dogs in 10 minutes at Nathan's on July 4th.Joe, what's your limit?CONCHA: My limit is, I eat two at Yankee Stadium, they've got to wheel me out of there.BARTIROMO: OK.CONCHA: Look, Joseph Christian Chesnutt is the most dominant competitor in any sport. More than LeBron. More than Brady. He has 13 titles. And, remember, 75 hot dogs he ate in 10 minutes. Those were with buns. That's 21,000 calories. Imagine being Mrs. Chestnut and sharing a bathroom with that guy, Maria. Enjoy your breakfast.BARTIROMO: Oh, my God. Wow, I don't know.All right, how about this, the Maldives are open to all global travelers. There is no mandatory quarantine or new visa requirements. But travelers will only be allowed on one resort for the entire trip.Jackie, you in?DEANGELIS: Yes, absolutely. Listen, an Apple store wasn't designed for social distancing, but the resorts at the Maldives certainly have -- are. So I would take my passport and go there and take a computer and an Internet connection and I'll see you later.BARTIROMO: There you go.All right, we'll be right back with Secretary Rick Perry.Stay with us.Load-Date: July 15, 2020End of Document

The same church set on fire by protesters last month. Fights breaking out as the protesters clash with police.Rioters met with the police as they tried to take down the town Andrew Jackson statue in Lafayette Park yesterday. President Trump tweeted early this morning on prosecuting people vandalizing monuments, writing this, "I have authorized the federal government to arrest anyone who vandalizes or destroys any monument, statue or any such federal property in the United States with up to 10 years in prison for the Veterans Memorial Preservation Act or such other laws that may be pertinent.This action is taken effective immediately but may also be used retroactively for destruction or vandalism already caused.

The company launched a $2 billion venture capital fund to invest in companies working to reduce the impact of climate change through clean energy. The move, part of an effort to reduce carbon emissions by Amazon and other companies to net zero by 2040. Amazon has been criticized for harming the environment.Checking Amazon shares this morning in the premarket -- we are looking at a gain of two-thirds of 1 percent.Raising the bar for visas. President Trump puts a freeze on foreign worker visas until 2021 making immigration more merit based.Blake Burman is live this morning in Washington with details there -- Blake.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hi there -- Maria. Good morning to you.Bottom line here, the White House says this executive order is about protecting the American worker. As you know, right now currently 13 percent unemployment in this country during a global pandemic. The executive order also puts a pause on green card applications for the remainder of the calendar year but really it focuses on new work visas, as many of them as well will be paused for the rest of the year as well.Giving sort of a broad look as to what this executive order goes into it will put a pause on visas for those seeking highly-skilled worker jobs that many companies especially in the tech field seek. Those are the H-1B visas, along with the spouses of those workers. It also puts a pause on visas for temporary seasonal workers -- that's H2b. Intercompany transfers -- that's J; and work-study programs -- L visas.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KEN CUCCINELLI, ACTING DIRECTOR, U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION: Just the temporary pieces of this Lou -- are over 500,000 job opening for Americans in the latter half of this year. that is a very big deal, unprecedented level of effort by a president to clear the American job market of competition like this.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: Now the H-1B component of this is being widely-panned by the tech community. For example, Amazon saying in a statement quote, "Amazon opposes the administration's short-sighted decision to pause high-skilled visa programs. Welcoming the best and brightest global talent is critical to America's economic recovery.On now to Brad Smith, who is the president of Microsoft. He tweeted in part, quote, "Now is not the time to cut our nation off from the world's talent or create uncertainty and anxiety. Immigrants play a vital role at our company and support our country's critical infrastructure.Maria -- there has also been some bipartisan pushback as well as one of the President's top supporters in Washington, Lindsey Graham tweeted out the following saying quote "Those who believe legal immigration, particularly work visas are harmful to the American worker do not understand the American economy."Now back to H-1B visas for a second because whenever there will be allowed for new applications for H-1B visas at any point down the line whether that is next year or potentially even some point in between, the executive order also changes how those visas -- Maria, will be handed out as they will be given to the top 85,000 potential wage earners -- Maria.BARTIROMO: All right. Blake -- thank you. Blake Burman with the latest there.This threat from Chinese technology. Attorney General William Barr telling me during my exclusive interview this weekend that the U.S. must rally behind telecommunications companies like Ericsson and Nokia that pose the strongest threat against Chinese telecom giant Huawei. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Would the U.S. consider acquiring Ericsson and Nokia to send a message to the world that if you use Ericsson and Nokia you've got backing of the United States government as an alternative to Huawei?BARR: That's right. I gave a speech a while back saying that it was -- that the two companies best positioned to compete with Huawei are Ericsson and Nokia.But unlike Huawei, Huawei has the backing of the Chinese government and all the Chinese government money. Ultimately the west has to rally around these companies. Whether that means private ownership or state involvement.BARTIROMO: So you would be ok taking a stake even if it's a minority stake in these companies to offset the threat of Huawei then?BARR: That is not a decision for the Justice Department. I -- I do think that the west has to pick a horse or horses.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Ohio senator, Senate Homeland and Governmental Affairs Committee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee member, Rob Portman.And Senator, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining me.SEN. ROB PORTMAN (R-OH): Hey, Maria. You bet, thanks for having me on.BARTIROMO: So many things to talk about. I want to talk about what the president is doing in terms of the visas H-1B visas, H-2B visas.But first, your reaction to what you just heard from A.G. Barr. I understand there was this briefing in -- in the Senate last week in one of the committees which raised the issue of the U.S. needing to get behind another horse to back up telecom and challenge Huawei.Your reaction. Would you like to see the United States take a stake in Ericsson?PORTMAN: I would like to see it send a really strong market signal, and that means that we are open for business. We want competitors.We just finished an investigation, as you know, of Chinese telecom companies here in the United States. We found out that one, which was under investigation, was being removed from the market. But there were three that were not, and they'd been here for two decades.And all the indications that we got in our investigation was that this was a national security risk for the United States, because that data was likely being transferred back to China -- and specifically the Chinese Communist Party is involved with these telecom companies.So I think it's a real problem. I think the market signal would be that -- if Nokia and Ericsson continue to develop their technology to compete with Huawei, that they have a market here in the United States. That's probably even a better way to do it, but we do need to be sure that the Western world has an alternative.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean there are so many things that the Chinese government is doing, the Chinese Communist Party, whether it's telecom or education. This week the Department of Education finding $1 billion --PORTMAN: $1 billion, yes.BARTIROMO: -- in anonymous foreign funds among institutions nationwide, even in a school with direct contracts with the Chinese Communist Party. What about that? Because A.G. Barr also talked about the threat from Chinese Communist Party stealing intellectual property as we speak.Listen to what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Can you tell me a bit about what the CCP is doing? I know there has been a real rethinking of the relationship between the United States and China.BARR: The way I look at it, this is fundamental challenge to the United States.What is at stake is the economic opportunity of our children and our grandchildren, whether we can continue to be the technological leader of the world.The Chinese have embarked on a very aggressive program during this time of stealing and cheating in order to overtake us. They have stolen our intellectual property. When they steal our -- steal our secrets about future technology, they are stealing the future of American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So Senator, you have you bipartisan legislation, the Safeguarding American Innovation Act, that would work to stop foreign governments from stealing information from taxpayer funded research.Tell me about that. And what is the CCP doing? Is it just targeting people like the -- the chairman of the Chemistry Department at Harvard, paying him --PORTMAN: Yes, yes.BARTIROMO: -- Charles Lieber so that he just sends data back to the CCP?I mean I have never seen anything where a foreign government actually has a real strategy of growing, strategy of being number one by stealing.PORTMAN: Yes. Maria, you are absolutely right. And what is happening is -- and it's been happening for two decades, the Chinese government -- really the Chinese Communist Party, when you look back at who is behind this, has been systematically targeting promising American research and researchers, paying them to take that research to China. Not telling either the taxpayer funded institutions, like the National Institutes of Health, which just fired 54 of their researchers, 90 percent of whom had ties to China, not telling the universities or other research institutions, like the Cleveland Clinic in my own state of Ohio, where recently someone was arrested for taking over $3 million dollars from China. China set up a replicate lab for them in China. They actually took the samples, biological samples, from Cleveland to China.So this has been happening for a long time.BARTIROMO: Yes.PORTMAN: We've got to shut it down. Our legislation is Safeguarding American Innovation. We introduced it last week. It's bipartisan. We need to pass it.It would address all of the issues we just talked about including foreign government's influence in schools.BARTIROMO: Well, it certainly feels like the global CEOs need to understand the national security risks better.PORTMAN: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: Senator, thank you, sir.PORTMAN: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: We'll be watching. Senator Rob Portman.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Futures pointing to a gain at the start of trading this morning. Opening bell about an hour away. The Dow Industrials near the highs of the morning here, up 320 points 1.25 percent. The Nasdaq is up 71. And the S&P is up 33 after a volatile overnight session sparked by White House trade adviser Peter Navarro saying that the U.S. trade deal is quote "over".Futures at that point tumbled better than 400 points but they rebounded after Navarro walked back his remarks and President Trump assured that the deal was in fact intact.Joining me right now is Allianz chief economic adviser Mohamed El-Erian. Mohamed -- it's great to have you. I think that whole episode there with Navarro saying the deal is over, the president coming back and saying it is -- the phase one trade deal is in place -- opens the window to really what is going on here. It feels like it's over and it feels like an economic war -- an economic cold war. What is the impact on investing -- Mohamed?MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER, ALLIANZ: So I think as your interviews have shown, the issue between China and the U.S. goes way beyond economics. It goes -- it speaks to national security. It speaks about our future. So it's not going to go any time soon.And the markets are very sensitive to signals, but all the market really care about it the short-term. So when they heard from President Trump that the deal is intact, they took off. And it just shows you how sensitive the markets have become to policy announcements.BARTIROMO: So what do you think about investing today -- Mohamed? The country is reopening. we know that now in New York we are in phase two. Wall Street titans are expecting a swift recovery at the end of the year and into 2021.Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman said that he expects a quote, "big V- recovery" in the next few months even if it takes a while to get back to 2019 levels. The economic backdrop -- how do you see it?EL-ERIAN: So I think if you are an investor, you're dealing with two tensions. The first is within fundamentals. Yes, we are reopening. Yes, we are going to see a V in the first few months but there's also health concerns so you have to deal between reopening and health.And then the second tension, between massive support from the Federal Reserve and a question mark as to what will come out of Congress.So I tell investors expect two things. One is it will be more volatile, and two, is quality names (ph) matter. Stay with what has worked so far. Resist the rotation trade, as tempting as valuations may seem, because it is still a pretty uncertain outlook.BARTIROMO: so would you sell into this rally today -- Mohamed? Dow Industrials up 320 points. What do you want to do today even though I know you are not a knee-jerk reaction type of guy, and as I am, you're long-term invested but longer term do you think this market has some trouble ahead.EL-ERIAN: So I think it's going to be a lot more volatile. Let me tell you what I would not do. I would not go for the names that have lagged tremendously. You don't want to get hurt on that (INAUDIBLE) again. Be careful of the airlines. There's a lot of question marks.Second, I would not say the U.S. stocks would (INAUDIBLE) the rest of the world even though the U.S. has outperformed the rest of the world significantly.And third I would look for very selective opportunities. That is where money is going to be made. It's not going to be market wide calls anymore.BARTIROMO: I see. Mohamed -- it's great to have you on the program as always. Great to see you -- sir. Thank you.EL-ERIAN: Thank you -- Maria.BARTIROMO: Mohamed El-Erian.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Major League Baseball pitching another return plan. The league proposing a 60-game season after striking out with the players association on its last.Dagen -- what do you think?MCDOWELL: This will be imposed by the commissioner -- Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred. This is based on a late March deal that he can now come and say ok, enough of the back-and-forth. You players were playing 60 games from late July until late September followed by normal postseason tournament.The issue now is the uptick in viruses. Major League Baseball has closed down all the training facilities in Florida and Arizona. There have been at least eight positive corona tests that came back for the Philadelphia Phillies alone.I think people are sick of baseball. Of all the people who put their lives on the line to feed us and take care of us during this virus shutdown, these players can't suck it up and get back on the field. And they were bickering about more money?Nat Candido's the biggest Mets fan on the planet and even he hates baseball now.BARTIROMO: Wow. Mattie -- what do you say?DUPPLER: I think Dagen hit it right on the head. Nat -- I'm sorry that you're a Mets fan. But listen, Hockey season is open -- like this is the deal. This is not that hard. Other franchises and other sports have figured this out.You look at what the NHL did. That's the model here. They did a phased reopening just like a lot of cities states and states have done. MLB -- might be time to start talking about replacing America's past time.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: NASCAR has been on the track since May. NASCAR has been racing --DUPPLER: That's right.MCDOWELL: -- since May. Where is baseball?DUPPLER: And baseball's outside. Baseball is an outdoor sport. It is the one of the less risky sports to be reopening and they can't get their act together? I think all America should be looking at hockey, should be looking at NASCAR. There's plenty of sports on TV for you to follow now.BARTIROMO: And the U.S. Open is coming back August 31. They're going to go, no fans in the stand. They're still going to play tennis.DUPPLER: That is right. I mean listen, again this is not hard. It just takes some agreement from the players and the leadership to figure out why they are even playing sports to begin with. It's for the love of the game. It's for the fans.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: Well, Jon is the bigger sports fan. What does Jon think?(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: These baseball players are losers.HILSENRATH: Dagen -- you know, you and I --BARTIROMO: Go ahead -- Jon.HILSENRATH: -- like to argue --BARTIROMO: Final world from you.HILSENRATH: I'm sorry. You're with me?MCDOWELL: Yes, go.HILSENRATH: Ok. Dagen and I like to argue. I can't disagree with anything that she just said about baseball.I'll tell you what, like the only thing that matters to me right now is watching my 17-year-old boy play football this fall. I just hope high school football gets back to business because there is nothing more American. There is nothing more community-oriented than a high school football game on Friday night. That's like that and work is all that matters to me right now.BARTIROMO: And it's so great to watch, too. You're right.All right. Quick break and then saving schools. Archbishop of New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan is here on the challenges facing Catholic education, coming up right after this.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, June 23rd. A look at the markets right now, 8:31 a.m. Eastern.One hour away from the opening bell and we've got a triple digit gain underway. The Dow futures up 300 points right now, that's better than one percent. The NASDAQ futures up 68 and the S&P futures up 32. This after an overnight plunge due to comments from Peter Navarro about the China phase one deal being quote, over. The administration later saying that deal is still on and Navarro walked back the comment.European markets are also on the rise this morning, take a look at European indices right now. Higher across the board. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announcing today that beginning on July 4th tourism and hospitality in England will begin to come back. The reopening there, he says that he trusts the public to use common sense. The FT100 is up 89 points, that's 1 1/2 percent. The Quatre Quarante in Paris is up 85 and the DAX Index up 327 points, 2 2/3 percent in Germany.In Asia overnight, green across the board there as well. News out of Japan, Japanese leaders say that the plans to have a budget surplus by 2025 are still in place despite massive spending the COVID-19 crisis.Meanwhile this, former Vice President Joe Biden agreeing to three Presidential debates this Fall. While slamming President Trump's push to add more. Cheryl Casone with the details now. Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: That's right Maria. In a letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates, the Biden campaign called President Trump's push to add more debates a quote, effort to change the subject, and quote, create a distracting debate about debates. The presumptive Democratic nominee will face off against the president in three debates that are slated for September 29, October 15 and October 22nd. The CPD announcing this morning they are moving the October 15th debate from Michigan to Miami, after the University of Michigan announced it can no longer host that event. The two remaining debates are going to take place in Indiana and Tennessee. The lone Vice Presidential Debate is set for October 7th. That's going to be held in Utah.Well folks, we may still need roads out there, but who needs car keys. Apple is adding a very cool new feature to its iPhone. Car key will be available on the 2021 BMW 5 series. That's actually going to be released next month. It allows drivers to unlock and start the car with their phone. iPhone uses near field communication to talk to the vehicle from just a few centimeters away. Drivers will also be able to share their codes via iMessage with family members or close friends, if your comfortable doing that. Apple plans to switch to a different technology next year that will allow driver to unlock their cars from a further distance away. They're also going to be working on technology so it can be used for other types of cars. Apple stock up almost two percent in the premarket.Finally, here is a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. The US is contesting bail for the two men accused of helping former Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn escape Japan, saying they are a flight risk. Cheese prices hit a record this month, at $2.58 a pound thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. And finally, Facebook is reportedly looking to take over Nieman Marcus' Hudson Yard's location, right here in New York City, after the retailer filed for Chapter 11. And Maria, those are your headlines from the newsroom. Back over to you.BARTIROMO: Alright Cheryl, thank you. Meanwhile, back to school on everybody's minds. President Trump eager to see students in class this Fall. As states reopen across the country.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Kids are much stronger than us. Let's open the schools please. Open. We got to get them open, in the Fall, we got to get them open.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The president promising to help Catholic schools, many on the verge of closing. Joining me right now New York Archbishop, Cardinal Timothy Dolan. Cardinal Dolan it is great to see you this morning. I hope you're well.CARDINAL TIMOTHY DOLAN, ARCHBISHOP, ARCHDIOCESE OF NEW YORK: I am Maria. It's always a joy to be with you. Thanks for the invite.BARTIROMO: So, tell me Cardinal, assess the situation for Catholic schools today. Before we get into what needs to be fixed. How do you see things as we stand? Give us the state of play.DOLAN: I see things as both promising and perilous. I got to be realistic, Maria. Things are perilous, because we're probably going to have to close a chunk of our schools, not because they're not quality, first class schools, but simply because our parents can no longer afford the tuition as much as we try to keep it low, and as much as we try to be lavish in our scholarships, they're just saying with tears in their eyes, we're afraid we can't re-enroll or register our kids in the schools, because we don't have a job. We don't know about the future. We don't have the money to do it. So, it's very perilous that we could lose a chunk of our magnificent schools. I also find it promising, because for the first time in my memory anyway, I see our culture, our society, our government having a very sane conversation about the essential nature of all of our school and the recipe for recovery and a real desire to support them.BARTIROMO: Yeah.DOLAN: So, this could be the time that finally we break through the bigotry and arrive at some way to support our non-governmental schools.BARTIROMO: Yeah. Well, you make a lot of good points, because the truth is during this pandemic, when we watch our students work on the computer, work online, one has to wonder if parents later, once we get out of all of this, say why am I paying all this money for school when my child did fine online. And then you've got online worshiping booming across all denominations during the lockdowns. The internet still the safest for the elderly and other vulnerable church members until pandemic ends. Some are worried that online worship is challenging the unity of faith communities. So, what's your take on this Cardinal Dolan? Online has worked so far. Are we going to be going online for our masses and our schools when we get out of this pandemic?DOLAN: It has. As in most things, Maria, we're talking about a mixed blessing. So, technology, communication, online, has been a blessing indeed through the pandemic, for our school kids and parents and for our congregants and those who love the church and who love to pray together. It's a mixed blessing because even though all those people, our school kids, our school parents, our worshippers, are grateful for what we were able to do in tough times, extraordinary times. They also tell us, it's not the same. And we got to get back there in person. That's why we're so aggressive, at least here in the Archdiocese, we want to be up and running after Labor Day, so that our Catholic Schools open and we don't want to close any of them.BARTIROMO: Yeah, but you know, people are going to say, is the cost the same. Should the cost be the same? Given the fact that we are looking at, you know, an effective situation doing it online, right. Are you expecting tuitions to come down?DOLAN: Well, we certainly want to keep them the same, and we want to be much more lavish in offering scholarships. You're aware Maria, because you've been part of our fundraising in the past, thank you. We have a magnificently well-oiled program of scholarships for our middle and low income students to help them stay in our schools and we try our best to help tuition, keep tuition down. No, I would find our parents and our students saying please open up, we need you.BARTIROMO: Yeah, you're right.DOLAN: And as much as we've benefited from technology, as much as we appreciate the stay at home learning, there's nothing compared to teachers and kids in a classroom, so please let's get up and running.BARTIROMO: Yeah, I mean, there's a certain education from just being with other students.DOLAN: Yeah.BARTIROMO: And even at the University level, having campus life, having said that, I do love watching you live stream, I like the live streaming from St. Patrick's Cathedral. Churches across the country, meanwhile are welcoming parishioners. In New York City houses of worship opening at 25 percent yesterday. How do you prepare for this, Cardinal? And we know the battle going on right now where the administration says, well, you know, some states are saying you can't go to church, but it's okay for you to go protest and go walk in protests. Which we've seen the last couple of weeks.DOLAN: You won't be surprised to hear me say that I would consider church, worship, religion, to be an essential service. I'm also immensely grateful to the faith community in the United States, that they've been extraordinarily vigilant when it comes to protecting the health of our people. We're in the business, the enterprise of protecting people's health, now and in eternity. We call that salvation. We're up and running and I'm grateful because the minute this started, Maria, way back on March 14th, we all said let's get ready for the reopening. Let's figure out what we're going to have to do. So, when phase two, phase three and all came into play, we were off and running. We were running towards first base and were there. There haven't been any glitches at all.I was at Saturday night mass up in Harrison, and it was beautiful, only about 1/3 of the church was filled, proper distancing, sanitation, masks, people as happy as could be to get back. Gradually they're going to start coming back, by the end of the summer. I hope we're back to normal. And Maria, you've got a point. Some people might say, hey, I've sort of enjoyed staying at home. I think though, we're going to see a kind of an ascendency because people have recovered the value of faith and they miss it. They miss being with one another.BARTIROMO: Yeah.DOLAN: They miss the personal, the tangible, the sacramental aspect of the mass and the sacraments and the prayers. I think we're in for a renewal.BARTIROMO: Yeah. We hope that there is a renewal and thank you for all that you've done in terms of your leadership. You lead the new St. Patrick's Cathedral, and unfortunately we had Ken Langone on the other day. He, of course, was a big sponsor in helping to revitalize St. Patrick's Cathedral and now it has been vandalized during the most recent unrest.DOLAN: Yeah.BARTIROMO: Sparked by the death of George Floyd. NYPD arresting and charging two teens for vandalizing St. Patrick's Cathedral. Last night the historic St. Johns Church in Washington was attacked again. Cardinal these are very terrible pictures to look at and it's a sad story that we're all living through right now. What's your reaction?DOLAN: It's very sad. It's very sobering, because what your looking would be examples of anarchy and nihilism. Protesters and thanks be to God, the overwhelming majority of protesters were not involved in such degrading episodes of defacement, but those kind of violent protestors know what they're doing, and they know if can chisel away, cheapen and deface a sign of what is most noble and uplifting and God like in the human enterprise, you're going to have some success. That's what they tried to do with St. Patrick's Cathedral. That's what they tried to with St. John the Divine. It shows the extremes to which they will go to kind of bring society into a state of nihilism and anarchy. We can't let that triumph.BARTIROMO: So, what do you want to see? How will you protect St. Patrick's Cathedral then Cardinal?DOLAN: Well, thank God you mentioned Ken Langone, God bless him, he was the chair of our renovation campaign. He was the one that said, look, we can put this treatment on the outside of the Cathedral, so that it won't absorb the soot and the pollution and by the way, God forbid, if there's ever graffiti, it'll easily wash off. So, we had already taken that precaution.BARTIROMO: Wow.DOLAN: The police have been phenomenal. The police, by the way Maria, said to me, Cardinal, we don't think it was anti-religion, we don't it was anti- Catholic, we don't think it was anti-cathedral, we think they were running up and down the street just spraying any brick in sight. And there were no kind of anti-church statements that they sprayed. So, we're doing okay, the police are good, our people have been so protective of the Cathedral, they've come through, especially at this troubled time that to keep the cathedral going. I think we'll be alright. We go through these upheavals and they don't prevail.BARTIROMO: Well, what a smart idea in terms of the renovations and ensuring that the graffiti is not long lasting from Ken Langone and yourself. Cardinal Timothy Dolan, may God Bless you and your parishioners. Thank you, sir.DOLAN: Thanks Maria. God bless our schools.BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Well, back to work. The Plexiglas and plastic industry seeing a massive boom as businesses reopen with new safety measures in place. We go back to work. Kristina Partsinevelos is live with more on this heightened demand from plastics. Kristina.KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: It is a good time to be in the plastic industry. You're seeing it live right now. They are already set to work dealing with an order. These acrylic see through plastic sheets, it used to be a market value of $1 billion dollars last year in North America, but the demand has more doubled just in the past few months alone. I'm at Canal Plastic Center and they are working very hard, they're waiting to even cross past the camera just because they're trying to deal with a lot of this demand. But as the country reopens, we know that many safety precautions have been put in place like these partitioned windows. Even my photographer, in my camera guys car, if I sit in the back seat, he has a plastic shield separating the two of us, just in case I sneeze or cough.But if we're talking about demand across the board, we've seen it just in June alone, and this is according to the International Association of Plastics Distribution, it has quadrupled just this month compared to last year at this time. But there is a little bit of a lead time. If your, let's say a grocery store, you normally would have to wait two to three weeks to get plastic. Now the lead time is almost 26 weeks. Very good for businesses like canal plastic that has been open for about 50 years or so, but I was told that they've had to pivot their business and make these new products like the sneeze, and the cough guards. I was just speaking to another worker here, and he told me too, that unfortunately though, despite the uptick in demand for these plastic guards, and the custom made guards, it still hasn't offset the loss of traffic and the fact that they were closed for several months. So, they're hoping things are going to improve and they're going to be able to keep up with the demand. Back to you.BARTIROMO: Alright, sounds like a growth story for sure. Kristina, thank you. Kristina Partsinevelos in New York City. Coming up, Google employee protest. The backlash facing CEO Sundar Pichai over the companies ties to law enforcement. Wait until you hear this. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: A Fox Business Alert right now, shares of China based coffee chain maker Luckin plummeting right now. The company says it received another delisting notice from NASDAQ last week, after failing to file its annual report. The company claims the delay is caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The stock right now is down almost 20 percent. There is a significant movement in the United States to enforce the accounting rules of the US. Chinese companies need to follow those accounting rules or get delisted. That's what's going on here.Google employees, meanwhile, are calling for change again. More than 1,600 workers signed a petition urging CEO Sundar Pichai to halt all contracts with law enforcement. Saying that the company must quote, take real steps to help dismantle racism. Google so far has no plans of stop allowing, stopping police to use its products. I spoke with Andural Industries founder Palmer Luckey during my AI special, about a similar story, the importance of US companies participating with the government.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Do some companies in Silicon Valley not understand that? Because in China, China's government will tell its companies and its Universities, do this. Work together. We want to be number one in AI by 2020 or 2025. In America, you've got technology companies, like Google, who walked away from a contract with the Pentagon, who are saying, you know what, we don't want to work with you, US Administration.PALMER LUCKEY, FOUNDER, ANDURIL INDUSTRIES: Well, first of all, in the United States, it's pretty great that these companies have the right to do that. I don't want companies to do this, I want them to work with US Department of Defense, but they do have the right to walk away. In China, that's not the case. A lot of people in Silicon Valley, a lot of companies in Silicon Valley see China as the ultimate business opportunity, not the ultimate adversary, and that is a huge problem.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Jon Hilsenrath, Palmer Luckey went on to say, imagine if it was during World War II and American companies said to the government, sorry, we can't help you defeat the Nazi's because we really need to get a good foothold in Imperial Japan. You know, these Google employees do not understand how they actually got rich, and how it is that Google is allowed to prosper the way it is. That's because of America, and our policies here.HILSENRATH: Yeah, you know, these are incredibly complicated issues. You know, I mean to use the World War II analogy, it's also as if, you know, American companies had built all of their fortunes on Germany, and then we're told to uproot because we can't do business with Germany anymore. You know, American companies have invested so much in China, and China's story in the last 30 years. And they're now being put in a position where they've got to move themselves out of that situation.BARTIROMO: I mean, Mattie, the employees at Google, they're activists. That's what, they just want to do activism.DUPPLER: Well, I think that analogy, though, slices both ways Maria. If America wants to continue to be a beacon of light for the rest of the world, it need to continue to do that for everyone. It needs to welcome people here. I think restrictions on immigration like we've been talking about all this show, demonstrate that, that's very problematic if we're going to continue to tell people that the United States isn't going to serve that leadership role anymore.BARTIROMO: Alright, good conversation there. Morning with Maria continues right after this.Load-Date: June 23, 2020End of Document

Chinese hackers in the Vatican: what secrets could China look for in the heart of the Church?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 30, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 877 wordsBodyThe Vatican and China are set to renew automatically in September, for one year, the 2018 pact that established the appointment of Chinese bishops with mutual recognition. This ended a decades-long conflict between the Catholic Church loyal to the Pope of Rome and an autocephalic patriotic Church at the hands of Xi Jinping's communist regime.The substantive discussions, due to the long pause imposed by the coronavirus pandemic?, will seek to sign a new pact in September 2021. Nothing has been reported of these swings in a year that has been sensitive to relations between Rome and Beijing, because of the alternatives to the epidemic and the deterioration of the situation in Hong Kong. Especially because of the increasingly difficult crisis between the United States and China and which many geopolitical analysts say has climbed to the level of a real bilateral cold war.This table records the complaint from an American source that the Servers of the Holy See have suffered in May the assault of Chinese "hackers",a serious fact on which the Vatican and the Beijing government have maintained absolute silence.The Chinese government never accepted that the pact with the Holy See for the appointment of bishops should be made public.How the hack wentAccording to the American computer monitoring company Recorded Future, Chinese pirates used as a tool of penetration into Vatican computer defenses a "Message of Troy". It was a high-class maniac of a true letter from the Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, of condolences for the death of a Chinese bishop. The missive was emailed to the Mission of the Holy See of Hong Kong.The Chinese hackeraggio served to control the secrets of the delicate trafficking that is still ongoing in order to restore Rome's diplomatic relations with China. A Chinese spokesman said the information was "just conjecture." The Vatican didn't say anything.The American Recorded Future that uncovered the story said the email had been spleened with malware from a group of Chinese hackers, identified as Red Delta.Penetration into The Vatican servers also serves to monitor the Vatican's role in the Hong Kong crisis and the renewal in September of the 2018 pact that ended the open confrontation between the Holy See and Beijing.According to the Americans, the work of Chinese computer hackers was "very sophisticated" to steal diplomatic secrets, with new techniques and new codes that make it difficult to identify the source.A spokesman for Beijing's foreign ministry said his government is a strong advocate for cybersecurity and that the allegations could not be based on "simple conjecture" but to provide "extensive evidence."Mountains of reserved materialAccording to Massimo Franco at the Corriere della Sera, the Vatican had a feeling that the documentation reserved with China had to be urgently protected when protest movements and clashes between policemen and students in Hong Kong were made hard in the summer of last year, where there is an apostolic headquarters that concentrates mountains of reserved material for many years.From Rome came the order to transfer the documents to the Philippines "to prevent them from being kidnapped or destroyed by Chinese military and intelligence service."Although Hong Kong diplomatic bags accumulated in Manila were safe in the Philippine capital,the Secretary of State, Cardinal Parolin, ordered his quick transfer to the Apostolic Archive in the Vatican.Diplomatic complications have widened, especially by the hot confrontation in Hong Kong. Jorge Bergoglio never spoke of the issue of violent clashes in the former colony returned by Britain to China, between students and opponents of integration under Beijing's rule.One episode demonstrated how delicate the relationship with China is to China for the Pope. On Sunday 5, a comment was planned by the Argentine pontiff on the situation in Hong Kong, in the speech he reads regularly after reciting the Angelus. But those written paragraphs were never pronounced. No one gave any explanation though it was obvious that they were considered to be able to complicate relations with the Chinese. Officially those words never existed. But they were in the seized text."In recent times I have followed with particular attention and not without worries the development of the complex situation in Hong Kong and I wish to express first of all my cordial closeness to all the inhabitants of that territory," Francis said from the balcony of his studio, addressing the crowded by the security measures of quarantine."In the current context, the topics dealt with are undoubtedly delicate and touch everyone's lives. That's why it's understandable that there's a remarkable sensibility. I would therefore like to let all those involved know how to deal with the various problems in a spirit of wisdom and authentic dialogue. This requires courage, humility, non-violence and respect for the dignity of all.""I pray that social life, and especially that religious life, should be expressed with full and true freedom, as envisaged by several international documents." It gives the impression that these concepts brought out rough themes in the Vatican's relationship with the communist regime.Vatican, correspondentLoad-Date: July 31, 2020End of Document

Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, June 26th. Your top stories right now just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.The U.S. is seeing another record rise in coronavirus cases right now. The CDC is estimating more than 20 million Americans may have already been infected and didn't even know it.Plus, Texas is hitting the pause button on the reopening plans as a result of the spikes.The health of American banks. The Federal Reserve's stress tests finding U.S. banks are strong enough to withstand the coronavirus crisis. Banks seeing some post financial crisis restrictions easing, but share buybacks and dividends will still be limited.Markets this morning are searching for direction. Take a look at futures indicating this morning a decline in the Dow Industrials, down about 25 points, but the Nasdaq is up 18 and the S&P is higher by four points. This after yesterday markets climbed toward the end of the session to the close in the green, led by the big banks and the results of those stress tests. The Dow Industrials were up almost 300 points, the Nasdaq was up 107, and the S&P yesterday up 33 points at 4:00 on Wall Street.House Democrats passing their police reform bill. It is not expected to make it to the president's desk. Meanwhile, a bill being introduced in the Senate to deny federal funds to cities and states that allow autonomous zones.This as the president prepares to sign off on an executive order to protect national monuments later.The Senate coming together against China, though, unanimously passing sanctions on the communist country in reaction to its restrictions on Hong Kong's freedoms.The 2020 race. New polls show former Vice President Joe Biden leading in some key battleground states.And this, FaceBook losing another major advertiser. Verizon is now joining the boycott of the social media giant.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.Global markets this morning are mixed. In Europe it is green across the board. The FT 100's up 108 points, the CAC quarante in Paris is up 90, and the DAX index this morning up 143 points in Germany. European Central Bank President Christine LaGarde says that the worst of the coronavirus is probably behind them, but still sounded off over concerns of a potential second wave coming.In Asia overnight, markets were mixed. Markets in China remain closed for a holiday. Asian economies, though, headed toward their worst quarter since the 2008 financial crisis. As you can see, it was a mixed session.Joining me this morning is Dagen McDowell, Alli McCartney and Jianna Caldwell (ph).Great to see everyone this morning.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you.JIANNA CALDWELL (ph): Thank you.ALLI MCCARTNEY, PRIVATE WEALTH ADVISER, UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES: (INAUDIBLE).BARTIROMO: We've got a big show ahead. Some of the stop stories that we are watching this morning, the House has passed a sweeping police reform bill aimed at curbing excessive force. It comes just one day after Democrats blocked debate on the GOP's version of that bill in the Senate. The bill honors the live of George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): The House is honoring his life and the lives of all killed by police brutality by saying, never again.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The George Floyd Justice and Policing Act bans chokeholds and no-knock warrants. It eliminates qualified immunity that protects officers from lawsuits and it increases reporting and record keeping of police use of force. The bill stands little chance of becoming law with slim hopes of passing in the Senate.And as the House prepared for its final vote, Democrats blocked the GOP resolution to condemn riots and opposed defunding the police. The amendment did not receive one Democrat vote.The U.S. sets a new, single day record for coronavirus cases. More than 39,000 Covid-19 cases were reported in the U.S. yesterday alone. That was the highest single day count of the entire pandemic. It surpasses the previous record of -- by more than 3,000 cases. So far more than 2.4 million Americans have tested positive for the coronavirus.But the CDC is warning that the outbreak may have infected more Americans than previously thought. CDC Director Robert Redfield says, quote, this virus causes so much asymptomatic infection that we probably recognized only about 10 percent of the outbreak. Cases and hospitalizations surging so much in the south, Texas has paused its reopening plans.The White House Coronavirus Task Force is set to hold a briefing later today, its first briefing in nearly two months.And President Trump, in an exclusive town hall last night with Fox News, slammed Seattle leaders for allowing protesters against police brutality and racism to occupy part of the city's downtown. Trump says enough is enough.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We can stop it quickly. And at some point, in the not too distant future, I'm going to do it. And if they don't do something with Seattle, we're going to do that. we're going to go in there, because what's happening, they're taking over American cities.By the way, in all cases, it's Democrats. They're Democrat-run. In all cases. And Joe Biden would have that be the whole country.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The leaders of CHOP, or the Capitol Hill Occupied Protests, say that their project is over and have asked demonstrators to leave the area. But members of the Seattle Black Collective Voice are seeking to reclaim the narrative, saying that protesters will decide how long the occupation will go on and they're calling to defund the city's police department by at least 50 percent.Putting pressure on Beijing. The Senate unanimously passed a bill that would of slap sanctions on any person or company backing China's efforts to restrict autonomy in Hong Kong. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle echoing similar statements.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): Beijing must know that its actions have consequences. This resolution today makes clear that that will be the case and that is why so many in Hong Kong are so eager to see it pass and why Beijing is so hopeful that it will fail.SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): What the government of China is doing in Hong Kong is unacceptable. They are taking away the rights of the people in Hong Kong. They are snuffing out the freedoms that exist there right now.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is the Eurasia Group President and G Zero Media President Ian Bremmer.Ian, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT, EURASIA GROUP: Hi, Maria.BARTIROMO: Obviously it looks like we are in an economic cold war with the United States calling out China's misbehaving for so many years. Your reaction to now both sides of the aisle here agreeing on China and its communist party's missteps.BREMMER: Well, Maria, I mean, the strongest area of bipartisan agreement in any piece of foreign policy is that we should be taking a harder line on China right now. I mean, as you said, unanimous vote in Senate. You cannot get people on the Democrat or Republican side of the aisle saying that they're in any way comfortable with the unilateral steps that the Chinese government has taken to undo the legally agreed one state two systems that had applied to Hong Kong and will no longer after this new national security legislation is put in place. So completely appropriate that the U.S. government is sending the strongest possible signal that we are unified on this issue.But I would not say that we're in a cold war with the Chinese. Peter Navarro, I think, would like us to be in one. He was slapped down pretty quickly by President Trump just a few days ago when he said the trade deal is no longer in place. The trade deal is still in place and -- and most American businesses doing business in Hong Kong are not going to stop doing business in Hong Kong because, of course, the special trade status the U.S. holds for Hong Kong is still in place as well. The process to scrutinize it is now being opened and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is proceeding.But I'd be surprised if it was taken away simply because there are a lot of American economic interests that don't want it.BARTIROMO: So are you saying you -- you really believe that the Chinese Communist Party is going to keep up their promise of buying $250 billion worth of U.S. goods, Ian? You believe that?BREMMER: No. No, I don't believe it for the slightest. I believe that President Trump and I believe, no, I don't.BARTIROMO: No. So then how is the trade deal on? So how is the trade deal on?BREMMER: Yes. Well, you'd have to ask the president, since he's the one that made that tweet.BARTIROMO: What's the -- what's the deal?BREMMER: Well, there are some -- I mean there -- for -- for example, the Chinese government has actually increased opportunities for U.S. financial institutions to do business. So you've seen -- I mean I -- I will tell you, the CEO of a number of financial companies in the United States feel like the deal is important because they've -- it has allowed them to open their businesses in China.The deal itself -- and -- and they have, in the last month, they've stepped up some of their agricultural purchasing, but there's no way with, you know, zero percent growth this year that they're going to meet those numbers. And they're not trying to.So my point is not trying to tell -- if you want to get me to say Chinese are living up to this deal, I (INAUDIBLE) --BARTIROMO: But, see, that's the thing, they're not trying to. But, Ian, you're saying they're not -- they're not going to meet those numbers and they're not trying to, yet the deal is on.BREMMER: Right.BARTIROMO: In my view, it's not on, OK. In my view it's not on at all because you've got China continuing to steal intellectual property and China's Communist Party continuing to break promises across the world.Look at what they're doing to Hong Kong. Look at what they're doing in India. Twenty soldiers are dead this morning, they're facing off on the Indian border. Look at the South China Sea and how they militarized it. So, when you say there's no economic -- economic cold war, I'm like, really, I don't know about that. The Pentagon just named 20 companies that should be sanctioned.BREMMER: But, yes, yes, look at -- look at what they're doing -- look at -- look at what they're doing to the Uyghurs, you know, over 1 million internally that have been (INAUDIBLE) fundamentally --BARTIROMO: Right. So you can't -- so I'm -- I'm just trying to -- I'm just trying to -- are you -- are you defending the CCP right here? I mean I just don't know what you're saying. I don't -- I don't follow you.BREMMER: No, no, no. No, I'm -- I'm only -- I'm analyzing, I'm telling you what our president is saying. I'm telling you that the president is saying the deal's still on, that he -- he has absolutely avoided direct criticism of President Xi when he had the opportunity to go after the Chinese on these transgressions and had a big press conference. The only one focused on China. He said -- he led it by saying, I'm leaving the World Health Organization. There was virtually nothing on China directly in his statements. And he is the one that continues to say that the deal is on, that we're making a lot of money on this deal.BARTIROMO: All right, just to be clear -- so, just to be clear --BREMMER: So, you're going to have to tell the president that you think the deal should be off (ph). He's not listening.BARTIROMO: All right, I -- we don't -- well, look, just -- just to be clear, Ian, this president is the first president to call out China. This president has been the first president to actually highlight the serious national security issues that are here as a result of China and their theft of military information, their theft of medical information, agricultural.And, of course, then there's the Huawei situation. Right now, as we speak, the U.S. is trying to understand how to get behind competitors of Huawei to tell smaller countries, you don't have to be intimidated when China comes calling and says, we're going to give you infrastructure for free and it's Huawei so that the back doors and all the data goes back to the CCP. I asked William Barr about that, the attorney general, and listen to what he said about what I was told came up in a briefing two weeks ago in a Senate hearing.Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Would the U.S. consider acquiring Erickson and Nokia to send a message to the world that if you use Erickson and Nokia, you've got the backing of the United States government as an alternative to Huawei?WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: So I mean I gave a speech a while back saying that it was -- that the -- the two companies best positioned to compete with Huawei are Erickson and Nokia. But unlike Huawei -- Huawei has the backing of the Chinese government and all the Chinese government money. Ultimately, the west has to rally around these companies, whether that means private ownership or state involvement.BARTIROMO: So you would be OK taking a stake, even if it's a minority stake, in -- in these companies to offset the threat of Huawei then?BARR: That's not a decision for the Justice Department. I -- I -- I do think that the west has to pick a -- pick a horse or horses.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So -- so we're in the middle of this, Ian. We are in the middle of this disagreement, challenge, economic cold war, whatever you want to call it. But it is not the same relationship we had just five years ago. Would you agree with that?BREMMER: Look, I want to -- it's very clear that the U.S. and China have no trust for each other. It's very clear that we are decoupling our relationship from China very strongly on the technology front. We are responding very strongly to Huawei and the fact that they are taking data from those that they engage with and providing it to the Chinese government. And the Trump administration has been strong on this.But I want to be very clear, Maria, because you were asking me, are the Chinese living up to the terms of the phase one trade deal. The answer is absolutely not. And I want to be very clear, the reason we are still in that deal is uniquely and completely on the shoulders of President Trump, who has ample opportunity to leave it and has chosen not to. And so, you know, that is -- that's not the fault of the Communist Party, that's not the fault of the Democrats or the Republicans in Congress. That is -- he's the one that made the deal. And if they're not going to live up to it, he's the one that will have to leave.Now, he has reasons not to leave the deal. I understand that.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, you're -- well, you're right --But since you -- you were the one asking me that question, you do have to recognize where that responsibility lies.BARTIROMO: A number of -- yes. A number of financial services companies have gotten the green light to go operate there, like JP Morgan. Before that, they weren't able to. So I understand what you're saying in terms of those companies.But AG Barr is calling out those companies. They -- he says it's their fault. They're looking for profit short-term and missing the national security issues.This issue is not going away anytime soon, Ian. We will continue the discussion. Thank you so much. It is great to see you, Ian.Ian Bremmer joining us.Stay with us. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Advertising boycott. Verizon the latest high profile company taking ads off of FaceBook and Instagram, joining companies like Ben and Jerry's, Patagonia, The North Face, over FaceBook not doing enough apparently to prevent racial or violent content being shared.Dagen, this is an issue that you have been talking about for years now in terms of watching some horrific things on social media.MCDOWELL: Right. There's always a why now that is the central question any journalist has to ask. And I think with these companies, they're using the cover of they're not happy with FaceBook and how it polices speech because they're trying to cut costs because we're still in the middle of a pandemic. These retailers are -- say, clothing manufactures and companies are struggling. So it's a way for them to posture their awareness of social injustice and hate speech, but also cut costs at the same time.Because I will just ask the question, where were they for years that people were streaming suicides, murders?BARTIROMO: Exactly.MCDOWELL: More than three years ago, a man killed an infant on a live video stream on FaceBook. Did we hear a peep from any of these companies?BARTIROMO: Oh, God.MCDOWELL: And one -- just one more thing. But the more that FaceBook polices speech, the more that they are indicating, hey, we are not going to need that liability waiver that we get with the Communications Decency Act from back in '96.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: So it is a very tough position that FaceBook's in.BARTIROMO: I want to -- yes, I want to switch gears, ask you about the Federal Reserve imposing new restrictions on U.S. banks following the latest stress test. We talked about this earlier and yesterday with Gerard Cassidy, remember, the Central Bank is capping banks' dividends and suspecting stock buybacks for a third -- for the third quarter. This is aimed at keeping the banking system strong through the Covid-19 pandemic.Alli, what's your take on what took place yesterday in terms of the stress tests? All of the banks are said to be healthy. And they should be, they've got enough capital on the balance sheet. But, of course, the dividends and the limitations on buybacks is something to look at.MCCARTNEY: This is a sort of glass half full, glass half empty in a way. It depends on how you look at it. The way the market looked at it yesterday was that the majority passed.Now, what they were looking for was different scenario analysis, just like all the banks are doing, which is, there's one thing if we have this v recovery, right? But in the case that we don't, that we have a prolonged l or a u or a w, where does that leave the banks, trying to use the information and the forward prescription that they learned during the financial crisis.So, yes, the good news is they passed. The bad news is, if this is prolonged and look at all the things we've been talking about today, especially with the IMF taking down their global forecast, you know, there world in which this becomes a lot more protracted and we want to make sure that all of that money that's gone into the system, the 2 trillion that's back into the banks, is being kept just in case.BARTIROMO: Do -- all right. Alli, thank you.We'll take a break.When we come back, Macy's laying workers off. The company's struggling amid the Covid-19 pandemic. What businesses should be doing to weather the crisis when we come right back.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Well, the coronavirus is taking a severe toll on business in the United States. Macy's has announced its laying off nearly 4,000 employees in corporate and management roles. That's roughly 3 percent of the company's workforce.Meanwhile, family entertainment chain Chuck E. Cheese filing for Chapter 11. They're going into bankruptcy protection as many locations remain closed during this pandemic.Joining me right now is Alixpartners CEO Simon Freakley.Simon, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.You see a lot out there speaking to your clients in terms of their -- what they've seen and the impact. What kind of an impact are you seeing in terms of business restructuring and the impact of Covid-19?SIMON FREAKLEY, CEO, ALIXPARTNERS: Good morning, Maria. And thank you for having me again on your show.I mean, obviously, we seen in the retail sector and the hospitality sector profound impact from Covid. Obviously we saw in apparel, for instance, that sales dropped by about 80 percent in April. But as we see people seeing bankruptcy protection, (INAUDIBLE) because it's a sign of the magnitude of the challenge (ph).But let's not forget, it's not just retail and hospitality that are suffering.BARTIROMO: So where do you think the biggest hits are then? Of course, in - - in retail, as well as in the restaurant sector, we've seen a lot of bankruptcies. These companies live on cash flow. There's none of it. They - - they are not going to be able to make it out of here. But where else do you think is the big hit that maybe we're not focused on in terms of the Covid shutdown?FREAKLEY: Well, of course, 70 percent of U.S. GDP is consumer spending. So anything that comes from consumer spending is going to be badly hit. And, of course, we've referenced retail and hospitality. And if miss a sale, particularly a meal, for instance, that never comes back. That's a lost sale. And so retail and hospitality, obviously.But just think about the impact on travel companies, on hotel companies, for instance. Take Marriott. Marriott's had a profound disruption to its business as a result of Covid. And, by the way, I think Arne Sorenson, the CEO, has done a spectacularly good job, leading with integrity and empathy as he's really shrunk that business in anticipation of what's to come.But I think the effect is profound. And now, of course, we're seeing spikes again in the southern states, Florida, Texas, starting to reduce activity again as the -- as the virus takes hold for a second time. And so there is going to be waves of this disruption throughout many sectors. But, you know, how quickly will the airline industry come back? Airbus is saying not until 2023, possibly until 2025.BARTIROMO: Wow. That is just incredible, Simon. And that -- and that really is the question. It's right that you brought it up, how long-lasting will this impact be on business? We'll have to wait and see.Simon Freakley, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for weighing in. We'll see you soon, sir.FREAKLEY: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Coming up, crossing the aisle. Former Connecticut -- and to you -- former Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman is here on how Republicans and Democrats can work together to pass police reform that everyone agrees with. That's next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, June 26th. Your top stories right now, 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.Markets are searching for some firm direction this morning. We are weighing another record rise in coronavirus cases and new restrictions on share buybacks and dividends for the big banks after the stress test results yesterday. Dow Industrials this morning down 57 points, banks are lower across the board, but the Nasdaq is up 12.5 and the S&P 500 right now up 1.25.Yesterday, markets climbed toward the end of the session to close in the green, led by the big banks as a post financial crisis restrictions were eased. The Dow Industrials were up almost 300 points, the Nasdaq was up 107, and the S&P was up 33 at 4:00 on Wall Street yesterday.Global markets this morning are mixed. European indices pretty good, looking good, up across the board. FT 100 up 101, one and two-thirds percent. The CAC quarante is up 81, and the DAX index is up 133. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde saying that the worst of the coronavirus is probably behind us in Europe, but still sounding off over concern of a potential second wave come the fall.In Asia overnight markets were mixed. Still some holidays going on. Markets in China are closed for a holiday. As you see, the Nikkei was one of the better performers, up 1.1 percent on the Nikkei in Japan.Nascar releasing a photo of the rope tied like a noose found in driver Bubba Wallace's garage.Cheryl Casone with those details right now.Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Maria. And the photo has caused quite the debate on social media after Nascar released this photo of the garage door pull rope that was in Bubba Wallace's garage. Nascar said it checked every garage that the 29 tracks it uses for races and the one at Talladega was the only rope tied this way, as you can see. An investigation found that the rope had been there in that particular garage since last fall and was not directed at Wallace personally. Nascar says it's going to install cameras and require sensitivity training. The FBI says Wallace was not the victim of a hate crime. Wallace says he is relieved at the result of this.Well, the Covid-19 pandemic took a heavy toll on Nike's latest quarter. The company posted a $790 million net loss after the outbreak forced nearly all of its stores to close for two months. Sales plunged 38 percent from a year ago. One bright note, online sales jumped 75 percent in the quarter. Taking a look at the stock in the premarket, it's actually down more than 3 percent in the premarket after those earnings.Well, America's best-selling pickup has a new look. Ford rolled out a new and improved F-150 during an online event last night hosted by actor Denis Leary. The new model includes a new interior, as well as technology and productivity upgrades. It's the first complete redesign of the struck since 2015. No word on how much the 2021 model's going to set you back. The average F-series, though, right now is a little more than $51,000. Taking a look at Ford in the pre-market, up 1.5 percent. It will be in showrooms later this year.And finally here is a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com.Goodyear is getting into the electric vehicle business with a new partnership with Lordstown Motors on tire services and future tire operations.Jeff Bezos says Amazon has acquired naming rights to the former key arena in Seattle. They're going to rename it the Climate Pledge Arena. It will be the first net zero carbon certified arena and it's going to have zero waste.And Barstool Sports CEO says the company is aiming to launch its sports betting app in time for the 2020 NFL season in September. Bring on the football, Maria.And those are the headlines from the newsroom.Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you.Meanwhile, the House passing a sweeping police reform bill yesterday aimed at curbing excessive force. It comes just one day after Democrats blocked debate on the GOP's version in the Senate. The vote nearly down party lines with three Republicans crossing over.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): We have the opportunity and the obligation to ensure that his death and the deaths of so many others are not in vain. When we pass this bill, the Senate will have a choice, to honor George Floyd's life or to do nothing.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is former Connecticut Senator, Vice Presidential Candidate, and United Against Nuclear Iran Chairman, Kasowitz, Benson, Torres Senior Council Joe Lieberman.And, Joe, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.Why is it that the two sides cannot get together on police reform? We've got two very similar packages and yet it all is along party lines.LIEBERMAN: Yes, I agree. I mean this is the problem that makes the American people angry at their government and Washington, lose confidence in their government. The public is really agitated about what they saw in the death of George Floyd, the police officer just sitting almost blandly, unemotionally on the neck of a fellow human being until he died. And they want something done about it, but they don't want their police strung up either because we're a rule of law society, we depend on our police. So, absolutely right.You've got two bills. One's Senator Scott's in the Senate and now the House Democratic bill. They cover the same subjects. They go at it a little differently. Oh, come on, let's -- let's get together and compromise, just the way the big things have always happened in Congress, and get something done. And that's the challenge now for Congress, both parties. I hope some of the leaders decide to break out of it. Speaker Pelosi and Senator McConnell have worked together on some things. Maybe they ought to just put their heads together and figure out how to get something done now. It's important for our country.BARTIROMO: One of -- one of the things that the Democrats want, they want the elimination of qualified immunity. And, of course, this is a protection that police have in the case of lawsuits. And AG Barr said to me, look, if there's no qualified immunity, people will not even begin to think about becoming a police officer.But, Senator, you would think that there is agreement about all of this stuff going on across the country, where, you know, looters have taken advantage of peaceful protesters or, you know, taking over parts of cities. They tried to do it in providence, but they certainly did do it in Seattle in terms of that CHOP zone. What's your take on that? Shouldn't we all agree that we don't want, you know, looters to come and destroy our infrastructure, knocking down statues?LIEBERMAN: Yes, I mean, we understand -- I think most Americans understand and share the anger at what we watched, which is the -- the death and murder really of George Floyd in Minneapolis. But, on the other hand, we live in a rule of law society. We can't have mobs controlling action. There's no justification no matter how angry you are for looting, for turning on the police, et cetera, et cetera.BARTIROMO: Exactly.LIEBERMAN: So it's got to be calm. And I think one of the ways to calm it down is for the Republicans and Democrats in Congress to join with the president and get a -- a police reform bill passed.And it's never going to be perfect. Nothing ever is.BARTIROMO: Yes.LIEBERMAN: But as you always said in (INAUDIBLE) the perfect shouldn't be allowed to be the enemy of the good. Let's get something good done now on this.BARTIROMO: Yes.But -- but, Senator, they're not going to do that because they want -- the Democrats want Donald Trump out.Look, this was from day one. We've got the race for the White House, you know, closer than ever. President Trump and Joe Biden both taking aim at one another from dueling campaign events.Listen to this. Got to get your reaction.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald Trump needs to stop caring about how he looks and start caring about what America -- what's happening in the rest of America.DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's so crazy what's happening. Here's a guy that doesn't talk. Nobody hears him. Whenever he does talk, he can't put two sentences together. I don't want to be nice or un-nice, OK, but, I mean, the man can't speak.BIDEN: Now we have over 120 million dead from Covid.TRUMP: That's a serious error. That's not a permissible type of error. We're talking about the presidency of the United States and it's just not acceptable.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, a new Fox News poll shows that Biden is in the lead in several key states, like Florida.Senator, how do you see the race?LIEBERMAN: Well, there's no question, based on the polling, that if the election were held today, Joe Biden would be elected president. But there are more than four months to go.A big factor is somewhat in the control of the president, but not really, which is, can we control the spread of coronavirus. And if those numbers begin to go down again, the economy will go up, people will feel good.Right now, when you ask the American people, is the country headed in the right direction or the wrong direction, the wrong direction wins by an enormous amount. And that's not good news for the incumbent.But the president really -- and this -- those clips you just showed, Maria, they -- they warn us, urge us to be prepared for one of the dirtiest and most personal campaigns in American history. And I don't think it's what the American people want.BARTIROMO: No.LIEBERMAN: I think they want to hear both candidates stop attacking each other and talk about their plans for the next four years if they get elected.BARTIROMO: Absolutely.LIEBERMAN: And -- but -- but right now the president's got some work to do, you know.BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right, Joe.Now, China is going to be one of the issues this election. The Trump administration now has named 20 Chinese companies, including technology giant Huawei, that it says are backed by the Chinese military. During my exclusive interview with Attorney General Barr, he told me that the U.S. must rally behind telecom companies like Erickson and Nokia because that is the -- those are the two strongest companies to pose a challenge to Huawei.Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Would the U.S. consider acquiring Erickson and Nokia to send a message to the world that if you use Erickson and Nokia, you've got the backing of the United States government as an alternative to Huawei?WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: So, I mean, I gave a speech a while back saying that it was -- that the -- the two companies best positioned to compete with Huawei are Erickson and Nokia. But unlike Huawei -- Huawei has the backing of the Chinese government and all the Chinese government money.Ultimately, the west has to rally around these companies, whether that means private ownership or state involvement.BARTIROMO: So you would be OK taking a stake, even if it's a minority stake, in these companies to offset the threat of Huawei then?BARR: That's not a decision for the Justice Department. I -- I -- I do think that the west has to pick a -- pick a horse or horses.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Your reaction? Your reaction, Senator?LIEBERMAN: Yes. I think there's some really good thinking there. First, let me say, it's hard to believe, because we have such great high tech and telecom companies, that there's not now a single American company to compete with the Chinese telecom companies. We've got to go to Erickson and Nokia. But, so be it. That's the way it is.And I think what -- what Attorney General Barr said is really worth all of us thinking about. Part of why the Chinese telecom companies have done so well is that they have been a part of big Chinese plans. In other words, the government has backed them. And it gives them an advantage. And that -- that no longer seems to happen in the U.S. So we've got to go back in a very practical, I think, non-ideological way and create again what we used to call public-private partnerships.Obviously the other thing that can happen is that the Chinese government companies can do some things to reassure us that they're not going to use 5G sales in America to compromise our security. But so far they haven't done any of that.BARTIROMO: All right.Senator Joe Lieberman, it is good to see you this morning. We will keep watching, of course. We'll see you soon, sir, thank you.LIEBERMAN: You too (ph). Have a good weekend.BARTIROMO: And to you. Thank you.Coming up, the next jobs in America. We are looking at professions poised for growth as the economy eventually bounces back.And then Covid-19 changing the way we live. The virus prompting some interesting home renovations. Wait until you see this. That's coming up.Be sure to tune in on Monday for my special interview with the Milken Institute Chairman Michael Milken on his efforts in the race for a coronavirus vaccine treatment, his take on the economy as well. You won't want to miss that.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: The next jobs in America. The country's steady reopening expected to impact the June jobs report. It is out next week and we will be all over it, of course. But Ziprecruiter collecting data on how the economy bounce back is influencing future job opportunities across the country. Exactly what we are looking at.Joining me right now is Ziprecruiter Labor Economist Julia Pollak.Julia, it's good to have you this morning.Let's get into it right here. Where are you seeing the most job opportunities at this point in the pandemic?JULIA POLLAK, LABOR ECONOMIST, ZIPRECRUITER: Well, honestly, Maria, right now the labor market is treading water. In mid-May, high frequency economic indicators were all ticking upwards and -- and things looked very encouraging. But since then, there's been very little improvement and not much recovery in sight.That said, you know, even in a crisis, there are always companies hiring and the places where we see the largest demand right now, or in anything related to e-commerce, postal service, warehousing, truck driving, and places like that.BARTIROMO: So you're saying that the things that we've been doing because of the shutdown, we're doing e-commerce, we're doing telemedicine, we're doing teleeducation, we're getting deliveries, so this is all creating demand for truck drivers and e-commerce positions.Do you think these jobs will be long-lasting? Will we still be doing these kinds of things when we get out of this?POLLAK: Yes. You know, people are creatures of habit. And once you download that Amazon Prime app on your phone and you start paying that subscription, you're probably going to keep using it. Also, you know, these companies have now been given an opportunity to innovate and grow and collect more and more data, which will help them get better and better. So there will be a, you know, a permanent shift towards online entertainment, online education, and the at-home economy.BARTIROMO: Alli McCartney.MCCARTNEY: To that point, you talked about some of the jobs that as we iterate and accelerate these online trends are going to be beneficiaries. Where are the areas that you see potentially permanent job destruction?POLLAK: So, right now the areas where job openings are down the most are in places like event planning, you know, conferences, conventions, travel services, tour guides, casinos. State and local government sees huge, huge, huge job losses ahead due to the budget crunch.And then we're also seeing a surprising decline in places like communications, marketing, advertising, business and professional services and even in tech. And one of the saddest things we're seeing is that formerly, you know, highly demanded professionals, data scientists, automation experts, are seeing all of their start-up opportunities freeze up as -- as, you know, investors shelter in place.BARTIROMO: Right. Sure.Great advice and insight from you, Julia. Thanks very much. We'll keep watching.Julia Pollak joining us there from ZipRecruiter.A quick break and then Covid-19 changing the way we live. This virus prompting some interesting home renovations. We're going to take a look at that when we come right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Changing spaces. Homes and offices looking a lot different. The pandemic shifting priorities for how we live and work.Lauren Simonetti with all of the details now.Lauren.LAUREN SIMONETTI FBN CORRESPONDENT: Happy Friday, Maria.Well, doors, they're coming back, along with bidets, mud rooms, even double master suites. So homeowners are reimagining their homes as offices, schools, gyms, even playgrounds. That means once popular open floor spaces may have seen their final day as people seek out privacy and noise control. More homeowners are turning to things like soundproof insulation and barn doors to transition their open spaces.And even more extreme, separate areas that keep germs away, including mud rooms and guest bathrooms with touchless faucets and self-cleaning toilets. One designer I spoke to predicts that soon floor tiles will take your temperature and mirrors will check your vitals.If any of this sounds appealing, a few things to know before you start your home renovation. It will likely take you a lot longer from the supply chains being disrupted, to labor crews having to practice new safety measures. Municipalities are also taking a long time, in some cases, to approve permits.But you may get more bang for your buck. Many contractors, they're looking to get their men and women back on the job.And take a look here, during lockdown, home builders, Lennar, Toll Brothers and others have seen their stock prices rise at least 30 percent. And then companies like Lowe's, for instance, up 50 percent.And one more thing, Maria, double master suites. Homeowners are demanding space to accommodate multigenerational living. There is little desire to put parents, for instance, in a care facility right now.So the way we live has totally changed and, you know, I had the option of an open floor plan a few years ago when we moved. And I didn't do it. And my husband and I have been fighting about it ever since. And now I say, I'm right, we have privacy.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's good. Glad you won that one.But it's really interesting the things that you're reporting, Lauren. Thank you so much.SIMONETTI: Yes.BARTIROMO: Dagen, jump in here.I love what Lauren says about mirrors taking your vitals. That sounds really good. Are you making any changes in your apartment?MCDOWELL: I don't have an Alexa, so I'm not going to take the next step to have a mirror taking my vital signs.I live in essentially a 500 square foot apartment in -- well, in the middle of certainly the dirtiest and least safe city in my opinion in the country. So it's -- rearranging furniture is even difficult in such a small space.But one thing I'll add is, don't be sold a lie that somehow you spend a lot of money on renovations and it's going to -- you're going to get $2 for every dollar you put into it. That's a lie that people in the home reno business and even realtors will tell you.But my parents added a fully functional kind of handicap accessible bathroom years ago, before my mother got sick. And that was -- like after she had a stroke and went through what she did, that was the smartest thing that they ever did. And I fussed at them when they were doing it about how much money they were spending. But I tell you, it was a life saver for all of us as we cared for mom for six years.BARTIROMO: Yes. I did that too for my parents, put in like different poles on the walls so that it's all really accommodative for senior living.MCDOWELL: The high toilet seat.BARTIROMO: Yes, that too.MCDOWELL: Every -- you know what, I'm 51, I need a high toilet seat now too.BARTIROMO: Still ahead, it is time to ask Maria. I am answering your questions, including what my favorite flowers are, and industry's poised for an economic rebound. We've gotten your questions and I have answered them, next hour, right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIAStay with us.Load-Date: June 26, 2020End of Document

GARDNER APPLAUDS NEW SANCTIONS ON CHINESE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALSStates News ServiceJuly 9, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 354 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Colorado Senator Cory Gardner:U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy, released the following statement today regarding new sanctions imposed on a Chinese government entity and four current or former government officials for serious human rights abuses against ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR)."These new sanctions imposed on Chinese Communist Party officials are a historic stand for human rights around the world," said Senator Gardner. "The CCP's actions in Xinjiang are an affront to humanity, and I am proud to have authored the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, which called for these sanctions against human rights abusers. We must continue to hold the CCP accountable and ensure it pays a heavy price for these heinous crimes."Gardner's Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, signed into law in December 2018, authorizes funding to promote democracy, human rights, and rule of law in the People's Republic of China and supports sanctions designations against any entity or individual that violates human rights or religious freedoms or engages in censorship activities.In December 2018, Gardner held a hearing in his subcommittee specifically focused on China's human rights abuses, including hearing testimony from one of the top Uighur community leaders. The hearing was the first public instance where the U.S. Department of State publicly revealed that over two million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities are being detained in modern-day concentration camps in Xinjiang. Also in December 2018, Gardner condemned China's human rights abuses in a personal meeting with China's Ambassador to the United States, Cu Tiankai.###Cory Gardner is a member of the U.S. Senate serving Colorado. He sits on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and is the Chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy.Load-Date: July 9, 2020End of Document

Why America Is Afraid of TikTokAtlantic OnlineJuly 30, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 4796 wordsByline: Michael SchumanBodyZhang Yiming embodies what the United States wanted China to be. He is the founder and chief executive of a company, ByteDance, that owns a wildly popular social-media platform, TikTok. He is a serial entrepreneur, having built multiple apps and search engines. Zhang's story is one not of a copycat or a cost-cutter-the tired stereotypes of the Chinese business owner-but of an innovator.For most of the past half century, one of Washington's primary foreign-policy goals was to create more Zhangs. The United States believed that it could transform Communist China into a society more like its own-wealthy, free, inventive, and open, a place where a nobody like Zhang, with little more than smarts and the tools of capitalism, could build the businesses and think of the ideas that would change the world.To a degree, Zhang is proof that the U.S. succeeded. TikTok may be Chinese, but it has been embraced by Americans as their own. While Facebook is for sharing baby pictures, Twitter is for political ranting, and Instagram is for showing off how popular you are, TikTok has a certain silly simplicity-a forum where you can dance in your living room, lip-synch bad jokes, capture animal antics, and share other slivers of your personal life.The United States has long prided itself on being open to anyone and anything, from anywhere, which improves our lives and livelihoods. In the American telling, the entrepreneurial, their grit and genius, have always been welcome, even cherished, no matter where they were born.You'd think, then, that Zhang would be feted from Washington to Wall Street as an avatar of the best of China and America, and of what their partnership can accomplish. With a presidential election approaching, both Donald Trump and Joe Biden should be tapping TikTok to woo young voters. New York bankers should be competing to list ByteDance's shares on U.S. stock exchanges.A few years ago, all that might have happened. But not now. Most Americans, inside and outside the Beltway, no longer perceive China as a potential partner, but as a strategic enemy. Trump rails against Beijing on Twitter and at news conferences. The old policy of patient engagement is derided as a naive liberal fantasy that did nothing more than hand wealth and power to an authoritarian adversary. Seen through this prism, Zhang and TikTok embody not what's gone right with China, but what's gone wrong. TikTok-an app largely devoted to viral dance crazes and teenagers pranking their cats-is part of the China threat: the sharp high-tech edge of the Communist regime, penetrating deep into American society, stealing its secrets, monitoring its citizens, and aiding Beijing's nefarious aims.And so, egged on by a growing consensus against Beijing in Washington, as well as by hawks in the Republican Party, the Treasury Department is poised this week to recommend action to be taken against the app, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said.Americans on TikTok "need to worry about it, because it is a surveillance apparatus for Beijing," Senator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told me. "It is a Trojan horse on people's phones."At first glance, such alarm might sound like paranoia. How can videos of kids dancing to hip-hop music possibly be a dire threat to anything? But in Washington, the perceived national-security risks of TikTok are very real, and in recent weeks, attitudes toward the company have hardened. TikTok has become a symbol of the new challenge a rising, tech-enabled China presents not simply to a free society, but to American dominance in the technology sector. The internet today is largely run-for better or worse-by American corporations such as Alphabet, Amazon, and Facebook, and TikTok is the first Chinese company to truly break through to the American, and global, consciousness, something its compatriots, including Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent, have yet to do.Fears are percolating in the U.S. that Beijing, thanks to its growing technological might, may be amassing an immense storehouse of information that could be used to identify or blackmail American citizens-or for purposes we haven't yet thought of. The worry is that TikTok could be a powerful vacuum, sucking up images of and details on unsuspecting Americans to feed Beijing's voracious appetite. China's widespread collection of data on its own people-whether through the surveillance state it has built in Xinjiang, the social-credit system that is being implemented, or its intrusive tracking of movements and meetings to combat the spread of the coronavirus-has further driven fears of its willingness to gather such information from abroad for its own ends. TikTok thus finds itself not simply the symbol of China's ascendance and penetration into America, but on the front lines of a new battle between the U.S. and China.Zhang insists that ByteDance has never turned over information on Americans to Chinese authorities, and that it never would. "We have never received such a request  from the Chinese government, and we don't think there will be such a request," Zhang told me. "Even if we get such a request, it is impossible" to comply.He is probably being perfectly sincere. There's no hard evidence that he's working for the Communist Party, at least none that has become public. (Zhang told me that he isn't a party member.) But amid the escalating distrust of China, Zhang's promises and pledges mean little. The regime has fostered an impression that all of its 1.4 billion citizens are loyal, or can be made loyal, to the party. In theory, then, that means anyone with a Chinese passport could be a spy, or could be compelled to be a spy. What would stop a government that tortures dissidents and locks up hundreds of thousands of Muslims in gulags from one day pressuring Zhang into doing its bidding?[Read: Chinese AI is creating an axis of autocracy]What Zhang could, would, or might do in the future is a rabbit hole of what-ifs and unanswerable questions. The fact that we're asking them is an indication of just how bad things are between the U.S. and China. Bizarrely, what happens to this goofy video-sharing app targeted at teens is an indication of whether the two countries are headed toward renewed, if uneasy, cooperation or into a superpower standoff with potentially disastrous consequences for world peace and prosperity. TikTok's fate also tells us if China can continue its historic rise and challenge American political and economic primacy: Chinese leaders know that they must transform their country into a technological powerhouse to reach new heights of economic success and diplomatic clout. If geopolitical headwinds stymie Zhang's ambitions, they could also destroy China's.But most of all, the controversy over TikTok offers a window into American and Chinese societies at this crucial moment, and where they might be going. TikTok shows the best and worst of modern China-both its boundless potential to generate wealth and ideas that can benefit everybody and the fear and conflict caused by its expansive and expanding authoritarianism. No other Chinese company has woven itself so intimately into American life. In an age of intrusive technologies, Big Data, and heightened foreign threats, our ideals are being put to the test by how we deal with this one app."We're at this inflection point," Samm Sacks, an expert in China and cybersecurity at the think tank New America told me. "Can we maintain the openness that has been one of our greatest strengths but protect ourselves with technology in everything? Right now the rules are being written in real time."(Arsh Raziuddin / The Atlantic)Like most journalists, I prefer to conduct major interviews in person: You get a glimpse into someone's character-how they dress, their body language, how others interact with them. That was the idea when I first started discussing meeting with Zhang. But then the pandemic intruded on any hope of a face-to-face conversation. I ended up talking with him on Zoom, which significantly narrows the window into someone's personality.Still, there are always clues. When planning the interviews (I spoke with him twice), I referred to him in emails as "Mr. Zhang." I didn't know him, and in China, businesspeople tend to lean toward the formal side in such matters. But TikTok's communications chief chuckled and told me, "You're the only one who calls him Mr. Zhang." Within ByteDance, he goes by his first name, so he's just plain Yiming. Informality seems to be his hallmark. At the start of our first interview, Zhang talked about how, amid the outbreak, he was managing ByteDance virtually. "They don't need me so much," he quipped, exhibiting a lack of imperial air rare among Chinese business leaders, which I have seen only a handful of times in my 18 years covering China.[Read: How China is planning to win back the world]In Zhang's telling, he's just an ordinary guy, born in the little-known town of Longyan, in China's southeastern Fujian province. His father was a librarian for a local science association, his mother a nurse. He spent much of his childhood reading-everything from novels to music magazines-a habit encouraged by a small allowance from his parents. Zhang, 37, was fortunate to have been a child of China's capitalist revolution, when exploring new ideas was in vogue. Deng Xiaoping had launched his economic reforms shortly before Zhang's birth, and, by chance, Fujian was one of the first provinces to open to the world, and thus among the reforms' earliest beneficiaries. By the time Zhang was in middle school, his parents had enough money to invest in a computer (his father wished to try his luck at stock trading on the reopened Shanghai bourse). Zhang learned how to use Windows 3.1 and some basic programming. "You can do many things by yourself. You have freedom to create things," he said. "I think that's the fascination of computers."Still, he didn't become committed to technology as a career until he was in university. A year after graduating, he joined with a group of businessmen to develop a travel search engine that was eventually purchased by Tripadvisor. He then left for Microsoft, but lasted only six months there, convinced he was unsuited for big corporations. After a short stint at another start-up, he set up a real-estate search engine with backing from the Susquehanna International Group (SIG), a finance firm based near Philadelphia.By 2011, Zhang was again ready for something new. He began musing on the future of technology, and found it in the cellphone. "The tipping point for mobile [was] very close," he recalled. Again with the help of SIG, Zhang said, he raised $2 million, including his own small contribution, and used the funds to found ByteDance in 2012, poaching six former employees of his and turning a Beijing apartment into a makeshift office where they would develop mobile apps. (Today, ByteDance has a bevy of high-profile investors, including SoftBank, KKR, Hillhouse Capital Group, and Sequoia. SIG, which remains a shareholder, would not comment on its business dealings with Zhang.) Among the first apps ByteDance debuted was a news-aggregation platform, Toutiao, which literally translates to "Headlines." It was a smash hit, and remains popular in China today.Several years later, in 2017, TikTok was developed. "We shifted more attention to video," Zhang explained. "Then we realized it is hard for ordinary users to create videos. Then we were thinking how to solve it." The idea was to help the average person express themselves by making technology more accessible.Initially, TikTok's popularity was largely limited to Asian markets such as Japan and the Philippines. Months after it was released, ByteDance acquired the Chinese lip-synching app Musical.ly for $1 billion. Musical.ly already had a sizable user base in the U.S., and ByteDance combined both the app and its user base with TikTok.[Read: TikTok is taking over India]Even with that entry into the American market, no one could have predicted the craze that TikTok would become. The app has been downloaded 165 million times in the U.S. alone, according to the research firm Sensor Tower, and globally tops 2 billion downloads, placing it among the most popular apps in the world. Americans-and users elsewhere-record and share videos of themselves lip-synching, dancing, telling jokes, or any number of other zany, creative, surprisingly personal (and potentially embarrassing) things. The fact that users can borrow and remix each other's audio is a key differentiator on the app, and further lowers the barrier to entry."We want it to become a window," Zhang said. "It is a window to look into a bigger world. We want the platform to become a window into a bigger and bigger world."(I must confess at this point that until I began reporting this story, I had no experience with, and scant knowledge of, TikTok and how it worked. I downloaded it and, flipping through its bottomless supply of short videos, quickly discovered that I didn't get it. I'm much too private to show the world that I can't dance, and the time and effort apparently required to manufacture a good video were intimidating. But it doesn't take much scrolling to see that Generation Z dominates on TikTok, and let's just say that I'm a couple of letters older.)Americans are normally suckers for this sort of entrepreneurial tale, and in the past, Chinese business leaders have won them over. In 2014, Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, was treated like royalty when he listed his e-commerce giant on the New York Stock Exchange. Wang Jianlin, the founder of the property developer Wanda Group, snapped up the theater chain AMC and the production house Legendary Entertainment, corralling an Oscar in 2016 for the film Spotlight, which was backed by another of his studios.As it turned out, however, that period marked the swan song of peaceful cooperation with China. The ascent of Trump and his fiery bombast have completely changed Beijing from a partner (albeit a troublesome one) to a secret-stealing enemy of American jobs, technology, and democracy. Just as important is the dramatic shift in China's policy that has made the country appear like much more of a threat to U.S. global dominance and domestic security. Chinese President Xi Jinping has assertively flexed his country's muscles in foreign affairs, while at home he has intensified state control with new technologies, from data harvesting to facial recognition, as well as crackdowns in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.Xi's agenda has dealt a serious blow to Chinese companies striving to go global, such as ByteDance. Previously, American and Chinese businesses could happily trade and invest in an almost separate sphere from China's litany of human-rights abuses. But Xi has kicked down the wall that tenuously protected commerce from authoritarianism. His new high-tech surveillance state and the horrific ways he's used it have dragged unsuspecting chief executives-as well as professional athletes, video-game players, and artists-on both sides of the Pacific into political turmoil.[Read: The decline of the American world]Zhang is much too smart not to have spotted the potential pitfalls of running an app inside and outside of China when he launched TikTok. From its inception, he envisioned it as an international platform. TikTok has never operated in China. (ByteDance has a near-identical app, called Douyin, that does.)This separation between TikTok and China has been a big part of Zhang's campaign to ease concerns in Washington about him and his company. As U.S. politicians turned up the heat, Zhang tried putting as much distance as possible between the app and Beijing. TikTok's U.S. management team was moved out of China and into various American offices, and Vanessa Pappas, the app's U.S. general manager, insisted that Zhang handed the executive team almost complete autonomy to run the U.S. business as they saw fit. She said that although she had conversations with ByteDance about overall strategy and ideas, "all the day-to-day decisions are mine independently." Since joining the company in 2019, she continued, "people often ask me how many times I've gotten to China, and I've only been once."Zhang also enlisted a host of impressive new hires to bolster confidence. In March, TikTok brought on the well-connected Washington lobbyist Michael Beckerman to handle the likes of Hawley, and formed an advisory council, composed of academics and other experts, to guide the app's decisions on content. But the most prominent addition came in May, when the top Disney executive Kevin Mayer was named TikTok's new chief executive and ByteDance's chief operating officer. "The reason why we hired Kevin is because our business in the non-China market is going very well and we need someone who knows the market," Zhang said. "We are a young company. I am always thinking of bringing some experienced executives into the management."Within the industry, the addition of Mayer and others was perceived as an attempt to put trustworthy American faces in front of the Chinese company. "I can't think of anything else they can do," Lisa Sotto, who heads the cybersecurity practice at the law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth in New York, told me.Yet evidently, none of it has appeased the swarm of hawks in Washington. When I spoke with Hawley, he mocked Zhang's makeover attempt as "ridiculous," adding: "They are a China-based company." That, it seems, is all that matters.Zhang Yiming poses for a photograph at ByteDance's headquarters in Beijing. (Giulia Marchi / Bloomberg via Getty Images)In certain respects, TikTok is more of a headache for Washington than any other Chinese company is-even one routinely in the political crosshairs, Huawei. The national-security case against Huawei is much more direct. The firm supplies what is known as critical infrastructure, the nuts and bolts of wireless systems. Any government would, and should, be wary that such vital communications networks could be vulnerable to potential foreign adversaries. But the equipment Huawei makes can readily be supplied by other companies from friendlier nations, such as Sweden's Ericsson, and its gear can simply be torn out and replaced, as Britain is seeking to do.TikTok presents a very different conundrum. For one, the app is already on millions of American smartphones. Washington's concerns about data security in regards to China have been heightened by two recent hacks: of the credit-reporting firm Equifax in 2017, and of the federal government's Office of Personnel Management in 2015. In both cases, security experts blame Beijing. The assumption is that Chinese authorities are compiling dossiers on U.S. citizens for unknown, but probably compromising, purposes. TikTok could be a handy device for stuffing the files with juicy new details. Even more, TikTok is in the business of content. It can just as readily act as a conduit for spreading information as collecting it-and therefore could be a propaganda tool for the Chinese state.But that's all in theory. There doesn't seem to be any indisputable evidence that TikTok has shared private data on Americans with China. The platform says it stores its data on Americans in the U.S. and Singapore, and is thus out of the Chinese government's reach. A lawsuit filed in California last year alleges that TikTok lifted private data and shipped them off to servers in China, though what proof the plaintiff has is unclear. (TikTok wouldn't comment on an ongoing legal case.) When I pressed Hawley's office on whether it had any hard evidence against ByteDance or TikTok, its case was based mainly on conjecture: The law in China requires that Chinese companies hand data over to the government, the senator stressed in a comment sent to me. From there, they reach the conclusion that TikTok is, at the very least, a potential threat.[Read: Prom during the pandemic is happening on TikTok]It isn't exactly clear, though, whether ByteDance, as a Chinese company, is obligated to share American data with Beijing. Hawley's argument reflects a widely held belief that Chinese law gives the government carte blanche over data held by Chinese companies, but some experts believe the matter isn't that simple, especially with data held outside of China. There are also instances in which Chinese tech companies have pushed back against government demands for data.The fact that there is no agreement on what should be a rather simple legal point illustrates the real problem: Chinese laws are written in a loosey-goosey fashion to allow officials the wiggle room to more or less do as they please. More than that, the Communist Party doesn't always abide by the niceties of legal processes. China has no independent judiciary, and companies and individuals have little power to stand up to their own government. So if the authorities want something-like data on Americans, for instance-you can bet they will find a way of getting it.By this reckoning, TikTok, or for that matter any Chinese company, can't be trusted, because China can't be trusted. "There are probably many people at TikTok who just want to run a profitable company. But they can't," said Dan Harris, a founder of the law firm Harris Bricken, which specializes in business in China. "If you know how China works, you cannot claim that TikTok is secure."Zhang has had his run-ins with Beijing in the past, too. In 2019, one of his apps got into hot water for supposedly generating search results that defamed a Communist hero. A year earlier, he shut down a joke-swapping platform when prickly government censors blasted its content as "vulgar." Zhang had to write a "self-criticism," a common form of apology to the authorities in China.To some extent, there is nothing particularly unusual about these incidents. Companies that operate in China, both local and foreign, repeatedly get into such scuffles with thin-skinned officials over perceived political incorrectness. But this type of interference has heightened scrutiny of TikTok's decisions about content. All social-media outfits have challenges with content moderation, but with TikTok, critics make the assumption that choices about what should and should not be on the app are made to please Chinese censors. TikTok, of course, denies this, and insists that decisions are made by the U.S. team.The inevitable controversies have ensued anyway. Critics accused TikTok of scrubbing videos supportive of prodemocracy protesters in Hong Kong, whom Beijing considers "terrorists," and of locking the account of a teen who shared a video critical of the Chinese government's ill-treatment of the country's minority Uighur community. (The company has denied both accusations. In the former case, an investigation by BuzzFeed News backed up TikTok's assertion, and in the latter one, TikTok said the video was not the reason the account was frozen, and it apologized and reinstated the user's access.) In the U.S., following the death of George Floyd, TikTok came under fire for allegedly suppressing videos related to Black Lives Matter and the protests against police brutality and racism. The company has said that this was a temporary technical glitch.[Thomas Wright: How should Biden handle China?]Facing perceived threats from China, Congress and the White House have tended to confront them with measures American officials previously preferred to avoid-restrictions on businesses and people. Visas for Chinese researchers have been curtailed. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the government body that scrutinizes acquisitions of American companies from abroad, was granted enhanced powers, with China squarely in mind. Congress is working to inhibit Chinese firms' access to U.S. stock markets. Zhang is far from the only major Chinese business leader to get ensnared in this new web of controls. Even the once-beloved Jack Ma got blocked in 2018, when CFIUS refused to allow his fintech firm, Ant Financial, to purchase the Dallas-based payment service MoneyGram. Rather than listing in New York, as Alibaba did, Ant decided this month to offer shares in Shanghai and Hong Kong.Washington is dealing with TikTok in a similar fashion. Hawley introduced a bill in March that would bar government employees from using TikTok, and has also proposed legislation that would erect a stouter firewall between China and the U.S. by explicitly prohibiting companies like TikTok from sending data to China and limiting the types of information they can collect from their users. The Pentagon has already told military personnel to delete the app from their phones. At the urging of the likes of Senator Marco Rubio, CFIUS has opened a retroactive investigation into ByteDance's acquisition of Muscial.ly, which could force its disinvestment. "The best thing would be for ByteDance to sell TikTok and for it to be American-owned and based here," Hawley told me. (TikTok wouldn't comment on the possibility of it being spun off from ByteDance.) Others have gone further: India-previously TikTok's largest market-banned TikTok in June, and politicians in Australia are debating doing the same.How TikTok fares "will largely depend on issues beyond TikTok itself," says Claude Barfield, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who specializes in cybersecurity.[Read: China has dominated the West before]The fact is, no matter where he located his servers, how many American hotshots he recruited, or how he organized his managers, Zhang couldn't single-handedly rebuild America's trust in China, and that, in the end, was his real problem. Standing firm against a rising China is probably the only thing the right and the left in the U.S. can agree on at the moment. What other issue could possibly bring together the odd couple of Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Tom Cotton, the conservative firebrand, who jointly called on the government's intelligence experts to investigate the security risks posed by TikTok.As doors close on Zhang in America, the implications could swell beyond his fortune and his company. He would probably survive quite nicely off of ByteDance's enormous following in China. The real damage would be inflicted on China's aspirations and economic future. TikTok remains China's only global tech success story, based entirely on ingenuity, able to endear itself to people around the world. A sad ending would signal that Beijing's expanding authoritarianism and penchant for international confrontation are undercutting its entrepreneurs and, more broadly, its hopes of being a technology leader, capable of competing with American rivals and influencing the technology the world uses. Without becoming a dominant global technology player, China, burdened with rising costs and an aging population, may get stuck, unable to progress its economy into the ranks of the world's richest.But if Washington takes the drastic step of banning TikTok, the U.S. would suffer as well. It would mean Americans failed to find a middle path between preserving their values and protecting their security in the face of ever-changing technology. That's why Sacks, of New America, recently called shutting down TikTok "a terrible idea" that "means taking a page from Beijing's playbook" by invoking blanket national-security concerns to control what Americans can do on the internet.That raises the ugly prospect of destroying one of the main purposes of the internet-to knit the world together and strengthen contact with other societies. If we begin banning apps or restricting access, we will end up with many separate internets, more likely to divide than unite. That's not the kind of internet many people want. Despite all the scary headlines and dire warnings, TikTok was downloaded 300 million times around the globe-20 million in the U.S. alone-in the first three months of the year, far more times than in any other quarter, according to Sensor Tower.Perhaps TikTok (and for that matter, all data-collecting technology firms) does present a threat to our privacy and security. But what I've come to fear is that we will confront authoritarianism by copying its methods.The Chinese dictatorship blocks Facebook, Twitter, and other foreign social media because its leadership doesn't have the guts to allow its people to decide what they want to say, post, or watch.The motivation for blocking TikTok in the U.S. is much different, of course, but takes us to the same place-where the state determines what we can and cannot do on the internet. That puts the American government in the impossible position of defending our values by undermining them. That can't be the best way to confront our fears.Load-Date: July 31, 2020End of Document

Earlier this year,            several US government agencies banned TikTok over concerns about cybersecurity. TikTok is one of the most downloaded phone apps in the world and has already            entered more than 150 global markets, with India being one of its most active regions. According to the            Economic Times, the app claims to have 200 million users in India, with about 120 million monthly active users. Other major Chinese apps banned by India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology include WeChat, Weibo, and QQ, an instant messaging service owned by Chinese internet giant Tencent.In a statement on Tuesday morning local time, Nikhil Gandhi, head of TikTok India, said that the company was "in the process of complying" with India's ban. "We have been invited to meet with concerned government stakeholders for an opportunity to respond and submit clarifications," the Gandhi said. "TikTok continues to comply with all data privacy and security requirements under Indian law and has not shared any information of our users in India with any foreign government, including the Chinese government." "Further, if we were requested to in the future we would not do so," Gandhi added. The move follows major clashes between India and China earlier this month along a disputed border shared between the two countries. During the standoff in the Galwan River Valley            at least 20 Indian soldiers were killed.Satellite photos released Monday showed a buildup of troops along both sides of the border. NOW WATCH: Inside London during COVID-19 lockdownSee Also:• China passes sweeping national security laws for Hong Kong, further crushing the city's autonomy• Chinese nationals with ties to the Chinese government donated hundreds of thousands to support Trump's reelection, according to report• The US ramps up fight with China by taking another shot at 4 state-run media outlets operating in the statesLoad-Date: June 30, 2020End of Document

I'm Maria Bartiromo and it Wednesday, July 8. Your top stories right now, 8 a.m. on the button on the east coast.President Trump is pushing the governors of the nation to open schools this fall. This as the United States nears now 3 million confirmed cases of coronavirus. The FBI is warning China poses the greatest long term threat to America. FBI Director Christopher Wray says half of the bureau's counterintelligence cases are now related to China. Sounding the alarm that most Americas have already had their information stolen likely.The White House is warning against Chinese investments for retirement savings as tension rise between the two countries. Markets this morning searching for firm direction, take a look at where we stand with futures indicating a gain at the start of trading this morning.

Walmart takes on Amazon with its own subscription service. The retailer reportedly said to offer free same day delivery and discounts for customers willing to pay about $100 a year.House Democrats are introducing a bill to defund the police meanwhile. This as crime is rising in big cities across America. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani telling me in the last hour that current Mayor Bill de Blasio is a disgrace and that moves to defund the police undermine America.Coming up at 8:30 a.m. eastern this morning, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf will join me with more on the rise in crime and what can be done about it and the impact to our country and national security. Plus walking your way to better health, do you really need 10,000 steps a day? Or is it that number much lower? We investigate with Dr. Mike coming up. Mornings with Maria is live right now.Global markets this morning are mixed take a look at European indices which are lower across the board. There is concern growing that the European Union cannot unite on a plan. Hungary's Prime Minister says that the E.U. is unlikely to agree on a stimulus program at next week's summit.

One bright spot, the death toll is steadily declining. Infections are on the rise though in 40 states as Texas, Arizona and California report record hospitalizations.The Lone Star State hitting a new single day record with more 10,000 new coronavirus cases just yesterday. This as the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut add Delaware, Kansas and Oklahoma to its mandatory quarantine list.President Trump officially pulling the United States out of the World Health Organization, the administration sending a withdrawal notice to U.N. Secretary General and Key Congressional Leaders. President Trump has called the organization a puppet of China, slamming the organization for it's response to the coronavirus pandemic. The move goes into effect next July.President Trump is also pushing for schools to reopen nationwide, call for local officials to bring students and teachers back to class this fall.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We don't want people to make political statements or do it for political reasons. They think it's going to be good for them politically so they keep the schools closed, no way. So we're very much going to put pressure on governors and everybody else to open the schools to get them it open. It's very important for our country(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The White House is arguing that even with coronaviruses cases rising across much of the country, the death rates are lower and keeping children at home is harmful to students and their parents. Ultimately, it is up to local officials on whether in-person classes will begin this fall.Well, a new report says mail-in voting could lead to fraud and a waste of American taxpayer dollars. The conservative group, Honest Elections Project, says that voters are casting ballots for dead people and voting in multiple states of the same election.

Meanwhile, Ascena Retail Group and the owner of the Lane Bryant and Ann Taylor reportedly plans to file for bankruptcy protection and close at least 1,200 of its 2,800 stores this week. Ascena closed all of its stores in mid-March when the coronavirus first hit and had reopened only 450 of them by late May. The retail stock this morning as you can see down 14 percent. It is sitting at $1.11, sharply lower in the premarket.Well, the largest wealth transfer in human history, that is how FBI Director, Christopher Wray, characterizes China's cyber attack efforts.(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI DIRECTOR: We've now reached the point where the FBI is opening a new China-related counterintelligence case about every 10 hours. Of the nearly 5,000 active FBI counterintelligence cases currently underway across the country, almost half are all related to China.(END VIDEOCLIP)BARTIROMO: Additionally, National Security Advisor, Robert O'Brien, and National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, are calling on the U.S. Railroad Retirement Board to divest its money from Chinese entities over national security risks. Joining me right now is New York Congressman, Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Financial Services Committee, Lee Zeldin. Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.REP. LEE ZELDIN (R-NY), HOUSE FOREIGN AFFIARS CMTE MEMBER: Good to see you.BARTIROMO: First I want to talk about your Foreign Affairs Committee and the threat that is China. Assess the threat for us.ZELDIN: The threat is huge. This is something that started before the coronavirus pandemic hit our country. Obviously China has been much more in the news. We desperately relied on China for personal protective equipment. We rely on them for - and other countries around the world for ventilators, medicines. So part of that supply chain discussion is one that you find the average American engaging in now, but what we saw whether it's a social media like a company like Tik Tok, CFIUS launched an investigation last November after they tried to acquire Musically. We also seen it with the race for 5G and Huawei, the ability with that infrastructure to be able to collect personal communications of individuals, the theft that takes place of U.S. patents and intellectual property. So that list actually goes even much further, and this has been one that Congress has been engaged in for years, that our country has had a huge amount of tension with China on, but it's really just been over the course of the last several months that you're seeing much more of the average American start to engage because it very personally impacted their lives due to what happened at the outset of this pandemic.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, I just think it's extraordinary that this is a situation where theft is actually a strategy for the communist party. That is how they believe they will grow to become the number one superpower by stealing intellectual property whether it's military data, medicine data. They're trying to get a COVID-19 vaccine before us by stealing the information and then filing a patent based on the information they just stole. The question really is what do we do about it? Is this enough in terms of the president saying don't invest in companies that are building military equipment in China and move the supply chains? Is there anything else we can do to stop the theft? They've already - Chris Wray just told us most adult Americans have already had their information stolen.ZELDIN: Yes, so for one as it relates to, for example, the pension investment, that's not just an act as far as the United States and China and leverage over the country of China, but it's also about protecting those pensions themselves because if the United States takes action that can adversely impact those -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes.ZELDIN: -- Chinese companies, you don't want to see Americans harmed. I mentioned earlier the CFIUS investigation because, you know, we have a decision to make as it relates to Tik Tok. They are controlled. They are censored by the CCP. They are collecting information. One of the tactics that get used by China with regards to their cyber security -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes.ZELDIN: -- effort is looking at individual social media accounts to choose who has connections with the government, who to target.BARTIROMO: I see.ZELDIN: We can stop that activity -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes.ZELDIN: -- with Tik Tok. The list goes on.BARTIROMO: All right, I want to - I want to get to another subject, but isn't it an interesting strategy Xi Jinping has come up with? While the president is pushing these retirement funds, whether it's the Thrift Fund or the Railroad Retirement Fund, to stop investing in Chinese companies, Xi Jinping is rallying the country to buy stocks so that you see a huge rally in China and then investors can say, well wait a second. You're telling us not to buy the stocks, but look at the rally. He's very strategic Xi Jinping. Really interesting to see what he did this last week by telling the country buy stocks. We need a bull market. That's exactly what happened. Millions of Chinese opened accounts.All right, let me ask you about defunding the police amid the crime surge. Terrible numbers, Congressman. New York City seeing shootings up 130 percent in the month of June compared to 2019 after moving to cut more than a billion dollars from the NYPD budget. I spoke with the former mayor, Rudy Giuliani, in the last hour about the uptick in crime. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Now we're challenging Chicago as a killing field. It's a tragedy. The man is a disgrace, and the governor is way past the time you should have removed him. I mean, this is not - this is not even debatable any longer. People are dying because of his incompetence.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Congressman, I know you also took to Twitter last night to call out de Blasio. You wrote this. "Mayor de Blasio is destroying our great city from the inside out. New York City will not make it through the remainder of his term. He needs to be immediately removed from office to save the city and protect the people who live there." Look, it was the smallest electorate that ever came out to vote for Mayor de Blasio. What can be done to turn New York City around if the public keeps voting for him and people like him in terms of leadership positions?ZELDIN: And for one, I mean, New York City is not going to be able to make it through the rest of de Blasio's term. As you pointed out, he has to be removed. I agree with the mayor, and it's about public safety. We see it with policies from defunding the police to the cashless bail that was launched earlier this year. That was something in many respect Albany was directly involved in as well.What's ironic about Mayor de Blasio's pandering to the radically left is that when he stands in front of them, they're booing him, so what are you doing this for? Why don't you just stand with our law enforcement, stand with - you know, for rule of law, for safety and security because there are a lot of people who live in New York City, who love the city, who wanted to see it flourish and prosper. That's about improving our education, providing more opportunity. And on the economic front, you know, you have a point where New York City if you work there, you're paying essentially the second highest income tax rate in the entire country next to California. So on so many fronts Mayor de Blasio has the city going in the wrong direction.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, but the shootings are going on. Do you think that there is going to be a more moderate person that actually can win in New York?ZELDIN: Yes, absolutely. This is - it feels a lot like when David Dinkins was finishing his term and you were moving to Rudy Giuliani coming into office. Right now, I believe that New Yorkers are desperate not based on Republican Democrat. They're looking for a person to actually lead the city to be better and stronger on public safety and to address these concerns.BARTIROMO: Yes, yes. Congressman, it's very concerning. It's good to see you this morning and get your insights. Thank you, sir.ZELDIN: Always good to see you.BARTIROMO: And to you, Congressman Lee Zeldin. We have a Fox Business alert. Shares of Biogen this morning are soaring. The biotech giant filing for FDA approval for its Alzheimer's treatment. Right now, there are no drugs approved by the FDA that can reverse mental decline fro Alzheimer's. The stock this morning is up 8 percent. This is very good news. We will be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. New York City reopening, Mayor Bill de Blasio announcing childcare centers could open as early as next week. The city now in phase three of getting back to business. The pandemic hitting New York City real estate hard. The second quarter seeing a steep decline in commercial property sales, which could hit the city's tax collections.Joining me right now is Peebles Corporation Founder, Chairman and CEO, Don Peebles. Don it is always great to see you. Assess the situation for us in terms of real estate in New York. We just spoke with Mayor Rudy Giuliani who went through the crime situation and it's really a sad story. What can you tell us about real estate?DON PEEBLES, FOUNDER, PEEBLES CORPORATION: Well what happened, Maria, is prior to this pandemic New York was struggling in terms of our real estate industry. People were leaving the city, high income earners and fleeing to states like Florida which are more tax friendly, more business friendly and better quality of life.And so what had happened is New York City's quality of like had been diminishing over a number of years over the past six to - years or so. Also the quality of like has diminished and as a result people left. The pandemic has now accelerated that. And also companies have been looking at New York City and questioning why they continue to operate there because of the fact that the business environment is so anti-business.And so as a result you've seen businesses leave the area and again go to the Sunbelt states and other states around the country that are business friendly. And so what's happening now is you're seeing an acceleration of that.BARTIROMO: And I know - and you've got - you've got businesses all over the country, Florida, you're actually seeing those people come into Florida in some cases. Crime is surging in our largest cities. New York City saw a violent 4th of July weekend, 44 shootings, Don, 11 homicides. For the month of June the city experienced over 200 shootings compared to less than 90 one year earlier.I mean have you ever seen anything like this?PEEBLES: Not in a very long time, in fact, when I saw the weekend statistics I thought I was looking at one of the second quarter statistics. I couldn't believe that that was just one weekend of activity. Clearly what's happening again is people are being - are frustrated because they're being quarantined. Two, we've got economic crises; three, there is a real absence of leadership in terms of what are the essential services that the government ought to be providing New Yorkers.And I think that's one of the things that has contributed to this and of course there's been other reforms, if you will, that have lent themselves to an acceleration of criminal activity.BARTIROMO: Don, let me ask you this. We had Ben Carson on a couple of weeks ago and he said, look, we don't need all of this commercial real estate anymore in big cities. People are fleeing. They want to work from home. He said maybe we can use some of that real estate for low income housing. Do you think we're going to see a transition in New York where, you know, big buildings used to be for big business and maybe now they'll be low income housing?PEEBLES: Well look, I mean, there's one school of thought. If you look at Detroit in the 1950s it was a city of two million people and now it's a city of 600,000 people, but their industry was decimated as well. New York is the greatest city in the country and one of the greatest cities in the world. And as a result of that, it's very resilient. It's got a very powerful and innovative industry, the financial services industry. So I don't think you're going to see people abandoning offices. I think that there's going to be a change in how people work, and there's also going to be a change in terms of how people - companies identify talent. I mean, now people don't have t live close to where they work. And so, the whole country is a place where you can attract talent, and therefore you're going to see a much greater -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes.PEEBLES: -- increase in, you know, remote working.BARTIROMO: All right. Real quick before you go, Don. You're a Democrat. You are a business man. You are a moderate. Will you run for Mayor of New York?PEEBLES: I unlike the person that you heard - that you had on earlier, I'm not sure a moderate can win in New York City. I mean, look, I'm focused on navigating my business and leading my business through this great crisis that we're confronting, and we're active in eight different cities. And so, I'm going to focus my energy there right now, and we'll see where the politics goes later.BARTIROMO: Ah, this is a better answer than in the past. We're getting closer, Don Peebles. It's good to see you this morning, my friend. Please come back soon. Don Peebles -(CROSSTALK)PEEBLES: Thank you. Good to see you.BARTIROMO: -- joining us there. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Well the show must go on, AMC Theaters nearing a restructuring deal to avoid filing for bankruptcy according to "The Wall Street Journal". The deal would require bond holders to provide a senior loan of $200 million. The chain has postponed opening its theaters until July 30. Michael, your reaction.LEE: Yes, look, this is a really risky deal. Even if we get to the other side of the coronavirus and everything normalizes, movie theaters are in structural decline because the at-home viewing experience is - continues to improve. As well as content competition from the likes of Netflix and other streaming services. I think this is really risky.BARTIROMO: Dagen, what do you think?MCDOWELL: Well I think that major movie theater change is a part of group including AMC, Regal and Cinemark had to sue the governor of New Jersey about reopening. Said that churches and shopping malls can reopen but the state continues to bar cinemas from resuming operations. Again it's not a level playing field. And if you can go to church and wear a mask and keep your distance.I know it's not the same thing, freedom of religion, I understand that. You should certainly be able to go to a movie theater. And the sound quality's better and so are the snacks than anything you've got in your house.BARTIROMO: That's true. Steve, what do you think?FORBES: Yes, if you don't mind spending a lot of money and paying three times as much for popcorn as you should, it's a great experience. They were in secular decline, I think they will have a revival but AMC and others were done in by this coronavirus crisis hastened what was happening already. And I do think theaters will come back, they always do.Television nearly destroyed them after World War II, they came back. People like the experience of going out. And by the way, this whole deal, I'm glad "The Journal" says it's nearly complete because you still have fights among creditors about who gets what and who has to put in how much and things like that. Who have first lien, second lien, all that kind of stuff. So the sooner they can get it done the more they can create an experience where people, like me, dinosaurs that we are, will go and pay $20 for popcorn.BARTIROMO: Yes and maybe when we get out of this, we'll want to go out even more. So there's that. Let's take a break, when we come back we're going to talk with acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf. A lot to talk about with the secretary including increasing crime across our country and combating China. That's coming up next. Chad Wolf, live.Then wine woes, the new issues the industry is seeing as tariffs loom. We are taking a look when we come right back.MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, July 8th. We're taking a look at markets right here at 8:31 a.m. on the East Coast.Futures have been searching for direction, but we are looking at a pretty good reversal of fortune. We're looking at a higher opening for the broader averages after negative performances for much of the morning. The Dow futures right now are up 17 points, the Nasdaq futures up 30 points. That's been the real winner all morning. The S&P is up 3.75. Investors are still eyeing the coronavirus spikes across the country and rising tensions with China.Global markets this morning mostly lower. European indices are red across the board, although here too we are off of our lows of the morning. There is concern growing that the European Union cannot unite on a plan to fix the economy. Hungary's prime minister says that the EU is unlikely to agree on a stimulus program at next week's summit. The FT 100 down 22, the CAC quarante down 51, and the DAX index down 73.In Asia overnight, markets were mixed but the Chinese stock rally continues. The Shanghai composite extending a winning streak to now seven days with the Shanghai composite up 1.75 percent.Two people in California charged with a hate crime after allegedly painting over a Black Lives Matter mural.Cheryl Casone with the details.Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Maria.The two San Francisco area residents were charged yesterday after a video of them allegedly defacing the newly painted mural went viral. Nicole Anderson accused of using black paint and a roller to cover up the mural. This happened in Martinez, California, on the Fourth of July. David Nelson, the man with her, charged with getting into a heated confrontation with Black Lives Matter supporters. A local Black Lives Matter movement got a city permit to paint that mural just last week. Anderson and Nelson are facing a number of charges, including a hate crime violation.Well, the Covid-19 pandemic is forcing Carnival to delay the launch of its newest ship. The Mardi Gras will now set sail from Port Canaveral, Florida, on February 6th, four months later than originally planned. That ship is powered by cleaner burning liquefied natural gas and it's also going to feature -- and we've done the story on the show, the first roller coaster at sea, but folks are going to have to wait. In addition, Carnival says renovations on the Radiant (ph) is not going to be completed until the spring after working in dry-dock (ph) in Spain was suspended due to the coronavirus. The Breeze (ph) cruise ship redeployed to take over the Radiant's itineraries from November to April of next year and then Carnival's Magics (ph) transatlantic and European itineraries from March of next year through May all canceled. Well, there is Carnival in the pre- market. It's up more than half a percent right now. Thirty cruises have now offed (ph) their charts from November till next May.And finally, here's a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com.The NHL's Chicago Black Hawks say it will not change its name or logo despite a push to eliminate racially insensitive material. The team says the name celebrates the life of Black Hawk of Illinois' Sac & Fox Nation.Amazon not going to receive incentive payments this year for its second headquarters in northern Virginia because the payments are tied to the tourism industry, which has been hit by the coronavirus.And, finally, KFC has replaced its potato wedges with new secret recipe fries. And that, Maria, is nationwide.And those are your headlines from the newsroom. Back over to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you.We've been talking about the crime across the country this morning. Crime is on the rise. Cities across the country have seen dramatic spikes in violent crimes, like shootings and deaths. The Trump administration announcing it is ready to help cities tackle this growing epidemic. Joining me right now is acting secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf.Secretary, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.CHAD WOLF, ACTING SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: Well, thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: The numbers -- the numbers are dreadful when you look at the number of shootings, just the incredibly violent July 4th weekend New York City is one. Should states and cities be reaching out to the federal government for help in -- in terms of these spikes in crimes?WOLF: Absolutely. And the president's been very clear about that, that localities and states, if they need assistance, then they should certainly call on the federal government. And I think what we're seeing around -- around the country, whether it's Atlanta, Chicago or New York is really a direct effect on what we talk about when we talk about defunding the police or law enforcement, attacking law enforcement and politicizing what law enforcement does. And I think criminals are really taking notice of this. And -- and criminalize at their core are violent opportunists and they are seeing that opportunity to take advantage and to do their violent act across the country.And so I think it's having a direct effect. The -- the -- the comments about again defunding the police and really attacking law enforcement, this is the result of that, and we've got to be very, very careful about that.BARTIROMO: Well, unfortunately, it's not just comments. New York City did, in fact, Mayor de Blasio, take a billion dollars out of the NYPD.WOLF: Right.BARTIROMO: So what can the federal government do about this? Who is going to bring law and order back to this country?WOLF: You're absolutely right. Whether it's New York -- and we also saw Portland also vote to defund I believe 15 million from their police department as well, the president's been very clear, a the -- at the core of this, though, this is a -- both a local and state responsibility. When their ability -- they can no longer protect their cities, they need to call on the federal government, but they have to request that.What we've seen in Georgia, Governor Kemp has called out the National Guard to parts of Atlanta. He's taken that right step. We need other governors to follow. If they don't want to do it through the National Guard, we can provide some civil law enforcement capabilities to states and governors, but they have to ask for it. That's how the law works. President Trump's been very clear about that, if they ask, we will respond.BARTIROMO: You know, when you look at some of the Democratic run cities, Mayor Giuliani was just with us and he -- and he named a number of cities that are run by Democrat mayors. I don't know if it's the sanctuary city policies or what it is, but why is it that all these Democratic run cities are going off the rails right now? Are these policies killing our cities?WOLF: Absolutely. And I think the core of this is a lot of those mayors, a lot of those individual leaders that are running those big city metropolitan areas are playing politics, whether it's with sanctuary city policies or, again, attacking our law enforcement. They are doing that for politics and it's having a very, very detrimental effect that we're seeing. We're seeing a rise in the number of violent crimes in these cities and it's a direct effect of that.Criminals are taking notice. They understand what's going on. And, again, at the core are violent opportunists and they're taking this opportunity to, again, do what they do every day in a very criminal way.BARTIROMO: Well, if that's the case, and they're playing politics, the American people should be outraged and they should be voting these people out. That is the number one job that any official has, keep the citizens safe.Let me ask you about these new guidelines from the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, which force international students to leave the United States if their school only offers online classes this fall. Now we're learning that Harvard and MIT are suing the Department of Homeland Security and ICE over this action.Secretary Wolf, your reaction?WOLF: Sure. So what we did is we wanted to make sure, as we went into the fall session, that students and universities understood the rules of the road. What I think they don't understand is right now, under the regulation, international students can only take one online class. We have amended that. We -- we told them as much. We're going to move that up to three online classes. So we're giving them more flexibility.But at the -- at the core of this is, they want students to still come here to the U.S. and take classes 100 percent online. And the student visa, Maria, as you know, is you have -- your presence is required here in the U.S. That's why you get the visa. If you're taking 100 percent of your classes online, your presence isn't required here in the U.S. to do that. So schools need to think hard about that. And, again, our change is actually providing them more flexibility. Right now they can only take one class online. We're giving them the opportunity to take up to three classes online.BARTIROMO: Well, look, this brings me to the threat posed by the Chinese communist government, of course. And yesterday we heard another speech from the FBI director, Christopher Wray. This is among a string of speeches from U.S. officials. And he was talking about Chinese theft of intellectual property and information among the largest transfers of wealth in human history that comes a month after a Harvard professor was indicted over criminal ties to China.What -- what do you want to do in terms of this threat from China. Lay it out for us. I know that there's a massive espionage campaign going on. Is it largely the Chinese communist government sending -- sending researchers in to this country to work, get jobs at universities so that they can send info back? How are they doing this?WOLF: Absolutely, Maria, I think it's all of the above. And I agree with Director Wray's comments. When we look at China, we know that they have a number of bad behaviors and activities across the spectrum. And whether it's national security and economic security is really what they're after. And they play the long game.So we have other nation state threats, whether it's Russia and Iran, but China is really playing that long game and we've got to be very, very concerned about that. So whether we -- we talk about, at the department, foreign investment into the U.S., which China is actively doing and we have -- we take measures against that, or whether they're using our immigration system and our visa system, whether they're coming over as researchers, as students and then they're sending that information back. The president, as you know, last month, took action regarding Chinese students with ties to the PRC, making sure that they don't do that graduate level research and study and sending that back to use for their military purposes. The department has also taken action when we talk about Chinese media, making sure that they check in with the department and we know who they are, we know where they are, and we're able to vet them.So the department and the administration, we're taking concrete actions to -- to really tamp down on what we see as a lot of espionage going on by the Chinese government in a variety of different sectors.BARTIROMO: Well, by the way, it's no different than what they do to us. I went to China. I -- 15 years ago and I had to travel the country with a minder (ph). They called him a minder. This guy followed me around everywhere and he wanted to know exactly what we were covering and what we were doing. So they're much more diligent about doing this now. The U.S. is doing basically what China has been doing.Let me -- let me ask you about the threat in terms of -- yes, go ahead. What -- you want to say something, Secretary?WOLF: No, no, no, I -- you're -- you're -- you're absolutely right. And I think what we see China using is our open society, our democratic society, and them understanding our laws and what they can get away with and what they can't. And I think this administration, unlike previous administrations, who perhaps admired the problem, we're taking definitive action to tamp down on what Chinese -- China is doing again with students, with researchers, and stealing that intellectual property and we're calling them out on it and, again, taking that action.BARTIROMO: Let me switch gears and ask you about DACA, because the Trump administration expected to file a new executive order on DACA sometime this week. the Supreme Court recently blocking the president's move to end the DACA program.What are you expecting here, Secretary?WOLF: Yes, well, two things I would say about the DACA decision from the Supreme Court. One, none of the justices said that the program was lawful. And I think that's very, very concerning. We know that it is an unlawful program and the president's been very clear about finding a lasting solution for this population. But we will not continue to operate an unlawful program.And, two, the court said that the department had every right to rescind the program. They simply didn't like the rationale and how we did it.So we're taking a look at the opinion. We've done that. And we are drawing up paperwork should the president want to, again, end the DACA program, we'll be ready to do that.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there.Secretary, it's good to have you this morning. Thank you so much for joining us.WOLF: OK. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Secretary Chad Wolf there.Coming up, wine woes. Issues the industry is seeing as tariffs loom.Plus, step by step. We've heard that 10,000 steps a day is best for our health, right, but that number may be a myth. We will explain.You are watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Well, wine woes. The industry already taking a major hit due to a decline in restaurant purchases. And now tariffs could serve up even more setbacks.Kristina Partsinevelos joins us live from a winery on Long Island.Kristina.KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Maria, although it may feel like you're drinking a lot more wine at home due to the pandemic and lockdown, that boost in sales is still not enough to offset the dramatic decline in purchases from bars and restaurants.I'm at the Paumanok Vineyard, like you said, in Long Island. Right now you can see a worker just picking sauvignon blanc. But I spoke to the winery here, which is a multifamily estate, and he said there's been a dramatic drop in sales because he primarily sells to restaurants in Long Island and New York City.And that talks about the bigger trend. IWSR, a firm that tracks global alcohol sales, estimates alcohol consumption in 2020 will plunge by more than 10 percent. Meaning, the wine industry specifically could potentially lose $6 billion, almost $6 billion in 2020. And if we're talking about 2019, we've seen the first decline in wine sales in almost 25 years. And we could face some sticker shock as well because the White House has threatened to increase tariffs from 25 percent to 100 percent on European imported wine.We spoke to one U.S. wine importer about what that could mean for prices here in America. Listen in.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SHAWN BALZANO, NATIONAL SALES DIRECTOR, ZONIN USA: This is going to have to be paid and the -- the cost is going to go back to the consumer eventually, whether it's through higher prices or higher acquisition costs by restaurants or retail establishments. So, eventually, the consumer is going to feel the brunt.(END VIDEO CLIP)PARTSINEVELOS: And while importers are reeling from the added cost, this could be a benefit for domestic producers as maybe Americans are drinkers here of wine could shift to domestic producers like Paumanok Vineyards, where I am, which means made in America might be good for the wine industry, but we'll wait and see. You can see that wine, though, the vines are growing, Maria, and the wine keeps selling.Back to you.BARTIROMO: Looks beautiful there, Kristina, thank you.Kristina Partsinevelos this morning at a winery.Coming up, step it out. Why some experts are saying 10,000 steps a day is more than enough to stay healthy. We're going to take a look at what it takes.And then a programming note, North Carolina Congressional Candidate Madison Cawthorn will be our special guest on Friday. He'll be joining the panel. Don't miss it. He'll be here Friday morning.Back in a moment right here.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.A "Fox Business Alert" right now.Shares of Walgreens rising this morning. The company announcing plans to open 700 Village MD primary care practices with doctors in its stores. The plan includes taking a 30 percent stake in Village MD. Walgreens reports earnings on Thursday. We'll likely hear more about it then. But, right now, the stock is up better than 2 percent on the news.Well, an about face. If you have been scrambling to get those 10,000 steps in every day, relax. It turns out experts now say it only takes 4,400 steps, about two miles a day, to improve your health. But more steps are always better for your heart.And back with us right now to discuss this, and the benefits of daily fitness, family medicine physician Dr. Mikhail Varshavski, a.k.a. Dr. Mike.Dr. Mike, how many steps do you take a day?DR. MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, A.K.A. "DR. MIKE," FAMILY MEDICINE: I definitely take more than 10,000 steps a day. That's because I live in New York City and I love to exercise.You know, it really does vary state by state and even country to country. Americans are sadly lagging behind with the amount of steps we take per day. So I do encourage all of my patients to take more steps.Now that 10,000 number that we've been advocating for years is really an archaic number. Your health is not just about your steps. Your health means your mental state, your diet, your fitness regimen. And while I encourage my patients to take more steps, if they get to 7,500 steps, not 10,000, that's still enough, they're still doing something.BARTIROMO: Yes.VARSHAVSKI: My recommendation would be 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise a week. Maria, that's only two and a half hours. There's a lot of hours in a week. We can make it happen.BARTIROMO: Wow, two and a half hours a week? That's it? That -- that sounds easy.Dagen, I know you're a runner. I bike. I bike 28 miles on Sunday, 20 miles on Monday, and I biked 20 miles yesterday. So I just --VARSHAVSKI: Wow.BARTIROMO: I'm not doing steps, but I'm biking.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: That is awesome.I'm looking at my step --BARTIROMO: What about you, Dagen?MCDOWELL: I am looking at my step count of the last week and it was 12,000 steps, which is pretty good, but that includes the step with running. So, basically, I run and then sit on my duff the rest of the day.VARSHAVSKI: Well, look, that type of exercise is going to be really good for you, Dagen.BARTIROMO: But you're getting the running in there.MCDOWELL: Right.VARSHAVSKI: And, Maria, the fact that you're cycling is also amazing and it's something that I recommend to a lot of my patients because it's a form of low impact exercise, meaning it's more gentle on your joints so you're not going to be experiencing knee pain, ankle pain, as those who are doing high intensity, plyometric, high-impact exercises, like running.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, I love it and I definitely do several hours a week, that's for sure.Mike, jump in here. What do you do?MICHAEL LEE, MICHAEL LEE STRATEGY: Yes, Dr. Mike, a quick question, how many steps do you need if you're pumping iron every day like me?VARSHAVSKI: That's a good question. We -- before used to recommend cardio over strength training, but nowadays it's really the combination of the two that seems to give the best outcomes.From cardio you strengthen your cardiovascular system, your blood flow, you decrease your cholesterol levels. But then when you do strength training, you're actually burning calories while you're working out and then while you're recovering. It's a really good way to keep your muscle, keep your bones strong and you really need both types of exercise. It's not one or the other.BARTIROMO: Yes, because you lose bone mass as you age, right? Isn't that right, Dr. Mike?VARSHAVSKI: Exactly.BARTIROMO: Always great info from you. Thank you so much, sir.VARSHAVSKI: Thank you so much, Maria.BARTIROMO: We will see you soon.VARSHAVSKI: Stay healthy.BARTIROMO: We'll be right back with more MORNINGS WITH MARIA right after this.Load-Date: July 8, 2020End of Document

US/China.- China accuses US of 'threatening Chinese companies without evidence' over 'Tik Tok' investigationCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 30, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 347 wordsBodyMADRID, 30 (EUROPA PRESS)The Chinese government on Thursday accused the United States of "threatening Chinese companies without evidence" following Washington's announcement of the opening of an investigation into 'Tik Tok' on national security grounds."Without evidence, the United States threatens a Chinese company in the wake of a presumption of guilt, revealing its hypocrisy in the so-called 'respect for justice and freedoms'," criticized Wang Wenbin, spokesman for the Asian giant's Foreign Ministry.Thus, he noted that "this is a violation of the principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on openness, transparency and non-discrimination" and added that it "does not benefit the interests of the American people and companies"."We ask some in the United States to listen to the voices of the international community, to create an open market environment, just and non-discriminatory for entities in all countries, including China, and to stop politicizing trade and trade issues," he said.In this regard, he stressed that "this affects the image and credibility of the United States" and recalled that "governments and the media in some countries have emphasized that there should be no double standards in social media.""China's software and app-in-app meet the needs of the population and market demand, give diversified options, and help social media markets and all countries grow solidly," said Wang, who has influenced that "the Chinese government always asks Chinese companies to comply with laws and regulations when doing business with foreign countries."The investigation against 'Tik Tok', owned by China's ByteDance, is being conducted by the U.S. Foreign Investment Committee, which will make recommendations to the president, Donald Trump, on whether the 'app' poses a risk to national security and should therefore be banned.For his part, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has stressed that Washington is "analyzing" the possibility of banning implementation, recently banned by India following a border confrontation between the armies of both countries.Load-Date: July 31, 2020End of Document

Britain's Huawei Ban Resets Relations With ChinaASEAN TribuneJuly 14, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 ASEAN Tribune All Rights ReservedLength: 1495 wordsBody 14 July 2020 (Voice of America) British officials are bracing for fierce Chinese government reaction and possible retaliation to Britain's decision Tuesday to block Chinese tech giant Huawei from playing any role in the development of Britain's next generation 5G phone network.Britain's culture minister, Oliver Dowden, told the House of Commons of the decision to banish Huawei from the network, saying any of the company's components already installed will have to be removed from the network by 2027. The major policy U-turn is prompting fears in Downing Street that Britain may become the target of a possible China-sponsored cyberattack similar to one that struck Australia last month amid heightened tensions between Canberra and Beijing.Chinese officials, including Beijing's ambassador to London, have maintained a chorus of warnings in recent months, threatening serious consequences if Huawei, one of China's flagship companies, is excluded from participation in developing Britain's 5G network.A Trump victoryTuesday's announcement is seen by analysts and diplomats as a big win for the Trump administration which, along with other Western allies, has been lobbying Britain for more than a year to block Huawei from Britain's 5G wireless network on security grounds. In January, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson decided to allow Huawei a role in the development of the fast-speed network, limiting the company's participation to just 35%. But U.S. officials - as well their Australian counterparts - continued to lobby London to block Huawei altogether. U.S. officials say there is a significant risk that the company, which has close ties to the Chinese intelligence services and was founded by a former Chinese army officer, will act as a Trojan horse for Beijing's espionage agencies, allowing them to sweep up data.Dowden told British lawmakers: 'We have not taken this decision lightly and I must be frank about the decision's consequences for every constituency in this country; this will delay our roll-out of 5G.' The British government acknowledges the move will delay the rollout of 5G in the by two to three years and increase costs by at least $2.5 billion. Acting on the guidance of Britain's National Cyber Security Center, Johnson accepted that U.S. sanctions imposed on Huawei in May had become a 'game changer.' Previously the center, a department within Britain's intelligence agency GCHQ, said the security risks posed by Huawei could be safely managed and mitigated, a view not shared by U.S. intelligence agencies. But the imposition earlier this year of new U.S. restrictions on Huawei altered the picture, the center warned. Britain's cybersecurity chiefs concluded the U.S. sanctions, which block Huawei from using components and semi-conductors based on any American intellectual property, will mean the telecom giant will have to use 'untrusted' parts, increasing security risks. Responding to the government's announcement, Huawei UK spokesperson Ed Brewster said: 'This disappointing decision is bad news for anyone in the UK with a mobile phone. It threatens to move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital divide.' He added: 'Regrettably our future in the UK has become politicized, this is about U.S. trade policy and not security.'That view was not shared by former British Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who has been at the forefront of a campaign to block Huawei. He says that it is impossible to separate Chinese firms like Huawei from the Chinese government. 'Across the free world, more and more countries are now recognizing that they face a particular threat now from Chinese government intentions,' he said. Big blow for HuaweiBritain's decision is a big blow for Huawei. Europe accounts for 24% of the company's sales and the British decision could have knock-on effects elsewhere on the continent, where other governments are currently assessing how much access to give Huawei. British officials say the decision is bound to worsen already sharply deteriorating relations between the two countries. Chinese officials, including Beijing's ambassador to Britain, Liu Xiaoming, have underscored for weeks that there will be repercussions in the event Huawei is excluded.Tensions have been escalating between London and Beijing quickly over a Chinese security clampdown on Hong Kong, a former British colony transferred to China in 1997. To Beijing's anger, Britain announced Hong Kong residents would be allowed to move to Britain to escape the crackdown. The two governments have clashed also over Britain's backing of an independent probe into the origins of the coronavirus.According to press reports, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison briefed Johnson recently on a massive cyberattack Morrison says was launched on his country last month. The incident, say Australian officials, targeted 'government, industry, political organizations, education, health, essential service providers and operators of other critical infrastructure.'Australia and China's communist government have been at loggerheads since Australia became the first nation to call for an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus.Critics have long alleged Huawei has close links to the Chinese Communist government and its equipment could be used for espionage purposes. The company denies the claim, describing Huawei as a private company 'fully owned by its employees.'An 'intimate part of the Chinese state'Former British intelligence chief Richard Dearlove disputes that description. On Sunday, he said Huawei 'is not an ordinary international telecommunications company. It is an intimate part of the Chinese state.' Dearlove added that a ban on Huawei would amount to 'a reset of the whole of our relationship with the Chinese leadership.' He has long lobbied for Huawei's exclusion, along with dozens of lawmakers from Johnson's own ruling Conservative party.Last week, Ambassador Liu warned Johnson of the consequences of excluding Huawei, saying at a virtual press conference, 'You cannot have a golden era if you treat China as an enemy.' A ban on Huawei, he said, would have many repercussions, including inflicting damage on Britain's reputation as 'a business-friendly, open, transparent environment.' Among other possible consequences, he said, China could disinvest from Britain's energy sector.FalloutTwo studies, by British research groups and set for publication this week, warn that a major disruption in Britain's trade relations with China sparked by a ban on Huawei would depress the British economy.Cambridge Econometrics says hundreds of thousands of British jobs depend on trade with China and that the relationship directly supports more than 100,000 jobs in sectors such as education and tourism. The study was commissioned by the China-Britain Business Council, a trade promotion association.Clive Hamilton, an Australian academic and co-author of 'Hidden Hand,' a groundbreaking new book examining Chinese influence operations and networks in the West, says he expects 'Beijing will react angrily' to Huawei's exclusion.Hamilton's book, co-authored with Marieke Ohlberg, a China scholar from Germany, has figured prominently in a fierce political debate raging in Britain about the future of Anglo-Chinese relations. The book has been cited by lawmakers who have been urging for Huawei to be banned from Britain's 5G network.In the book, Hamilton and his co-author accuse the CCP of intensive grooming of British politicians, business people and academics and warn that 'so entrenched are the CCP's influence networks among British elites that Britain has passed the point of no return, and any attempt to extricate itself from Beijing's orbit would probably fail.'Asked by VOA whether Tuesday's decision to exclude Huawei would suggest that such a judgment is premature, Hamilton responded in an email exchange that he 'expects the CCP's powerful friends among Britain's elites to re-emerge and lobby hard to give priority to economic relations and give way to Beijing on other issues.' Losing friends Hamilton added, though, that the coronavirus pandemic, and increasing 'public awareness of the nature of the CCP regime,' is hardening attitudes towards the Chinese government. 'The pandemic, its origins in Wuhan and the early Chinese government handling of it have changed the international dynamic in ways that are still playing out.' He says the Chinese communist government has taken 'a big reputational hit in many countries around the world. In Britain, the damage has been compounded by the events in Hong Kong, which looms large in Britain's political consciousness for historical reasons.''Elsewhere in Europe, the picture is mixed. China retains warm ties with several nations in East and Central Europe and with Italy and Greece. But it is losing friends in nations like France and Sweden. Germany is the key, and it is wavering,' he added.Load-Date: July 15, 2020End of Document

Founder and CEO Eric Yuan asking questions regarding the company's data privacy practices and potential coordination with the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party.This letter was sent in response to recent news that Zoom, a U.S. company, closed the account of a group of U.S.-based Chinese activists after an event commemorating the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre, a pro-democracy movement."Zoom's recent actions and acquiescence to China raise serious concerns about your data practices, including how you protect information you collect on Americans and, importantly, who you grant access to such information," the Committee leaders wrote.Click HERE to read the letter: https://republicans-energycommerce.house.gov/news/letter/letter-to-zoom-ceo-on-data-privacy-practices-ties-with-chinese-communist-party/* * *June 11, 2020To: Eric Yuan, Founder and CEO, Zoom Video Communications, Inc., 55 Almaden Boulevard, 6th Floor, San Jose, CA 95113Mr. Yuan:We write regarding Zoom's recent decision to close the account of a group of prominent U.S.-based Chinese activists after they held an event commemorating the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre.1 Zoom acknowledged that it closed the account and defended this action by stating such decision was made to "comply with local law." 2 This suggests Zoom, a U.S. company, closed the account at the direction of the Chinese government, which forbids free discussion of the 1989 Tiananmen pro-democracy movement. Such coordination with, or even acquiescence to the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party alarms us , especially since Zoom admitted that some data on non-China users had been routed through China earlier this year and researchers found your encryption used keys issued via servers in China.3Zoom's recent actions and acquiescence to China raise serious concerns about your data practices, including how you protect information you collect on Americans and, importantly, who you grant access to such information. Accordingly, please provide written answers and any related documentation to the following questions no later than June 26, 2020: Questions Related to Zoom's Data Practices:1. As a U.S.-based company, please cite the "local law" you claim to have complied with to justify suppressing the free speech of U.S.-based Chinese activists and identify the date on which you reinstated the accounts of such activists.2. Please explain how Zoom collects information on Americans and what specific categories of information is collected.3. Please explain why Zoom collects the specific categories of information it collects on Americans and for what purposes such information is collected.4. Please identify the categories of third parties Zoom shares information it collects on Americans and explain for what purpose such information is shared to those third parties.5. For any information Zoom collects on Americans, please answer the following: a. Does Zoom share such information with the Chinese Communist Party? If yes, please explain what information is shared, why such information is shared, and under what circumstances such information is shared.b. Does the Chinese Communist Party have access, either directly or indirectly, to such information? If yes, please explain.c. Does Zoom share such information with any Chinese state-owned entity? If yes, please identify the categories of such entities.d. Do any Chinese state-owned entities have access, either directly or indirectly, to such information?e. Does Zoom maintain and store such information in China?6. Does Zoom have a data sharing agreement with the Chinese Communist Party or any Chinese state-owned entity? If yes, please explain what the agreement covers and why.7. Please identify each country Zoom sends, maintains, or stores information collected on Americans. For each country, please identify whether the government or an entity on behalf of such government has access to such information.8. Please identify all examples of Zoom taking directions from or acquiescing to requests of the Chinese government, including whether Zoom has closed other user accounts or suppressed political content.9. In light of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, please answer the following: a. Due to the increase in users in recent months, has Zoom implemented any additional safeguards to protect information it collects on American users? If yes, please explain.b. Due to the increase in users in recent months, has Zoom changed how it processes information collected on American users, including any changes to where such Letter to Mr. YuanPage 3information is transferred and stored? If yes, please explain what changes have been made and why.c. Does Zoom collect any health information about American users? If yes, please explain why and for what purposes.d. Has Zoom received any requests to alter, delete, or block content that runs counter to the official line of the Chinese government in response to its handling of the COVID-19 crisis?10.

US, Britain Increasingly See Eye-to-Eye on ChinaASEAN TribuneJuly 21, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 ASEAN Tribune All Rights ReservedLength: 1128 wordsBody 21 July 2020 (Voice of America) U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson Tuesday as tensions escalated between the United States and China over trade, the status of the South China Sea, the origins of the novel coronavirus and the Chinese response to the virus when it first emerged in the city of Wuhan. The London visit by America's top diplomat came just days after Johnson decided, on security grounds, to prohibit Chinese tech giant Huawei from participating in the development of Britain's fast-speed 5G phone network - a ban Washington had been urging for more than year.After finishing his initial talks, Pompeo tweeted, 'Constructive visit with @BorisJohnson today. Our two countries' long-standing, strong bilateral relationship has laid the foundation for today's candid discussion on issues ranging from 5G telecommunication to our negotiations for a U.S.-UK free trade agreement.'In a press conference later Pompeo praised Britain for its tough line on Huawei and Hong Kong. 'I wanted to take this opportunity to congratulate the British government for its principled responses to these challenges. You made a sovereign decision to ban Huawei computer 5g networks.'He added: 'We want every nation to work together to push back against the Chinese Communist Party's efforts in every dimension that I described to you today that certainly includes the United Kingdom includes every country, we hope we can build out a coalition that understands this.'The two Western allies appear to be increasingly seeing eye-to-eye about the challenges posed by the Chinese government, say analysts and Western diplomats. On his arrival in the British capital, Pompeo tweeted that he was looking forward to meeting with Johnson 'as we tackle our most pressing global issues in combating COVID-19 and addressing our shared security challenges.' COVID-19 is the disease caused by the coronavirus.Pompeo and Johnson observed social distancing guidelines while in the Downing Street garden. 'Hope you appreciate the social distancing,' Johnson told journalists gathered there. 'Social distance does not imply diplomatic or political distance,' the British leader added. Analysts say Pompeo wants to capitalize on Britain's hardening line toward Beijing. The Huawei ban was a major policy U-turn for Britain which has been trying to walk a tight rope between Washington, its long-stranding traditional ally, and Beijing, which it has been courting heavily since the 2016 Brexit vote in the hope of securing a lucrative trade deal.The outright confrontation between Washington and Beijing in the wake of the coronavirus has made a balancing act even harder to pull off, say former British diplomats. Beijing's increasingly aggressive moves in the South China Sea, where it is alarming its neighbors with expansive territorial claims, is also prompting a cross-party political backlash in Britain. This week Britain announced it was suspending an extradition agreement with Hong Kong because of a draconian Beijing-imposed security law on the former British colony. The British and Chinese governments have been trading increasingly acrimonious barbs since the Chinese government launched a crackdown earlier this year on Hong Kong - a move the British say breaches a deal the two countries struck in 1997 for the handover of the territory to China.Britain has also imposed an arms embargo on Hong Kong, banning the export of equipment that could be used for 'internal repression.' Britain's foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who also met with Pompeo, told the House of Commons Monday that the measures were a 'necessary and proportionate response' to the new security law, which Britain says is being used to outlaw dissent. 'The UK is watching and the whole world is watching,' Raab told lawmakers.China responded to Monday's announcement by warning that Britain would 'bear the consequences' of its actions. 'Now the UK side has gone even further down the wrong road in disregard of China's solemn position and repeated representations,' a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in London said. He added,' China urges the UK side to immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs, which are China's internal affairs, in any form.'Australia and Canada suspended extradition treaties with Hong Kong earlier this month, and the United States ended preferential economic treatment for the territory, while also imposing sanctions on Chinese officials. China has taken retaliatory steps.British officials have started to echo more volubly long-standing American grievances about Beijing's treatment of China's Muslim Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim minority in northwest China. Since 2015, more than a million Uighurs have been detained in what Chinese officials describe as 'vocational education centers' for job training, but critics and rights campaigners describe as internment or concentration camps, part of an effort to forcibly assimilate the Uighurs. The ban on Huawei has angered Beijing and retaliation is almost a certainty. Chinese officials say the ban has wrecked any chances of Beijing agreeing to a wide-ranging free trade deal with Britain, something London has been hoping would come in compensating for the likely commercial losses the country will suffer from Brexit. British companies such as AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Burberry and Jaguar Land Rover, which have large investments in China, are bracing for retaliation. With a Chinese trade deal likely off the table, a favorable post-Brexit agreement with the U.S. is of even greater urgency for Britain, say analysts. A senior Chinese official accused Britain of pandering to Washington shortly after Pompeo landed in London. 'We do not want to see the tit-for-tat between China and the U.S. happen in China-U.K. relations,' the Chinese ambassador to Britain, Liu Xiaoming, tweeted.U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday hailed Johnson's Huawei ban as Pompeo set off for Britain.Pompeo is scheduled also to meet in London with Hong Kong democracy activist Nathan Law, who fled China recently, and Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong. Patten is a former Conservative minister who has become increasingly critical of China and advocates confrontation with Beijing.In a recent press interview, he said Britain and other Western countries had been naive in thinking they could tame China's Communist leaders by 'cozying up' to them. He said successive Western governments had fallen for a myth about China 'that somehow at the end of all the kowtowing there's this great pot of gold waiting for us… We keep on kidding ourselves that unless we do everything that China wants we will somehow miss out on great trading opportunities. It's drivel,' he added.Load-Date: July 22, 2020End of Document

Internet Governance Project: The Hypocrisy of a U.S. TikTok BanTargeted News ServiceJuly 29, 2020 Wednesday 8:51 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3079 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: ATLANTA, Georgia BodyThe Internet Governance Project issued the following article:Just over a year after the U.S. government placed restrictions on China's Huawei, the ongoing economic rivalry between the two countries has found a new target. For weeks the Trump administration has hinted that it is considering banning TikTok, the short video app over national security concerns. With over 2 billion downloads globally on the App Store and Google Play, TikTok has emerged as a serious competitor to U.S. based social media apps particularly in emerging markets like in Indonesia, India, Egypt, Nigeria and Brazil. TikTok is especially popular amongst young users, about 60 percent of its active users in the U.S. are between the ages of 16 and 24. In the first quarter of 2020, the app was downloaded 315 million times globally.TikTok's success has caught the eye of regulators and policymakers around the world. Australia, Turkey, and the United Kingdom are allegedly reviewing the app for security risks. In June 2020, the Indian government banned TikTok along with 58 other Chinese apps accusing them of engaging in activities that were "prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India". The move has led to TikTok being shut out of its biggest and fastest growing market.If you scroll through TikTok, it is hard to understand why an app filled with videos of people lip-syncing and remixing dance or music has come to be viewed as a national security risk in the U.S. and abroad. Those promoting the idea that TikTok is a threat, enumerate three distinct but interrelated factors:* TikTok's content moderation practices* TikTok's handling of user data* TikTok's Chinese provenanceAfter examining the first two, it's pretty clear that the only one that really matters is its status as a Chinese company.China's Influence over TikTok's ContentCritics of TikTok have argued that China could leverage TikTok's influence and reach to extend its censorship regime, and sway public opinion or influence policy in foreign countries. Claims that TikTok is a tool for the Chinese censorship gained traction after leaked guidelines revealed that the company had instructed its staff to censor topics deemed sensitive in China such as Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence and the religious group Falun Gong. TikTok has confirmed the authenticity of the guidelines but said that they are no longer in use. More recently, the app has been accused of shadow banning or restricting videos on topics deemed sensitive in China and blocking pro-Hong Kong content, although an investigation by Buzzfeed has refuted these allegations. The concerns around content moderation on TikTok is not limited to fears of politically motivated censorship, but has expanded into claims that the app could be used as a vehicle for Chinese propaganda and other influence operations.Fears of censorship on TikTok are largely driven by the fact that the app is owned by ByteDance Technology Co. which operates out of China and is therefore bound to the Chinese censorship regime. While ByteDance is a Chinese company, TikTok was created for the global markets and is not available in China. ByteDance has created a separate app for the Chinese market--Douyin. Having two separate entities has allowed ByteDance to navigate the censored and restricted Chinese market while competing with social media companies like Facebook and YouTube in markets outside of China. Distinguishing between the two companies is important as the markets they operate in shapes the policies and practices within each company. In adherence with the regulations that China imposes on all web users and platforms Douyin censors content and deploys facial recognition technology to monitor its users. By operating outside of China, TikTok is not bound by the same stringent rules. While ByteDance collaborates with the Chinese government to disseminate state propaganda about Xinjiang, and Douyin wipes away evidence of China's actions in Xinjiang, TikTok ended up apologising for suspending a video talking about China's action in Xinjiang.As a global company operating outside of China, TikTok has no commercial or political incentives in promoting pro-China content on its platform. Even assuming that TikTok is taking a pro-Chinese line should it be labelled a national security threat? As a social media company operating in the U.S., Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act grants TikTok discretion over moderating content on its platform. TikTok does not have a monopoly on information resources in the U.S. and if users do not approve of the content on the app, they have the freedom to delete it. TikTok maintains that Bytedance or the Chinese government have no influence over its content moderation decisions. The claim is backed up by its transparency report which confirms that the company has not received or complied with any requests for content removal by the Chinese government.Social media companies being enlisted in the service of state censorship and propaganda is a legitimate concern, but this threat is not limited to TikTok. Recently, Facebook agreed to significantly increase the censorship of "anti-state" posts for local users in Vietnam after its local servers were taken offline for a few weeks. All big U.S. based social media companies including Facebook, Google, YouTube, and Amazon have been accused of heavy-handed censorship, political bias or inadequacy in their content moderation practices. Since May, U.S. social media platforms have been engaged in a stand-off with President Trump over bias in their content moderation policies.Accountability to prevent preferential treatment of content and double standards in applying rules or procedures is much needed. But the answer to countering censorship and propaganda on platforms is not to ban them but to push for transparency in how companies moderate content. TikTok has recently overhauled its community guidelines bringing them in line with policies of other major platforms and has published information on how its recommendation algorithm works. The company is setting up a Transparency Center to provide outside experts an inside view of its content moderation practices. These are steps in the right direction towards developing an understanding of how platforms can uphold consistent policies in the face of competing societal expectations, different experiences, cultures, or value systems.TikTok and User DataThe revelations that Cambridge Analytica purchased the personal profiles of 50 million or more of Facebook's U.S. users who were then targeted by President Trump's election campaign has led to a number of large social media platforms being scrutinized for their privacy and data protection practices. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has imposed a record-breaking $5 billion penalty and sweeping new privacy restrictions on Facebook. The settlement with Facebook is the largest ever imposed on any company for violating consumers' privacy and almost 20 times greater than the largest privacy or data security penalty ever imposed worldwide.Like other big platforms, TikTok has attracted the attention of regulators for its data privacy and security practices. Last month, TikTok made headlines when it was caught abusing a problem in iOS 14 beta version which allowed apps to secretly access the clipboard on users' devices on the clipboard on users devices. In February 2020, TikTok was fined by the FTC over allegations that an earlier version of its app violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by failing to provide the proper safeguards to protect the privacy of its young audience. Google ended up paying $170 million, a much higher amount than TikTok's $5.7 million fine, to the FTC for violating the exact same child privacy law. Although TikTok has grabbed eyeballs for privacy violations, but it is hardly different from the likes of Facebook and Google who continue to create privacy disasters. Just this week, Google has been called out by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for misleading millions of Australians to obtain their consent and expand the scope of personal information that it collects about users' internet activity.TikTok has been accused of being a "data collection service that is thinly-veiled as a social network" by an anonymous Redditor who claims to have reverse engineered the app's software to gain an insight into the massive amounts of data it is collecting on its users. A lawsuit filed in California last December 2019 alleges that: "TikTok profits from its secret harvesting of private and personally-identifiable user data by using such data to derive vast targeted-advertising revenues and profits." Consideration of the security risks posed by the app's access to sensitive data like geolocation and internet history has resulted in targeted bans. Various military branches prohibit the use of the app by personnel. A few corporates and political parties have also attempted to restrict the use of the app by their staff for security reasons. More recently, legislative proposals seeking to ban TikTok from work devices of all federal employees have gained traction.TikTok's emergence as the target of concerns over data privacy are driven by the fact that it collects information like the internet or other network activity information such as users IP address, unique device identifiers, GPS data, browsing or search history, and cookies. The personal information collected by TikTok is the kind of data collected by most apps. A great deal of what TikTok does with that data is common across other social media platforms--garnering an understanding of its users, their phones, their likes and dislikes, affiliations, interests and behaviors. If TikTok is suspicious because of data collection practices, aren't all other platforms? The core business model of all social media companies, whether U.S. based or not, is monetizing the data they collect from users--not only for themselves but also for selling to others. It seems obvious that when targeted advertising is a huge source of revenue, social media companies are commercially oriented and collect information about their users and sell it to advertisers.The challenge for TikTok is not just that it captures significant amounts of user data, rather what matters to policymakers is who has access to the app and the information it gathers. TikTok's terms of service state that even if data collected overseas is stored on servers in the U.S. and Singapore, it may be shared with its parent company ByteDance and its affiliates. The ambiguity around the clause has led National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien to accuse the app of sending "intimate data" back to China for processing. These allegations of data transfers to China remain unproven and TikTok insists that user data is stored in the U.S. and Singapore, with strict controls on access to source code and sensitive data. Clearly, though, it's an allegation that is not going away. Recently, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned people should use TikTok only "if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party".The threat that TikTok could pass information to state agencies persists as China's cyber governance regime lacks clarity of law, oversight mechanisms, and clear pathways for contestation. Several laws rope in Chinese companies into collaborating with intelligence services and law enforcement.It is unclear what kind of strategic value an app filled with lip-syncing and dancing videos has for intelligence or law enforcement agencies. The fiercest critics of TikTok have not been able to prove whether data from the app could be or has been used to profile potential targets or undertake mass surveillance. The fears of TikTok being used for snooping by Chinese intelligence agencies reflects a manipulative framing of the issue. Every government in the world can request data from information service providers in its jurisdiction.While U.S. citizens have more legal protections than Chinese citizens and companies, once national security is invoked many of those protections disappear. As revelations by Edward Snowden highlight, the use of platforms for surveillance is not the prerogative of China and TikTok. NSA's Prism program, a vast surveillance operation involving direct access to the systems of Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and other U.S. internet giants, gleaned private information of millions of platform users. More recently, the U.S. Justice Department has made its support for ending end to end encryption within platforms. Critics of TikTok also need to consider the broader implications of their argument. If a Chinese company running a social media app that handles U.S. citizens data is deemed inherently risky for national security, then isn't the same true of Apple, Microsoft and Google?In any case, a country with the kind of advanced cyber capabilities that China has does not need TikTok to gather data about U.S. citizens. It can, and has found other ways of gaining access to companies holding American data. China was behind the single biggest compromise of healthcare data in history that compromised the health records of nearly 79 million people including their names, Social Security numbers, medical identification numbers, addresses, dates of birth, email addresses, and employment information. In 2015, China's hacked the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) gaining access to classified information on more than 21 million people. OPM was the largest of a series of hacks against U.S. based companies and services that had data on government employees providing the Chinese with a wealth of personal information for counter-intelligence purposes. More recently, in 2017 the Chinese military hacked Equifax to steal the Social Security numbers and other personal information of nearly 150 million Americans.While limiting the risk of unauthorized data access and protecting privacy of citizens is a legitimate and commendable policy goal, historically, the U.S. government has done little to improve the accountability of companies that collect and use sensitive information. For example, following the OPM hack government employees tried to sue the agency for violating their privacy, however their case was dismissed on the grounds the Privacy Act only prohibited the agency from giving up users' data willingly. Currently, there is no overarching federal privacy law that governs private-sector companies that collect and resell personal information. There is also no federal statute that gives consumers the right to learn what information is held about them for marketing purposes and who holds it. In the face of these broader privacy gaps, regulators and policymakers in the U.S. should drive the development of standards on what data can be collected and retained by all companies, regardless of their origin. Setting minimum standards on data collection and access will help protect U.S. personal data, regardless of whether the threat a state-sponsored hacker, data brokers selling data, or a private company transferring the data to China.TikTok's National OriginThe assault on TikTok is really a repetition of the problems of any social media platform; TikTok is not distinctively worse than the dominant players, and its prospective audience is a lot smaller. The real problem with TikTok is that it is Chinese. By identifying TikTok as Chinese, its critics play on three leaps of logic:* Any Chinese firm is allegedly an agent of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The assumption here is that Chinese firms are not trying to make money, they are doing politics.* After equating the entire Chinese economy and all its firms with the CCP, the next leap of logic is to assert that U.S. and China cannot co-exist and are locked in a global struggle for supremacy. If Chinese firms have data about you, then the Chinese state will use that to harm and control us. When you download TikTok, you are downloading Communism.* After positing an irreconcilable conflict between the U.S. and China, the next leap is to assume that U.S. will defeat this menace not through competition but by walling itself off from the Chinese economy. The advocates of this view imply, seemingly without even knowing it, that the U.S. should imitate the China, becoming more like them. The U.S. should ban Chinese services and information sources, expel their telecom firms and block any international cables that touch China. The U.S. should nationalize the 5G network, erect export controls to wall off chips and software, and develop industrial policy initiatives in high-tech areas. Washington's push to ban Tiktok is part of a full-fledged imitation of Chinese economic nationalism and censorship.At its root, the debate on banning TikTok boils down to whether or not it is acceptable to shut down applications and services based on their country of origin. Policymakers weighing in on the issue should be mindful that ban on TikTok sets a dangerous precedent in which governments can shut out entrepreneurs and capital using blanket national security claims as justifications. When it comes to social media platforms, there are legitimate questions related to data security and content moderation that need to be addressed, but militarizing these problems is not the answer. The response to TikTok will have ramifications for whether countries accept the U.S. vision for data and content governance going forward. Whether the U.S. goes ahead with banning TikTok will also serve as a reference and a roadmap for other governments that are concerned about U.S. companies and the U.S. government getting access to their data.The focus on TikTok suggests that geopolitical competition between nations over the global technology landscape has spilled over to the application layer. If there is any competition between the American way and the Chinese way, Americans will not win it by imitating the Chinese. Protectionism and censorship are for second-rate economies and third-rate military powers. Now more than ever, U.S. needs to retain its identity as a free and open economy, and leverage the competitive advantages that brings. It cannot do that by building an American Great Firewall. Openness, competition and freedom are sources of strength, not weakness.[Category: Computer Technology]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7192019 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 29, 2020End of Document

Is TikTok fun? The world sees it as a very serious matter and rightly soCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 10, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 767 wordsBodyTikTok is fun and has well earned the number of users it has achieved (as of May this year, about 800 million). It is an app that found an important strand from Musica.ly, an application that bought Bytedance, its parent firm, and that enhanced after finding that it was extremely popular with young people.Some say that an app ceases to be cool at the time when the average age of its users far exceeds that of its early adopters, something that all over the world happened with TikTok last year, more or less at this point: we saw more and more large people getting on the platform. A cycle that was already observed, by case, on Facebook.Facebook won't like this.However, in recent weeks there were some other signs that TikTok is not so cool, starting with the origin by Bytedance, the Chinese firm to which it belongs. Because, as strange as it sounds to you, the concept of privacy of usage data does not exist in China, and developers who run their applications from servers in that country cannot guarantee that the government will not access its databases without restriction.OK, you don't care so much about privacy. I don't want to contradict you, but this time you have a clear example to understand why being careless with the data we provide, and who we give it to, is not a good idea. It's, rather, serious.Let's go in partsLet's start with India, a country with which China shares more than 4,000 kilometers of border. The Government directly banned TikTok (among 58 other applications) from China as "harmful" to the country and its population.The reasons given by the Indian Government point to TikTok and other applications, such as those of Xiaomi or the Mimso Wechat, "are related to activities detrimental to India's sovereignty and integrity, its defense, state security and public order".The decision – which leaves TikTok without a tremendous market, but also millions of users without official access to the app – was made after the publication of "several news" in which bad practices of Chinese applications for iOS and Android were reported, such as the transmission of user data to foreign servers.What TikTok saysOf course, TikTok's boss in India denies everything. "TikTok continues to comply with all data privacy and security requirements under Indian law and has not shared any information from our users in India with any foreign government, including the Chinese government," he said, in addition to arguing that they have favored democracy in India.The accusation is not new either. In October 2019, TikTok responded to these demands from U.S. lawmakers and said, "We are not influenced by any foreign government, including the Chinese government; TikTok does not operate in China, nor do we intend to do so in the future."That's true, but it's not so true. In China, there is an alternative version of the TikTok app called "Douyin", which is made by the same company, Bytedance.The case of Hong KongAs if nothing else, TikTok announced earlier this week that it will withdraw from Hong Kong (which officially has the status of special administrative region of the People's Republic of China), after the Chinese government enacted its new national security law, which will pursue all activities considered as "secession," "subversion," "terrorism" or "collusion with foreign powers.""In light of recent events, we have decided to halt TikTok application operations in Hong Kong," the statement to the media was made. According to ByteDance, it has not shared or shared data with the Chinese government, whichhard to believe under the new rule.Other signsIf an undemocratic regime like the one that works in China can chase people who think differently from the data that users give to an app (and that app gives to the government), it's not good.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged in an interview that the United States could also prohibit the operation of TikTok on its territory.In parallel, other companies such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Google decided to stop responding to requests for user reports in Hong Kong. And governments like Boris Johnson's in the UK decided to backtrack on the deployment of 5G networks that they had given Huawei, also for security and privacy reasons.How do you realize privacy is serious? Easy: we started by talking about TikTok, we ended up in geopolitics and national security matters.TECHNOLOGY Newsletter with the most important analysis and news, every Wednesday.

ZOOM SHUTS DOWN ACCOUNT OF U.S.-BASED GROUP AFTER TIANANMEN ANNIVERSARYStates News ServiceJune 11, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1164 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The video-conferencing app Zoom recently shut down the account of a U.S.-based Chinese rights group after it held an online event marking the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre.Humanitarian China said its account was closed on June 7 at around 10.00 p.m. local time, a week after it had used the platform to host an international event commemorating the weeks-long pro-democracy movement that ended when Chinese leaders ordered the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to kill civilians with tanks and machine guns on the night of June 3-4, 1989."Zoom has not responded to our requests for an explanation," the group said in a statement on its website.It said more than 250 people had taken part in the online event, which was also livestreamed to other social media platforms."A significant proportion of attendees were from China," Humanitarian China said in a statement on its website. "Our conference provided many the opportunity to connect with activists abroad for the first time."Speakers included members of the Tiananmen Mothers victims' group, workers severely punished for resisting the PLA troops on the ground, the organizers of 30 years of June 4 candlelight vigils in Hong Kong, as well as writers, academics,and former student leaders of the 1989 movement."Prevented by police from reporting live, most speakers from China sent pre-recorded messages," the statement said, citing the case of dissident Dong Shengkun, previously jailed for 17 years for his activism, who was detained for five days by police to prevent him from taking part."We are outraged by this act from Zoom, a U.S company," Humanitarian China said, adding that the platform was "essential" to efforts to reach out to Chinese audiences and fellow pro-democracy activists."It seems possible Zoom acted on pressure from the [Chinese Communist Party] to shut down our account," the group said. "If so, Zoom is complicit in erasing the memories of the Tiananmen massacre in collaboration with an authoritarian government.""Humanitarian China demands an explanation of why our account was shut down, and we will pursue other channels to protect our rights," it said.Contract protected by U.S. lawU.S.-based lawyer Ouyang Ruoyu, who managed the Zoom account for Humanitarian China, said the group had paid its subscription so as to be able to host the event."This contract is protected by U.S. law," Ouyang said. "How could Zoom just abruptly terminate this contract at the request of the Chinese government?"Former 1989 student leader and Humanitarian China founder Zhou Fengsuo said the group had hoped to reach more people inside China's Great Firewall this year, because Zoom had yet to be banned by the government like other non-Chinese platforms.In a statement quoted by the news website Axios, Zoom confirmed that the account had been shut down, and said it was due to a need to "observe local regulations" in jurisdictions where they operate.The company then restored the Humanitarian China account with little fanfare."Beijing makes its rules, and then Western companies are driven by the need to make a profit to comply with them," Zhou told RFA."These 'local regulations' are obviously Chinese regulations, which is tantamount to admitting that they shut down our account at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party," he said."We need to know what kind of instruction they received from the Chinese authorities, and whether it will be providing user data to the Chinese Communist Party," Zhou said.Zoom also recently shut down an account belonging to veteran labor activist and human rights campaign Lee Cheuk-yan, who is one of the organizers of the Hong Kong June 4 candlelight vigils.He had previously used Zoom to deliver four lectures related to the June 4, 1989 and the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong.He has yet to receive a response from the company.Another Zoom event hackedAnd former 1989 student leader Wang Dan said his commemorative Zoom event for the Tiananmen massacre anniversary was interrupted several times.Wang said it was unclear whether Zoom was hacked, or whether it had colluded with the Chinese authorities."We strongly suspect that this attack came from China," Wang told RFA. "It was clearly politically motivated.""Zoom is an American company, and as such should first abide by the laws of the United States, not the laws of China," he said. "Freedom of expression is protected under U.S. law.""They shouldn't be shutting off access to their services or closing accounts for political reasons," said Wang, who is considering taking legal action against the company.An April 2020 study by the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab said the company had been using non-industry-standard encryption for securing meetings, and that there were discrepancies between security claims in Zoom documentation and how the platform actually works.The company had been routing encryption keys through servers in China, even when all meeting participants and the companies they worked for were located outside China, it found."This finding is significant because Zoom is a company that primarily serves customers in North America and sending encryption keys via servers in China may potentially open Zoom up to requests from authorities in China to disclose the encryption keys," Citizen Lab said in its FAQ.Zoom saw a huge spike in new users in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, with numbers rising skyrocketing as millions started working from home.App banned by companies, governmentsChinese-American entrepreneur Eric Yuan, founded Zoom in 2011, has previously disclosed that most of its product development was done in China, with some calls routed via Chinese servers.The app has been banned by some companies and government agencies, including Tesla, NASA, the New York City government, the U.S. Senate, and the German foreign ministry.RFA technology specialist Lee Kin-kwan said the hacker attack on Wang Dan's event could have been sponsored by the Chinese authorities, who would be able to obtain the app's source code directly from the company or its employees in China.Lee said participants in Zoom meetings should limit the software to a dedicated device, and use it in conjunction with a virtual private network (VPN), which should be switched on first.He warned there could be a threat to the security of participants in a politically sensitive event like the June 4 anniversary.He said that, as well as hacker attacks, Chinese spies could infiltrate such events and then use video recordings as evidence against people without anyone being aware of it."It's to be expected that they would do this because the Chinese Communist Party has always done this in the past," Lee said. "Intelligence agents from East Germany and the Soviet Union used to do similar things."Reported by Ng Yik-tung and Sing Man for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by the Mandarin Service.

Human Rights Watch: Tech Companies Should Stand Up to China's BullyingTargeted News ServiceJune 12, 2020 Friday 8:23 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 413 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyHuman Rights Watch issued the following news release:Global tech giants censoring on behalf of the Chinese government for the China market is not news, but Zoom has taken appeasement to the next level by directly censoring users outside of China on the government's behalf. This should serve as a wake-up call to tech companies that keep acceding to Beijing's censorship demands.On June 7, Zoom shut down a US-based Chinese dissident's account after he held a Tiananmen Massacre memorial that was joined by China-based activists and families of victims of the 1989 massacre. Zoom later reactivated the account and said that the suspension was to "comply with local law."It is unclear what Chinese "law" Zoom is referring to that would compel Zoom to censor users outside of China. Besides, freedom of speech is guaranteed in the Chinese constitution and there is no law banning people from attending a vigil to commemorate the Tiananmen Massacre."Complying with local laws" has been repeatedly cited as the reason by international companies when they relent to political pressure from Beijing. Apple said it was "complying with local laws" when it removed hundreds of virtual private network (VPN) apps from China's App Store. LinkedIn said the same when it blocked content critical of the Chinese government.Laws in China are often abusive and don't comply with international human rights standards. Yet tech companies have a responsibility to respect human rights. Yahoo's reputation remains tarnished two decades after it handed over the email records of two journalists to Chinese authorities, which resulted in the pair being sentenced to 10 years in prison.Beijing's fit of rage last year with the National Basketball Association after the general manager of the Houston Rockets posted a tweet supporting the Hong Kong protests shows that any criticism - even outside of China - can put even major companies' holdings there in jeopardy. Tech companies can never be sure that they won't land themselves in the same predicament no matter how hard they try to stay in the Chinese Communist Party's good graces. Without the rule of law and the protection of basic rights, everyone and every business live in fear of the Party's wrath.Tech companies should stand together to resist Beijing's censorship demands and uphold the right to freedom of expression. Otherwise, the groveling will never end.[Category: International]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7140147 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: June 12, 2020End of Document

Center for Strategic & International Studies: Strategic Competition and the U.S. Semiconductor IndustryTargeted News ServiceJuly 25, 2020 Saturday 8:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 7730 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Center for Strategic and International Studies issued the following transcript of an interview on July 24 with Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Mark Warner, D-Virginia:James Andrew Lewis: Thanks to everyone for joining us today. We have a pretty big audience on the call. It's an important topic, and I think one of the things we're going to do is showcase an important and really precedential bill for the United States in its technology contest with China.Let me introduce our two speakers.Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. He's serving his third term, running for a fourth term. Served as the Republican whip between 2013 and 2018. A lot of us know him, of course, from FIRRMA, which was one of the great improvements of recent times. He currently serves on Senate Finance, Intelligence, and Judiciary. Prior to the Senate, he practiced law, was a district judge, was on the Texas Supreme Court, and became the first Republican to be elected attorney general in Texas since the Reconstruction. So impressive background, right, for this stuff.Joining him will be Senator Mark Warner, my former governor. And I guess you're my current senator since I live in Virginia; I forgot. (Laughs.) Senator Warner is currently serving his second term. He serves on Senate Finance, Banking, Budget, and Rules, and is the vice chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence. Prior to joining the Senate, Senator Warner was a businessman and an entrepreneur, and an earlier investor in cellular telecommunications - great background for this stuff - and invested in hundreds of startups. So Senator Warner, as I mentioned, was governor of Virginia from 2002 to 2006.So welcome to both of you. Thank you for doing this. I think this is an important moment for the country. I hope your legislation is putting us on a new path, because we are in a contest, may not like it. Let me open with a question for Senator Cornyn. The pandemic has shown some of the vulnerabilities that arise from the supply chain we have now that's both dependent on China and it's not particularly secure. This has been a focus of yours, not only with semiconductors but with 5G. Can you talk about why this is so important? Can you tell the audience why you've decided to focus on this?Senator John Cornyn: Well, thank you, Jim, and to everyone else at CSIS, for having me and my good friend - and I don't say that lightly - Mark Warner, who has been my indispensable partner on a lot of this important legislation. I had a chance to speak last year at CSIS about U.S. energy policy. And so I appreciate the great work you do, and the information that you bring to bear for policymakers to hopefully make better decisions. But, yeah, the virus I think is teaching us all sorts of lessons.But one of the most important is the vulnerability of our supply chains, whether it's personal protective equipment, medication, medical equipment generally. You know, we've had this idea that if it could be made cheaper that it would be better for consumers. But we haven't given enough attention, I think, to some of the national security and long-term economic implications of everything being made in China.And semiconductors are something that, you know, I'm not an expert in, but my crack staff pointed out to me that everything that turns off and on probably involves a semiconductor. But I became increasingly concerned when I learned that there was a sole source in Taiwan for some of our most sophisticated semiconductors. And while we design semiconductors in the United States and these fabulous entities, the foundries that are so important are not largely being built here in the United States, haven't been.Now, that's started to change because the administration, particularly Secretary Ross at Commerce, Secretary Pompeo at State, they've been negotiating with the Taiwan semiconductor company for a placement of a fab in Arizona. And once I began to understand how vulnerable we were to this supply chain stretched across the ocean, and what had happened to us with the pandemic, we - it really was brought home to me.And as you point out, Mark and I serve not only on the Finance Committee together, we serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee. So we hear a lot about what China is doing, some of which we can't talk about publicly. But I think we all understand that China has moved up the list to the number-one rival of the United States, not only economically but they're also acting very aggressively in their intelligence functions and in places like the South China Sea.So China has been a major supplier of most of these products that we have become dependent on, but particularly when it comes to semiconductors and integrated circuit chips. Demand has skyrocketed as we've gotten much more technically oriented. We carry around these computers in our pocket, and we just - it's become part of our - a very important part of our everyday lives. But the U.S. companies - U.S.-based companies create 47 percent of the global market share of these integrated circuit chips. But when it comes to manufacturing, we've dropped from roughly a quarter of the manufacturing facilities to only 12 percent.And not surprisingly, as our number has come down, China's has gone up. China has gone from manufacturing zero chips to now 16 percent of the world's supply. And they are aggressively investing and planned investment of over $1.4 trillion in semiconductor technology. So we've lost ground to our global competitors, and our number-one competitor when it comes to semiconductors. And unless we take action, it's estimated that by 2030 83 percent of the global semiconductor manufacturing will be in Asia. That's precisely the type of trend China has been hoping to achieve through its Made in China 2025 initiative, which it seeks to achieve in high-tech manufacturing.So as Attorney General Bill Barr noted recently in a speech, he said it's clear that the PRC seeks not only to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies, but to replace them altogether. Frankly, allowing that to happen would spell disaster for the United States. We need to bring these manufacturing jobs back onshore. So it's not anymore just a talking point. This is really urgent and important, which has led us to this important collaboration.Fortunately, we were able to work with the Senate Armed Services Committee and get this - at least a beachhead established toward our funding these new foundries, starting in Arizona, but it's broadly available. As Mark made a point of telling me, it's important we make this available not just to foreign semiconductor manufacturers who want to build these foundries in America, but to our existing semiconductor manufacturers.So other governments are investing not only in China but South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Germany. And if we're going to regain lost ground, we need to make a strategic investment from the federal government. This is a little bit uncomfortable to some of us who were raised to believe in free markets and it would all work itself out. But we all know now that the world is very different from perhaps those days and that if America is going to maintain our preeminence, not only from a national-security perspective but economically, a federal incentive program through the Department of Commerce to encourage semiconductor manufacturing is very important.So let me give another quick shout-out, not only to Senator Warner, who's been my partner in this effort, but also the great contribution of Senator Tom Cotton and Senator Chuck Schumer. There's not many things that happen in the Senate that actually get done. There's nothing gets done that's not bipartisan. And this, thankfully, has not fallen prey to some of the dysfunction that we've seen in the past.We were able to pass this amendment to the defense authorization bill with a vote of 96 senators to four. That's an overwhelming vote, obviously, and will help enable us to bring this manufacturing back onshore. We want our advanced technologies to run on made-on-America semiconductors for all the reasons I said. And this is a critical first step to getting us there.Thanks.James Andrew Lewis: Great. Thank you, Senator.Senator Warner, let me turn to you. You know, you probably don't remember, but you and I talked about some of these issues more than a year ago. And at that point, you know, the odds for Congress actually in producing subsidies and industrial policy seemed a little remote. What's changed? Why do you think we need industrial policy now when it comes to the competition with China that Senator Cornyn was talking about?Senator Mark Warner: Well, Jim, let me echo what John said. Thank you and CSIS. In all the programs I've done with you guys over the years, they're always thoughtful and I think well-timed.Let me also thank my good friend John Cornyn. I mean, he started this effort. I was happy to be his wingman. You know, we kind of reversed roles on 5G, where I took the lead and he was my wingman. And we have this collaboration, particularly out of the Intelligence Committee, that I think gives us a broader view across a whole series of jurisdictional areas, and technology being one.And John made the comment that our colleagues on this were, you know, Chuck Schumer and Tom Cotton. And when you can start with Chuck Schumer and Tom Cotton agreeing on something, that's - Cornyn and Warner working together is occasionally, I t does happen fairly often. You know, Cotton and Schumer was a little more interesting. But I think it goes a little bit to your question, Jim, of something that was potentially viewed as out there a year ago. Why is this happening now?And I would argue that it's - I think we've all learned that the rules that China is playing by are really different than what we expected when we invited China into the WTO, when - I used to say I was - you know, I was in the Hank Paulson camp, that the more we bring China into the global economy, you know, the better it will be for all.And I think, in many ways, we were wrong, not because China - I'm not anti-China. I'm not anti-Chinese. Obviously, I think we have to be very careful when we talk about China not to impugn Chinese Americans. But the Communist Party in China - (inaudible) - Xi Jinping has a very different model than some of the previous Chinese regimes. And I do think they have a(n) economic model that on one hand is market-driven, but you go a little bit below the surface, it is not market-driven at all. I frankly think that many of the great Chinese tech companies - the Huaweis, the Alibabas, the Baidus, the Tencents - at the end of the day, most of these companies are driven at the end of the day by the needs of the Communist Party of China, not by their shareholders or by their executives.And I would almost argue we partially got to where we got to on semiconductors so quickly because of what happened - and John made mention of this - what happened in 5G. Over the last couple of years we've seen the emergence of Huawei. And in 5G - I was an old telecom guy - in 5G, we're seeing an area where for the first time I would almost argue since Sputnik we have China both with the leading company and setting the rules, the procedures, the protocols around a new technology development area, that being 5G. And for so long, even if it was not invented in America, we by the - our size, by our academic institutions, set the rules of procedure. You see this in satellites. You see this in my old industry, telecommunications. You see it in the internet. 5G was the first time when, in many ways, at the - at the standard-setting bodies, China flooded the zones in these international bodies to set the standards.Then they have a model where they have some level of ferocious competition for their domestic market until a national champion emerges. And Huawei emerged as the national champion on 5G. By having the Chinese domestic market, that gets you about 30 percent of the overall global market. So if you start with that advantage and then China comes behind you, backing a company - again, let's stay with 5G - Huawei, with a $100 billion line of credit, there is no way any American or Korean or Indian or French company can compete against that model, where they give out their domestic market first and then exponentially back their chosen enterprise around the world.And I think we're making some progress now, again, I think partially due to COVID, where people thought, gosh, when China did not come fully clean about the virus to start with and not let others in, do you really want to be dependent upon a sole-source Chinese provider, I think has kind of awakened a lot of - awakened policymakers in America, but also policymakers around the world that there may need to be a Western rule-based law, market-based alternative to Chinese investment policy.And under John's leadership, I think what's happened with semiconductors is we've been hearing this story for the last decade, and China is still chasing us on semiconductors. But when we had the opportunity with TSMC, clearly one of the leading fabs in the world, it combined that with kind of our great American companies like Intel and Micron, Qualcomm and others, there is a - there was a real opportunity here to move aggressively. And in many ways, you could - you know, if you look back to American investment in DARPA, it helped create the internet. Or if you look back at American investment on the defense side, I think about $4 billion back in the '70s and '80s on GPS. You know, we did quasi industrial policy 30, 40, 50 years ago and it benefited us for decades afterwards.I think there is a new competitor in town, as John has indicated, with China. They are playing a different set of rules. I think we, America, and we, the West - I include, obviously, the Japans and Koreas and Australias and Indias in that category, along with our European friends - have to offer a different alternative. And I think our legislation is that first step, and it is about - it is about the foundries. It is about, also, the packaging component. One of the things John and I worked on together was recognizing that that was a part of the process around semiconductors that we also needed to take a lead on. We've now got to make sure that the - you know, that behind this amendment we put the kind of resources that are going to be needed.And I would argue - just last point - is that we're going to have to do this in semiconductors. I think there is a recognition we have to do it in 5G. I'm increasingly worried that when we look at artificial intelligence and quantum computing and hypersonics there may be a series of areas where either America or America in conjunction with a coalition of the willing are going to have to have an alternative economic model, because China has got a plan. And if there's anything that we should have all learned is we should not underestimate the determination of the Chinese Communist Party to execute on these plans and to bring a host of both human resources and financial resources to the table.James Andrew Lewis: Thank you.You both touched on a point that maybe I can ask both of you, which is that China's got an advantage in their willingness to spend money. You know, it helps not to have to go to the voters. But the bill, when I first saw it -Senator Mark Warner: That said, Jim - that said, Jim, the two of us were trying to get rehired - (off mic).James Andrew Lewis: (Laughs.) When I saw the bill, I was a little shocked because I thought, this is real money. How did you end up coming up with a great incentive package? How did you end up coming thinking about the money you'd spend and how you'd spend it? So, Senator Cornyn, I don't know if you want to start, but it's an impressive bill just in that regard alone.Senator John Cornyn: Well, let me back up a little bit. As I mentioned, there have been some negotiations from the - from the administration, State and Commerce, with the Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer.James Andrew Lewis: Right.Senator John Cornyn: And so that was - that was really brought to me through - actually through a contact I had with the President's Intelligence Advisory Board, who had been sort of assigned or volunteered to work this issue. But they didn't - he didn't know how to get any legislation passed. I said, well, that's our bailiwick; let me - let me see what we can do. And so I first reached out to Mark because we have worked so well together on so many issues relating to national security and intelligence, and he was quick to say, yeah, let's do this.So we tried to figure out what's the appropriate funding mechanism for this incentive package. We knew, for example, the state of Arizona had theirs. But in order to make it commercially feasible for them to build a foundry here, we know the cost of operation in the United States and constructing this was greater than it would be if it was done over in Asia. And so this made me and a number of us do things that maybe we wouldn't have done before.But I kind of like the way Mark described, you know, our competition. They're not bound by any rules. They don't follow any rules. They steal all our technology and they are investing huge amounts of money in this cutting-edge technology in hopes of dominating the world economy, and in the process knock America down a tier or two when it comes to our national security capabilities.So we looked at different ways to do this and came up with this tax-incentive model, which is - we're working with the Senate Finance Committee that Mark and I sit on as well. Secretary Mnuchin's got some other ideas. He said maybe if there's some money left over in the - some of the COVID-19 relief package that hasn't been able to be used for other purposes that maybe we could just use that money. We haven't worked out those details yet, but that's why we had to break this essentially into two packages. And we hope and expect we'll be able to do the second part of it in the - in the COVID-19 bill which we will - we will pass, I believe, in the next two-and-a-half weeks.James Andrew Lewis: Great. Thank you.Senator Warner?Senator Mark Warner: Well, let me, first of all, you know, begin giving a shout out to John Cornyn because, as you said, Jim, this is real money. I mean, this was not a study. This was not a, you know, kind of a tentative foot in the water. Because I think John recognized and I recognized that, you know, this - we are not going to win with the status quo, you know, when China's willing to throw incredible resources, when China's got the ability to kind of choose who's going to dominate their domestic market. I mean, our - if we basically said we're going to keep the rest of the world out of our domestic market, our companies would start enormous advantage, they'd travel around the world, whereas sometimes our companies have turned a - they've been so anxious to try to get bits and pieces of the Chinese market they've turned a blind eye to Chinese bad behavior, whether it's the treatment of the Uighurs and the treatment of the people of Hong Kong, or just the fact that, as John pointed out earlier, the theft of intellectual property.One of the projects that John and I have been working on as well over the last literally two and a half years is we've done a series of what we call road shows. We did one in Austin, that was really enlightening, where we bring in - have brought in the venture community, the telecom community, the banking community, BRT, academia. And we give them a couple of hours of classified briefs on the challenges that are presented by China.So I think John recognized and I recognized that this was not a time to be timid. That we needed to make a statement that in the long run these dollars, while they've got billions attached to them, are small compared to the economic value that will be created with these fab facilities. I've got one in Virginia that Micron owns. I mean, it's always needing to be refreshed and renewed. These are great jobs. But as important, if not important, the jobs are going to be, you know, a supply chain component that we want, you know, these chips, which are at the heart of virtually all the technological innovation that's going to take place, as they get smaller, and smaller, and smaller. We want to keep that building capacity and intellectual capacity here in the United States.This is core to our national security, as well as our economic security. And I'm glad we bit the bullet. And I would only add as well - and you don't often hear me that many times complimentary of the Trump administration. But in this case, they have been great partners. And my friend Steve Mnuchin - we may not fully agree with Steve on how we get there, but I think he's committed to getting us there as well. We've got a little more sausage making to do.James Andrew Lewis: Well, that's good news. But let me pick on something that you both raised, and it's something that's in the bill. How do you see the private sector working with this? What do you - what do you want to get from them? What can they do to help? You've got incentives. You've got tax bill parts, legislation perhaps. What's the role of the private sector in this? How do we coordinate that? This is a different kind of industrial policy, so -Senator Mark Warner: Let me start with that.James Andrew Lewis: OK.Senator Mark Warner: And I think that's going to be something that - I think we're still feeling through. We want the private sector to have skin in the game. We want them - you know, I do think we're going to have to think about - you know, when we - when we help with a fab it may be different than some of the other investment. But we may need to think about, you know, the intellectual property that's created. Is it going to be exclusively for one company, or is it going to be for a variety of American companies? We want to make sure that, particularly when we're making these kind of investments, that they build this in America. We don't want them to go off and for a nickel less, you know, locate the next facility abroad. Although, one last comment, coming back to John, though I do think this model around technology innovation - you know, this may the framework for the new alliances of the 21st century.You know, we've had military alliances. We've had economic alliances. I think increasingly, particularly when we see China with such an organized plan with the China 2025 document, I think we may have technology-based alliances. I know we've had conversations with our allies around the world about what a Western alternative to Huawei would look like on 5G. So there may even be even more innovation coming where we might have, you know, a Five Eyes, or a NATO plus Japan and Korea on some of these opportunities. I think there's a great chance to partner. John and I are both co-chairs of the India Caucus. There's great chances to partner with India on a lot of this technology innovation.So, you know, we're kind of making it up as we go along in terms of the specific role of the private sector, but they've got to play a big role. This is not we're going to write you a check, and then trust you to go spend it, and - you know. There will be strings attached.James Andrew Lewis: When we could travel, I was in Brussels and a commissioner told me - a European Union commissioner said: We're on the same path as you when it comes to China. We're a few years behind, but we now see the risk. Not universally shared, but there are some opportunities there. And of course, you've got the European private sector as well. But, Senator Cornyn, I don't know what you wanted to say on this, so.Senator John Cornyn: Well, you know, the government's not very good at innovating.James Andrew Lewis: (Laughs.) Really?Senator John Cornyn: (Laughs.) And so that's the - that's the essential role of the private sector, to create this intellectual property, the processes, to come up with new ideas to meet the need. But I would argue that this COVID-19 crisis, this pandemic, sort of kind of pushed us over the edge. Certainly, I think it contributed a lot to my decision to support something like this, because this is - again, it's not entirely comfortable to a free-market kind of guy. But as Mark points out, our rivals are not free-market kind of guys either, and we know that China is investing huge amounts of money into all the things that Mark mentioned, from semiconductors to 5G to artificial intelligence, just to mention a few.And, you know, we're either going to compete or we're not going to compete. And frankly, I don't want us to be number two. And so, yes, we're having to adjust and adapt to the new reality. But I think, because China is not a rules-based country and we are, we're going to have to adapt to the new rules, which are sort of the de facto reality that we either compete or we fall behind.James Andrew Lewis: Thank you.For both of you again, what does doing business with China look like in the next few years? I was at a DoD event where an official told me there are no safe end users in China. That might be a little over the top, but where do you think we're going? We hear about decoupling. This might be more wearing your intelligence hats. But what does the business relationship, the commercial relationship, the tech relationship with China look like in the next few years?Senator John Cornyn: I'd love to hear what Mark has to say. (Laughter.)Senator Mark Warner: Well, let me -James Andrew Lewis: Give me a sign if I ask one you don't want me to ask.Senator Mark Warner: No, no, no. I'd say this is - we've seen, I think, out of the Communist Party in China, their ability to kind of - their ability to frankly manipulate their technology companies to create an almost Orwellian surveillance state. You know, I think that is the antithesis of kind of American values and, you know, democratic values - not just American, but amongst many in the West writ large.And I think there's going to have to be a real recognition amongst so many of the American businesses that rushed to China because they thought this was such a big market that they couldn't let it pass by. And I - at least I think if you had a confidential survey with businesses, American business or Western business in China, you'd find some that say things have done great and they're doing fine, usually on the lower end of the supply chain, lower end of kind of consumer.But if you've got a high-value product, I know many, many corporate 500s that, you know, have invested in China. China stole their intellectual property. They had a partnership. They then built a facility that copied all their activities. And the sacrifices they made on intellectual property or the sacrifice they just made on values, the fact that a lot of the Western airlines can't put Taiwan on their maps if they fly into China and their - you know, look at our friends at the NBA who, when somebody had the audacity to mention the Uighurs, you know, China brought the rulings up.I do think this goes to how we're going to do business and how we're going to do business and still represent our values. I mean, our country right now is going through a, I think, healthy reflection on our own history, what we did right and wrong about race and other issues. You know, and I commend American companies who are rethinking that.I get a little bit frustrated if those same companies who espouse kind of our values are willing to then go to China and turn a completely blind eye to what the Chinese government has done, not just to the Uighurs, but I stand with the people of Hong Kong. I know John does as well. And I think this, how we calibrate about how we do business with China and I don't want us to get into the kind of a - back to a 20th century bipolar model, and gosh knows a huge amount of innovation/intellectual capital coming out of China. We've got to figure this out. But it's got to be a two-way street.And I think, candidly, the Chinese government has played us - Americans off the Europeans off the Japanese in a brilliant fashion, you know, over the last 25 years. And I think we need to all agree we have a lot more common alignment, not to gang up on China but to kind of basically say if you want to be part of the world order, you actually - as John said, you've got to play by the rules.Senator John Cornyn: Well, Jim, the - you mentioned FIRRMA, which is the reforms to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States that we were able to get through. Actually, kind of using this same model on the defense authorization bill, we were able to get a lot of cooperation and recognition that China was being very creative when it came to their foreign investments in the United States, particularly in startups and dual-use technology. And not only could they get the intellectual property; they could get the know-how that would make it a lot easier for them to do what they are - have said they are going to do and are doing under Made in China 2025.But I think one of the challenges that we had when we took up the FIRRMA legislation, to reform the Committee on Foreign Investment, is a number of American businesses kind of acted like, well, this isn't their problem. This is, you know - and I wanted to ask, you don't think national security is your problem? And, of course, nobody would say - nobody would admit to that. But the fact is they've got fiduciary duties to shareholders and a bottom line they've got to meet. They've got to run a company. And, of course, this just adds another layer of complexity, unwelcome layer of complexity, to their ability to run their business and satisfy their shareholders.But I think perhaps this new, as you call it, industrial policy, this - and we're just doing this - you know, this is one step at a time. But I don't see why, as Mark indicated, this wouldn't apply to 5G and some of these other areas where we're in a rivalry with China. We're going to have to figure out, you know, how to come up with the money. But it may be a win-win because we can - you know, companies can come to the United States. They can hire our workforce. They can help our economy and maintain our preeminence when it comes to national security and economically.So maybe this is a little bit of a shift. We'll see. This is important for its own sake, even if this is the only thing we do. But it's easy to see other applications. And 5G is perhaps the most obvious one.Senator Mark Warner: And let me just, Jim, add to what John said; a couple of other quick points.We do have legislation that we got also into NDAA that started down the path to have a small $750 million goal for a fund on kind of O-RAN, Open Radio Access Network, that's moved behind where Huawei's got the advantage.But I remember - and John's leadership on FIRRMA was important - we had a session in Austin, in a classified setting. And I remember two distinct things that came out of it, because I don't think the American government had been very good about informing, other than large corporates, some of this challenge.I remember one startup guy, I remember, and he was talking about his company. And I think it was in quantum. And he was saying, as we went through this whole presentation - we had ODNI and FBI and other appropriate, CIA there and stuff, and it was a young guy. But he goes, "gosh, I was wondering why the Chinese-backed venture firm was offering three times more than anybody else."And then another one, that was a college president, said, "oh, my gosh, you're saying some of these students are - could be spying for China? I thought when you - when the American government gave them a student visa that you've done a full security check on them."And it was - and I think, you know, so we have to do a better job of informing. And I actually think most of American industry - and I've seen a dramatic change over the last few years - starting to get the one area - and I know there may be some on the call or line here who will be offended at this - private equity has been the one sector of our economy that I don't think has wanted to hear this story, because so much of them have made such incredibly valuable investment in some of these Chinese tech companies that they don't want to hear the other half of the story.And I think we're - I don't know about you, John - John is higher in the food chain than I am - but my caucus is calling me and saying they're going to close the vote if I don't go vote on this last bill.Senator John Cornyn: I'm getting the same indication.James Andrew Lewis: So we're technically - we've got about 10 minutes. Let me see if there are any questions from theSenator Mark Warner: I actually -James Andrew Lewis: You've got to run.Senator Mark Warner: I can run and come back if - you know, I don't know if you want to -James Andrew Lewis: Do you want me to give it a try?Senator Mark Warner: I'll run -Senator John Cornyn: Mark, why don't you go vote and come back, and then I'll go vote.Senator Mark Warner: Yes -James Andrew Lewis: That sounds great, because we did get - we actually got a question from a VC and from one of the big chip companies. So we'll come back to that.But let me - let me start by asking you, Senator, now that he's gone - (laughter) - what were the sticky points in the bill? Because I think this is a precedent in many ways. It's certainly groundbreaking. Where were the sticky points?Senator John Cornyn: Well, I would say, you know, how to pay for it remains a sticking point. And we've tried to come up with a way to provide a tax incentive. You know, obviously, a lot of states use various incentives to attract investment in their states, but the federal government, by and large we've sort of viewed that as crossing a line and figured, well, if the economics didn't work out well enough for the business, then, you know, why would we subsidize that. But again, this is where the national security interest is preeminent.And I just think, again, I'll come back to my earlier statement. I think - I think the pandemic has awakened a lot of us to our vulnerabilities. And it's - can you imagine if for some reason we weren't able to import these high-end semiconductors what would happen to some of our biggest companies, things like Apple and others, just to mention one, but even more importantly than that what it would do to our technological advantage when it comes to our weapons systems and our - and our national defense. That's always been our comparative advantage, is in technology front. But it's easy to see if China can't steal it, then they are going to - they're going to out-invest and, ultimately, bypass us. And so this has been a - is the culmination of things happening which caused this realization that we really I don't think have any other choice.And I think it's a - it is a precedent. We're still at the early stages of it, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it applied in other areas as well.James Andrew Lewis: That's great. Let me combine two questions we got from - one from one of the big chipmakers and one from the Semiconductor Industry Association. They both asked something kind of similar. What are the biggest obstacles to getting this bill across the finish line? That's one question. What can they do to help? And in particular, how can they help you reinsert the funding levels you had when we first saw this bill? So how can they help you get this to the finish line at the right level?Senator John Cornyn: It's only a - it's just a question of money. It's pretty easy.James Andrew Lewis: Yeah.Senator John Cornyn: And to be honest, what we - the way we tried to do this is to move it as quickly as we could using moving legislative vehicles. And thankfully, Senator Inhofe, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Jack Reed, the ranking member, were willing to work with us because they saw the national security implications. But because of the web of jurisdictions - different jurisdictional - of committees in the - in the Senate, we really didn't have time to get this all done now. And really there would have been, perhaps, some - even some jurisdictional objections to doing all of this in the NDAA. But we know that we are going to pass another COVID bill in the next two-and-a-half weeks, and we looked at this - you know, how can we break it down, break it in two, and get it in - the rest of it done in that bill.So what people can do to help is to continue to advocate for funding that will allow this to be successful. And you know, if we don't get it all done at one time, we'll come back and do some more later. But this does seem like an unusually opportune time to be able to get the funding done either through the tax credit or through funds that were available as a result of the appropriations Congress has already passed for the COVID-19 response.James Andrew Lewis: Welcome back, Senator Warner.Thank you, Senator Cornyn.The question that Senator Cornyn was answering was -Senator Mark Warner: John, they're flipping out on the - OK, great. Sorry. (Laughs.)James Andrew Lewis: There he goes, yeah. (Laughs.)What are the biggest obstacles? How can industry help you get it across the finish line? What can they do to help you get the funding levels back up to what they were before? So it's fairly basic stuff.Senator Mark Warner: Thanks, Jim. I think, you know, as John was saying, a lot of the reasons we don't get stuff done up here is many times actually less about Democrat-Republic and more about committee jurisdictions, as you know. And so there are moments on must-pass bills, like NDAA or COVID, where, you know, regular order might never get us there. I think this is one of those times. And we have alignment. We have alignment with the administration. You know, we've got - (inaudible) - the Democratic leader - (inaudible) - we got the, you know, former whip. You know, we kind of got the right players aligned.And I think we need to bump these numbers up. I think there will be the normal - you know, the idea Mnuchin has of using already-appropriated funds if we can't get the tax credit is - I think is a valid one, because - and I say this with great affection for my friends who are appropriators - but they are kind of like the third party and the third leg of the stool. And, you know, this size number as a new initiative would probably never go through a traditional appropriations process. Again, why COVID or an NDAA makes sense.I would also make the pitch - and we got some of this in, frankly, without enough money on 5G and O-RAN, you know. I would argue - and, again, I'm a little bit biased as a former telecom guy - that the 5G competition is as important as the - you know, as the semiconductor competition. And, you know, we don't even have an American horse in that fight at this point - you know, basically Huawei, Nokia, Ericsson, and Samsung. But if we move towards a more software-based system with O-RAN, you know, American companies and other Western companies can compete, and it's more secure. So, you know, we're looking at about a billion and a half where we both have this domestic fund and international collaboration fund. Smaller numbers, but we need help on that as well.And I think we really are going to need industry to be actively engaged, you know, kind of across the technology menu front. And because, you know, I firmly believe that we will have similar - and they're not - you know, semiconductors and telecom are - both are anchored by, you know, single large, usually, entities. But we could have the same issue in AI, and quantum, and, again, so many of these other areas. And we're going to - we're going to really need shoulder to the wheel, and we're going to - you know, back to the earlier point, we're going to need industry to have skin in the game. The idea that we're just going to write checks on this and then say, go forth and prosper, it isn't going to be the case.And we're not going to want to micromanage by any means, but we are going to want to make sure, you know, industrial policy is called industrial policy because it means you're advancing the interest of a nation-state. And in this case it may not just be - and this is one of the things I'm excited about - not just an American industrial policy but, again, this coalition of the willing idea around a suite of technologies.James Andrew Lewis: Yeah. I think it's seen as pushing some of that. And we have a little program like that too.You touched on something that there was another - we're getting questions from the audience now - someone else raised from an investment group. What do you think the role of foreign companies should be, friendly foreign companies, in this industrial policy and strengthening U.S. and key industries? And this touches on 5G as well.Senator Mark Warner: I think - yeah, I think there is an absolutely critical role. You know, this is not an American-only enterprise. This needs to be a - you know, again, coalition of the willing. And even in the semiconductor world, we're talking about TSMC as kind of the anchor tenet coming across, in addition to our great American companies. So we went through this recently on the - in the COVID debate in terms of, you know, who was going to benefit or not, when we were looking at some of the business support systems. And I'm a big believer that if, you know, it's a Germany company, if it's a Indian company, if it's a Korean company, you know, as long as they're going to play by our rules, and we're going to have rules in the law that, you know, we cannot do this - you know, I am not - I am not a build a wall kind of guy around our economy.So I think there's an incredibly important role. Now, it's a lot more - you know, one of the things, as we were talking about on 5G, you know, if we thought about a series of governments investment in a Western-based competitor to Huawei, which has been - you know, I think there are stories kicked around about that for a while. You know, the complexity of that is made more difficult. But I don't think you can rule anything out because, I mean, I just keep coming back to my initial comment.If, in most of these areas, the Chinese domestic market alone is going to equate to between 20 and 30 percent of the growth in the world market, and if you figure there's always going to be a Chinese champion starting with that much heft, and just the profit margin that comes out of the Chinese domestic market. And then you have a government that's willing to spend, you know, with very few limits, and they're willing to use their industrial policy and economic aid, you know, it really is a 21st - the Chinese are doing a 21st century version of what the British did in the 19th century and probably we did post-World War II, in terms of semi-economic imperialism. But they've held it to a new level.James Andrew Lewis: Well, we're coming close to the end of our time. And I think I've hit most of the questions from the audience, at least all the ones I can get. Let me close with a final one that hopefully won't be too long to answer for you. And if Senator Cornyn makes it back, I don't think he will. But some people talk about a new Cold War with China. Do you think this is Cold War? Why is it different?Senator Mark Warner: My hope is that it does not default to - you know, I have enormous respect for China, for the Chinese people, for their innovation. And I also think, you know, the - for their actual thirst for democracy. And I think we see that play out right now with the people of Hong Kong. So that would be the worst default position.But to simply - and I would argue that this was a bit of the pattern under both President Bush and President Obama. We were so anxious for this collaboration that we turned a - we continued to turn a blind eye to where there was intellectual property theft or there was cybersecurity theft. I mean, the fact that we have, you know, on published reports, not from my - I mean, not from anything I would say, but from published reports, the fact that evidence of, you know, China hacking into OPM or the host of other Chinese hacks. And almost arguably for years China and Russia were able to punch us with impunity because we feared, you know, cyber escalation.So I think there has been this recognition that - and it's not just in America; I think it is around the world, exacerbated by COVID - that, you know - we want China to be an active participant in the world economy. They are a much bigger participant economically than the Soviet Union ever was. But the idea that they can pick and choose which set of rules they want to follow when it's convenient to them and when they want to not even any more pay lip service to any notions of, you know, privacy or democracy, intellectual property having independent value, they just can't play that - that is not a fair - that is not a fair way to operate. And this is where, again, I think there is such an opportunity.And where I've been disappointed so much with the Trump administration, there was this moment in time when I think the world would so welcome strong American values-based alliance in this field of technology development. And while I think there's conflict in the administration, some in the administration reject that kind of multilateral cooperation when I actually think it is the future for our country and for the world.James Andrew Lewis: Great. Thank you. Great answer.We've come to the end of our time. Let me note that we will make a recording of this interview - this discussion available. As I told Senator Warner before, that usually means we'll get a good turnout in China, but it'll be in 12 hours. Something to look forward to.Senator Cornyn sends his regrets. He says thank you.But let me thank both of you. You're two of my favorite senators and you've done great work with this bill. So thank you very much for this event.Senator Mark Warner: Well, Jim, thank you, and thanks to CSIS.James Andrew Lewis: Thank you.Senator Mark Warner: These kind of discussions are so important. Thank you so much.James Andrew Lewis: Thank you, and goodbye to everyone.[Category: Political]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7188621 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 25, 2020End of Document

Continue reading Google, Facebook, and Twitter halt government data requests after new Hong Kong security lawIllustration by Alex    Castro / The VergeGoogle, Facebook, and Twitter are pausing the processing of data requests from the Hong Kong government as they review a new security law that went into effect on July 1st. Google put its pause      into place as soon as the law took effect last Wednesday. [W]hen the law took effect, we paused production on any new data requests from Hong Kong authorities,  a Google spokesperson told The Verge in an email,  and we ll continue to review the      details of the new law,  the spokesperson said.Twitter also halted its handling of government requests as of July 1st, with Facebook announcing its pause on Monday, The New York Times reported.Social media platforms typically produce private user information in response to valid court orders, depending on the legal process in various countries. But under this new position, all the      companies will, at least temporarily, ignore the requests coming from the government of Hong Kong.The new policies are in response to China s new national security law in Hong Kong, which was first proposed in May. Hong Kong has traditionally enjoyed significant independence from mainland      China, but the central Chinese government has tightened restrictions on speech in Hong Kong in recent months, bringing a gradual end to the  one country, two systems  principle. China s push      toward more control has led to widespread protests across Hong Kong, which began last year.In particular, the new security law gives China the power to limit political dissentagainst the Communist Party, making it unlawful to engage in  secession, subversion, organization and      perpetration of terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security.  Those powers are particularly relevant for social platforms,      which may be hosting the now-criminalized subversive activities.Google, Facebook, and Twitter have both been banned in China for several years, part of the so-called  Great Firewall,  under which government censors and monitors track online activity.The new security law has already compelled several political opposition parties in Hong Kong to disband, NPR reported, and is expected to further chill political dissent against Beijing in Hong      Kong. We believe freedom of expression is a fundamental human right and support the right of people to express themselves without fear for their safety or other repercussions,  a Facebook      spokesperson said in an email to The Verge.Twitter says it is reviewing the new law to assess the implications, adding many terms of the new law are  vague and without clear definition,  a spokesperson wrote in an email to The Verge.       Like many public interest organizations, civil society leaders and entities, and industry peers, we have grave concerns regarding both the developing process and the full intention of this      law. Facebook has a process for reviewing government requests, which takes into account its own policies and local laws as well as international human rights standards, the spokesperson added.  We      are pausing the review of government requests for user data from Hong Kong pending further assessment of the National Security Law, including formal human rights due diligence and consultations      with international human rights experts. Facebook has offices in China and uses Chinese suppliers to manufacture some of its hardware, including its Oculus VR headsets and its Portal video chat devices. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg      has attempted to mend relations with China in the past, meeting with Communist Party leaders while in Beijing for an economic forum in 2016. More recently, he s pushed concerns about      Chinasetting the terms for online engagement.  If another nation s platform sets the rules,  Zuckerberg said last year,  our nation s discourse could be defined by a completely different set of      values. See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21314900/google-facebook-twitter-hong-kong-government-data-chinaContact Information:Kim LyonsTags:, Wire, Artificial Intelligence Newswire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: August 13, 2020End of Document

Twitter closes Chinese accounts as Zoom folds to Beijing demandsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 12, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 672 wordsBodyReacted with reaction from China and Turkey ///Hong Kong, 12 Jun 2020 (AFP) - Social network Twitter is closing tens of thousands of propaganda and disinformation accounts related to the Chinese government, while its compatriot Zoom acknowledged that it has folded into Beijing's demands to suspend human rights defenders in the United States and Hong Kong. Twitter, such as YouTube, Google and Facebook, are banned in China, which, with a "great computer wall," blocks undesirable content. But, on the other hand, Chinese diplomats and state media flood these platforms with messages. On Friday, Twitter noted that it had disabled a "core" of 23,750 accounts linked to China and broadcast by another 150,000 accounts that serve as "amplifiers". Its contents have been stored in a database for scientific research, the company noted. The network of Chinese accounts was discovered using tools installed last August to erase Beijing-linked accounts during the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.That network posted tweets, mainly in Chinese and probably destined for the diaspora, "spreading favorable geopolitical theories to the Chinese Communist Party, while supporting misleading theories about political dynamics in Hong Kong," Twitter explained in a note. These thousands of accounts have also served to promote Beijing's views on the fight against coronavirus and anti-racist protests in the United States, said Australian expert group ASPI, which analyzed the flow of tweets." While the Chinese Communist Party does not allow the Chinese people to use Twitter, our analysis shows that it does not hesitate to use it to spread propaganda and misinformation internationally," said one ASPI manager, Fergus Hanson.La most of the messages were written during Chinese business hours, especially during the week, which "clearly suggests a lack of authenticity and coordination," according to ASPI. China is "the biggest victim of misinformation," retorted a spokeswoman for Chinese diplomacy, Hua Chunying." If Twitter wants to fulfill its part of the contract, it should close the organized and coordinated accounts to attack and discredit China," suggested Hua, a user of the social network. This massive account suppression is the second offensive in a year by U.S. tech companies to curb the networks of influence attributed to the Chinese government.          - Chinese Demands - In August 2019, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have already deleted thousands of accounts to tackle the Chinese authorities' campaign to discredit pro-democracy mobilization in Hong Kong. In its announcement on Friday, Twitter also claimed to have closed 7,340 Turkish accounts, a network detected in early 2020 and devoted mainly to the promotion of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and 1,152 linked to Russia.The communication director of the Turkish presidency, Fahrettin Altun, said, via Twitter, that "the company's allegations (...) are not accurate" and which meant an "unacceptable attempt to defame the Turkish government." The position of Western platforms on the demands of authoritarian governments, whose countries also represent important markets, is in the crosshairs of public opinion. The Zoom video conferencing application, which has become popular during the governing imposed by the coronavirus, is at the heart of a debate about freedom of expression. On Thursday night, the U.S. company acknowledged that it bound to the Chinese government's demands and closed three accounts of prominent human rights militants in the United States and Hong Kong who wanted to use its app to commemorate the brutal Chinese Tiananmen crackdown in 1989.For Zoom, thisresponse "was a failure" and "should not have affected users outside mainland China." The accounts were reactivated and Zoom announced that it promises technological tools to limit governments' demands to limit activities they deemed illegal to limit to the territory of the country. jta/amj/lch/jhd/en/af/mis -------------------------------------------------------------Load-Date: June 13, 2020End of Document

Thanks for being with us. See you here tomorrow. Good night from Sussex.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, July 7th. Your top stories right now, 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Big tech taking a stand against China's crackdown on Hong Kong's freedom. Google, Facebook and Twitter, all saying that they will not release user data to Hong Kong law enforcement. TikTok pulls out from the city as well. This, as the U.S. is looking at banning the popular app, another China- based social media app, the way India has already.Coronavirus cases still rising and at an alarming rate this morning. Dr. Anthony Fauci is warning we are still knee deep in the first wave. Cities like New York reopening, while other areas, including Los Angeles and Miami reversing course.Markets this morning pulling back from yesterday's big rally. Take a look at Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading this morning, down 283 points on the Dow, down 50 points on the NASDAQ, and the S&P right now down 28 on Futures. This after a strong rally kicked off the week yesterday, pushing the NASDAQ to yet another all-time high.Who dipped into the Paycheck Protection Program? Companies include law offices, the Girl Scouts, P.F. Chang's, even Kanye West's clothing company has got some - looked for some money. The list causing some controversy this morning. We've got it.Plus, crime rising in major U.S. cities. Georgia's Governor declaring a state of emergency, deploying the National Guard following a weekend of violence in Atlanta."Mornings with Maria" is live right now.Global markets this morning are red across the board. Take a look at European Indices here. The FT 100 down 83, the CAC quarante in Paris is down 57, and the DAX Index in Germany lower by 176 this morning. Even though there are some signs of recovery to tell you about in Germany, industrial output rebounded in the month of May, rising 7.8 percent.In Asia overnight, markets were mostly lower with the exception of China. Stocks rose again overnight in China, following that big rally on Monday after state media said that China needs a healthy bull market and is ready to add support to attract investors. As soon as the CCP said it, millions of accounts are opened in China by retail investors.Now, some of the top stories that we are watching this morning, leaders in major U.S. cities are now vowing to get crime under control after another violent weekend. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp says that he will deploy 1,000 National Guard troops after at least 30 people were shot in Atlanta over the weekend, five people were killed, including an eight-year-old girl.In New York, more violence leads to outrage after a video is reported to show a man holding his daughter's hand as he is gunned down in the city. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says the situation is unacceptable. He is blaming the uptick in violence on the coronavirus.Meanwhile, the White House says it is ready to play a larger role in the debate over how to address this violence, adding the country needs to focus on securing its streets. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says the Trump administration may soon ban Chinese social media apps, including TikTok, Pompeo weighed in on Fox News last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: We are taking this very seriously. We are certainly looking at it. We've worked on this very issue for a long time.LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Would you recommend that people download that app on their phones tonight, tomorrow, anytime currently?POMPEO: Only if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: TikTok says it is leaving the Hong Kong market after China imposed a controversial national security law there. The Beijing-based app has been trying to make moves to distance itself from China, including naming American and former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its CEO of TikTok.Facebook and Twitter suspending requests for data from Hong Kong's government meanwhile, after China recently approved the controversial national security law. The two companies said that they are reviewing the implications to the new law, which gives China sweeping powers to crack down on dissent in Hong Kong and criticism of the CCP. Hong Kong police made its first arrest under this new law last week, 10 people were detained.Seattle City Council, meanwhile, has approved a payroll tax on big businesses that pay the highest salaries. This new tax in Seattle targets companies with annual payrolls of at least $7 million in salaries of more than $150,000. Lawmakers estimate that the plan called "Jumpstart Seattle" will raise $214 million a year. The money would be used for COVID-19 relief and to build more affordable housing.Futures pointing to a lower opening this morning. Markets are pulling back from that big rally yesterday, ending on a high yesterday. Investors are eyeing reopenings across the country, some areas now rolling back those efforts amid spikes in coronavirus cases, the surge after the holiday weekend coming as Shanghai reported significant gains.Joining me right now is Potomac Wealth Advisors President and Founder, Mark Avallone. Also joining the conversation this morning is Fox Business's Dagen McDowell; The Wall Street Journal's Senior Writer Jon Hilsenrath, and Cornerstone Macro's Michael Kantrowitz.It is great to see everybody this morning. Thank you so much for being here.Mark, let me kick this off with you. Yesterday, that big rally, as we got the word from the Chinese Communist Party that we're supposed to have a bull market, retail investors started opening accounts in China and that led a whole global rally, what's your take on what took place?MARK AVALLONE, POTOMAC WEALTH ADVISORS PRESIDENT & FOUNDER: Well, that's a continuation of Central Bank involvement that we've had in the stock market for close to 13 years. Investors respond favorably, and there is no reason for them not to when you have the dual impact of monetary and fiscal policy really urging stocks higher.When the Fed and other central banks step in, they are huge engines behind an economy or global economies at this point. And it's also taking away other alternative investment choices. Where are investors supposed to go when the 10-year (ph) is just hovering north of one-half of 1 percent, which is less than inflation? So that pushes people into stocks. It might be created some froth, especially in some of the growth names at least in the short run, but until the Fed gets some discipline here, until the - even the U.S. government, Congress stops these relief efforts - which are needed, of course, but until--BARTIROMO: Yes.AVALLONE: --we see an end to that, we don't see stocks falling through the floor.BARTIROMO: Right. Well, that's one way to look at it, the Chinese Communist Party creating more stimulus like the Fed has. But Michael Kantrowitz, when you're looking at China specifically, this is a different story in my view than the other stimulus that we've seen. I mean, yesterday, the Chinese government basically said, look, we want a bull market in place, and that's how that economy works. It's top down. The CCP says something, and the country follows suit. That's why you had millions of retail investors opening stock accounts. Is that sustainable?MICHAEL KANTROWITZ, CORNERSTONE MACRO: It's not sustainable, but in the near-term, it's certainly something that's going to help lift sentiment as the government tries to stabilize the economy after the shock of COVID and helps - tries to help China from the relative weakness around the world, like in the United States. But it's not sustainable, but certainly--BARTIROMO: So what do you want to do here, Michael? I know you've been looking at cyclical. Tell us how you're allocating capital right now.KANTROWITZ: Sure. So, with China specifically, they are definitely helping the domestic market. We're not seeing signs, though, that they're necessarily helping to lift global markets and create a more reflationary environment like we saw in 2016 or in 2009 when money growth in China was in high double-digit territory.And so we don't think we're in a backdrop like that. But it's certainly - you don't want to be fighting the governments, whether it's the Fed, the BBOC, et cetera. And so you want to find those tailwind--BARTIROMO: Yes. Now, I'm really - I'm really referring to the broader market actually. And Dagen, technology stocks obviously have been performing great recently. The NASDAQ closing at a record-high again yesterday. Netflix reaching an all-time high. Amazon at $3,000 a share yesterday. Your take on what we've seen in terms of the valuations, Dagen?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: This is just the inflation of asset prices because of unprecedented Federal Reserve action and action by central banks around the globe. And I think that politically and economically, you're seeing a greater divide between the haves and have-nots where there's going to be a lot of explaining that needs to be done by this inflation of asset prices on one hand and people who are still struggling to find enough work or get their jobs back. And I think that it's only going to be exacerbated over the coming years. And I don't know how much longer this can hold up.BARTIROMO: Jon Hilsenrath, we've got bank earnings coming out soon. Several banks expected to report second quarter earnings next week. Investors are looking at the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. You've got interest rates, of course, where they are. What do you want to say about the banks this morning, given the earnings are coming out in a week?JON HILSENRATH, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SENIOR WRITER: Well, I think the banks had to - had a tough quarter with loan volumes and loan values. So, that, to me, kind of points to a disconnect that we're seeing in the market right now, where tech stocks are going through the roof, NASDAQ is hitting new records every day. But if you look at the other markets, S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrials, they're still down for the year.And one of the things that I think investors have to puzzle out over the next few weeks or months is whether they keep writing tech stocks higher or whether a moment is coming to shift towards these less-valued, under-valued broader market stocks, including the bank stocks that you referenced.BARTIROMO: Mark, what you've got there? Real quick. If you look at technology, if you look at banks, banks are going to be reporting earnings next week and tech is really where the valuations have skyrocketed. Are you (inaudible)?AVALLONE: Banks cause me a lot of concern right now that if you talk to bankers on the street, the reason we haven't seen this many write-downs and charge-offs is because of loan restructurings. When a strip shopping mall, commercial office property, anything travel-related, has a dead on the books, they've gone to the bank and the banks have given some sort of loan forgiveness and restructuring, and there hasn't been a write-down.When those occur later in this quarter or the following, then we're going to see the true weakness in the core economy - not the growth sector, not the tech sector we've been talking about, not the NASDAQ stocks. And the disconnect that Jon mentioned is going to be exacerbated and it's going to be visible. That doesn't mean investors should run for the hills and pull from stocks. It just means they need to be selective.And if they want to be on the value side of the trade, they need to look at things like industrial, health care, telecom, dividend-yielding players that might be able to do well in a new environment, in a Biden administration or Trump administration, whoever wins, and broadly diversify out. But I would not overweight and back up the truck to over-weighted growth tech names and I wouldn't overweight banks on a valuation plate. I think they're a value trap.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. We will be watching that sector and checking out if it's a value trap. Mark, thanks very much. Mark Avallone, joining us this morning on investing.We are just getting started this morning. Coming up this hour, join us for the state of real estate - major cities facing a declining market, prices coming down. We are going to take a look.Next hour, Former Acting White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, is here to talk about the state of the Paycheck Protection Program. The Chief Operating Officer of Nissan, Ashwani Gupta, will be here talking about the turnaround at Nissan after COVID-19 and the arrest of Carlos Ghosn. And Columbia Business School Dean Emeritus Glenn Hubbard joining us to talk about the state of the economy.In the 8 a.m. hour, we are looking at alternative to Twitter. The CEO of Parler will join us to talk about growth and bringing Democrats over to the platform. All that coming up, much more ahead.But first, General Jack Keane is here to talk about the idea to ban TikTok in the United States. First, reopening America. New York City now in phase three. We are talking to a nail salon owner on what's changed. That's next, coming up.You are watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. There are growing concerns over coronavirus spiking in the United States. Dr. Anthony Fauci warned yesterday that we are still, quote, "knee deep" in the first wave of the pandemic, as cases never decreased to intended levels and deaths across the country top 130,000 now.Florida facing conflict within the state, Miami-Dade County deciding to reclose restaurants and gyms. Governor Ron DeSantis's administration is mandating all K-through-12 schools reopen next month. Meanwhile, New York City is now in phase three of a reopening, which includes personal care services like nail salons, spas, tattoos and piercings at 50 percent capacity. It also includes the reopening of outdoor recreation services. The city has decided against reopening indoor dining.Joining me right now is the manager of one of those reopened businesses, Le Jolie's nail salon manager, Grace Hahn. Grace, it is great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us. How was your reopening?GRACE HAHN, LE JOLIE NAIL STUDIO MANAGER: Our reopening was a little bit slower than expected. A lot of our old customers have been very excited to come back. So we've been seeing a lot of those calls and seeing them as well.BARTIROMO: So, do you feel that you have a lot fewer customers, you've got a capacity issue? Are you handling things much differently in terms of the safety precautions like gloves and masks, et cetera? Tell us what's happening with this reopening?HAHN: So, with the 50 percent capacity, it definitely limits our income significantly. And so the way that we've been doing things now is we're taking appointments only, which basically trying to limit the amount of time that a customer will spend inside the store.So, at the moment, because we haven't fully booked up yet, people are still calling to see if we actually are open. We have been getting some walk- insurance, and we've only been taking them if we have the space and asking everybody to wait outside. We've been taking temperatures, cleaning the equipment, the stations regularly, which has been adding time to the work.BARTIROMO: Are you going to be able to keep this going with 50 percent less capacity and the increased costs that you face now with the safety precautions?HAHN: So, with the increased costs, all of our expenses are staying the same, and then also, having just come out of a - of over a three-month closure, with the 50 percent, it's going to be an uphill battle for sure. Basically, we have to rely on any profits that we make in the upcoming months to kind of cover the rent that we still owe for the last three-and- a-half months as well. So it's going to be a struggle.BARTIROMO: Grace, have - have you had to raise prices, Grace?HAHN: Yes, we have had to raise - we have had to raise prices. We have to cover the cost of PPE essentially as well as--BARTIROMO: Of course.HAHN: --the tip credit kind of being lost as well. And so we don't want to add too much to the prices for services that customers will like to come regularly for, but we have had to add a little bit on.BARTIROMO: Yes.HAHN: And then we're going to see how that goes in the next coming weeks. And then, depending on that, we - to cover our losses and to cover expenses, we would need to raise it a little bit more than what we have already. But if we can, we would like to just kind of keep it as low as possible for our customer sake.BARTIROMO: All right. We wish you the best, Grace. We'll be watching as your company and so many others face this task and the same issues, really.Grace Hahn, thanks so much. Best of luck. We will see you soon.HAHN: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Coming up, banning TikTok, the U.S. taking a closer look at the fate of the Chinese social media site. Plus, what a deal! Patrick Mahomes signing the largest deal in NFL history, the eye-popping number making a buzz this morning. That's all right after this. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Well, the clock is ticking, apparently. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the Trump administration may soon crack down Chinese social media app, TikTok. Pompeo weighed in on Fox News last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POMPEO: We are taking this very seriously. We are certainly looking at it. We've worked on this very issue for a long time.INGRAHAM: Would you recommend that people download that app on their phones tonight, tomorrow, anytime currently?POMPEO: Only if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Of course, the app has been accused of promoting propaganda and feeding user information directly from China and has been banned in India.Dagen McDowell, TikTok's developer has denied these allegations, with the CEO telling "Reuters" it would not comply with any request to give data to Beijing. Your take?MCDOWELL: And that's what the CEO - his name is Kevin Mayer - said. He's the Chief Executive of TikTok, also the Chief Operating Officer at the parent company, ByteDance. He was hired from Disney, of all places, to kind of shepherd the growth and kind of try to set aside the concerns about this. But when India did the same, banned TikTok, this is what the CEO said then. "Chinese authorities have never requested the data of their Indian users. And even if they had, the company would not comply."But of course, TikTok is the center of a national security review that was requested by senators really beginning with Senator Marco Rubio, but this is a bipartisan effort from those including Chuck Schumer of New York and Tom Cotton. So the TikTok is certainly going to be continuing to feel a lot of heat from the U.S. government and maybe users here.BARTIROMO: Yes. But I mean, just to be clear, if you are a Chinese company, you will not say no to the Chinese Communist Party. It's just not how it works. I mean, the CCP, if they want information from any company that is a Chinese company, they will get it. And they will be forced to hand over all data to the CCP.There's also something called civil-military fusion where any innovation in China first is checked with the military to see if the military can use it. So, again, the Chinese Communist Party will run all companies that are in China. So, I mean, he could say he's not going to give the information to the CCP, but it's just no way that that would happen if they asked him for the information.MCDOWELL: Well, the data--BARTIROMO: That's - it's not like America where you can be Google and say, guess what, Pentagon, I'm going to walk away from you and I'm not going to work with you. Now, that wouldn't fly in China.MCDOWELL: Well, for India (inaudible) in China, there are. So there is the issue of where their servers are held.BARTIROMO: And India, of course, has banned TikTok and 50 other apps from China. It looks to me like the world is understanding better what the CCP is doing and trying to run over speech. Obviously, we're seeing that in Hong Kong as well.We'll take a break. When we come back, we'll get retired four-star General Jack Keane's thoughts on this. We'll get his thoughts on issues surrounding TikTok and a lot others. That's coming up.And then, thank you, "Hamilton," the musical's debut giving Disney plus a big boost. We'll take it a look when we come right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Tuesday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, July 7th. Let's take a look at markets this morning at 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Futures are pulling back from yesterday's big rally, take a look, we've got the Dow futures down 271 points, the Nasdaq futures lower by 53 and the S&P futures down 27 right now.This after a strong rally yesterday kicked off the week, pushing the Nasdaq to a third consecutive record high. Take a look. The Nasdaq now at 10,433 unchartered territory. Global markets this morning are also weaker, red across the board in Europe. There are signs of recovery in Germany, industrial output rebounding in the month of May, rising 7.8 percent, the FTSE 100 this morning is down 87, the CAC Quarante in Paris is down 63 and the Dax index in Germany is lower by 172 points right now.Overnight in Asia, all markets were lower with the exception of China which continues this momentum. Stocks rose yesterday and a big rally yesterday, and they continue this morning after state media said that China needs a healthy bull market, and it is ready to add support to attract investors. CCP basically saying buy stocks and they did.Jeffrey Epstein's long-time associate and former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell is now in a New York prison. Cheryl Casone with the details. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: What a story, Maria, good morning to you. Ghislaine Maxwell is now behind bars at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. Maxwell's first court date set for next Tuesday where she's facing multiple charges in connection to an alleged sex trafficking operation. She's accused of luring under-aged girls so that Jeffrey Epstein can abuse them. This was happening in Palm Beach allegedly, New Mexico, Manhattan. Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail last year.Now prosecutors are urging no bail for her. They say that her wealth, her international connections and 3 passports makes her an extreme flight risk. Also, Alicia Arden; a model in Los Angeles filed a complaint about Epstein back in 1997. She's come forward again. She never heard anything from law enforcement, and Gloria Allred is now representing her. A lot of these victims have been publicly coming out this week talking about the abuse by Epstein and by Maxwell.Now her arrest reportedly is worrying Prince Andrew according to "The Sun". The prince is feeling nervous after he said Maxwell was a, quote, "key element" in his friendship with Epstein. Andrew has not been charged in the investigation, he denies any wrongdoing, but again the case continues to unfold day-by-day. Well, switching gears, Patrick Mahomes is now the highest paid man in sports, like in all of sports.The Kansas City quarterback signed a massive 10-year $503 million extension with his contract with the Chiefs. He led that team to their first real victory in 50 years earlier this year. His contract, the biggest in sports history, he's now beating up the last record of a large sports contract that was MLB star Mike Trout. Soccer stars or the baseball stars, Mahomes is now number 1. Well, country music fans are mourning the death of Charlie Daniels, perhaps he was best known of course for his hit song, "The Devil Went Down to Georgia".(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(MUSIC)(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Oh, he was such a classic. Daniels was a member of the Grand Ole Opry and the Country Music Hall of Fame, he died from a stroke yesterday in Tennessee. Fans turned out. They wanted to pay their respects at a police escort -- look at this, led his body to the funeral home where he's going to be resting. Dolly Parton, one of many artists paying tribute to Daniels on Twitter, saying, "well, the devil went down to Georgia but Charlie went straight to heaven."The great Charlie Daniels, 83 years old, may he rest in peace. And finally, here's a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com, Brooks Brothers is nearing a bankruptcy filing that could take place as early as this week, sparking a possible bidding war. "Siriux XM" is reportedly near a deal to buy E.W.'s Scripps Stitcher Podcasting unit for around $300 million. And Disney Plus' downloads reportedly increased 72 percent during the Hamilton debut.And Maria, that was on July 3rd. Everyone seem to watch Hamilton on Disney Plus over the holiday weekend. Those are your headlines.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you. Meanwhile, there's a state of emergency this morning in Georgia, Governor Brian Kemp making the move to go to the state of emergency following a violent July 4th weekend, calling up the National Guard. Georgia reporting more than 30 people were shot, five people were killed including an 8-year-old girl. This comes as the country is witnessing a dramatic uptick in shootings in major cities.Joining me right now is Fox News senior strategic analyst General Jack Keane. General, it's good to see you this morning, thanks very much for being here. And of course, we want to begin on this violence across the country. Atlanta is one issue, you've got New York as well, Chicago, a deadly weekend there as well. What is going on in the country with all of this violence and what can the administration do to bring calm back?JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Well, we've seen this play before. When we've had massive protests against police, there's usually a pull-back after that by the police themselves because they're weary of being able to do their job. They don't believe that they're going to be backed up by a police chief or by a mayor or by a governor. And we've already seen some evidence of that in the country itself.But certainly, the governor is looking at that situation and he knows it's out of hand, and he's doing what he can to bring it under control. But I think anybody who has looked at this situation for years knows what it takes, and these police departments to achieve the degree of public safety that they need to achieve, and that has been demonstrated a number of years ago in New York City, in Boston, and in Los Angeles and recently in Detroit. And there are plenty of benchmarks --BARTIROMO: Yes --KEANE: Out there in terms of how to police properly, how to have community relations properly and how to control the level of violence. And you have to put the perpetrators away at some point, and that's the reality.BARTIROMO: Yes --KEANE: We've got to get them off the streets because they're the ones who are doing the killing.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, it starts with support from your bosses, support from the governors, and the mayors in these cities, and the cops are not getting that support. No wonder we're seeing all of these resignations and retirements going on within the police force. Let me turn your attention to China because Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last night said that the United States is considering banning TikTok and other Chinese social media apps.We've been talking about this, this morning, general. It comes less than a week after the FCC designated Huawei and ZTE as national security threats. The U.S. is stepping it up in terms of watching for security threats coming out of China. Your reaction?KEANE: Well, I think what's happening here, this universal recognition now about how much China is really overstepping their hand, and clearly, the major intellectual property theft that they have -- that they have executed against the world writ-large and the use of their telecoms and their IT companies have also done very much the same in stealing people's secrets, influencing governments, influencing people by the under-hand that they've been doing.They use IT to do that. And I think, you know, Maria, when I look at this strategically, President Xi came in 2013, and he put China on a fast track to dominate and control the region and also replace the United States as the world's global leader. And I think in those 7 years, and we look back on it, with a little bit of clarity than we probably have right now, I think we're going to see that President Xi has overreached.And this pressure on him inside this country for it as well. You know, his Belt and Road initiative where he builds energy projects and infrastructure, they're running out of money, and they're not delivering a quality product. I mean, what we saw happen with the pandemic and worldwide condemnation for this deception and spreading the epidemic into a pandemic. And then I think -- I think he overreached --BARTIROMO: Yes --KEANE: In Hong Kong. He thought they were going to be compliant, and after a year of protests, he had enough, and they had to clamp down on them with this National Security Act which has done what? It produced a decisive victory in Taiwan for a conservative anti-mainland China candidate in President Tsai as a result of this heavy hand in this -- in Hong Kong. And the same thing goes on in the region. He's overplayed his hand in the region --BARTIROMO: Yes --KEANE: And we've got the United States pushing back significantly, to make certain our partners and allies know that we're going to be there for them. That's what the two aircraft carriers are doing right now as we speak.BARTIROMO: Well, at this point, the world or certainly America should understand that the CCP has had a very aggressive espionage campaign in place, and it's doing it through many ways. Whether it's these apps or, of course, the technology giants. The U.S. tech giants are pushing back against this controversial Hong Kong security law. You've got Facebook, Twitter, Google saying that they will suspend requests from the Hong Kong government for user data.General, your thoughts on that, you're finally seeing social media in the United States recognize that you're dealing with the CCP when you're looking at Hong Kong and requests for user data.KEANE: No, that's absolutely the case. The world has woken up to the reality of what the Chinese Communist Party really is, and certainly the pandemic has educated many people about it. But you know, they made a strategic decision which has impacted everybody, and that is to dominate technology, they get their hands on it and to steal it, not the create it - -BARTIROMO: Yes --KEANE: But to steal it, and that is what they've been doing for years now and it's finally starting to catch up with them --BARTIROMO: Yes --KEANE: We've got a long way to get control of this yet to be sure, but recognizing the problem is a major first step.BARTIROMO: Well, there's an incredible amount of surveillance of Americans going on as well. They're doing this through hotels, they're doing this through the Huawei infrastructure that is still prevalent in America in rural areas. We've got to point that out that Huawei is used in America, and where Huawei is used, those Americans are being surveilled. Now, I want to also point your attention to hotels because a Chinese-base firm, for example, acquired Radisson Hotels back in 2018.This is Jin Jiang International Holdings announced back in November that it has closed a deal to acquire the majority ownership of HNA Tourism also of China of Radisson Hotels. So when you go to a Radisson Hotel and you stand there in front of -- and you're checking in, and they're taking your picture, just remember that that's also going into the bank of info on you, Americans. People miss the fact that Americans are being surveilled in their own country because of the way China and the Communist Party has been able to infiltrate things, even the hotel industry, general.KEANE: Yes, the Chinese knew a number of years ago clearly what they were trying to achieve. And it's through malign and aggressive behavior they want to gain geopolitical control and influence. And a vehicle and the currency to be able to do something like that is information. And they have been riding the IT waves and dominating people's lives all over the world and gaining that information, not just technological information, so many which assists them, but information on people, information on corporations.The merges that may be coming, the acquisitions that are coming. They're involved in all of that. It's an incredibly comprehensive --BARTIROMO: Yes --KEANE: Campaign that they've been conducting for years.BARTIROMO: Yes, really interesting that Radisson Hotels, the whole Radisson Hotel group was acquired by China and very little coverage of that. So, we wanted to point that out as well because there's a lot of ways to infiltrate and steal data, importantly our universities. That's why you've seen all these indictments recently of university professors like the -- like Charles Lieber, who was running the chemistry department in Harvard.A lot to talk about, a lot to go through, general, it's great to get your insights as always, thank you, sir.KEANE: Yes, and it's good for you to put a spotlight on it, Maria, like you've been doing. It's great work.BARTIROMO: Thank you. Thank you so much. Coming up, a major health warning to report, Florida is on high alert this morning, a deadly brain-eating amoeba identified in the state. We're going to take a look when we come right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, real estate reversal. The largest markets in the country feeling the impact of the coronavirus now. In New York City, sales and prices are plunging in the once booming bay area rents are plummeting. And in Boston, condo sales are down more than 40 percent. Joining us right now is Warburg Realty Broker Jason Haber. Jason, it's good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.It's not just prices, the number of closed sales in New York City also down, down 54 percent in the second quarter. Assess the situation and do you look for a rebound?JASON HABER, BROKER, WARBURG REALTY: Right, so, a lot of people are asking right now, is this the beginning of urbxit, which is the urban exit that people have wondered about after traumatic events happened in just cities. So, we know what happened to date, the question is what happens now? I will tell you, here in New York City, we are seeing much more volume and activity since we moved to phase 2, which is now a little over 2 weeks ago.So I think what you'll see is a market that was dislodged, a market that was basically arrested, return to more normalcy grant it at lower prices because we've already seen it move down, and so now the big question is what happens from here? And I think you're going to see a rebound over time here in New York City.BARTIROMO: Well, Jason, what kind of a decline are you seeing in terms of prices? Walk us through real estate in New York right now. Are sellers --HABER: Right --BARTIROMO: Having to cut the price, what? How much?HABER: So when we began two weeks ago, the expectation was that we were going to be off in the order of 5 percent to 10 percent. And so what you're seeing right now is somewhere in that magnitude where we're seeing deals get done. Now, the other thing that I want to emphasize is before COVID, we were in a market that was declining for a few years and then had been relatively flattened end of last year, and it was actually showing some upward momentum to start the year. So, the market was already down. So, I don't think you're going to see --BARTIROMO: Yes --HABER: What you're seeing in some up markets where it's increased velocity downward. I think New York has the floor that other markets won't have necessarily.BARTIROMO: Jon Hilsenrath?JON HILSENRATH, SENIOR WRITER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Two questions for you. One is, who wins in this environment if the companies and individuals are moving out of kind of big cities and central cities, who are the winners and what are the places that wins? And also there's a lot of talk lately about crimes in the big cities. When you're talking to clients --HABER: Yes --HILSENRATH: That's something that they're getting worried about that, that crime is going to go back to what it was like in the '90s --HABER: Right --HILSENRATH: And that it's just going to be less safe to live there.HABER: So we remind everyone that unlike other cities, systemic crime has not been part of the story, the recent story of New York City, 2019 was actually the safest year that we've ever had on record. And I also remind people that we're 349 days away from electing a new mayor in New York City. A lot of them are disappointed in our current one. But that's on the crime front.In terms of people going elsewhere -- listen, I talked to brokers in the -- outside of New York City, whether it's in the Hamptons, whether Up State, in New Jersey, they've been extremely busy and they've been setting records because how fast homes have moved, homes are sold on sites unseen, they've sold virtually which would never have happened --BARTIROMO: Yes --HABER: Before, and so --BARTIROMO: Yes --HABER: Those markets are growing.BARTIROMO: But that -- but that's also a function of the decline in New York, right? People are leaving the city to go --HABER: Yes --BARTIROMO: Move to the country, whether it's the Hamptons or out of the city. I mean, that also speaks to what's going on in New York City.HABER: Sure, but both things can be cured at the same time. So, you can have folks who are exiting the city, at the same time, you can have new buyers come into the fold, and that's what we're seeing right now --BARTIROMO: Right --HABER: As prices come down, you have new folks that come right in. In a market that's in real decline, just you don't have buyers waiting in the wing. So, I think both are true right now here.BARTIROMO: All right, Jason, thanks very much, we'll be watching. Jason Haber joining us there. Quick break, and then coming up, the new alternative to Twitter, we are talking with the CEO of Parler on the platform's growth and bringing left-wing commentators to the side. Then Slack gives your weekend back, and it's making a buzz this morning, it's all coming up right here.BARTIROMO: Time for the Morning Buzz. First up, the richest sports contract ever. The Kansas City Chiefs signing Super Bowl-winning quarterback Patrick Mahomes to a reported 10-year, $503 million contract. This makes Mahomes the first athlete with a half a billion-dollar deal. It is also the first time a member of the NFL as the highest paid player in the sports world overall. Jon Hilsenrath, your reaction.HILSENRATH: I'm going to put a geeky twist on this. You know, there's this idea called super star economics in the economics field, that the top person in any field, whether it's dentistry or book-writing makes orders of magnitude more than everybody else. And we see it even in football, the average football player's salary is $3 million a year. Mahomes is going to be making almost 17 times that, $50 million a year. But we see super star economics in every field, even in the super star field of football.BARTIROMO: Wow, next up, having your passport with you all the time, and this is talking about technology. Apple filed a patent application, allowing users to store IDs digitally. This feature could be used away, but Dagen, what's your reaction?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: Ultimately, it could happen down the road. Again, it's just quite frankly, it's pretty easy to lose your passport if you're carrying it around in your purse with you. More recent -- more currently, Apple in the new version of iPhone, you're going to be able to start your automobile with the phone. It only begins with BMWs, they're made, I think in the middle of 2020, but that would be something that catches on probably quicker than storing your passport on your phone.BARTIROMO: Well, we try to do everything with that phone, I guess. Finally, this Slack gives you some time back. Slack is now allowing users to turn a no-notification policy on for weekends or whenever. You don't want the notifications -- Michael, your reaction?MICHAEL KANTROWITZ, CORNERSTONE MACRO: Yes, I think it's great that, you know, especially with us, many of us that are still working from home to be able to separate work days from weekends. My wife has a small business, and I know she always tries to separate out the weekends from doing her client interactions, you know, even though we are all online all the time these days. It's still nice to be able to have that control between work days --BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, it's getting --KANTROWITZ: And weekends, when we can a lot --BARTIROMO: It's getting harder and harder to do frankly. It's getting harder and harder --KANTROWITZ: Yes --BARTIROMO: To do because we're doing everything with our phone. We'll take a break, when we come back, we'll get the word on Wall Street coming up, leading financial experts weighing in on China supporting a bull market. What's next for the economy and what's on tap for investing, all coming up. Then the alternative to Twitter, I'll be speaking with the CEO of Parler on site's growth boom, much more ahead. You're watching MORNING WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.Load-Date: July 7, 2020End of Document

Senate Commerce, Science & Transportation Committee Issues Testimony From Commerce DepartmentTargeted News ServiceJuly 30, 2020 Thursday 3:17 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4582 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee issued the following testimony by Nazak Nikakhtar, assistant secretary for industry and analysis at the Commerce Department's International Trade Administration, at a hearing entitled "The China Challenge: Realignment of U.S. Economic Policies to Build Resiliency and Competitiveness":Thank you for providing me the opportunity to testify today regarding the United States' economic relationship with the People's Republic of China (PRC). We are at historic cross-roads in the U.S.-China relationship, as the steps we take now will chart the course for U.S. economic and technological leadership, and will shape the landscape for the democratic world for decades, and possibly centuries to come.The Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration is responsible for strengthening the competitiveness of U.S. industry in the United States and global marketplace, increasing investments in America, monitoring compliance with U.S. trade agreements, and enforcing U.S. trade laws. At Industry and Analysis (I&A), we are, in particular, responsible for working with businesses to develop international trade and investment strategies for a range of industries from the manufacturing sector to the financial services sector, including industries that are critical to the United States' national security interests. I&A also leads the Commerce Department's participation in the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a committee that reviews certain specific foreign investments and real estate transactions in the United States for their impact on U.S. national security.Today, I would like to speak about challenges to the United States' national security industries and set the stage for the successful commercial growth of our most critical sectors. In 2017, the U.S. Government began, for the first time, to confront head-on the challenges posed by China's predatory practices. Those challenges had been ignored for decades and, as a result, over the course of the past 40-plus years, the United States has continuously lost capabilities in sector after sector in manufacturing, technology, and services that are essential to our national security. In goods alone, the offshoring of manufacturing has created supply chain vulnerabilities across hundreds of critical products, ranging from semiconductor and electronics manufacturing to the development of active pharmaceutical ingredients. This has led to job losses of between 3.4 to 3.7 million between 2001 to 2018./1In key sectors such as communications equipment, electronics and computer technology, we ceded up to 40 percent of the domestic market share to Chinese imports, and globally China has captured 40 percent of market share in those sectors as well.To underscore with examples of where that leaves us, the United States does not have the domestic supply chains required to manufacture many key electronic components for our telecommunications systems, or many active pharmaceutical ingredients for medicines to serve America's health needs. Nor does the United States process the rare earth elements that produce magnets that are essential for military and weapons uses, as processing is now dominated by China. Even the more mature steel and aluminum industries have been experiencing existential challenges, as global overcapacity continues to weaken American firms. Where the United States was once the undisputed leader in technological innovation and industrial advancements across the board, it is now struggling to remain competitive in many key industries.There are two classes of state actors in the global economy. The first class is comprised of nations that generally adhere to their obligations under the rules and principles of the global economic and trading system, as enshrined in international organizations such as the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the World Trade Organization (WTO). The second class is comprised of nations that either do not adhere (or selectively adhere) to these rules and norms, or actively circumvent them. While both classes of nations can introduce distortions into the global economic order - for example, through corporate subsidies and discriminatory nontariff barriers - the distortions can be managed when dealing with rules-based state actors and market-oriented economies. Here, international agreements may provide viable legal mechanisms to address non-competitive, market-distorting behavior, and states have historically adhered to their binding commitments or improved their practices when compliance fell short.The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), on the other hand, does not just fall within this second class of state actors. It is also, by far, the most distortive economic actor that the global trading system has ever encountered. Not only are the current rules of international trade and monetary policy largely ineffective when dealing with China but, as a non-market economy under the tight control of the CCP, the government of the People's Republic of China flagrantly flouts those rules when it believes it is in its interest to do so, and shows no intention of reforming to a market-based system or adhering to its international obligations when those rules frustrate its national industrial goals. And because of China's size and scale, it has been able to weaken international supply chains and disrupt the global economy significantly. In this respect, the threat from China is formidable, and it is the largest threat the United States has encountered to date.But we need to remember that this threat is nothing new, it has its roots in the Cold War. Khrushchev famously said "We," meaning the Sino-Soviet bloc, "declare war upon you," the United States, "in the peaceful world of trade. We will declare a war; we will win over the United States." Again, quoting from the Prime Minister of the Soviet Union, "We," again referring to the Communist states, "value trade less for economic reasons and most for political reasons." The hearing transcript for the Trade Act of 1962 includes these powerful statements. Perhaps in response to this threat, in the "Statement and Purpose" subsection of the Trade Act of 1962, 19 U.S.C. 1801, Congress explicitly enacted into law the goal of Chapter 19; it is inter alia, "through trade agreements affording mutual trade benefits" to "prevent Communist economic penetration." This provision is still valid today precisely because the threats continue today. And after 1979, when the United States formally normalized trade relations with China, the PRC government accelerated its plan to augment global economic and military strength in a quest that it concedes will ultimately lead to a great power struggle against the United States.The PRC government's weapon of choice is predatory economic tactics, and it has successfully used such tactics to disrupt global supply chains and weaken the technological advancements of the United States and its Western allies. China has transformed itself into the epicenter of global commerce, has centralized manufacturing and research and development (R&D) hubs within its own borders and, with this, it has accumulated the power to influence all economies that are dependent on it.CHINA'S USE OF PREDATORY ECONOMIC TACTICS TO CAPTURE CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAINS AND TECHNOLOGYIn order to understand the PRC government's predatory economic strategy, it is important to understand the specific trade tools that it deploys. Indeed, China's most effective tools, by design, are those that are governed by weak or non-existent international rules and disciplines. To understand a "strategic competitor" or an "adversary," one has to understand their tactics. To counter those tactics, we need to consider how our laws need to be strengthened.Case in point: China's economy has grown in large part because of the massive subsidies it provides to industries, and the lack of transparency on the subsidies it provides results from its failure to notify them completely to the WTO, as well as the absence of effective WTO rules governing the types of market-distorting industrial subsidies used in China./2It is difficult to legally challenge what we do not know about or what the rules do not cover. Moreover, China leverages its self-designated developing country status to avoid complying with existing WTO rules and obligations, and WTO rules are generally silent on how a member state can challenge another country's self-designated status.Next, the PRC government takes advantage of the absence of applicable international rules over state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to funnel massive amounts of capital and other resources to SOEs with the well-publicized intent of dominating strategic sectors worldwide. The PRC government also distorts prices and costs throughout its economy (e.g., land and property, energy, wages, and raw materials) through direct price controls and to export undervalued goods and services worldwide, thereby weakening the competitive positions of market-based firms. Dangling possible access to China's large consumer market and making available cheap labor, goods and services are also how China lures foreign manufacturing capacity and technological know-how into its own borders. And as the CCP controls the government of a sovereign state, it knows full well that its non-market economic system is unaffected by legal challenges or the prospect thereof by the rest of the world; even possible losses of legal challenges at the WTO may not be incentive enough to compel China to reform a system that has served it so well and eroded the competitive positions of its adversaries so quickly.Just as alarming, the PRC government takes advantage of the dearth of rules governing global overcapacity to flood world markets with distortedly low-priced goods. In 2019, China's overcapacity significantly depressed global prices in the fiber optical cable market. Its strategy is to eliminate competitors and obtain absolute control over this critical 5G infrastructure asset. The PRC government has previously deployed the same strategy in the steel and aluminum sectors, among many others, and the same strategy will create excess capacity in new sectors in the future. And notwithstanding the fact that the 2020 coronavirus pandemic has dramatically reduced demand for steel and aluminum products worldwide, China has once again ramped up steel and aluminum production and dramatically increased inventories, contributing to drastic global price depression. This illustrates the national security threat to our steel and aluminum industries and why the President imposed Section 232 tariffs to address the impact of overcapacity and the threat posed by steel and aluminum imports. Outside the United States, however, the global surge continues and China's actions are still destabilizing the global steel and aluminum industries.The PRC government is further exploiting opportunities abroad to monopolize strategic ports and mines (among other assets). State-backed Chinese investors own 10 percent or more of equity in ports in Europe, and it has major deals in Greece, Italy, Spain, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium. This is in addition to a growing number of investments in more than 40 ports in North America, South America, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Central Asia, South and Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Pacific. The PRC government is similarly increasing control of the raw materials necessary for manufacturing high-technology products (e.g., phones, vehicles, advanced energy storage systems, and magnets) that are sourced from a small number of countries, and for which substitutes are unavailable. Operating in niche markets with limited transparency, often in politically unstable countries, Chinese firms continue to capture supplies of cobalt, graphite, lithium, nickel, niobium, and platinum, to name just a few. Because these minerals and metals are finite assets that cannot be replaced, China is able to exert influence over the rest of the world by withholding access to these assets to compel nations to bend to its will.Additionally, in its never-ending quest for technological superiority and control over key positions in the industrial value chain, the PRC government regularly has supported or directed the theft and misappropriation of U.S. technology and intellectual property (IP). Monetary damages accrued to the United States are estimated to range from $50 billion to as high as $600 billion annually. Moreover, by making short-lived market access promises to cutting-edge technology companies, the PRC government pressures the most technologically-advanced firms to transfer IP and sensitive data to it. The PRC government ultimately uses the IP it extracts from companies to displace them from the market. China's increased dominance in key segments of the industrial value chain further cements its technology transfer approach. Even where Chinese firms are perceived to "collaborate" in technology development, take for example Huawei's announcement that it plans to build a $1.2 billion optical fiber research facility in the United Kingdom, the gains are only one sided./3Chinese companies will, as directed by the PRC government, benefit from scientific research and collaboration with international scientists abroad, resulting in some cases in the repatriation of technology to generate overcapacity to eliminate competition and obtain a monopoly position. In sectors like 5G, where optical fiber cables provide the infrastructure for an impending technology revolution, the national security implications are obvious.It is also reported that the Chinese government, this year, is implementing a nationwide credit rating system for all corporations - foreign-owned or Chinese-owned - operating within China. Companies handling sensitive personal data and proprietary technical information will be required to transfer that data to the Chinese government. The European Chamber reports this credit rating system as amounting to "life or death" for companies./4China's engagement in international standards as a way to influence the global technology market also is of great concern, but it is often not fully understood. To illustrate this attempted influence, take for instance the fact that, from 2011 to 2019, the number of Chinese-led technical committees in the International Organization for Standardization, one of the largest international standards setting organizations, increased by 75 percent./5 Further, China has strategically increased its participation in the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), an agency of the United Nations responsible for coordinating telecommunications operations and services, with the hopes of expanding its influence around the globe. In fact, in key technology working groups of the ITU, China alone comprises 40 percent of participants./6Moreover, China's press into international standardization ranges from introducing weak proposals into the standards development process, flooding the organizations with low-quality proposals that detract from and take resources away from sound proposals, to making financial contributions as a way to wield power over those organizations and to punish member companies and countries that do not side with its agenda. Indeed, China's participation in international organizations has become a vehicle to advance its One Belt One Road Initiative, and the more influence China has over standards development, the more likely this initiative will succeed.Additionally, China uses other international organizations to advance its global ambition, including the Belt and Road Initiative. To illustrate, it has been reported that the head of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs used his position to discriminate against people and organizations who were drawing attention to the CCP's repression of the Uighur ethnic group. The World Health Organization's capture by the Chinese government, by failing to alert countries to the rapid transmission of the coronavirus, is yet another recent example. Even more to the point, if the Chinese government is currently threatening to retaliate against Nokia and Ericsson for the EU's possible move to ban Huawei from their 5G systems,/7 imagine the types of influence that China could wield if it is able to dominate global standards organizations and the standards themselves.Finally, it is worth emphasizing that because China is a sovereign state, foreign laws can never be sufficient to fully address its conduct. In fact, the PRC government takes advantage of the United States' lack of an extradition treaty with it to advance cyberattacks on sensitive U.S. assets. The attacks not only obtain proprietary trade secrets from companies and sensitive personal information about American citizens from servers, but these attacks also target crucial weapons systems and sensitive military technology (well-documented examples include attacks that extracted sensitive information about U.S. submarines, cryptographic systems, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and anti-ship missiles that are crucial for deterrence and developing countermeasures). China's medium of cybertheft also includes stealing computer software source codes, design technology, and technical product specifications. And the PRC government continues to violate its 2015 bilateral commitment to the United States in which it had vowed to refrain from stealing and misappropriating U.S. IP.The tactics used by the PRC government over the course of the past 40 plus years have enabled the country to move its economy from the 12th largest in the world ($191 billion gross domestic product, GDP (current prices), in 1980) to the second largest ($14 trillion GDP (current prices) in 2019); become the second largest foreign holder of U.S. debt at $1.09 trillion in 2019 (the first largest being Japan holding $1.27 trillion), and grow as the world's largest exporter of goods. Indeed, the United States' largest bilateral trade deficit is with China ($345.6 billion in deficit in goods in 2019). In addition, China today holds uniquely powerful positions in the most critical supply chains in the world including rare earths elements, medical equipment and supplies, pharmaceuticals, and electronics.The past policies of the United States did not effectively impede or curtail China's rise as a predatory economic actor. To build our seemingly efficient supply chains, we flocked to China as the low-cost producer of virtually every link in the chain, allowed the PRC government to build reserves of U.S. dollars which it used to devalue its currency, traded our most sensitive intellectual property in exchange for short-term market access and profits, and did not adequately use legal enforcement tools to protect our industries. Our motives were short-sighted, and we failed to sufficiently anticipate the vulnerabilities that this trading relationship would create.As a result, we willingly transferred our debt and exported our manufacturing capabilities (and jobs) to a non-market economy where market principles, transparency, and predictability do not exist. By doing this, we created a global economy where distorted prices and non-market conditions are allowed to proliferate. We also put China in control of our revenue stream. This vulnerability is often not discussed among policymakers, but it is important to emphasize: within our highest-technology sectors, substantial revenue comes from U.S. exports to China. This means that China, by controlling America's revenue stream, also controls America's ability to earn income and fund R&D. This is an extraordinary vulnerability that, if unaddressed, will be used by the PRC government to further halt America's technological progress.RESHORING CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAINSTraditionally, economists have viewed calls for countries to pursue policies aimed at protecting national security production capacity skeptically. They argued that a nation could, in a globalized world, always turn to other countries if the domestic supply chains eroded at home. However, what we have learned from the coronavirus crisis is that borders do matter because any state has the sovereign right, and ability to, restrict exports to the rest of the world. Indeed, the PRC government strategically withholds exports: (1) as a bargaining chip to extract concessions from trading partners; or (2) to punish trading partners that do not bend to its will. Even our allies introduced earlier this year - at the height of the pandemic - emergency export restrictions over much needed medical equipment in order to provide for their own citizens to the detriment of neighbors in need.These facts should serve as an important reminder to the United States that the security of domestic supply chains is essential, and it must be regained because the basic political and economic unit should always remain the nation-state. Indeed, the protection of American citizens requires that the United States' vulnerable supply chains be strengthened, and a major component of supply chain resiliency must be reshoring. But how can the United States reverse the excessive offshoring that has occurred over the course of the past 40 years?The problem is complex, but it can be solved through a whole-of-Government approach. That is, if we collectively are prepared to tackle difficult policy questions, even those that may run counter to long-held economic biases. To the extent that those biases once formed policies that incentivized critical industries to offshore, then logically they need to be revised or reversed.Understanding what has led to the degradation of our supply chains, then it stands to reason that a comprehensive reshoring strategy must remedy those causes. At the outset, the United States must systematically and routinely identify all products, goods, and technologies that are critical to national security to address the country's dependency on imports from strategic competitors, whether in a time of war, cyber-attack, pandemic or other national emergency. This Administration - my office in particular on behalf of the White House - has begun doing this. We need to continue this on a permanent basis. An additional component here is measuring the flow of technology if it is now as equally as important, and in many instances more important, than the traditional "national security good."A second essential component of a reshoring strategy is incentivizing inward investments in domestic manufacturing and R&D activities. We have begun doing this to boost innovation and economic growth through tax cuts. A whole-of-Government approach, in partnership with Congress, will continue to make this effort successful.Third, we have in our arsenal of tools powerful U.S. Government procurement authority, including the Defense Production Act authority, to provide capital to new American investments and also as a tool to generate demand, through U.S. Government purchases, for national security-related items that are produced within the United States. Reliance on Government procurement authority is what will compel many companies to take a leap of faith and re-invest in the United States. This is an important tool that we are using and should be empowered to use even more.Fourth, it is, of course, axiomatic that U.S. investments must be encouraged to grow to commercial scale in order to compete against more mature foreign competitors. Further, an industry's commercial viability will generate robust upstream and downstream supply chains, draw in new market entrants to enhance production efficiency and moderate prices, attract greater private sector investments, and encourage competition to accelerate R&D. These are the fundamental building blocks of a resilient domestic supply chain.Finally, we have the ability to increase exports of all U.S. firms - including those that re-shore to the United States - through trade agreements. We have begun to increase exports thorough the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement and the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement, and we should continue to encourage greater exports through new trade deals.With the support of Congress, we can build the strongest supply chain in the world, enhance our comparative advantage with allies, and create an ecosystem where market-based principles prevail and market distortions are eliminated. We have begun doing this; we can do more together, which is why this hearing is so important.Historically, through times of adversity, the United States has led the world out of war and economic turbulence into recovery. And now too, the world will look to the United States to lead the way in solving today's supply chain challenges. It should not be forgotten that the global economy of the 20th century was developed by the United States and, although China is aggressively seeking to shape the global economic order of the 21st century, it is not too late to act. While the United States remains the largest economic power in the world (a status that is not guaranteed as China's exponential growth continues), it has the ability and leverage to act in coordination with allies. Time is of the essence, and our supply chain vulnerabilities are too great to await another national security crisis that may expose this country to even more devastation and destruction.* * *Footnotes:1 Scott, Robert; Mokhiber, Zane, Economic Policy Institute, "Growing China Trade Deficit Cost 3.7 Million American Jobs Between 2001 and 2018," (Jan. 30, 2020) https://www.epi.org/publication/growing-china-trade-deficits-costs-us-jobs/; also Census Data and Department of Commerce calculations.2 Examples include Chinese government subsidies that constitute unlimited guarantees to corporations, subsidies to insolvent or ailing enterprises lacking credible restructuring plans (also known as "zombie" companies), subsidies that encourage global overcapacity, subsidies to firms unable to obtain long-term financing from independent commercial sources that are operating in sectors or industries in overcapacity, and direct debt forgiveness.3 Gold, Hadas, CNN, "Huawei to Build $1.2 Billion Cambridge Facility as It Faces Uncertain UK Future,"(June 25, 2020) https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/25/tech/huawei-cambridge-uk/index.html.4 European Chamber of Commerce, "European Chamber Report on China's Corporate Social Credit System, A Wake Up Call for European Businesses in China," (Aug. 28, 2019), https://www.europeanchamber.com.cn/en/press-releases/3045/european_chamber_report_on_china_s_corporate_social_credit_system_a_wake_up_call_for_european_business_in_china.5 Kamensky, Jack, China Business Review, "China's Participation in International Standards Setting: Benefits and Concerns for U.S. Industry," (Feb. 7, 2020) https://www.chinabusinessreview.com/chinas-participation-in-international-standards-setting-benefits-and-concerns-for-us-industry/.6 Department of Commerce calculations.7 Lin, Liza; Woo, Stu; Wei, Lingling, "China May Retaliate Against Nokia and Ericsson If EU Countries Move to Ban Huawei," Wall Street Journal (July 20, 2020), https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-may-retaliate-against-nokia-and-ericsson-if-eu-countries-move-to-ban-huawei-11595250557.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7198174 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: August 6, 2020End of Document

GOP Senator Drafting Bill to Block U.S. Companies From 'Giving In' to ChinaNewsweek.comJuly 19, 2020 Sunday 1:14 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 624 wordsByline: Benjamin FearnowHighlight: Louisiana Senator John Kennedy said Sunday he is drafting legislation to prohibit American companies from "giving in" to Chinese government rules on doing business.BodyRepublican Senator and financial services chair John Kennedy said he is drafting legislation to prohibit American companies from "giving in" to Chinese government rules on doing business.The Louisiana senator--who earlier this year introduced the CONFUCIUS Act aimed at reducing Chinese influence on U.S. campuses--said in a Fox News interview Sunday that he is drafting legislation to prevent U.S. companies from conducting business in China. He agreed with U.S. Attorney General William Barr's comments last week that U.S. companies routinely agree to censor films and conduct business under the authoritarian rules of the Chinese Communist Party."The Chinese people are wonderful people but their government, the Communist Party of China, is comprised of a bunch of outlaws, they are bullies, they understand only strength. If you're too nice to them, if you turn the other cheek, they just stab you in the neck," the GOP senator, who is also a member of the senate Budget and Judiciary committees, said during his appearance on Sunday Morning Futures."I'm working on a bill which will prohibit American companies from giving in to this bullying by the Communist Party of China. It would say basically if you give in to them, you violate American law. It's a delicate bill to draft but we're working on it. Barr's right," Kennedy continued.Speaking at the Gerald Ford Presidential Museum last week, Barr warned U.S. corporate executives against making deals with the Chinese government. He accused Cisco, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Apple and Disney by name as guilty of "bowing" to the communist leadership. "The ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States it is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards but in the end the PRC's goal is to replace you," Barr cautioned.Kennedy also ridiculed the National Basketball Association (NBA) for making any and all concessions China wants in order to promote business overseas."The NBA leadership is so greedy, so anxious to do business in China that they do whatever the Chinese Communist Party tells them to do. If the party told the leadership of the NBA to join the Taliban, the NBA leadership would say 'where's the line?'" the Louisiana senator said, calling the NBA the "poster child" for U.S. companies selling out American values.Newsweek reached out to both Kennedy's office and the NBA for additional remarks over the potential legislation aimed at restricting business with Chinese consumers.In March, Kennedy introduced and the Senate later passed the Concerns Over Nations Funding University Campus Institutes in the United States (CONFUCIUS) Act, which threatens to eliminate federal funding to schools with Chinese government partnerships."The Chinese Communist Party has rooted its propaganda in college campuses all over the U.S. We must return power to American students and teachers through the CONFUCIUS Act, which the Senate passed unanimously. Because of Reps. Donna Shalala and Anthony Gonzalez, the House now has the chance to do the same," Kennedy said of the CONFUCIUS Act, which has not proceeded forward in the House.Last week, Kennedy thanked India and its prime minister, Narendra Modi, for "standing up" to China over a border dispute.

Justice Department: Singaporean National Pleads Guilty to Acting in U.S. as Illegal Agent of Chinese IntelligenceTargeted News ServiceJuly 25, 2020 Saturday 9:17 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1086 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of Justice's National Security Division issued the following news release on July 24:Jun Wei Yeo, also known as Dickson Yeo, entered a plea of guilty today to one count of acting within the United States as an illegal agent of a foreign power without first notifying the Attorney General, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 951. Yeo's plea was entered via videoconference before the Honorable Tanya S. Chutkan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.The announcement was made by John G. Demers, Assistant Attorney General; Michael R. Sherwin, Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia; Timothy R. Slater, Assistant Director in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Washington Field Office; and Alan E. Kohler, Jr., Assistant Director of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division."The Chinese Government uses an array of duplicity to obtain sensitive information from unsuspecting Americans," said Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's National Security Division John C. Demers. "Yeo was central to one such scheme, using career networking sites and a false consulting firm to lure Americans who might be of interest to the Chinese government. This is yet another example of the Chinese government's exploitation of the openness of American society.""Today's guilty plea underscores the ways that the Chinese government continues to target Americans with access to sensitive government information, including using the Internet and non-Chinese nationals to target Americans who never leave the United States," said Michael R. Sherwin, Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. "We will continue to prosecute those who use deceptive practices on the Internet and elsewhere to undermine our national security.""At the direction of Chinese intelligence operatives, the defendant targeted U.S. government employees and an Army officer to obtain information for the government of China. Mr. Yeo admits he set up a fake consulting company to further his scheme, looked for susceptible individuals who were vulnerable to recruitment, and tried to avoid detection by U.S. authorities," said Alan E. Kohler Jr., Assistant Director of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division. "But this isn't just about this particular defendant. This case is yet another reminder that China is relentless in its pursuit of U.S. technology and policy information in order to advance its own interests. The FBI and our partners will be just as aggressive in uncovering these hidden efforts and charging individuals who break our laws.""Mr. Yeo admitted that he not only provided valuable information to Chinese intelligence, but also that he knowingly recruited others in the U.S. to do the same," said FBI Washington Field Office Assistant Director in Charge Timothy R. Slater. "The tactics Mr. Yeo used to target cleared individuals on professional networking social media sites are just one facet of the full court press China employs on a daily basis to obtain non-public U.S. government information. The FBI urges citizens, especially those holding security clearances, to be cautious when being approached by individuals on social media sites with implausible career opportunities. We are committed to holding those accountable who attempt to work for Chinese intelligence and other adversaries to the detriment of our national security.""The Diplomatic Security Service is firmly committed to working with the U.S. Attorney's Office and our other law enforcement partners to investigate allegations of crime and protect our national security," said Galen J. Nace, Deputy Assistant Director for Counterintelligence of the Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service (DSS).As outlined in the statement of offense, Yeo began working with Chinese intelligence officers as early as 2015, initially targeting other Asian countries, but then focusing on the United States. In response to taskings from his Chinese intelligence contacts, Yeo worked to spot and assess Americans with access to valuable non-public information, including U.S. military and government employees with high-level security clearances. After Yeo identified American targets, he solicited them for non-public information and paid them to write reports. Yeo told these American targets that the reports were for clients in Asia, without revealing that they were in fact destined for the Chinese government.Yeo made use of various social media sites to carry out the taskings given to him by Chinese intelligence operatives. In 2018, Yeo created a fake consulting company that used the same name as a prominent U.S. consulting firm that conducts public and government relations, and Yeo posted job advertisements under that company name. Ninety percent of the resumes Yeo received in response were from U.S. military and government personnel with security clearances, and he passed resumes of interest to one of the Chinese intelligence operatives.Yeo also used a professional networking website that is focused on career and employment information to carry out the taskings he received from Chinese intelligence officials. Yeo used the professional networking website to find individuals with resumes and job descriptions suggesting that they would have access to valuable information. After he identified individuals worth targeting, Yeo followed guidance he received from Chinese intelligence operatives regarding how to recruit potential targets, including identifying their vulnerabilities, such as dissatisfaction with work or financial difficulties.The maximum penalty for a violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 951 is ten years. The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes. The defendant's sentence will be determined by the court based on the advisory sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors. Sentencing is set for Oct. 9, 2020 before the Honorable Tanya S. Chutkan.The investigation into this matter was conducted by the FBI's Washington Field Office and DSS. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Thomas N. Saunders and Erik M. Kenerson of the National Security Section of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, along with David Aaron of the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section of the National Security Division. If you suspect you have been the target of a recruitment scheme, contact your local FBI Field Office.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7188073 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 25, 2020End of Document

Harvard's Chinese Community Must Speak Against China's AtrocitiesThe Harvard Crimson: Harvard UniversityJuly 8, 2020 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OP EDS; Pg. 1Length: 729 wordsBodyIn search of a ray of hope and optimism, I picked up a pen two months ago and shared with The Crimson the Chinese government's brutal treatment of my brother Ekpar Asat, a Uighur tech entrepreneur and philanthropist. My op-ed sparked conversations among the Harvard community, even grabbing the attention of human rights champion Ambassador and Professor Samantha J. Power. My brother's forced disappearance of over four years by the Chinese government prompted a global outcry within the Harvard legal community. Led by Diogo Santana Lopes and Kristin Zornada, more than 80 Harvard-educated lawyers from more than 50 countries rallied around me and issued letters demanding that the Chinese government unconditionally release my brother.Despite carrying the "Veritas" motto with me as a Harvard Law School graduate, I feared that by speaking out, I'd be doing my brother harm. Ekpar was targeted for participating in a prestigious State Department program as the founder and CEO of a multifaceted social media platform. I worried that any additional American connections would further jeopardize his well-being. Shining a light on the truth can be a matter of life and death when it comes to an authoritarian country like China. So I was deeply moved by the love and support of the Harvard community in response to my article.Many people questioned, however, why it seems Chinese Harvard affiliates are not speaking out for my brother, Ekpar. A few Chinese alumni and students did contact me to offer sympathy for my brother's situation. However, there could be many reasons why more have not. The Chinese education system discourages students from engaging in political discourse. Unfortunately, that deeply rooted belief is not easily erased, regardless of exposure to Western ideology and values. Chinese people may also fear that by speaking out, they'd be engaging in politics and therefore subject to potential harassment from the Chinese government.After the tragic death of George Floyd, many of us in America promised ourselves to be a part of the world where we choose speaking up over silence, action over inaction, love over hate, care over indifference, decency over discrimination. To truly achieve racial justice, we have to carry out the promise today, tomorrow, and onward.Racial injustice also exists in China, where over 1 million people are locked up in internment camps because of their ethnicities or religions. Without the support of the Chinese and Chinese Americans, it will be difficult to end this unspeakable repression and state terror. These groups can change the course of the Chinese government's crimes against humanity. Perhaps deliberately, the Chinese government singled out minority ethnic groups so that the majority would turn a blind eye on its oppression. Yet, as William Wilberforce, a campaigner who fought tirelessly against the slave trade in the U.K. so aptly put it: "You may choose to look the other way, but you can never say you did not know."In a recent op-ed published in The Crimson, Harvard undergraduates wrote: "We chose Harvard not just because it has the best education in the world, but also because it has the best people." China too, as a vast country, has some of the brightest people in the world. So, I appeal to the conscience of Chinese Harvard students, if you are one of these best people chosen by Harvard to carry its brand and legacy. Please speak out against your government's atrocities. If the entire Harvard Chinese community acts in solidarity, the Chinese government cannot punish them collectively. For a social movement to last longer than a fluttering moment and lead to success, the majority has to lend unyielding support.I call on Harvard's Chinese community to stand in solidarity with the Uighurs. Carry the "Veritas" torches of Harvard to shed light on racial injustice and fight against the unfolding genocide in China.Rayhan Asat is a graduate of Harvard Law School. .css-nuva7n-Is{font-size:16.5px;line-height:26px;box-sizing:content-box;max-width:600px;padding:0px 20px;margin:0px auto;margin:1em auto;}.css-nuva7n-Is a{color:#ba0600;}Want to keep up with breaking news?

U.S. CONTINUES CRACKDOWN ON ACADEMICS' TIES TO CHINESE COMMUNISTSStates News ServiceJuly 28, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 613 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Accuracy in Academia (AIA):Spencer Irvine, Leave a commentUnder the Trump administration, the U.S. federal government has cracked down on college professors and academic researchers who misused their positions to benefit the Chinese Communist Party-run government in China. Last week, federal prosecutors announced that they charged a visiting academic researcher with fraud on her visa application.Inside Higher Ed reported that Juan Tang, a visiting researcher at the University of California-Davis, was one of four academic researchers who lied on U.S. government student and research visa applications about their ties to the Chinese military. Tang, according to federal authorities, is currently a "fugitive from justice" from federal authorities and is allegedly housed at the Chinese consulate in San Francisco, California. The other three nationals are in U.S. custody and could face a ten-year prison sentence if convicted of visa fraud.In addition to Tang, the three others charged by federal authorities were visiting researchers Xin Wang at University of California-San Francisco, Chen Song at Stanford University, and Indiana University graduate student in machine learning and artificial intelligence Kaikai Zhao.The U.S. Department of Justice issued a press release and accused the four individuals of hiding their ties to the People's Liberation Army (PLA). Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers said, "These members of China's People Liberation Army applied for research visas while hiding their true affiliation with the PLA." He added, "This is another part of the Chinese Communist Party's plan to take advantage of our open society and exploit academic institutions. We will continue to conduct this investigation together with the FBI."Tang, who remains in hiding, is an active "uniformed officer of the PLA Air Force." She was employed at the PLA's Air Force Military Medical University, but when interviewed, she denied that she was a member of the PLA. The government has not outlined what information she stole from UCD as she remains at-large.Wang, according to the U.S. government, hid his fourteen years in the PLA working as an associate professor in medicine and was allegedly active as a PLA technician. During the course of the investigation, the U.S. government discovered that Wang duplicated research of one of his UCSF academic colleagues at a Chinese lab.Song allegedly lied on her application and claimed she was a neurologist while she was an active PLA operative. She also lied about her employer, which her application said was Xi Diaoyutai Hospital. Tang's military affiliation was with the PLA's Air Force and she was listed as an attending physician of the Department of Neurology of the PLA Air Force General Hospital. It was unclear which information she stole from Stanford.Zhao is an active employee of a PLA's "premier institution for scientific research and education," called the National University of Defense Technology. She attended the Chinese Communist equivalent to the U.S. Air Force Academy, which is the Aviation University of Air Force.The U.S. government has pursued ties between researchers and academics and the Chinese Communist Party government under the Trump administration. One of the more notable arrests was of a Harvard University department chair named Dr. Charles Lieber. Lieber was Harvard's chemistry department chair and he allegedly lied to the government about China's government paying him to pass along research and secrets. China allegedly paid him a $50,000-per-month salary and $158,000 in living expenses while working in China.Load-Date: July 28, 2020End of Document

Singaporean Man Pleads Guilty To Spying On Behalf Of China, Recruiting Agents Through Job Networking WebsitesThe Daily CallerJuly 24, 2020 Friday 07:08 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; usLength: 496 wordsByline: Chris White, Tech Reporter, chris@dailycallernewsfoundation.orgChris is a Missourian trying to find news angles in the blank spaces of life. Also go Chiefs!Author ImageBodyLink to ImageA Singaporean man pleaded guilty Friday to charges of spying on behalf of the Chinese government amid a crackdown on what officials describe as widespread Chinese espionage.Jun Wei Yeo worked as an unregistered agent of the Chinese government from 2015 until 2019, Axios reported Friday, citing a statement from prosecutors. Yeo's guilty plea comes amid a Department of Justice initiative designed to flesh out intellectual property theft in the U.S. and instances of Chinese espionage.“At the direction of Chinese intelligence operatives, the defendant targeted U.S. government employees and an Army officer to obtain information for the government of China,” Alan Kohler, Jr., assistant director for the FBI's counterintelligence division, said in a statement, according to Axios.“Mr. Yeo admits he set up a fake consulting company to further his scheme, looked for susceptible individuals who were vulnerable to recruitment, and tried to avoid detection by U.S. authorities,” Kohler added.(RELATED: Wray: FBI Opens A New Chinese Spy Investigation Every 10 Hours)China uses a variety of techniques to collect sensitive information on Americans, Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers said in a press statement, Axios reported.“Yeo was central to one such scheme, using career networking sites and a false consulting firm to lure Americans who might be of interest to the Chinese government. This is yet another example of the Chinese government's exploitation of the openness of American society,” he noted.Yeo was charged as an “illegal agent of a foreign power” under the same code used to charge Maria Butina in 2018 for serving on behalf of the Russian government, Axios reported. Butina allegedly attempted to infiltrate the National Rifle Association, among other groups, to advance Russia's interests before the 2016 presidential election, reports show.“This statute is for borderline spies,” Ben Freeman, director of the Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative at the Center for International Policy, told Axios. “The bottom line here is that the Department of Justice appears to believe Yeo was acting more as a spy than an unregistered lobbyist.”The Chinese government has a history of using job networking websites as recruiting tools, according to officials. Beijing uses LinkedIn “on a mass scale” to recruit current and former U.S. officials, William Evanina, the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, told The New York Times in 2019.“Instead of dispatching spies to the U.S. to recruit a single target, it's more efficient to sit behind a computer in China and send out friend requests to thousands of targets using fake profiles,” he said.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

China Cold Chain Logistics Market Overview and Outlook 2020-2026 - Market Size, Demand, Gross Capacity, Competitive Landscape, Market Structure, ProspectsPR NewswireJune 3, 2020 Wednesday 5:30 PM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1336 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, June 3, 2020 BodyPR NewswireThe"China Cold Chain Logistics Industry Report 2020-2026"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.The Chinese residents see a change in food consumption and there is a growing market demand for cold chain of food alongside the accelerating urbanization in China. Chinese governments at all levels beef up investments in cold chain infrastructure, facilitating enlargement of cold chain logistics.In 2019, the Chinese cold chain logistics market was worth RMB276.37 billion, growing an annual compound rate of 10.5% between 2010 and 2019. As China's policy and standards for cold chain becomes clear, fresh food e-commerce springs up and financial innovations are further made, the cold chain logistics industry of China will take a great leap forward and will be sized by RMB512.25 billion in 2026, showing a CAGR of 9.4% from 2019 to 2026.Cold chain logistics is driven primarily by meat, aquatic products, quick-frozen food, fruits & vegetables, and dairy products, among which the fruit & vegetable cold chain is now the largest market segment in terms of cold chain circulation, and aquatic products have a fast-growing demand for cold chain. What's more, medicines, particularly vaccines, blood products and diagnostic reagents will be a key growth driver for cold chain logistics.As concerns competition in cold chain logistics:Logistics operation: the majority of cold chain logistics operators are engaged in both cold storage and cold chain transportation, such as Xianyi Holdings, Swire Cold Chain Logistics, and ZM Logistics that boast huge cold storage capacity and strong transportation capability domestically.Cold storage operation: the Chinese cold storage market is scattered and characterized by low concentration and distinct regionality. The top ten cold storage operators had a total of cold warehousing capacity up to 25.15 million cubic meters in 2019, an about 17.3% share of the national total, and the typical companies are Xianyi Holdings, Swire Cold Chain Logistics, and China Merchants Americold, each of which enjoys a nationwide cold storage network.This report highlights the following:Cold chain logistics (definition, classification, composition, industry chain, market features, business models, industrial policy, etc.) Chinese cold chain logistics market (market size, demand, competitive landscape, market structure, prospects as well as the development in key areas including the Yangtze River Delta region, the Pearl River Delta region and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region) Cold chain logistics market segments (fruits & vegetables, meat, quick-frozen food made of wheat flour and rice, aquatic products, dairy products) Cold storage market (overview, gross capacity, regional analysis, competitive pattern, forecasts) Refrigerated vehicle market (overview, overall scale, regional analysis, competitive pattern, forecasts) 22 cold chain operators (profile, performance, revenue structure, cold chain business, development strategy, etc.)Key Topics Covered1.

US charges Chinese hackers for wide-ranging activities, including Covid research intrusionsCNN.comJuly 21, 2020 Tuesday 1:50 PM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 659 wordsByline: By David Shortell, CNNBodyUS prosecutors have charged two alleged Chinese hackers over a "sweeping global computer intrusion campaign" that they say was supported by the country's government and aimed at coronavirus treatment and vaccine research.The hackers have also allegedly targeted dissidents and human rights activists in the US, China and Hong Kong, as well as hundreds of businesses in more than 10 countries, as part of a 10-year-old campaign that amassed terabytes of stolen data, John Demers, the head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, said Tuesday.The accusations were included in an indictment returned earlier this month and unsealed in a Spokane, Washington, federal court Tuesday. They represent the first criminal charges against foreign hackers going after coronavirus research as the pandemic continues to rage across the world.One of the hackers, Li Xiaoyu, allegedly conducted electronic reconnaissance on at least four US-based companies that were publicly known to be working on coronavirus projects.According to the indictment, in late January, Li scanned for vulnerabilities in the networks of Maryland and Massachusetts biotechnology firms that were researching coronavirus vaccines. The next month, he targeted a California company that had just announced it was researching antiviral drugs to treat the virus. In May, Li took aim at a California diagnostics company that was developing coronavirus testing kits.Prosecutors did not allege that the hackers actually breached the networks or stole information from the American companies working on the coronavirus, although a senior Justice Department official noted that the searches for network weaknesses that Li is accused of doing are a standard precursor to an attempted hack.Li and another Chinese national, Dong Jiazhi, are charged with 11 federal counts including conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets and aggravated identity theft. The pair worked from China, where they are still believed to be located.While the indictment does not specify if the hackers had been working at the behest of the Chinese government as they targeted the coronavirus projects, senior national security officials have been warning of Chinese government attempts to steal coronavirus research from US institutions for months.Officials from the US, UK and Canada also said last week that Russian cyber actors were targeting organizations involved in coronavirus vaccine development.The indictment does allege that Li and Dong worked alongside a Chinese intelligence officer from a Guangdong outpost of the country's Ministry of State Security in other instances, including the theft of personal information of Chinese dissidents.The hackers provided the MSS officer with email accounts and passwords belonging to a Hong Kong community organizer, the pastor of a Christian church in China, and a dissident and former Tiananmen Square protestor, the indictment alleges.Much of the information stolen by the hackers from businesses across the globe -- comprising hundreds of victims, Justice Department officials said -- was also in line with the areas the Chinese government has said they wanted to advance.The Trump administration has blasted the Chinese government for a campaign of economic espionage and intellectual property theft to achieve those goals, and in the indictment, Li and Dong are accused of stealing information regarding military satellite programs and high-powered microwave and laser systems from defense contractors, among other defense technology.The indictment also marks the first time that the US is accusing the Chinese government of propping up the hackers as they conduct their own work unrelated to any government taskings."China has now taken its place alongside Russia, Iran and North Korea in that shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cyber criminals in exchange for those criminals being on-call for the benefit of the state," Demers said.Load-Date: July 21, 2020End of Document

CONGRESSWOMAN LIZ CHENEY NEWSLETTER: JULY 10THStates News ServiceJuly 10, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1283 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney:On this day 130 years ago, Wyoming was admitted as the 44th state in our Union. The Cowboy State continues to be unmatched not only for its beauty but also for our great people. Happy birthday Wyoming!Expanding Access To Telehealth Services For Seniors:The spread of COVID-19 has created unprecedented challenges for all Americans, one being the facilitation of a safe environment for our seniors to receive high quality health care. Increasing access to telehealth services, especially in our rural communities, has literally been a lifesaver for America's seniors since the first outbreak of COVID-19.To ensure that seniors continue to have access to these critical services, I introduced the Advancing Telehealth Beyond COVID-19 Act, legislation that will continue the telehealth policies implemented by the Trump Administration and through the CARES Act. This bill will allow seniors to utilize telehealth services even after the emergency declaration has ended.Congress has worked with the Trump Administration to remove many of the barriers that prevented seniors from utilizing telehealth services from the safety of their homes. As a result, telehealth use among seniors has continued to rise and this legislation would continue this successful trend well after the pandemic is over, while allowing Medicare to adapt to the ever-changing innovation in medical technology. Click here to learn more.PILT Distributions Announced For Wyoming Communities:Last week, the Department of the Interior announced the 2020 Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) distributions.

No American should ever be compelled by the government to violate their religious beliefs, but that's exactly what was happening to The Little Sisters of the Poor because of unconstitutional mandates in Obamacare.I proudly joined my colleagues in signing an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to restore the Little Sisters of the Poor's constitutional rights, and applaud the Court for doing just that. The Supreme Court's decision, upholding religious and conscience protections adopted by the Trump administration, is a victory for religious freedom and for the First Amendment.Paycheck Protection Program Extended:Wyoming small business owners: The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) has been extended until August 8th to help keep workers on payroll.

Watch my remarks below:REP. LIZ CHENEY: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I also oppose this amendment. As Mr. Turner has said, we can go over all of the issues that we debate about the triad, certainly I disagree with Mr. Khanna's characterization of the experts, the so-called expert's view on the triad. But I would also point out what Mr. Khanna has suggested what we do is take a billion dollars out of funding for the GBSD and allocate that money to pandemic preparedness. Now this is, I suppose, something that he's done to try to say that there's a cause that's greater than our nuclear deterrent. I think it's important, first of all, to point out we have allocated significant resources to pandemic response, to pandemic relief, to ensuring that we are providing the kind of support this country needs to begin to recover from the pandemic and also to ensure that we're protecting ourselves from these kinds of things in the future.But there's one fundamental issue that is missing in this discussion and that is China. The extent to which the Chinese government, the Chinese Communist Party, is directly responsible for the deaths that we've seen in the United States and around the world, directly responsible for the economic devastation. They caused this pandemic to be spread globally, and when I say they caused it to be spread globally, I say that because they knew that they had human-to-human transmission and they stopped travel from Wuhan to the rest of China but they allowed travel from Wuhan into the world. They knew what they were doing and instead of coming together to hold China accountable, which is what we ought to be doing, which is what we, the Republicans, asked Speaker Pelosi and others to do, to join with us on our task force to hold the Chinese government accountable for this death and devastation. Instead, my colleague Mr. Khanna is proposing an amendment cutting a billion dollars out of our nuclear forces. This amendment helps China, this amendment helps America's adversaries. The people that would benefit from this amendment are the people that want to see the United States unilaterally disarm, and that is the government of China. It is absolutely shameful in my view.This is a time that we need to be clearer than ever before that we are going to put the resources behind modernizing our nuclear forces, our adversaries are doing it, the government of China is doing it. We are falling behind, and I don't think the Chinese government, frankly, could imagine in their wildest dreams that they would have been able to get a member of the United States Congress to propose, in response to the pandemic, that we ought to cut a billion dollars out of our nuclear forces. It is more than they could have imagined. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and I yield back.Pelosi's Partisanship Is Fundamentally Hurting The People Of This Country:Instead of working together to build solutions, Speaker Pelosi's partisanship is fundamentally hurting the people of this country. Earlier this month, I highlighted the failed leadership of Speaker Pelosi for continuing to pursue partisan legislation instead of working with Republicans to solve the challenges facing the American people.

Donald forces China to close its consulate in Houston, TexasCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 23, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 783 wordsBodyWashington. - U.S. President Donald Trump forced China to close its consulate in Houston, Texas amid new accusations of espionage, to which the Asian giant responded with the promise that it will retaliate if the U.S. fails to back down.It is one of the most aggressive actions the U.S. has taken since establishing diplomatic relations with China in 1979.Speaking to Efe on Wednesday, a U.S. State Department spokesman has been in the past. But it'snot the first time He denounced the existence of a pattern of espionage and theft of intellectual property by the Chinese government and assured that the closure of the consulate in Houston seeks to protect Americans."The People's Republic of China has been engaged for years in massive illegal espionage operations across the U.S. against U.S. officials and citizens. These activities have increased markedly in scale and scope in recent years," said the spokesman.WHY HOUSTON?That source, however, refused to explain why the U.S. decided to close the Houston consulate and did not explain why he chose that diplomatic headquarters.Until now, China had five consutados in the U.S., located in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Houston. The latter covered eight of the nation's 50states: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas,according to the Chinese embassy website in Washington.Officially, the US and its allies have been in the world But it'snot the first time it has not clarified why it acted against the Houston consulate, but a government official told Efe that Washington has information that Beijing had attempted to steal information from the energy sector companies and NASA, which are based there.The Chinese consulate in Houston was on a list that the U.S. had prepared to punish China for alleged espionage, detailed that official, who asked not to be identified because he was not allowed to speak publicly of the matter.BURNED PAPERS IN THE CONSULATE COURTYARDAlthough the movement was ready, the U.S. did not announce the closure until after China denounced it.The first sign that the U.S. had given that order came about 20.00 local time on Tuesday (01.00 GMT Wednesday), when local Houston network KPRC2 began issuing images of people burning documents in the Chinese consulate courtyard.Local police and firefighters flocked to the vicinity of the building, alerted by the smoke and calls from neighbors, according to the KPRC2 network.A policeman told the Houston Chronicle that neighbors claim to have seen Chinese officials burning documents on what appeared to be trash cans.Please note that the consulate staff, about 60 people, must leave the building by Friday, July 24, by U.S. order.CHINA DEMANDS U.S. TO RECTIFYFor its part, China has considered the closure of the consulate to be a "unprecedented" provocation and has promised that there will be retaliation if the US and the United States is not a good place to do so. But it'snot the first time does not rectify."We ask the U.S. to retract this wrong decision, or else China will take the necessary legitimate retaliation," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin, who considered the closure of the consulate "in such a short period of time" to be "an unprecedented increase in The actions that China has taken against China."The Chinese governmenthas not revealed what retaliation it is assessing; but the Global Times has raised on Twitter the possibility of China reacting with the closure of one of the U.S. consulates and explicitly citing the options of Hong Kong, Macau, Guangzhou or Chengdu.Another possibility would be the closure of the American consulate in the Chinese city of Wuhan as the "brother" consulate of Houston.In total, in addition to the embassy in Beijing, the U.S. has consulates in four cities in mainland China (Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Shenyang), as well as another in Hong Kong serving that city and Macau.NEW CHAPTER IN THE COLD WARTrump, who is in re-election in the November election, has repeatedly blamed China for the pandemic and in recent weeks has imposed several sanctions on the Asian giant.This week, the U.S. has already sanctioned eleven Chinese companies for abuses of Muslim minorities in China's northwestern region of Xinjiang, and also filed charges against two Chinese "hackers" allegedly attempting to steal vaccine data for COVID-19 and military technology secrets.The background to the differences between the two powers is the underlying struggle over hegemony, technological and trade warfare, and, more recently, U.S. criticism of the new security law for Hong Kong and the human rights situation of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.Load-Date: July 24, 2020End of Document

China Charges US With 'Malicious Slander' After State Department Forced Houston Consulate To CloseThe Daily CallerJuly 23, 2020 Thursday 07:22 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; worldLength: 573 wordsByline: Neil Shah, Contributor, neil.dcnf@gmail.comBodyLink to ImageChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a press briefing on Thursday that “malicious slander” motivated the forceful shutdown of the Houston Chinese consulate on Wednesday.Wenbin said during a press briefing in China that the shutdown “violates international law and basic norms governing international relations,” and “seriously undermines China-U.S. relations,” the Associated Press reported.The U.S. State Department ordered the consulate to shut down earlier this week, according to The Daily Caller. Houston authorities reportedly had to respond after there were reports of smoke billowing out of the consulate courtyard due to open trash cans containing burning documents, local outlets reported.State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement emailed to The Daily Caller News Foundation that the U.S. government ordered the closure “in order to protect American intellectual property and American's private information.”Ortagus said that the U.S. “will not tolerate the [People's Republic of China's] violations of our sovereignty and intimidation of our people, just as we have not tolerated the [People's Republic of China's] unfair trade practices, theft of American jobs, and other egregious behavior.”Wenbin condemned the State Department's action Wednesday, claiming it was “political provocation” and an “outrageous and unjustified move which will sabotage China-US relations.”Hua Chunying, another Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said on Twitter Wednesday that China will respond with “firm #countermeasures”: The #US should revoke its erroneous decision. China will surely react with firm #countermeasures. - Hua Chunying 华春莹 (@SpokespersonCHN) July 22, 2020 The Chinese consulate shutdown comes during a time when the U.S.-China economic trade war is escalat ing, and heavy criticisms are being levied at China by U.S. officials.Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse, who sits on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, criticized the Chinese government in June for arresting Tsinghua University law professor Xu Zhangrun, an outspoken critic of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) who has published widely shared essays critical of the CCP.China has also faced criticism from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for its newly imposed national security law in Hong Kong, which purportedly seeks to stabilize the region, but in effect curtails freedom of speech and citizens' abilities to protest injustices they face under Chinese rule.(RELATED: China Sends Tanks to India's Borders In Deadly Standoff)China has also faced pushback from the U.S. over its alleged efforts to steal information about highly sensitive technologies from scientific research being conducted at U.S. institutions of higher education. Ohio Senator Rob Portman proposed bipartisan legislation last month, the Safeguarding American Innovation Act, which gives the State Department greater authority to deny visas and introduces measures to prevent foreigners from gaining access to sensitive technologies.China has also received criticism from President Donald Trump and others for its mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic that originated in Wuhan, China.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

CHINA: NO JUSTICE FOR TIANANMEN EMBOLDENS ABUSESStates News ServiceJune 1, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1069 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:31 Years Since Crackdown, Domestic Repression Worsens, Goes GlobalThe Chinese government should accept responsibility for the massacre of an untold number of peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators around June 4, 1989, Human Rights Watch said today. The authorities should cease all harassment of families of victims and activists for commemorating the occasion and censorship of discussions of the crackdown."China's government never paid a price at home or abroad for the Tiananmen Massacre, encouraging its arbitrary detention of millions, repression of civil society, and weakening of international human rights law and institutions," said Yaqiu Wang, China researcher. "Governments need to take stronger measures to pressure Beijing to acknowledge past wrongdoing and cease ongoing abuses."As in previous years, in the weeks before the anniversary, authorities have been on high alert across China to preempt commemorations of the massacre. Authorities have put under house arrest or restricted the movement and communication of members of Tiananmen Mothers, a group of relatives of Tiananmen Massacre victims, including Zhang Xianling, 82, and Ding Zilin, 83, whose sons were killed in the crackdown. The police have also put many activists, including Gao Yu, Hu Jia, Zha Jianguo, and Qi Zhiyong, under house arrest and prohibited them from communicating with others or updating their social media accounts.The last person known to be imprisoned for his involvement in the 1989 protests was released in October 2016. But many who took part in the demonstrations and continued their activism after their release have been re-incarcerated. Among them, Huang Qi, prominent activist and founder of the human rights website 64 Tianwang, is serving a 12-year sentence after being convicted in 2019 of "illegally providing state secrets abroad." Writers Liu Xianbin and Chen Xi, detained since 2010 and 2011 respectively, have been serving 10-year sentences on "inciting subversion" charges.Chen Bing, sentenced to three-and-a-half-years in prison in 2019 for commemorating the massacre, was released in January 2020. Chen Wei, Chen Bing's twin brother, was released in February after serving nine years in prison on charges of "inciting subversion." The authorities continue to harass and restrict the brothers' movements.The severe repression inside China has made commemoration of the Tiananmen Massacre increasingly difficult. However, Chinese activists in Canada, Germany, Taiwan, the United States, and other countries continue to hold discussions and memorials. Recently, the police in China harassed mainland activists who participated in online activities organized by Chinese abroad.For the first time in 30 years there will be no vigil for the massacre in either Hong Kong or Macau. Both former colonies banned the vigil, citing Covid-19 related concerns. The event in Hong Kong is usually attended by tens of thousands of people. The two cities have been promised autonomy but in recent years, respect for the basic rights and freedoms of their populations has significantly declined.The Chinese government continues to ignore international and domestic calls for justice for the Tiananmen Massacre, and sanctions that the US government imposed in response to the massacre have over the years been weakened or evaded. The lack of a broad and meaningful international response to the massacre and ensuing crackdown helps explain Beijing's increasingly brazen abuses, including the continuing mass detention of an estimated one million Turkic Muslims, the weeks-long cover up of the Covid-19 outbreak, and, most recently, the direct imposition of national security legislation on Hong Kong contrary to the Basic Law. Instead of acknowledging and addressing its abysmal human rights record, Beijing has tried to present itself as a leader at the United Nations Human Rights Council.The Tiananmen Massacre was precipitated by the peaceful gatherings of students, workers, and others in Beijing's Tiananmen Square and other Chinese cities in April 1989, calling for freedom of expression, accountability, and an end to corruption. The government responded to the intensifying protests in late May 1989 by declaring martial law.On June 3 and 4, the military opened fire and killed untold numbers of peaceful protesters and bystanders. In Beijing, some citizens attacked army convoys and burned vehicles in response to the military's violence. Following the killings, the government implemented a national crackdown and arrested thousands for "counter-revolution" and other criminal charges, including disrupting social order and arson.The government has never accepted responsibility for the massacre or held any officials legally accountable for the killings. It has been unwilling to conduct an investigation into the events or release data on those who were killed, injured, forcibly disappeared, or imprisoned. The nongovernmental organization Tiananmen Mothers, consisting mostly of family members of those killed, has established the details of 202 people who were killed during the suppression of the movement in Beijing and other cities.The government of President Xi Jinping should mark the 31st anniversary of June 4, 1989 by addressing the human rights violations pertaining to the event. Specifically, the government should:Respect the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly, and cease the harassment and arbitrary detention of individuals who challenge the official account of June 4;Meet with and apologize to members of the Tiananmen Mothers, publish the names of all who died, and appropriately compensate the victims' families;Permit an independent public inquiry into June 4, and promptly release its findings and conclusions to the public;Allow the unimpeded return of Chinese citizens, exiled due to their connections to the events of 1989; andInvestigate all government and military officials who planned or ordered the unlawful use of lethal force against peaceful demonstrators, and appropriately prosecute them."Despite extraordinary persecution, human rights activists across China continue to follow the spirit of 1989 and push for democracy and freedom in the country," Wang said. "Governments around the world need to support them, learn from them, and stand up to the Chinese government's abuses."Load-Date: June 2, 2020End of Document

US orders closure of Chinese consulate in HoustonCNN.comJuly 22, 2020 Wednesday 10:16 PM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 941 wordsByline: By James Griffiths and Nicole Gaouette, CNNBodyThe United States government has abruptly ordered China to "cease all operations and events" at its consulate in Houston, Texas, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, in what it called an "unprecedented escalation" in recent actions taken by Washington.Late Tuesday evening, police in Houston said they responded to reports of smoke in the courtyard outside the consulate, located on Montrose Boulevard, in the city's Midtown area. Local media shared video of what appeared to be officials inside the compound burning documents.US State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said the consulate was directed to close "in order to protect American intellectual property and Americans' private information" but did not immediately provide additional details of what prompted the closure. Chinese media reported that the consulate had been given 72 hours to close.Relations between China and the United States have plummeted in the past year, amid an ongoing trade war, the coronavirus pandemic, and US criticism of China's human rights abuses in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.A spokesperson for the State Department said in a separate statement that China "has engaged for years in massive illegal spying and influence operations" and that those "activities have increased markedly in scale and scope over the past few years."The State Department has not clarified what, if any, particular incident triggered the US demand to close the embassy or when it made that demand.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was just in Europe rallying leaders to take a harder line with Beijing and meeting with exiled Chinese dissidents, declined to offer details about the decision in remarks Wednesday. But the top US diplomat is set to deliver remarks on China on Thursday at the Richard Nixon Museum and Library in California.Move comes a day after US charged alleged Chinese hackersOn Tuesday, US prosecutors charged two alleged Chinese hackers over a "sweeping global computer intrusion campaign" that they say was supported by the country's government and aimed at coronavirus treatment and vaccine research. The indictment also marks the first time that the US has accused the hackers of working on behalf of the Chinese government.Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said the accusation was like a "thief accusing others to be the thief," in a press briefing on Wednesday, and charged that the US "has been engaging in the largest cyberattacks activities in the world."In a statement posted on its official social media, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said the order to close the consulate was a "political provocation unilaterally launched by the US side, which seriously violates international law, basic norms governing international relations and the bilateral consular agreement between China and the US."The Chinese Foreign Ministry condemned the decision and urged the United States to withdraw it.The statement goes on to say the US has been "shifting the blame to China with stigmatization and unwarranted attacks against China's social system, harassing Chinese diplomatic and consular staff in the US, intimidating and interrogating Chinese students and confiscating their personal electrical devices, even detaining them without cause."It added "China is committed to the principle of non-interference. Infiltration and interference is never in the genes and tradition of China's foreign policy."When asked about the closures on Wednesday, Pompeo said US officials had set "our clear expectations for how the Chinese Communist Party is going to behave.""And when they don't, we're going to take actions that protect the American people, protect our security, our national security, and also protect our economy and jobs," he said.Ortagus's statement earlier Wednesday said, "The United States will not tolerate the PRC's (People Republic of China) violations of our sovereignty and intimidation of our people, just as we have not tolerated the PRC's unfair trade practices, theft of American jobs, and other egregious behavior. President Trump insists on fairness and reciprocity in US-China relations."Rubio claims consulate was a 'central node of the Communist Party's vast network of spies'Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the acting chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, wrote on Twitter Wednesday that closing China's consulate in Houston "needed to happen," and claimed it is a "central node of the Communist Party's vast network of spies."Sen. Angus King, an independent of Maine who caucuses with Democrats, told CNN's John Berman on "New Day" Wednesday he was not aware of any "recent intelligence of particular Chinese activities, either with regard to our elections, or the whole confrontation between our two countries -- theft of intellectual property" that may have driven the decision."There certainly is a good reason to confront China. My concern is, escalating this tension, is it really about confronting China, or does it have something to do with an election in four months?" King, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said.On Twitter, Hu Xijin, editor of the state-backed tabloid Global Times with strong ties to China's Communist Party, said that Beijing had been given 72 hours to close the consulate. "This is a crazy move," he added.According to a statement on its website, the Houston consulate covers eight southern US states, including Texas and Florida, as well as Puerto Rico. It was the "was the first (consulate) to be established" in 1979 after the US and China established diplomatic relations, though a liaison office was already operating in Washington, DC, at that time.Load-Date: July 22, 2020End of Document

ROB'S RUNDOWN: WEEK OF JUNE 8 JUNE 12, 2020States News ServiceJune 12, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 7744 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Ohio Senator Rob Portman:This week the Senate continued to consider Senator Portman's bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act, which is tentatively scheduled for final passage next week. Portman gave remarks urging his colleagues to support the legislation on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. The Restore Our Parks Act will support more than 100,000 jobs over the next five years by rebuilding critical park infrastructure by helping to address the more than $12 billion backlog in long-delayed maintenance projects at throughout the National Park system.During Tuesday's Senate Finance Committee Hearing, Portman highlighted his $450 return-to-work bonus proposal to incentivize individuals to safely return to the workplace, which will be critical to a robust economic recovery as we safely begin to reopen.As Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), released a new bipartisan report detailing how the federal government provided little-to-no oversight of Chinese state-owned telecommunications carriers operating in the United States for nearly 20 years. Because of Portman's PSI investigation, the FBI and the Justice Department have since taken more aggressive action to respond to the national security threat these telecoms pose d in terms of cybersecurity and economic espionage.Finally, during a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, Portman urged Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) officials to bring production of personal protection equipment (PPE) back to the United States. He also pushed officials to expand COVID-19 testing capacity in Ohio.For a more detailed look at Senator Portman's week, please see the following:Monday, June 8, 2020On Senate Floor, Portman Highlights How Bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act Will Support More Than 100,000 Jobs and Rebuild Park InfrastructurePortman highlighted his bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act currently under consideration on the Senate floor this week, which will support more than 100,000 jobs over the next five years. The bill will help rebuild our parks infrastructure by addressing the nearly $12 billion backlog in long-delayed maintenance projects at the National Park Service (NPS). The Restore Our Parks Act is a part of a broader package, the Great American Outdoors Act -- landmark bipartisan legislation to address the deferred maintenance backlog across the federal land management agencies and to provide permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund.Portman has pushed the Senate to pass the Restore Our Parks Act over the last several years. The bill will establish the National Park Service Legacy Restoration Fund to reduce the maintenance backlog by allocating half of the existing unobligated revenues the government receives from on and offshore energy development up to $1.3 billion per year for the next five years. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved the bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act in November 2019. Portman worked with his colleagues to expand the Restore Our Parks Act to address the more than $18 billion in deferred maintenance backlog across all land management agencies in the Great American Outdoors Act . This legislation now provides $1.9 billion per year for five years into the "National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration Fund" from half of unobligated on and offshore energy revenues. Last week, Portman announced that a new National Parks Service (NPS) study of the Restore Our Parks legislation found that the legislation will support an average of 40,300 direct jobs and a total of 100,100 direct and indirect jobs over the next five years to help address the delayed maintenance backlog and rebuild our national parks infrastructure.Portman thanked his cosponsors, U.S. Senators Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Mark Warner (D-VA), and Angus King (I-ME) for their work on the legislation and President Trump for his support of this legislative effort.A transcript of his remarks is here and a video can be found here:Portman, Bipartisan Colleagues Urge Top Health Officials to Swiftly Distribute Emergency COVID-19 Funds to Hospitals Serving Low-Income, Vulnerable PopulationsPortman joined Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), and a bipartisan group of senators in requesting that the Administration act swiftly to distribute the second tranche of emergency funding allocated in COVID-19 spending packages to hospitals that overwhelmingly serve Medicaid and low-income patients. Portman has made clear that the Administration must do a better job of quickly distributing funding for safety net hospitals and providers, speaking out in April when other hospitals and health care providers received the first tranche of COVID-19 response funding while safety net provider funding was initially delayed.Under normal circumstances, these hospitals face high-uncompensated care costs and bring in significantly lower revenue than other hospitals; the pandemic has severely exacerbated these disparities. The senators' letter also noted that the patients these hospitals serve face underlying health conditions, barriers to quality health care, and limited access to fundamental social determinants of health, meaning they're at higher risk of contracting COVID-19. Without adequate federal funding, these hospitals will be unable to effectively treat the country's most vulnerable communities."To date, the distribution methodology used by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has not sufficiently addressed the needs of hospitals and health providers who disproportionately serve Medicaid and low-income patients ," the senators wrote. " We are concerned about the future financially viability of our hospitals who help care for the sickest, lowest-income, and costliest patients. These hospitals stand at the frontlines of our health care system for many of our disadvantaged communities and operate on razor thin margins under the best of circumstances... If we are to implement a successful comprehensive national response to COVID-19, we cannot leave anyone behind . Our safety net hospitals currently lack the funding they need to effectively treat the nation's most vulnerable families and individuals ."The letter was also signed by John Boozman (R-AR), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), David Perdue (R-GA), Doug Jones (D-AL), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Mark Warner (D-VA), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Martha McSally (R-AZ), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) and Tina Smith (D-MN).A copy of the letter can be found here and here.Tuesday, June 9, 2020Portman, Carper: Bipartisan Report Reveals How Three Chinese Government-Owned Telecoms Operated in the U.S. for Nearly 20 Years with Little-to-No Oversight from the Federal GovernmentSenators Rob Portman and Tom Carper (D-DE), the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), released a new bipartisan report detailing how the federal government provided little-to-no oversight of Chinese state-owned telecommunications carriers operating in the United States for nearly twenty years. As demonstrated in recent PSI investigations, China routinely exploits the American education and scientific research sectors to further its national interest and engages in cyber-attacks against U.S. companies, like Equifax and Marriott. This report reveals how the telecommunications industry has been similarly targeted.In May 2019, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) denied China Mobile USA's application to provide international telecommunications services. The FCC found that because of its Chinese government ownership, allowing China Mobile USA to operate in the United States would create an unacceptable risk to our national security. This marked the first instance in which the FCC denied an application on national security grounds.The Subcommittee reviewed three other Chinese government-owned telecom companies, all authorized by the FCC to provide similar services China Mobile USA applied (and was denied permission) to provide. The Subcommittee's year-long investigation found that the FCC and "Team Telecom" an informal group comprised of officials from the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and Defense have failed to monitor these three Chinese government-owned carriers. China Telecom Americas, China Unicom Americas, and ComNet USA have been operating in the United States since the early 2000s. The Subcommittee's report documents how Team Telecom had little engagement with China Telecom Americas and ComNet USA, until recently. Team Telecom has only visited the two carriers twice in more than a decade. The Subcommittee also found that Team Telecom had no oversight of or interaction with China Unicom Americas since the FCC authorized it to provide international telecom services in 2002."This bipartisan report demonstrates that federal agencies have done little to protect the integrity of U.S. telecommunications networks and counter national security threats from China," said Senator Portman. "The Chinese Communist Party uses its state-owned enterprises to further its cyber and economic espionage efforts against the United States, and they've been exploiting our telecommunications networks for nearly two decades while the federal government historically put in little effort to stop it. In recent months, and in response to this investigation, the federal government has begun to do more, including an important Executive Order by the President to ensure foreign-owned carriers are properly monitored and reviewed. I am encouraged by these efforts, and I look forward to working with Senator Carper on legislation to ensure federal agencies have the oversight and enforcement tools necessary to protect our telecommunications networks going forward."Portman Announces that Ohio Receives $8.5 Million of Department of Labor Dislocated Worker Grants Due to COVID-19Portman announced that the U.S. Department of Labor awarded Ohio $8.5 million in funding for Disaster Recovery Dislocated Worker Grants (DWGs) to help address the workforce-related impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. These grants are funded through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act which Portman supported. Portman released the following statement:"This $8.5 million grant is good news for the people of Ohio," said Portman . "As we continue to safely reopen these funds will help displaced workers around the state get the training they need to find meaningful employment. Ultimately, this grant will help us restart our economy by getting Ohioans back to work. I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure Ohioans have the resources they need during these uncertain times."At Hearing, Portman Urges HHS Officials to Bring PPE Production Back to America and Increase COVID-19 Testing Capacity in OhioAt a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, Portman asked Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) officials how they plan to bring back production of personal protection equipment (PPE) to the United States. Portman has been instrumental in helping to facilitate PPE production in Ohio-based companies, including helping secure approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow Cleveland-based SecondBreath to begin producing ventilators for shipment across Ohio and the country; facilitating a donation by Dublin-based Cardinal Health of 2.2 million non-surgical gowns to the federal government's Strategic National Stockpile; and encouraging U.S. Trade Representative Bob Lighthizer to implement key tariff exclusions necessary for Gojo in Akron to be able to distribute larger quantities of Purell hand sanitizer, a key tool in slowing the spread of the virus.Portman also urged HHS officials to work to bring more COVID-19 testing machines to Ohio. Portman has continuously said that in order to reopen the economy and create peace of mind for individuals to return to the workplace and retail establishments, Ohio must have an adequate amount of testing to track the virus in addition to continued work on anti-viral medications, vaccines, and increased personal protection equipment for health care providers.Excerpts of Portman's questioning can be found here.Portman Announces $26 Million in CARES Act HUD Grants to Help Fund the Housing Choice Voucher Program Across OhioPortman announced that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded cities across Ohio $26 million in Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG). These grants are a supplemental allocation of ESG-CV2 funds as authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act which Portman supported. This is the second allocation of CARES Act funding through the ESG program (ESG-CV2). These special funds are to be used to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the coronavirus pandemic among individuals and families who are homeless or receiving homeless assistance.Today's announcement builds on last week's announcement of $26 million in ESG-CV2 grant funding. Portman has long focused on ensuring Ohioans have affordable housing and is currently championing the bipartisan Evictions Crisis Act which will help to address the national housing crisis that is undermining the efforts of millions of Americans to rise into the middle class. The bipartisan legislation will shed light on the root causes of the eviction crisis, reduce preventable evictions, and limit the devastation to families when eviction is unavoidable. More than 75 national and Ohio based housing, civil rights, and homelessness groups have announced their strong support for the Eviction Crisis Act. Portman released the following statement:"These HUD grants will help Housing Authorities across Ohio that are struggling to keep up with growing housing expenses during this ongoing coronavirus pandemic," said Portman . "I've long believed we must address homelessness and increase the supply of housing so Ohioans can reach their God-given potential and I'm glad these grants will help public housing authorities assist individuals and families during this crisis. I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure Ohioans have the resources they need during these uncertain times."Portman Applauds Administration for Swiftly Distributing $10 Billion in Emergency COVID-19 Funds to Hospitals Serving Low-Income, Vulnerable PopulationsPortman applauded the Trump Administration for acting swiftly in distributing $10 billion in additional emergency funding allocated in COVID-19 spending packages to hospitals that overwhelmingly serve Medicaid and low-income patients. Yesterday, Portman and a group of bipartisan colleagues sent a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) urging them to act quickly and equitably in distributing funding to vulnerable populations. Portman has made clear that the Administration must do a better job of quickly distributing funding for safety net hospitals and providers, speaking out in April when other hospitals and health care providers received the first tranche of COVID-19 response funding while safety net provider funding was initially delayed."Support for our safety net hospitals is long overdue, and I'm pleased that HHS quickly responded to our request to distribute this essential COVID-19 emergency response funding to hospitals serving predominantly Medicaid and low-income patients," said Portman. "These providers serve those most at risk for COVID-19 with limited access to fundamental determinants of health putting the on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic. These funds will ensure they can continue to work diligently to help our hardest hit and most vulnerable communities. I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure our hospitals in Ohio and around the country have the resources they need during these unprecedented times."Trump Administration Agrees to Portman Request to Provide Additional Funding For All Hospitals That Fought COVID-19 HotspotsPortman applauded the Trump Administration for announcing it would be collecting additional data from hospitals to determine their eligibility for funds from the Provider Relief Fund for the purpose of supporting hospitals that have responded to acute COVID-19 outbreaks. On April 22nd, HHS announced its intention to provide $10 billion to hospitals in "hotspots" that had a disproportionate number of inpatient admissions due to COVID-19. HHS had set an arbitrary eligibility cutoff date of April 10th for such funds, excluding potential hospitals in Ohio from meeting such an eligibility. Portman wrote to HHS, calling for increased flexibility, so that it could include hospitals like the Ohio State's Wexner Medical Center that were in the midst of responding to outbreaks at state prisons in Marion and Pickaway Counties. Today's announcement will set a new eligibility for hotspot funding for those hospitals that fought outbreaks through June 1st of this year in order to receive additional funds from the Provider Relief Fund, thus capturing a greater number of potential hospitals. Portman released the following statement:"I applaud HHS for responding to my request to ensure that all of our hospitals that have worked tirelessly to address COVID-19 outbreaks have access to these funds. By providing additional funds to those hospitals that fought hotspots after the first HHS deadline of April 10th, we'll be able to more equitably support hospitals that experienced later outbreaks in this pandemic."At Hearing, Portman Highlights Need for Return-to-Work Bonus Proposal to Incentivize Folks to Safely Return the Workplace and Bolster EconomyAt a Senate Finance Committee Hearing, Portman highlighted his proposal to incentivize individuals to return to the workplace, which will be critical to a robust economic recovery as we safely begin to reopen. Portman believes it is critical that we have a workforce that's ready to step into their old jobs or newly available jobs as the economy reopens and that a return-to-work bonus for individuals reentering the workplace would better help get the American economy running again. He highlighted his proposal of providing $450 a week for individuals returning to work, meaning they'd receive their wages plus this $450 bonus. Portman believes this proposal would ensure that there are as few situations as possible where staying on unemployment is more lucrative than returning to work. He believes this provision should be a part of the next coronavirus response stimulus legislation considered in the Senate.According to recent research from the American Action Forum and from the University of Chicago, between 60-70 percent of individuals currently on unemployment are making more than they did in their prior job thanks to this federal supplement. Furthermore, the bottom 20 percent of wage earners are making, on average, double what they made in the workforce through this UI program. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow praised Senator Portman's work on this issue and said the White House is considering the proposal as discussions commence about the next COVID-19 legislative package.A transcript of his remarks can be found here and a video can be found here.Portman on Senate Floor: Let's Get Our Parks Back on Track so They Will Be There for Future GenerationsPortman once again highlighted his bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act which is currently under consideration on the Senate floor this week, which will support more than 100,000 jobs over the next five years. The bill will help rebuild our parks infrastructure by addressing the more than $12 billion backlog in long-delayed maintenance projects at the National Park Service (NPS). The Restore Our Parks Act is a part of a broader package, the Great American Outdoors Act -- landmark bipartisan legislation to address the deferred maintenance backlog across the federal land management agencies and to provide permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund.Portman has pushed the Senate to pass the Restore Our Parks Act over the last several years. The bill will establish the National Park Service Legacy Restoration Fund to reduce the maintenance backlog by allocating half of the existing unobligated revenues the government receives from on and offshore energy development up to $1.3 billion per year for the next five years. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved the bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act in November 2019. Portman worked with his colleagues to expand the Restore Our Parks Act to address the more than $20 billion in deferred maintenance backlog across all land management agencies in the Great American Outdoors Act . This legislation now provides $1.9 billion per year for five years into the "National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration Fund" from half of unobligated on and offshore energy revenues. Last week, Portman announced that a new National Parks Service (NPS) study of the Restore Our Parks legislation found that the legislation will support an average of 40,300 direct jobs and a total of 100,100 direct and indirect jobs over the next five years to help address the delayed maintenance backlog and rebuild our national parks infrastructure.Portman thanked his cosponsors, U.S. Senators Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Mark Warner (D-VA), and Angus King (I-ME) for their work on the legislation and President Trump for his support of this legislative effort.A transcript of his remarks is here and a video can be found here.Wednesday, June 10, 2020How Portman's Bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act Will Benefit OhioThis week, the Senate is considering Senator Portman's bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act , which will support more than 100,000 jobs over the next five years to rebuild critical park infrastructure by addressing the more than $12 billion deferred maintenance backlog at the National Park Service (NPS). The bill is a part of a broader package, the Great American Outdoors Act , landmark legislation that will address the more than $20 billion in deferred maintenance backlog across all federal lands and provide mandatory and permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund.Last week, Portman announced that a new National Parks Service (NPS) study of the Restore Our Parks Act found that the legislation will support an average of 40,300 direct jobs and a total of 100,100 direct and indirect jobs over the next five years to help address the maintenance backlog and rebuild our national parks infrastructure. Portman's bipartisan legislation, which has been praised by key national and Ohio stakeholders, will establish the "National Park Service Legacy Restoration Fund" to reduce the maintenance backlog by allocating existing unobligated revenues the government receives from on and offshore energy development on federal lands. Notably, the measure would help tackle the more than $100 million maintenance backlog at Ohio's eight national park sites, which is highlighted here.Portman, a lifelong outdoorsman and a frequent visitor to Ohio's national parks, has long been a leader in the U.S. Senate in efforts to protect our national parks. He is the author of the National Park Service Centennial Act, legislation signed into law in 2016 that authorizes the National Park Centennial Challenge Fund and the Second Century Endowment Fund, two public-private partnerships that will help preserve our national parks for generations to come. In 2019, Portman received the Friend of Industry Award from the Outdoor Industry Association and the Distinguished Travel Champion Award from the U.S. Travel Association for his leadership on the Restore Our Parks Act. In 2017, Portman received the National Park Foundation's Centennial Champion Award for his work on the National Park Service Centennial Act. He has previously received the 2012 NPCA Centennial Award, the 2015 Bruce F. Vento Public Service Award, and the Cuyahoga Valley National Park Centennial Leader Award.Portman, Warren Unveil Companion Bill to Support Dependents of Fallen and Injured ServicemembersSenators Portman and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) introduced the bipartisan Leasing Relief for Dependents of Fallen Heroes and Injured Servicemembers Act , that will allow adult dependents of deceased or catastrophically injured servicemembers to terminate residential and car leases without financial penalty under certain conditions. The bipartisan bill is the modified companion to legislation introduced by Representatives Brad Wenstrup (R-OH) and Cheri Bustos (D-IL) and passed the House of Representatives in February."Military dependents dealing with the death or catastrophic disability of a loved one as the result of their service should have the ability to end home and car leases without incurring financial penalties," said Senator Portman . "This bipartisan bill, which has veteran support, will provide much-needed relief for these families. I encourage my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting this common-sense legislation."Thursday, June 11, 2020Portman: Federal CARES Funds Pave Way for Significant Increase in COVID-19 Testing for ColumbusPortman applauded Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther's announcement that Columbus Public Health (CPH) will partner with Ohio Health, Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, and Mount Carmel to increase testing capacity and provide more free testing options for Columbus and Central Ohio residents. This increased testing is funded in part by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act which Portman supported. In addition, Mayor Ginther announced that CPH will have testing available five days a week from 9am-4pm at ten sites around Columbus and testing will be expanded to allow asymptomatic people to get tested as well, a vital component to ensuring the accurate tracking and monitoring of the virus. Portman released the following statement:"I'm pleased these federal CARES Act funds are helping Columbus and central Ohio increase testing because testing is absolutely essential to our efforts to reopen the state safely. Testing is key not only because it helps us know where the disease is and how it may be spreading, but also because as Ohioans continue to see the number of new cases decline, they will have greater confidence to return to their normal lives in an incremental and safe manner. I have appreciated the ongoing dialogue and close working relationship with Mayor Ginther and will continue to work with him and other local leaders throughout Ohio to ensure that they have the resources they need.Portman Introduces Bipartisan Twentieth Amendment Section Four Study ActPortman introduced the bipartisan Twentieth Amendment Section Four Study Act . This legislation will establish a panel of constitutional experts to recommend to Congress an appropriate process in case there is a death of a candidate in a contingent presidential or vice-presidential electionThe Constitution established that if no candidate wins a majority of the electoral votes for president, the U.S. House of Representatives selects the president from the top three electoral vote recipients in what's called a contingent election. Unfortunately, the Constitution has no rules for what is to be done if a presidential candidate dies during a contingent election. Section 4 of the Twentieth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the authority to enact legislation establishing rules for such a scenario. Yet, Congress has never exercised this authority. To establish what the process should be if a presidential candidate in a contingent election dies before the House elects the president and the Senate elects the vice-president."In the horrible event that a candidate passes away in a contingent presidential or vice-presidential election, it's imperative that Congress has the necessary information and guidance on how to proceed. Congress should not attempt to write the rules in the midst of such a crisis, and with such clear partisan outcomes at stake," said Portman. "Though unlikely, it is important to pass this legislation in order to establish a panel of experts and determine the best course of action to resolve this issue before a nightmare scenario occurs. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this bipartisan bill."Ahead of Tax Filing Deadline, Portman, Carper Unveil New Findings on IRS' Free File Program, Call Attention to Free Services for TaxpayersSenators Portman and Tom Carper (D-DE), the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), unveiled a new bipartisan staff memo that found there has been little IRS oversight of the Free File program, which provides free online tax preparation and filing services to U.S. taxpayers. As a result, American taxpayers, who are eligible for free tax filing through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), may not be aware of the program or taking advantage of it. This could result in eligible taxpayers paying fees to file their taxes.Over the course of a year-long investigation, the Subcommittee examined the history of the IRS Free File program, the coordination between the Free File Alliance (FFA) and its membership of tax preparation software companies, oversight of the Free File program by IRS, and reporting in 2019 that certain FFA members used coding to hide their Free File websites from online search engines.Ahead of the July 15 th tax filing deadline, Senators Portman and Carper want to ensure that Americans who made $69,000 or less in 2019 know that they can access the free filing services to which they are entitled by visiting www.irs.gov/FreeFile."The PSI Staff Memo documents a lack of oversight for years by the IRS of the Free File program. This lack of oversight resulted in confusion, including where users should start the Free File experience and whether Free File websites should appear in online searches. I am encouraged that the IRS and Free File member companies have addressed these issues and are working to increase awareness of this important public-private partnership. As the July 15 tax filing deadline approaches, eligible taxpayers should take full advantage of IRS Free File products in filing their taxes," said Senator Portman.Portman, Warner, Alexander, King Highlight National Park Service Study Showing Visitor Spending Generates $41 Billion in Annual Economic Impact and Supports More Than 340,000 JobsSenators Portman, Mark Warner (D-VA), Lamar Alexander (R-TN), and Angus King (I-ME) highlighted a new National Park Service (NPS) study which shows that in 2019, visitor spending in communities near national parks resulted in a $41.7 billion benefit to the nation's economy and supported 340,500 jobs. The senators' Restore Our Parks Act legislation, currently being debated on the Senate floor, will help address the more than $12 billion backlog in long-delayed maintenance projects at the NPS to ensure this economic benefit continues for communities near national parks across the country. The measure, which is included in the broader Great American Outdoors Act legislation, will provide up to $6.5 billion over five years to address priority deferred maintenance needs at our national parks."Now, more than ever, we need our parks. Families are eager to spend time outdoors together as the economy reopens across the country. This new National Parks Service study underscores the importance of our national parks to our economy and job creation around the country. My bill with Senators Warner, King, and Alexander, the bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act, will help rebuild our national parks infrastructure to ensure that folks can continue to visit and bolster the surrounding communities for generations to come. The Restore Our Parks Act will address the more than $12 billion deferred maintenance backlog at our national park sites throughout the country, including the more than $100 million maintenance backlog in Ohio's eight national parks. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation when it comes to a vote next week," said PortmanFriday, June 12, 2020Portman Announces $4.4 Million Federal Grant to Support the I-70 Corridor Partnership ProjectPortman announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation's (USDOT) Federal Highway Administration awarded a $4.4 million grant to the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) to help support the Interstate 70 truck automation corridor project, which is a partnership between the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT), Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT), and DriveOhio.According to the partners, this project will help advance truck automation technologies through the deployment of this technology by logistics firms using I-70 in Ohio and Indiana, sharing data from this grant to scale up the use of this technology within the transportation system, and identification of infrastructure needs of the interstate system as the number of automated vehicles on the roads continue to increase. These lessons learned will inform the development of state DOT roadway automation installation, maintenance and regulatory standards as this technology is scaled across the nation."This $4.4 million DOT grant is good news for Ohio and economic development and job creation in the state. I applaud the Federal Highway Administrator Nicole Nason for providing Ohio with the resources needed to help support the I-70 truck automation corridor project. This federal grant will help further facilitate the partnerships between the Ohio Department of Transportation, DriveOhio, and the Indiana Department of Transportation to leverage innovative autonomous driving technology," said Portman. "I'm pleased to see this federal investment in our region and look forward to seeing how this partnership strengthens the reliability of autonomous driving and promotes further economic development in Ohio."On Senate Floor, Portman Urges Colleagues to Pass Bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act to Preserve and Protect National ParksPortman once again urged his colleagues to pass his bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act , which will support more than 100,000 jobs over the next five years. He has spoken on the floor several times this week to highlight how the bill will help rebuild our parks infrastructure by addressing the more than $12 billion backlog in long-delayed maintenance projects at the National Park Service (NPS). The Restore Our Parks Act is a part of a broader package, the Great American Outdoors Act -- landmark bipartisan legislation to address the deferred maintenance backlog across the federal land management agencies and to provide permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund.

On June 12, 2020 the North Atlantic Council recognized Ukraine as Enhanced Opportunities Partner, part of NATO's Partnership Interoperability Initiative, to ensure Ukraine can maintain and deepen cooperation with NATO Allies and Partners. This partnership was granted in recognition of Ukraine's continued dedication to defense reform and their contribution to Allied operations, to include Afghanistan and Kosovo as well as NATO Response Force and NATO exercises. This Program will provide Ukraine with enhanced access to interoperability programs and exercises to increase their capabilities and ability to operate with NATO partners. Portman issued the following statement:"I am pleased to see that the North Atlantic Council has accepted Ukraine as an Enhanced Opportunities Partner. Ukraine's status as an Enhanced Opportunities Partner is a recognition of the tremendous sacrifices made by the brave men and women of the Ukrainian armed forces in support of NATO operations and the dedication of the Ukrainian government to continue to make serious structural military reforms. I strongly support Ukraine's NATO integration and eventual full partnership and I will continue to advocate on their behalf."Portman Announces Nearly $400,000 in Federal Grants to Help Health Care Facilities Across Ohio Provide Telehealth ServicesPortman announced that the Federal Communications Commission's Wireline Competition Bureau awarded $398,125 in telehealth grants to three health care facilities in Ohio that will use this funding to provide telehealth services targeted at low-income patients so that they can receive medical care in more flexible settings. The exact funding amount and details of the facilities telehealth services can be found below.This grant award follows previous announcements of telehealth grants for Ohio, including one announced in April for the Health Partners of Western Ohio located in Lima, Ohio. Last month, three facilities received nearly $1 million in funding and four facilities received nearly $800,000 in funding. This month, six facilities received $1.8 million in funding, and an additional six facilities received $1.1 million in funding.. These grants come from funds accessible thanks to the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which Portman supported and was signed into law by President Trump. Portman released the following statement:"These new federal grants are good news for folks all across Ohio . During this ongoing coronavirus pandemic, telehealth has become a vital service for Ohioans to receive the health care consultations they need without having to leave the safety of their homes. I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure Ohioans have the resources they need during these uncertain times."SOCIAL MEDIASenate Faults Oversight of Chinese Telecom Companies in U.S.Senate investigators said Tuesday that government officials had "exercised minimal oversight" of the risks posed by three Chinese telecom companies that operate on American communications networks.Federal agencies failed to properly follow up on some agreements meant to protect national security, did not provide adequate workers to vet the Chinese companies and operated through a "disorganized" process, according to a report from the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.The report looked into a group of officials from the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense Departments, known as Team Telecom, that has historically advised the Federal Communications Commission on the possible national security risks of foreign involvement in American networks.The findings could put pressure on officials at those agencies and embolden politicians from both parties who argue that the United States must move quickly to sever any links between its communications networks and Chinese companies.The Trump administration has cracked down on Chinese telecommunications companies that operate in the United States, arguing that the Chinese government could use their equipment to hear and read American communications on their networks.Huawei, a Chinese manufacturer of telecom networking gear, has been one of the administration's top targets, and has pushed back against the accusations. Last year, the Federal Communications Commission turned down the application of China Mobile, a wireless carrier, to operate in the United States.But other Chinese companies with ties to the country's government are still licensed to operate on American networks, and the Senate report said the Team Telecom agencies had failed to keep an adequate watch on three of them: China Unicom Americas, China Telecom Americas and ComNet (USA). All three are part of Chinese state-controlled companies.The report said that while the agencies had established security agreements with China Telecom and ComNet in 2007 and 2009, they had visited the companies only twice each to ensure they were complying. It said the agencies had never entered into a similar agreement with China Unicom, "meaning Team Telecom has no oversight authority to assess the company's operations in the United States."The agencies have already taken steps to respond to critics of the system for reviewing foreign entrants into domestic networks. This year, Team Telecom recommended that the Federal Communications Commission revoke China Telecom's and China Unicom's licenses to operate in the United States. The White House also issued an executive order to replace the process with a more formal one.The report also criticized the resources devoted to oversight of the companies. The Homeland Security and Justice Departments assigned fewer than five employees to field applications for Team Telecom reviews and check whether companies were meeting the terms of their agreements with the group, the report said.The subcommittee also said there were flaws in the way the review process was set up, noting that it operated on an ad hoc basis because it was not explicitly authorized by Congress. Members of the subcommittee's staff told reporters on a call on Monday that they expected to discuss legislation addressing the issue with the agencies."We look forward to reviewing the contribution of these senators and committee staff to this important national security work," a spokesman for the Federal Communications Commission, Will Wiquist, said in a statement.The Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Senate bill would provide $47 million for Perry's Monument repairsA bill that could bring more than $100 million in funding maintenance at national parks throughout Ohio, including millions locally, has been making progress recently in the U.S. Senate.The bill, titled the "Restore Our Parks Act," would address a total of around $12 billion in maintenance that had been deferred and backlogged at the National Park Service's properties throughout the country and was first introduced by Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, in July 2018.The bill calls for the creation of a "National Park Service Legacy Restoration Fund," allocating existing revenue that the federal government receives from energy development and, instead, using it to reduce the maintenance backlog at the parks.More recently, the bill was folded into another piece of legislation, the "Great American Outdoors Act," which Portman said he believes should be voted on early next week."We're actually on the verge of a huge win for Ohio and for Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial," Portman said.Deferred maintenance at national parks in Ohio would cost over $103 million, including more than $47.7 million at the local Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial, which has been in operation for over a century.The memorial is home to an iconic 352-foot monument, which typically draws between 150,000 and 200,000 visitors each year.And despite delays to the launch of the tourism season at Put-in-Bay due to the coronavirus pandemic, visitors have been returning in droves since it kicked off late last month."I think Put-in-Bay is going to be very popular this summer," Portman said.After having spent months under a stay-at-home order, many Ohioans have begun taking advantage of the opportunity to get out of the house and visit the lake.One of the reasons the island has been such a great tourist destination for so long, Portman said, is because of the monument and the history surrounding it."Unfortunately, it's falling apart," he said, referencing extensive damage to the structure's seawall and deteriorating tiles from the terrace around the monument."Their annual budget is adequate for yearly operations, like having rangers and historical interpreters there and keeping the visitor's center up, but what they can't do is afford these really expensive things like the seawall, which is just collapsing," Portman said.The "Restore Our Parks" legislation would create a fund to address not only the seawall damage at Perry's but similar maintenance needs that have deferred at other national parks across the country totaling more than $12 billion.According to Portman, these maintenance needs are shovel-ready projects that would create jobs with the funds becoming available almost immediately.The "National Park Service Legacy Restoration Fund" would be created using funds from royalties earned through offshore and onshore oil and gas. Portman said those funds are already allocated to be used for conservation and environmental purposes."I think it's a good source of funding to be able to knock down these big, long-term maintenance costs," he said.Load-Date: June 12, 2020End of Document

U.S. senators urge investigation of Chinese TikTok and ZoomCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 30, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 604 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- The Justice Department should investigate whether popular TikTok and Zoom video apps have violated Americans' constitutional rights by sharing private information with the Chinese government, two senators wrote in a letter to the agency Thursday.The request of Senators Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, and Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut Democrat, denotes a growing bipartisan concern about potential threats from applications because of their ties to China, at a time when relations between Beijing and Washington are crumbling."We are extremely concerned that Zoom and TikTok may disclose private information about Americans to RPC and engage in censorship on behalf of the Chinese government," the senators wrote to John Demers, head of the Department of Justice's Homeland Security Division, referring to the People's Republic of China."We believe it is imperative that the Department of Justice investigate and determine whether business relationships, data management practices, and operational connections with China from Zoom and TikTok pose a risk to Americans," the senators wrote.The senators also asked the Justice Department and U.S. intelligence agencies to report to Congress as soon as possible.TikTok has repeatedly rejected allegations that it supplies information from its users to China or is being pressured by Beijing, even though its parent company, ByteDance Ltd., is headquartered there."TikTok is led by an American CHIEF Executive Officer, with hundreds of employees and key leaders in safety, products and public policy, here in the United States," said a company spokesman earlier this month. "We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked."Zoom, based in San Jose, California, came under scrutiny last month after it suspended, and then reactivated, the account of a group of pro-democracy Chinese activists in the United States. Critics say he did so to appease China's government. Since then, the company has announced a delay in producing a report on how often it discloses user information to governments.The company was previously criticized for failing to provide end-to-end encryption of its popular video conferencing service, which has increased its popularity during the covid-19 outbreak. That discovery came after investigators found cases where Zoom meetings and their related encryption keys were routed through servers in China, even though no one on the call was in that country.The senators' request comes after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the press Wednesday that TikTok is under a national security review by the U.S. Foreign Investment Committee, known as CFIUS, and that President Donald Trump will soon receive a recommendation on it.Hawley and Blumenthal said TikTok and Zoom present the property as American companies, but "have tried to hide and distract attention from their significant ties to China.""As tens of millions of Americans turn to Zoom and TikTok during the covid-19 pandemic, few know that the privacy of their data and their freedom of expression are at risk because of these companies' relationship with the Chinese government," according to the senators.Another bipartisan group of senators wrote Tuesday to the Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, and the FBI Director, Christoper Wray, saying that theyChina was concerned that China could use TikTok to conduct influence operations against the United States, including interference in the upcoming presidential election.Original Note:Justice Department Probe of TikTok, Zoom Urged by Two Senators©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: July 31, 2020End of Document

TikTok is a national security threat, politicians say. Here's what experts thinkCNN WireJuly 9, 2020 Thursday 10:39 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1543 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON (CNN Business) BodyWASHINGTON (CNN Business) --  The short-form video app TikTok has quickly become a key part of popular culture in the US, serving as a platform for viral memes as well as political satire and activism. Facebook, the dominant force in social media, has tried to copy the app, but so far that has not slowed down its rapid rise. But now TikTok faces the most direct threat to its expansion in the US -- not from a competitor, but from the US government. President Donald Trump said Tuesday his administration is "looking at" banning the app, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, affirming remarks on Monday by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. It's just the latest, and most high-profile, example of Washington raising alarms about the app that's popular among younger users in the US, where TikTok has been downloaded 165 million times. Other prominent critics have previously highlighted TikTok as a potential spying threat. Last year, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton called for the intelligence community to assess the risk TikTok may pose to national security. TikTok has pushed back on those claims, calling them "unfounded." To underscore its independence from China, TikTok has cited its recently hired American CEO, and said it has "never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked." The US is not alone in seeking to clamp down on TikTok. India said this week it would ban TikTok and other Chinese apps after a bloody border clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers.Although leaders like Pompeo have described TikTok as a clear and present danger, many in the cybersecurity community say the reality is more complex. While TikTok could become a clear threat to US security under certain scenarios, they say, the danger is currently largely hypothetical or indirect. Some analysts also say the matter is complicated by Trump's aggressive approach to China overall --- arguing the situation is a reflection of the administration's political priorities. Experts have raised similar concerns about Trump's approach to Huawei, the Chinese tech giant, saying Trump has inappropriately conflated national security with trade negotiations. "The Trump administration has taken almost like a whack-a-mole approach to dealing with these issues, because it seems that as soon as a Chinese company is in the news, all of a sudden that becomes the new target," said Justin Sherman, a fellow with the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council. "It seems very unlikely that there is thinking going on about the longer term strategy, and much more likely that the focus instead is on this politically motivated attack on an application because it's a Chinese-owned app, even if there are real security questions."The China questionTo understand why policymakers view TikTok as a risk, it helps to know how the company works. TikTok is owned by the world's most valuable startup, a Chinese company named ByteDance. But TikTok does not operate in China and functions as an independent subsidiary.Policymakers' chief worry is that ByteDance could be forced to hand over TikTok's data on US users to the Chinese government, under the country's national security laws. TikTok has said it stores American user data on US-based servers that aren't subject to Chinese law; skeptics argue TikTok's parent, ByteDance, is ultimately a Chinese business that's still beholden to Beijing. But several security experts told CNN Business that, although TikTok's links to a private Chinese company are worthy of concern, the app simply wouldn't be that useful for espionage. "It's right to be suspicious of the Chinese," said James Lewis, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a security think tank. "But I'm not sure TikTok is a good intelligence tool for them."Like some other social media apps and technology companies, TikTok automatically gathers users' geolocation information, IP addresses, unique device identifiers and the content of in-app messages, according to its privacy policy. That is a lot of data, but far more sensitive information -- and potentially more damaging to national security -- was exposed by data breaches affecting the Office of Personnel Management, announced in 2015, and Equifax, disclosed in 2017, according to Lewis.Even if TikTok collected enough of the right kind of data from the right people to pose a unique threat, it is not guaranteed the Chinese government would be able to access it easily. China's national security laws contain more gray areas than many realize, according to Samm Sacks, a senior fellow at Yale Law School who has studied the Chinese laws. Chinese companies have successfully resisted or thrown up roadblocks to Beijing's demands for data in the past, Sacks told lawmakers at a Senate hearing in March. "The Chinese government does not necessarily have unfettered real-time access to all companies' data," Sacks said in her testimony. "Chinese corporate actors are not synonymous with the Chinese government or the Chinese Communist Party, and have their own commercial interests to protect." Concerning security flawsAn alarming technical report about TikTok this year has only added to the concerns about its security, though experts say there is an important distinction between identifying individual security gaps and labeling something a threat to national security.In January, a team of security researchers announced they had found several vulnerabilities in TikTok. The flaws, if left unpatched, could have let attackers gain control of TikTok accounts, change the privacy settings on TikTok videos, upload videos without permission, and obtain user data such as email addresses. The discovery raised important questions about TikTok's ability to safeguard user privacy. But company engineers appeared to operate in good faith, according to Oded Vanunu, a security specialist at Check Point Research, who led the group of researchers that announced the findings. TikTok, he said, seemed motivated to fix the flaws. "They were concerned about the optics of it, and their PR people, there was some friction there," said Vanunu. "But from our perspective they were very happy to get this kind of information and were happy to cooperate."Asked whether the vulnerabilities he found might lend credence to claims TikTok cannot be trusted, Vanunu said security flaws are something that all software companies grapple with, even large ones. The difference, he said, is that TikTok is a relatively young and inexperienced company."TikTok is committed to protecting user data," TikTok said in a statement at the time of the disclosure. "Like many organizations, we encourage responsible security researchers to privately disclose zero day vulnerabilities to us."The bigger concern with TikTokEven as technical experts describe TikTok's espionage risk in mostly theoretical terms, policymakers argue TikTok could still threaten US interests in softer ways --- by influencing the global conversation on its platform. And in this respect, some experts warn, the danger is already being felt. TikTok has faced mounting criticism, for example, over its handling of content that's critical of the Chinese government. Last year The Guardian reported on leaked documents that it said instructed moderators to clamp down on critiques of socialism and Tiananmen Square. ByteDance told The Guardian at the time that those guidelines were outdated. In November, allegations of politically motivated censorship increased when several former US employees of TikTok told The Washington Post they often felt pressured to clamp down on videos that their colleagues in Beijing found subversive, prompting Schumer and Cotton to express concerns in their letter to intelligence officials.TikTok has said that its content and moderation policies are developed by a team of American employees and that the policies are not influenced by any foreign government. TikTok's investors include large international names such as Sequoia Capital and Softbank, and in May, the company hired Kevin Mayer, a former Disney executive, as its CEO.In addition to restricting some speech, TikTok could become a major platform for misleading speech, policymakers and security experts fear. Reports have already found Pizzagate conspiracy theorists on the platform and users spreading false claims about the coronavirus. And if TikTok were to suffer a data breach, said Vanunu, it might be that much easier to target users with bogus information that could undercut American democracy.So TikTok's handling of content and user data could plausibly weaken US power and influence, experts say, but more abstractly than directly spying on government officials or monitoring troop movements. That says more about the US's lack of policies regulating data, privacy and platforms than it does about TikTok, many of them said."I think people are blending a lot of different values here related to human rights, privacy, censorship --- and it's at risk of getting bundled into a security argument," said Karl Grindal, a cybersecurity expert at Georgia Tech. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, July 7.Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.Big tech takes the stand against China's crackdown on Hong Kong's freedom. Google, Facebook and Twitter all saying that they will not release user data to Hong Kong law enforcement.Tiktok planning pulling its app from the city as well. This as the U.S. looks to ban Tiktok and other China-based social media apps.Coronavirus cases are still rising at alarming rate meanwhile. Dr. Anthony Fauci is warning we are still knee-deep in the first wave. Cities like New York reopening while other areas including Los Angeles and Miami have reversed course.Markets are pulling back this morning after a big rally yesterday. Take a look. We've got a triple digits decline with the Dow futures down 205 points. Nasdaq down 31. And the S&P futures right now down 20 points an hour and a half away from the opening bell.This after a strong rally kicked off the week yesterday pushing the Nasdaq to yet another recorded high. The Nasdaq in unchartered territory at 10433 with a gain yesterday of 226 points.Who dipped into the Paycheck Protection Program? Companies include law offices, big Girl Scouts, PF Chang, even Kanye West's clothing company and restaurants backed by Robert de Niro. The list causing controversy this morning.Meanwhile crime is rising in major U.S. cities. Georgia's governor has declared a state of emergency in Georgia deploying the National Guard following a weekend of violence in Atlanta.Plus Parler gaining momentum as an alternative to Twitter. Its CEO John Matze will join me in about half an hour. Don't miss that, coming up.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.Global markets this morning are under some selling pressure. Take a look at European indices right across the board with the FT 100 right now down 87 points. The CAC 40 down 46. And the Dax index down 150 points.The Eurozone is heading toward a deeper recession than earlier predicted. The European Union's commission forecasting a record contraction of 8.7 percent in 2020. Next year, they're expecting a rise of just over 6 percent. So they are looking at growth in 2021.In Asia overnight, markets are mostly lower except for China where stocks rose again following Monday's big rally, after a state-run media reported that China needs a healthy bull market and is ready to add support to attract investors. The Shanghai composite up another third of a percent overnight. The Hang Seng Hong Kong index down one and a third percent.Joining the conversation this morning: Dagen McDowell, Jon Hilsenrath and Michael Kantrowitz. Great show so far, guys. Thanks so much for being here.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Thank you.JON HILSENRATH, SENIOR WRITER, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL": Great to be here.MICHAEL KANTROWITZ, CORNERSTONE MACRO: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning now.Leaders in major U.S. cities are vowing to get crime under control after a violent weekend.Georgia Governor Brian Kemp says that he will deploy 1,000 National Guard troops after at least 30 people were shot in Atlanta over the weekend, five people were killed including an eight-year-old girl.In New York, more violence leading to outrage after a video is reported to show a man holding his daughter's hand as he is gunned down. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says the situation is unacceptable and is blaming an uptick in violence on the coronavirus.Meanwhile we know that shootings are up 205 percent in New York after the making the decision to disband the plainclothes anticrime unit in New York. Shootings up better than 200 percent.Meanwhile the White House says it is ready to play a larger role in the debate over how to address the violence adding that the country needs to focus on securing its streets.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meanwhile says that the Trump administration may soon ban Chinese social media apps including Tiktok. Pompeo weighed in on Fox News last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We are taking this very seriously. We're certainly looking at it. We've worked on this very issue for a long time.LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Would you recommend that people download that app on their phones tonight, tomorrow, any time currently?POMPEO: Only if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Tiktok says it is leaving the Hong Kong market after China imposed a controversial national security law there. The Beijing based app has been trying to make moves to distance itself from China. But how can you when you're a Chinese company. That includes naming an American and former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as CEO. Kevin Mayer is the current CEO of Tiktok.Facebook and Twitter suspending requests for data from Hong Kong's government after China recently approved a controversial national security law. The two companies say that they are reviewing the implications of the new law which gives China sweeping powers to crack down on dissent in Hong Kong.Hong Kong police made its first arrest under the new law last week. Ten people were detained.Meanwhile in Seattle, the city council has approved a payroll tax on big businesses that pay the highest salaries. The new tax targets companies with annual payrolls of at least $7 million dollars and salaries of more than $150,000.Lawmakers estimated that the plan called Jumpstart Seattle will raise $214 million dollars a year. The money would be used for COVID-19 relief and to build more affordable housing.Taking on Chinese technology. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last night the U.S. is considering banning Tiktok and other Chinese social media apps. This comes less than a week after the FCC designated Huawei and ZTE as national security threats.Dagen McDowell, your reaction to this. I want to get your take on what is going on in terms of these security threats in China -- coming from China. But also get your take on what is going on in these cities across the country.I tweeted over weekend that we saw this coming in New York. You and I were railing on the new bail reform law for two years now when we saw the security. Now look at 64 people shot in New York City during the violent Fourth of July weekend according to police, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Well, you mentioned this in the news, Maria, that Mayor Bill de Blasio is blaming recent events with the coronavirus shutdowns in New York City. No. This is the policy that has been put in place by liberal leaders here in New York City and in other places across the country."The Wall Street Journal" editorial that I know that you tweeted out over the weekend called "New York's cop-out" goes through what has gone on since Mayor Bill de Blasio took over the nation's safest big city.Now it is a dangerous hellhole because of him and because of other leaders particularly Governor Cuomo.I'll just go through a couple of things. So the city council eased law -- laws about quality of life offenses say public urination. The Manhattan D.A. Cy Vance no longer prosecuting those offense. Governor Andrew Cuomo's bail reform which basically turned there's no bail for arson, for hate crimes, for manslaughter, for the assault of a child under 11 years of age. No bail.And individuals are being picked up and released over and over and over again. These are criminals. They won't call them that. And then in recent weeks --BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- you have had the police department dismantling its plainclothes anticrime unit. These rich liberals have security protection. And rich folks can get guns. They can get a carry permit. They have security details traveling with them.Meanwhile, people who have no way of protecting themselves are being the victims of crimes all across this city and all across other cities. It is disgraceful what these politicians have done to the American people.BARTIROMO: It's true. You are right. And the gun violence is continuing to kill. Can you believe Mayor de Blasio is blaming COVID-19? 160 people dead. Gun violence in the holiday weekend. 64 people shot just during the violent Fourth of July weekend. He is blaming COVID-19, Dagen.MCDOWELL: A man shot holding the hand of a child in the middle of the street, in broad daylight. And by the way, in New York City, you cannot carry a gun if you are you a private citizen. The Second Amendment does not apply to you here.You can barely keep a gun in home. The only reason that the state changed - - the city changed the law and the state changed the law is to avoid the Supreme Court hearing that case. It did hear it and it didn't make a decision on it because the law was changed.But you, it is basically, unless you are a rich celebrity, you cannot get a carry permit here in New York. I can protect myself from the coronavirus. I can wear a mask. I can keep my distance from other people. But in terms of the crime that is happening in this city, you are at the mercy of criminals who have been coddled by Cuomo and de Blasio and their ilk.BARTIROMO: I mean New York feels like a different city to me. Jon Hilsenrath when you look at the violence across these cities, whether it's New York, Chicago, Atlanta don't you think that that is going to elongate what has been a very tough economic story for these cities due to this recession and the shutdown?I mean, it is going to make it that much more difficult to actually get growth. Real estate prices are plummeting. People are fleeing New York right now.HILSENRATH: Well, there is no question that safety is a fundamental factor that led to the renaissance of American cities over the last 20 or 30 years because crime rates fell dramatically across the country including New York.And it's certainly worrying. You know, one of the things that I find that is interesting right now is that this crime that we're seeing is violent. So if you look at murder rates, it's up in New York, it's up in Atlanta, it's up in Chicago, it's up in Baltimore.If you look at robberies, they are actually down. And I don't quite understand that. I don't understand what is behind it. But if cities in America don't get -- keep violence under control, then, you know, they are going to risk losing a lot of the gains that they had.I am not convinced yet that this is the kind of pandemic we had in 1980s, 1990s but Maria, you and Dagen -- we all know how bad it was in New York in those, you know -- we're a long way from that. But it's certainly not the kind of trend you want to see right now.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, we don't know how far we are from that. It definitely does feel different on the ground in New York City right now with all of this tension around this crime and murders -- 39 murders, year 2020 in June so far.Let's take a break.When we come back, welcome to Parler. I'm speaking with CEO John Matze on how it plans to compete with Twitter. We will talk about business of apps.Plus what a deal. Patrick Mahomes signed the largest deal in NFL history. The eye-popping number coming up.You are watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA, live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.COVID-19 side effects. A bedrock of the U.S. economy now on life support, struggling through the coronavirus pandemic and recession. Gerri Willis is now here with the details. Gerri -- good morning.GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Hey. Good morning -- Maria. That is right.The healthcare industry on life support due to the double whammy of COVID- 19 and the recession.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WILLIS: Health care normally resistant to economic cycles but not this time.DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ACTION FORUM: In the first quarter of quart 2020, when GDP fell at a 5 percent annual rate, 2 percentage points of that were from people using fewer health services. They stopped going to the doctor.WILLIS: Worst yet experts predict 27 million people will lose employer- sponsored health care coverage this year. And that will mean incredible pressures on our health care system. Who will cover the new jobless and how will we pay at a time states are underfunded?Dr. Ezequiel Emanuel, a former President Obama adviser examined health care systems in 11 countries to write his new book, "Which country has the World's Best Health Care" and suggests emulating single payer systems in countries like Germany and the Netherlands.He writes, "Individuals choose their own insurer and the government pays most of the premium, risk-adjusted to reflect the patient's age, sex and state of health."But Doug Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum suggests a more targeted approach such as government health and extending employer- sponsored COBRA coverage or a special enrolment period for the Affordable Care Act.HOLTZ-EAKIN: I don't think the state sponsor solution is the answer. We have seen the debate over Medicare for all for example. The extreme end point of a state-sponsored solution. And one of the things you learn in following that debate is people like their employer-sponsored insurance.(END VIDEOTAPE)WILLIS: The debate will likely continue Maria, but the stakes will get higher this fall as more people search for coverage -- Maria.BARTIROMO: All right. Gerri, thank you. Gerri Willis on health care.We'll slip in a break.When we come back markets are pointing to a triple-digit loss at the start of trading this morning after a record run yesterday. What is driving markets with the Dow futures down 212 points this morning.Then Bubba's big break. The NASCAR star has a new musical related deal. Much more ahead.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Taking on Chinese tech. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last night that the U.S. is considering banning Tiktok and other Chinese social media apps. Tiktok just released a statement to Fox Business saying this. "Tiktok is led by an American CEO with hundreds of employees and key leaders across safety security product and public policy here in the United States. We have no higher priority than promoting a safe and secure app experience for our users. We have never provided user data to the Chinese government nor would we do so if asked.Joining me right now is former Nebraska Senator, Allen and Company managing director, former Democratic presidential candidate, former Navy Seal, and former 9/11 Commission member Bob Kerrey.Senator, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for being here.BOB KERREY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, ALLEN AND COMPANY: You're welcome. Nice to have so many of formers in front of my titles.BARTIROMO: We have been talking a lot these last several days and weeks about China and about the national security threat. When you hear Tiktok say look, even if we were asked by the Chinese Communist Party to give user data we won't do it. What is your reaction?KERREY: Well, it's hard to trust the answer. So I don't know. I mean I would have to be read into more precise information as to whether or not they do it. It's hard to take their assurance at face value.BARTIROMO: Well, it is hard to believe, hat they would not be forced to hand over data. I don't care who the CEO is. The CEO is former executive from Disney. If the CCP comes calling and says send us that data, you are going to send that data.And this morning a lot of Wall Street firms are talking about this as well. Apparently, Hong Kong has asserted this new national security law but with it has policing powers including, get this, warrantless searches, online surveillance and property seizures under the new security law with the city's CEO Carrie Lam saying that this law will be enforced very stringently and people's concerns will be eased.She reaffirmed that much of the implementation of the law would be managed in secret, saying that a committee created to oversee it would not release details from future meetings.Your reaction to this new security law that is being implemented in Hong Kong, born in China.KERREY: Well, it certainly kills the freedom movement inside of Hong Kong. I mean the desire for just limited democracy and capacity to form their own government is, I think, been obliterated. And Xi Jinping has taken advantage of the global pandemic to seize control of the island. It's not the same anymore. And they can pretend that it is the same but it's not.They have taken control and it was -- yes, it was a source of great strengthen for the country, for China. And you know, for whatever the reason, Xi Jinping has made one more overreach, in my view that will, in the end, damage China.BARTIROMO: Yes. And certainly, change Hong Kong, breaking another promise there.(CROSSTALK).BARTIROMO: Let me switch gears to talk a bit about domestic issues. And that is Joe Biden's vice president sweepstake heating up. Pressure is mounting on the presumptive 2020 Democratic nominee to choose a black woman as his VP candidate given the racial unrest facing this country.Senator, as somebody who was vetted to be a vice presidential pick for Bill Clinton back in 1992, what can you tell us about the process and who you think Biden will ultimately choose?KERREY: Well, it's a completely different process today. I mean, in 1992, you know, we didn't have cell phones with cameras and we did not have access to all kinds of additional information whether it's, you know, it's Facebook or Web sites and all that sort of thing. So, you know, you could - - I can fly down to Little Rock and you know go inside governor's mansion and have a conversation with very few people knowing I was there.So the intensity of the focus is much greater. And I am sure the vice president's very much aware that the number that is most important to him is 270. So he has to get 270 electoral votes regardless of all the other, you know, can't you get somebody that has this, that or the other characteristic. The most important thing for any president who is running to either be elected or reelected is 270.And my guess is that's going to be a primary consideration. It is also true for actually both for he and the President that they have to think about -- you know, I will just put it this way, if I or anybody over the age of 70 goes to sleep tonight and dies in her sleep, the first thing that people are not going to say tomorrow morning is that was a surprise.So Joe -- anybody picking a vice president who's over the age of 70 has got to sit there and say, what happens if -- suddenly they become president of the United States. Do they have the capacity to do it? I'm sure that Joe is thinking that way in addition to thinking about 270 electoral votes.BARTIROMO: I know. I think you make a great point because it may very well be that --(CROSSTALK)KERREY: It's exactly the point.BARTIROMO: -- whoever he chooses as vice president will become president in no time.Now as somebody with moderate views like yourself, how will you go about bridging this bipartisan divide that we have in Washington right now, nothing seems to be able to get done because each side hates each other.KERREY: Well, there is no question, that it's more than just partisan, it is polarization that's occurred. The sort of a stacking on the issues kind of made it more difficult for a Democrat to move to the middle or a Republican to move to the middle because they get they get trashed by the extremes.And if you're going to get immigration done. If you can't economic policy right. If you begin health care. There's a number of issues where if -- all you do is push a Democrat or a Republican proposal, you simply are not going to get the votes. You're going to have gridlock and you're going to have frustration with American people.BARTIROMO: do you think that mail-in voting works? What are THE other main issues we need to think about going into the election?KERREY: Well I think you've got to have I would say two things. I mean "The Wall Street Journal" had an editorial last week where they described the simple things that need to be done. The first one is you've got to have enough polling places. If people go out and vote there's got to be enough polling places, don't have to stand in line for hours.And secondly, when the votes are -- when the mail-in ballots start arriving, start counting. Don't wait until the election, the day of the election to start counting because if you do you're going to get a delay in yo9ur capacity to announce who the winner is.Already we're were sitting in a situation with -- in New York state. So I think it is really important that you do the simple things to be prepared for the election.BARTIROMO: Senator -- it's great to see you this morning. Thank you so much, sir. Thank you for your --(CROSSTALK).KERREY: Nice to be here with you.BARTIROMO: Senator Bob Kerrey on all of -- and to you. Thank you, sir.Coming up, a major health warning. Florida on high alert this morning after a deadly brain-eating amoeba identified in the state. We are taking a look at that.And then welcome to Parler. I'll be speaking with CEO John Matze next on how it plans to compete with Twitter. We'll talk social media right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, July 7th. Markets this morning, 8:30 AM Eastern, are trading lower. Take a look at where we stand about an hour away from the opening bell.Futures pulling back after yesterday's big rally. The DOW right now down 233 points. NASDAQ Futures down 34 and the S&P Futures down 23. This after a huge day yesterday that the saw NASDAQ hit a 24th record close of the year; 150 (ph) under President Trump. Take a look at yesterday's performance with the NASDAQ at an all-time high, up better than 200 points.Checking global markets this morning; it is red across the board. European Indices are down, take a look. The FTSE 100 down 97, the CAC quarante down 58 and the DAX index in Germany lower by 167. This right here is the low of the morning for Euro. The Euro Zone is heading toward a deeper recession than previously thought, according to the EU. In Asia, overnight, markets were mostly lower except for China where stocks rose following yesterday's rally, after a state-run media said that China needs a healthy bull market and is ready to add support to attract investors. With that, millions of retail investors in China opened accounts.NASCAR standing behind Bubba Wallace meanwhile after President Trump tweeted "The rope shaped like a noose in his garage was a hoax." Cheryl Casone with the details now. Cheryl?CASONE: That's right, Maria. President Trump suggested that Bubba Wallace should apologize after NASCAR rallied around him when that rope was found in his garage at Talladega Superspeedway last month. Now, the President said it was a hoax and he also questioned NASCAR's move to ban the Confederate flag. While Wallace who is NASCAR's only black driver fired back on Twitter writing in part, " Love should come naturally as people are TAUGHT to hate. Even when it's hate from POTUS...love wins."While the FBI determine the rope was not a hate crime and had been in the garage since October, NASCAR released a statement yesterday praising Wallace for his courage and his leadership. Beats by Dre is also showing their support for Wallace, announcing a new endorsement deal with the driver a week early in response to the President's comments.Well, a victory for Native Americans after a federal judge ordered the Dakota Access Pipeline be shut down and emptied pending an environmental review. The judge specifically called out the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe staged protests that sometimes were violent during the pipeline's construction, claiming it will contaminate the Missouri River. The $3.8 billion pipeline, which spans more than 1100 miles underground, has been an operation now for three years. The environmental review must be done within 30 days. This ruling, a setback for the Trump Administration's efforts to speed up pipeline projects by cutting red tape and environmental studies.And here's a look at what's trending this morning on foxbusiness.com, the Kansas City Chiefs signed Super Bowl MVP quarterback Patrick Mahomes to a ten-year extension worth up to $503 million, making up the richest contract in sports history and the first time ever an NFL player became the world's highest paid athlete.The National Gallery of Art purchases its first painting by a Native American artist and there it is on your screen. And finally, there is this; Dunkin' is testing new bubble teas, summer shandies, which is tea or cold coffee with lemonade or other fruit, and vitamin-loaded refreshers at select (ph) locations at Massachusetts that goes from July 1 to August 18, Maria, and those are your headlines from the newsroom, back over to you.BARTIROMO: And if we were together, we would probably be trying that out right now.CASONE: Of course, we would.BARTIROMO: Thanks, Cheryl. Well, the alternative to Twitter, Parler Launched in 2018 setting out to be an unbiased social media platform, free of censorship and promoting free speech. Since its inception, Parler has grown each year with over 600,000 total accounts last year and over two million accounts this year. Prominent Republicans flocking to the app including Eric Trump, Rudy Giuliani, senators Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Congressmen Kevin McCarthy and Devin Nunes.Joining me right now is the CEO of Parler, John Matze. John, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us. Congratulations to you.JOHN MATZE, CEO, PARLER: Thank you. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Tell me how you are going to keep to all that - no censorship, free speech. I mean obviously, we've got lots of issues around the current group of social media companies like Twitter keeps pushing back against President Trump, but doesn't do the same with similar speech from others who are critics of the President; similar story with Google. How are you going to increase and make sure that Parler remains free of any meddling?MATZE: Well, we've been focusing on that real problems and trying to drown out a lot of the noise that has been going on. Basically, our rules are really clear, and they are set with different FCC guidelines. These are not requirements; we don't need to follow them, but we opting into them.Things like pornography and nudity, we keep off the platform, but if people have a disagreement, they are allowed to talk about it and they can have a discussion. And so, the concept is to create a Town Square where people are having realistic discussion, where it reflects their genuine views and they can do that without getting into this nasty internet content that you see on other places by basically ensuring people are real.BARTIROMO: This is a really important point that you are making and you are right. We wanted just a platform - in 1996, with the Telecom Act which pretty much gave the social media companies the privilege of having a platform as an explainer of who they are and that allowed them to get protection in terms of getting sued by people, that is obviously now potentially changing with DOJ's proposal to remove that protection. Assess the situation for us, John, before moving on to explaining specifically about Parler, how do you see the social media situation today? Is there truth that there is censorship?MATZE: I think they are censoring, I don't think they believe they are, and I don't know that they would admit that they are. But, it is pretty clear that they are behaving like publications and that is really where the problem comes down to, is they are telling you they are an open community forum for people to get on and then they are behaving like publications, choosing what gets to reach its audience and what doesn't.And so, from that perspective, I think that is why it has created a lot of political problems for them. And that is why it has been getting worse and worse. And really to be honest, we are kind of probably a good thing for them because it shows that there is a marketplace where people can choose different platforms and that we can effectively get into this market and make a splash which has been really nice, this year and even last year too. And so, in a way, this is really the answer to a lot of those problems.BARTIROMO: Yes, well, I will tell you, I joined, I am will at - on Parler. But, how do you keep this app from becoming the other side of Twitter or essentially a Trump rally? That was a criticism raised in a recent article in Politico, how do you broaden out your user base? And tell us your business model; how do you make money?MATZE: Well, frankly a lot of these media outlets like to write articles about us like that; they unhappy that we have such a large audience now. That Politico article I think was very unfair. We have a lot of people coming on with different viewpoints because they are kind of tired of sitting there, going - look at this is where all these people I want to argue with are in debate and so they are going to join, and you are seeing diversity as a result of that.In terms of monetizing, since I last kind of spoke about it, we've seen a tremendous amount of interest in advertising. The only thing we haven't done is actually been able to sell them because we've been too busy focusing on growing our platform. So - I mean we have seen up to $50,000 a day in ad sales which is really great and really promising but as we grow, this is going to get earn better and bigger. And as we continue to make this more advanced ad network, it is going to be very, very nice for people.BARTIROMO: So, tell me what the growth plan is, how do you continue to grow in the coming five years? What is the strategy?MATZE: Well, I am focusing on the near-term right now; that's our big thing, is we want to make sure that the service is fast and that it is working well and that everybody gets to reach their audience. And as long as we can provide that, within the next year, I can see us growing another 10x from current capacity.Especially as the political situation when it comes to online censorship with Twitter and Facebook and all these other places, they continue to hamper down on conservatives with this ad boycott and everything that's going on, I'm curious to see what is going to happen with people like the President of the United States or other political leaders who want to have a fair discussion.And this is not just in the United States. Last week, we had large influx of people from Brazil. The President of Brazil joined our platform, and now we've got - Netanyahu joined this week from Israel. So, we are getting a lot of people from different countries around the world, not just the United States, that are experiencing the same issues with Twitter and other big tech companies.BARTIROMO: I mean it is creepy to know that you post something and then you don't see it for days in some cases. Is that shadow banning? I mean they say that they don't shadow ban and yet it feels like something is going on. They blame things on the algorithms. But, honestly, John, somebody is programming those algorithms.MATZE: Well, there's inherent bias in whoever programmed the algorithm. It's probably a handful of engineers, very small subset of people that are actually writing that code. And if they're not very careful, and they don't hyper focus on keeping it really clean and pure, they're going to have issues.Like what we did is we just made it chronological and so the idea is you opt into what you see. A lot of these other companies, what they like to do is try to reprioritize your news and your feed based off of what they think that you want to see in order to give you a "a better user experience." But in reality, what it's doing is it's kind of creating this concept that if they don't think other people want to see your content, it's not going to show up to other people. And so you're not going to reach your audience who opted in to following you.BARTIROMO: That's exactly right. So you just named a number of high profile people who've joined Parler. Do you feel like you're getting a group - liberal voices as well as conservatives? Do you feel like you're broadening out to the broader public?MATZE: Yes, I think we are. I don't think it's as quick, obviously, but we are seeing a lot of people coming on there. And some of them are just there to make nasty comments about how awful we are, and then tell us that they're organizing groups to make bad App Store reviews for us, because I've seen that too, unfortunately.But we also get some people coming in there for debate. They're going, you know, look at why are these people joining? I want to have a conversation with them. I want to find out what they're talking about and what they're trying to do, and they're coming in. So there is genuine interest there as well. Not just in the conservative community, but I think it's going to be a little bit of a long-term before they really start joining in more mass.BARTIROMO: Well, I know that most conservatives want to see this problem fixed by market share, by capitalism and the markets working, so you're obviously taking market share. We'll be watching John. Congrats to you. We hope you'll come back soon. Thank you, sir.MATZE: Thank you. Take care.BARTIROMO: John Matze, joining us there. Check out Parler.com.Fox Business alert right now, United Airlines is warning of potential furloughs as it sees bookings decline due to travel restrictions. According to "The Wall Street Journal" this morning, the airline says that bookings began to slide in June after New York, New Jersey and Connecticut announced a 14-day quarantine from a variety of coronavirus hotspots. The stock is down 3 percent right now on this news. United Airlines is going to be one to watch this morning with a decline of better than $1 a share.Coming up, the state of unemployment. People getting more money from the government than from working. We're taking a look at that.You are watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox BusinessBARTIROMO: Welcome back. Cracking down on unemployment fraud, some getting the unemployment COVID boost, despite not qualifying for the benefits. A group of former employees at one business now accused of cheating the system. Kristina Partsinevelos is with us. Now is there this morning. Good morning, Christina.KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning, Maria. What we're seeing is you have months of lockdown for a lot of these businesses and now they're facing a new predicament. They struggle to find workers, like you said.I'm standing in front of Morton Williams, a New York's grocery chain, and the corner says that many of his former employees are taking advantage of the system. Morton Williams has about 16 locations across the entire city. And the Co-owner, we spoke with him, and he said that many of those employees are trying to file for unemployment benefits even though they do not qualify and this comes at a time when he's struggling to find workers. Listen him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)AVI KANER, MORTON WILLIAMS CO-OWNER: Over the past four months we've let go off maybe three or four people total. Can you imagine that three or four people total in our entire chain of 1,200 people? We now have 600 unemployment claims, of which 160 have already been paid. It's - you know, it's just mind boggling.(END VIDEO CLIP)PARTSINEVELOS: If an employee gets fired or is like oh, for other reasons, they do not qualify for those unemployment benefits. And yet, if they still get them, then that can be considered fraud.We reached out to New York State to get information about this particular story and they responded saying, "Unemployment benefits are a lifeline for New Yorkers who lose their jobs and it is unacceptable that dishonest individuals would seek to defraud the system for their own gain. Make no mistake, attempting to cheat the unemployment system is a crime and we investigate all reports of fraud."Americans may be staying home because of course of health concerns, caregiving, but also because their combined income of the benefits is more than their income before the pandemic. We know that the federal government is giving out $600. At the state level it varies. Minimum amount here in New York is $172.Economists at the University of Chicago found that 70 percent of eligible workers are making more money post pandemic off of those benefits than before. And we have a situation even in Texas and Maria, I'm going to end with this.So, 46,000 Texans are being asked to give back their unemployment benefits to the tune of about $32 million, because they either received it because of error or because of fraud. And so this comes at a time when we're trying - businesses trying to rehire workers, deal with the paperwork about unemployment claims, and then possibly have to deal with increases in unemployment insurance rates, all at a time when doors are open, but business is far from pre-COVID levels. Back to you.BARTIROMO: That was an incredible soundbite that you played from Morton Williams CEO that they have laid off two or three people--PARTSINEVELOS: Yes.BARTIROMO: And they got 600 applications for unemployment benefits. Kristina, thank you.PARTSINEVELOS: Exactly.BARTIROMO: Kristina Partsinevelos in New York City this morning.Coming up, a major health warning. Florida on high alert this morning after a deadly brain eating Amoeba identified in the state. We're taking a look when we come right back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Coronavirus is not the only worry in Florida. This morning, officials there have issued a statewide warning confirming a case of a very rare and deadly brain eating amoeba - the tiny amoeba, typically found in warm fresh water like lakes, rivers and ponds.Joining us right now is family medicine, Dr. Jen Caudle. Dr. Caudle, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for being here. So what should we be aware of?JEN CAUDLE, FAMILY MEDICINE DOCTOR: Thank you. Yes, so well, first thing to know is that this is an amoeba. This is not a virus, it's not a bacteria. And you're right, it's found in warm freshwater lakes, rivers, as you mentioned. It can also be found in swimming pools that are not properly maintained, even hot springs.But the thing that you mentioned is it is sort of a brain eating Amoeba, which means it causes a condition called primary amebic meningoencephalitis, which is a brain infection. That's right. It gets in through the nose into the body, travels to the brain and actually destroys brain. So that's one of the really sort of tragic things about this.Maria, before we go on. I do want to give people some good news. Even though this is a very deadly condition, over 97 percent fatality rate. It is very rare. And that's a really good thing to know.BARTIROMO: So you said that it goes into the nose. How do people get infected?CAUDLE: That's right.BARTIROMO: Is this just a sneeze or cough? And is there a cure?CAUDLE: That's a great question. So you can't get this by drinking contaminated water or anything like that. You can't get this from, say, oceans, because again, it's fresh water. It's typically acquired from swimming or diving in warm bodies of fresh water.So what happens is sort of that force in going into the water, when the water goes into the nose, that's where it allows that amoeba to travel into the brain. The ways that we want you to prevent it are, of course, you can - avoiding warm bodies of fresh water, right? Swimming or doing activities and lakes and rivers, et cetera and things like that.But also, other ways of prevention would include holding your nose or using nose clips, and things like that. Of course, nothing is necessarily a 100 percent. This amoeba is found in lots of bodies of water. Once again, the good thing is it is very rare. The CDC says there have only been 145 reported cases between 1962 and 2018.But on the flipside, as I mentioned before, there's over a 97 percent mortality rate. Of those 145 only four have survived. So the treatment is pretty complicated. The treatments are not the best, and I still think they're kind of a work in progress.I think the most important thing for people to know is if they have symptoms of nausea, vomiting, headache, high fever, seizures, mental status changes, they feel dizzy, confused symptoms that are not right after swimming or honestly in any other time, you need to see your doctor promptly.BARTIROMO: You said that this also could happen in pools that are not maintained. So what does that mean for chlorine in pools. It's summertime, it's also tick season. Experts are also figuring an unusually bad season amid the coronavirus, so talk to us about what we're dealing with in terms of the summertime chlorine in the pools and tick season.CAUDLE: Yes. So the most important thing for those of you who have pools or when you're going to a local pool or things like that, it's important for that pool to be properly maintained, which means making sure it's properly cleaned, disinfected, chlorinated, and things like that.If a pool is properly maintained, we have very little concern, OK. It's when those pools are not properly maintained that we certainly get concerned for things like this amoeba and another things.Tick disease, Lyme disease, rather, avoid ticks. Make sure that you're wearing bug spray. You know, all of those prevention methods are really, really important for the summertime.BARTIROMO: All right, Dr. Jen Caudle, great to get your insights this morning. Thanks so much. We will see you soon. Jen. Thank you.CAUDLE: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Quick break and then more "Mornings with Maria." Right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets down about 200 points. Opening bell about 30 minutes from now. Dagen McDowell, Jon Hilsenrath, Michael Kantrowitz, great to see you. Thank you so much for being here.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: Thank you.Load-Date: July 7, 2020End of Document

Grand jury indicts Harvard prof for lying about China fundingPolitico.comJune 9, 2020 Tuesday 11:58 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 559 wordsHighlight: Charging documents say Charles Lieber had a relationship with the Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) while also chairing Harvard University's Department of Chemistry.BodyA grand jury has indicted one of the country's foremost chemists, Charles Lieber, on charges of lying to government officials. Lieber maintains his innocence. In a January criminal complaint, the Justice Department charged the Harvard scholar with lying to government officials about his work for a Chinese university. But the second step - indictment by grand jury - took months, as the novel coronavirus had stalled grand jury proceedings around the country. Now, the next step has officially been taken. The charging documents say that Lieber had a relationship with the Wuhan University of Technology (WUT), a prominent Chinese institution, while also chairing Harvard University's Department of Chemistry. Authorities also allege that when Department of Defense investigators asked Lieber about his relationship with WUT, he lied--and that he lied another time to Harvard, causing the university to share bad information about his affiliation with the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Lieber received grant funding from both DOD and NIH. In both instances, he allegedly denied participating in China's Thousand Talents Plan. The charging documents say that he actually was a participant. The Thousand Talents Plan recruits academics from around the world to research in China, working at Chinese institutions and with students there. The effort has raised concerns among American national security officials; a DOJ press release announcing the charges against Lieber said Thousand Talents and other similar programs "reward individuals for stealing proprietary information" and exist to further China's national security. Participating in the program isn't illegal. But it is illegal to lie to federal authorities as part of conversations about grant funding. "The government has this wrong," said his trial counsel, Marc Mukasey. "Professor Lieber has dedicated his life to science and to his students. Not money, not fame, just his science and his students. He is the victim in this case, not the perpetrator. But he's also a fighter - he always has been - so we're not taking this lying down. We're fighting back. And when justice is done, Charlie's good name will be restored and the scientific community again will be able to benefit from his intellect and passion."It's one of the highest-profile cases in the Justice Department's nationwide China Initiative, a project designed to counter Chinese espionage efforts in the U.S. The wide-ranging undertaking has homed in on academics who fail to disclose Chinese government funding to the U.S. government when applying for grants. DOJ officials argue that the Chinese government co-opts these American academics to advance its own interests. Critics of these cases say they turn professors into criminals for making clerical errors. In an interview with POLITICO earlier this year, Andrew Lelling - the U.S. Attorney supervising the Lieber prosecution--said his office has worked to build closer relationships within academia. "You get leads sometimes from the universities themselves, if they have a good working relationship with us and with the FBI," he said at the time. "A big component of the China Initiative is outreach."And John Demers, who heads the DOJ's National Security Division, said DOJ Headquarters has encouraged all 94 U.S. Attorney's Offices to bring China-related cases.Load-Date: June 10, 2020End of Document

The real reasons that led the United States to close china consulate in HoustonCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 23, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1055 wordsBodyThe United States lastordered China on Tuesday to close its consulate's operations in Houston, Texas, in a diplomatic movement that surprised the world and put the dispute between the two countries before a new phase. The regime promised to respond: its goal is to respond in equal measure and its target will probably be the American consular office in Chengdu, key to missions in Tibet, an always sensitive area.Immediately, upon the news broke, a call to the consulate's red phone in Houston gave a direct order: to burn all the confidential documents they were filing for years. The 60 employees who work there every day began to move quickly. The mandate was absolutely fulfilled. At such an extent that smoke began to leave the building of 3417 Montrose Blvd in that Texas city. To such an extent, reports were set on fire that firefighters must have attended to quell the flames.What information did Chinese diplomats want to turn Chinese diplomats into ashes? For american authorities, the consulate was the regime's "epicenter" of espionage in the United States. That was initially apparent by claiming that Beijing was conducting "illegal operations of mass influence and espionage."David Stilwell, who is in charge of the State Department's East Asia-Pacific policy, was more direct in an interview with The New York Times. "They had subversive behavior," Donald Trump's administration official reported. He revealed that the consul general, Cai Wei, along with two other diplomats from his country, were caught using fake ID cards. It happened last March 31 and they did so to accompany Chinese citizens to one of the main gates of George Bush International Airport to catch a charter flight that would return them to China in the middle of the pandemic. Why did they use official fake identities that can travel quietly with their international credentials?The flag of China flies in front of the Country Consulate General in Houston, Texas (Reuters) (ADREES LATIF/)But he went further. He said the consulate could be linked to the regime's recurrent attempts to steal information - to U.S. companies, laboratories, and institutions - on advances in the Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus vaccine that causes COVID-19 disease.The information given by Stilwell matches an FBI report accessed by the prestigious New York newspaper. Relevant points include: illegal transfer of medical research and other sensitive information from health institutions; recruitment of talents; the persuasion of more than 50 researchers, professors and academics to deliver their research or information to Chinese institutions. But it was also a center of pressure on their own citizens living in the United States who do not want to be oppressed by the regime: they want them to return to their homeland.The United States ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston "to protect American intellectual property and Americans' private information," a State Department spokesman had declared in the early hours of Wednesday. "The Vienna Convention says that state diplomats must 'respect the laws and rules of the host country' and 'have a duty not to interfere in the internal affairs of that state,'" the spokesman said.Morgan Ortagus on a visit by US diplomamaster Mike Pompeo to Copenhagen.The consulate in San Francisco, the next one?The prosecution reported Wednesday that a Chinese investigator who lied to the FBI about his membership in his country's military university entered china's consulate in San Francisco on June 20 last june and has remained there ever since. The suspect had been interviewed by FBI investigators regarding an alleged visa fraud, according to documents to which the Axios site had access.If the information were confirmed, China would be using one of its diplomatic facilities in the United States to house someone accused of a federal crime, which could cause serious tensions between the two countries, at a time when the relationship is going through a complex time.Scientists responding to the Chinese People's Army in one of its laboratories where they develop the coronavirus vaccine (Chinese government)In particular, the United States has taken a number of strong measures in recent times against Chinese espionage and the theft of investigation information, including the closure of that country's consulate in Houston."It is very unusual for a Chinese diplomatic post to be so closely associated with a suspect in a case involving intellectual property theft," said Axios, Minyao Wang, a New York lawyer who has worked on China-related intellectual property theft cases. The situation, how is unusual, makes the accusations more serious.On Tuesday night, indeed, the United States closed the Chinese consulate in Houston, a move that, according to State Department spokesman Morgan Ortagus, intends to "protect American intellectual property and americans' private information."Data theft, formal indictmentThe Justice Department on Tuesday accused two Chinese hackers of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars in trade secrets from companies around the world and, more recently, of attacking companies that develop a vaccine for coronavirus.The indictment, which will be detailed at a press conference, noted that hackers Li Xiaoyu, 34, and Dong Jiazhi, 33, had in recent months investigated vulnerabilities in the computer networks of publicly known companies for their work in developing vaccines and treatments.The accused hackers were working with China's Ministry of State Security, said John Demers, assistant attorney general for U.S. Homeland Security. In addition, they also targeted their cyberattacks against human rights activists in North America and Hong Kong.U.S. authorities believe That Li and Dong are in Chinese territory, beyond the scope of American justice. Prosecutors say in some instances acted "for their personal benefit" and others to give the Chinese government an advantage.MORE ON THIS TOPIC:U.S. ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in HoustonVideos of burning confidential documents at the Chinese consulate in Houston that THE US ordered to closeUS: Prosecutor's office claimed that a FBI wanted investigator is hidden at Chinese consulate in San FranciscoU.S. accused China government of hacking into companies to steal data on coronavirus vaccineLoad-Date: July 24, 2020End of Document

How China Co-opts HollywoodNewsweek.comJuly 20, 2020 Monday 6:00 AM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 2657 wordsByline: Paul BondHighlight: To gain access to what will soon be the world's biggest film market, Hollywood has had to bow to Chinese censors.  Will heightened tensions with the U.S. change that?BodyFor Hollywood, China is a big opportunity and maybe a bigger headache. The opportunity is that it is an enormous movie market, expected to soon become the biggest in the world. As Tuna Amobi, an entertainment analyst with investment research firm CFRA, says. "Every studio understands that to be successful internationally, the growth lies in China."The headache is that if Western producers want to show—or make­—a film in China they must first deal with an army of bureaucrats who decide what Chinese audiences can see. Their names are appropriately Orwellian: the State Ethnic Affairs Commission; the State Administration for Religious Affairs; the Publicity Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China; the Ministry of State Security and Safety and many more. Their jobs are to make sure not only that China is always portrayed favorably, but also that some subjects are never mentioned, Chief among them are the three T's: Taiwan, Tibet, Tiananmen. Also off limits: president Xi Jinping's attempt to extend his term of office indefinitely; the detention and torture of 13 million Uyghurs, Kazakhs and Turkish Muslims; the suppression of Christianity in China and the harassment of pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong.Hollywood has mostly gone discreetly along with that since China began opening to the western movie business in a big way in the 1990s (for a look at some of the films that have been censored, see page 41). Last summer Paramount Pictures, for instance, released a trailer for Top Gun: Maverick, its upcoming sequel to the 1986 blockbuster, co-produced with Chinese internet giant TenCent. (Originally set for release this June, the pandemic has pushed the film back to December.) One shot features Tom Cruise, as the now middle-aged title character, putting on what looks like the brown leather jacket he wore in the first film. In 1986, the jacket had commemorative Navy exercise patches featuring the flags of Taiwan (which split from mainland China in 1949) and Japan (China's bitterest regional rival). In the new trailer, the jacket looks the same, but the flags are gone. Paramount declined to talk about it with the press.There are some small but real signs, however, that the days of studios quietly tailoring American movies for China are numbered. U.S. relations with China have grown tense across the board. The change began with President Trump's trade war and now charges and counter-charges about COVID-19, Beijing's crackdown on Hong Kong and its ambitions in the South China Sea have only increased the temperature.Meanwhile, although public discussion of Chinese censorship remains taboo for the big studios, some filmmakers have been increasingly willing to complain­ and even, in a few cases, resist. This spring, Congressional conservatives proposed legislation that would punish American producers for censoring their films to satisfy Beijing. Exhibit A? Tom Cruise's jacket. As Texas Republican Ted Cruz asked from the floor of the U.S. Senate this May, "What message does it send that Maverick, an American icon, is apparently afraid of the Chinese communists?"Paramount, Universal Pictures, Disney, 20th Century Fox, Sony Pictures, MGM and Warner Bros. declined to speak to Newsweek about their China strategies. Newsweek, however, spoke to dozens of current and former movie industry insiders, all of whom said censorship is the primary impediment into breaking into the Chinese market in any meaningful way.Staggering Potential Before coronavirus shuttered theaters worldwide, China was on track to become the planet's biggest movie market in 2021, with $11.2 billion in box office receipts compared to $10.9 billion for the U.S, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. At the end of 2019, China boasted 69,000 movie screens, up from just 9,700 a year earlier, according to The People's Daily, a mouthpiece for the country's ruling Communist party. CFRA analyst Amobi, says, "2020 is a lost year, but there's no question China will regain its prominence probably in 2021."Hollywood has been chasing Chinese revenues since 1971 when President Richard Nixon ended a two-decade trade embargo and allowed studios to license their films to China, usually for about $20,000 a film. A nominal fee, but the alternative was surrendering to rampant piracy and getting nothing. By the 1990s, China was allowing a few U.S. films into China every year on a revenue-sharing basis, including hits like Warner Bros's The Fugitive, Paramount's Forrest Gump and Disney's The Lion King, according to the book China's Encounter with Global Hollywood (University Press of Kentucky, 2016) by Wendy Su. But the dollars for Hollywood were still small, with studios only getting about 13 percent of ticket sales, according to Chris Fenton, a production executive who has done business with China for more than two decades.Since a deal was struck in 2012, China now allows 34 foreign films into the country annually and the studios get 25 percent of the box office with the rest going to Chinese firms, including government-owned distributors China Film Group and Huaxia Film Distribution Co.. But movie industry insiders, speaking on condition of anonymity, say 34 is more a floor than ceiling, especially since studios can co-produce with a Chinese company and thus avoid having their movie classified as "foreign." That was the case with The Great Wall which featured Matt Damon and a cast of Chinese and western supporting actors, in 2016, and the upcoming Top Gun: Maverick."The fact that major American blockbusters have been casting Chinese film stars, or even filming scenes in China, as a way to capture their moviegoers' attention is extremely telling," says Jeff Bock, a senior analyst with Hollywood data firm Exhibitor Relations Co. "While studios don't receive as large a cut from the box office in China as they do domestically or in other territories, the growth potential is staggering and worth the risk."Jamie Chen, a Shanghai-based senior analyst at investment firm Third Bridge Research, agrees, pointing out that while about 1,000 films are produced annually by China's domestic film industry only about 400 of them are deemed worthy of theatrical release. Even prior to COVID-19, "the vacancy rate in Chinese cinemas was huge," Chen says. That leaves a large void for U.S. studios to fill—if they are willing to play ball.Those considering not playing have long had the example of Richard Gere to consider. On the red carpet outside the 1993 Oscars, Gere, then near his A-list star peak, protested China's "horrendous" occupation of Tibet. Gere has said his continuing stand on Tibet seriously damaged his career as the Chinese market grew in size and importance. In 2017, Gere, who declined to speak to Newsweek, told an industry trade publication, "I recently had an episode where someone said they could not finance a film with me because it would upset the Chinese." (Similarly, Brad Pitt's role in 1997's Seven Years in Tibet reportedly landed him on China's do-not-cast list for a while, though in 2013 World War Z was allowed to open in Hong Kong where it earned a modest $5.5 million).Since then Hollywood filmmakers have gotten used to Chinese interference over things big and little. Producer Jerry Molen, who has produced several Steven Spielberg movies including Schindler's List, says often the meddling is about trivia. "The Chinese will ask for everything expecting to get something," he says. "Sometimes, it's an actor or scenes filmed in China. It doesn't mean you have to show Shanghai, Beijing and The Great Wall in all their glory, but you can never show them in a bad light." In 2018, Molen was executive producer on The Meg, a co-production of Warner Bros. and China Media Capital about an enormous prehistoric shark. The hero scientists in the movie are Chinese. The film was a box office success, earning $530 million worldwide, $153 million coming from China.For Disney's 2013 Iron Man 3, state-owned China Film Group wanted a hospital scene to be filmed in one of its then-new sound stages in Beijing. Producer Chris Fenton was at time president of Beijing-based DMG Entertainment Motion Picture Group which released the film in China. He's now CEO of Media Capital Technologies and the author of Feeding the Dragon: Inside the Trillion Dollar Dilemma Facing Hollywood, the NBA & American Business, which Post Hill Press will release on July 28. Fenton says, "The floors were made of faulty, cracked bricks that slowly disintegrated into dust as the crew and equipment moved over them, The bricks coughed up more and more dust to the point where we all needed to wear masks in order to breathe." Ultimately, most of the hopelessly foggy hospital footage was unusable.A Chinese requirement for co-productions with foreigners is that there be only one version shown worldwide, effectively allowing Chinese censors to decide what international audiences can see. Producer Matthew Malek, who has helped get multiple U.S. movies into Chinese theaters says, "Even when the Chinese tell you they just want control over what's seen in China, the contracts they send over have a clause that the China version becomes the master version. They don't admit that, but I've seen it enough times. There's no way around it, unless you're a giant studio that's created a movie knowing what the Chinese want from the beginning."Sometimes the requirement can be finessed. On Iron Man 3 in 2013, Disney appeased Beijing by adding a few Chinese actors and products to the film—only for a version released in China. The same year, however, Paramount's zombie apocalypse thriller World War Z starring Brad Pitt was released. In Max Brooks's 2006 novel, scientists and doctors believe a pandemic of undead cannibalism had its start in China. There is no mention of that in the film. At the time of release, Paramount denied reports that a scene discussing China as possible zombie ground zero had been shot for a planned non-China version of the film, but cut when Chinese authorities insisted only one version be released worldwide.Of the major studios, insiders say, Disney is the most successful at doing business with China, as the studio's ability to manage the authorities on Iron Man 3 shows. The company has successfully partnered with the government on its theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong, even replacing trademark attractions like Space Mountain with spectacular only-in-China rides at the insistence of authorities. Last year the studio's Avengers: End Game became the biggest grossing film in history, hauling in $2.8 billion worldwide, with $614 million, or about 22 percent, coming from China.Similarly, Disney has high hopes for its upcoming live-action version of Mulan, based on the Chinese folk tale of a young woman who poses as a man to take her ailing father's place in the army. When a teaser trailer for the film went online last year, 52 million people in China watched it in the first 24 hours. But last summer in the midst of a growing crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong, actor Liu Yifei, who plays the title character, tweeted her support of the Hong Kong police. The backlash was swift and loud and spawned an ongoing campaign to boycott the movie when it opens. After Liu's tweets, Twitter suspended about 1,000 accounts boosting the hashtag #SupportMulan, saying they were Chinese state-backed bots designed to undermine "the legitimacy and political positions of the protest movement."While studios like Disney have worked hard to get along with China, some filmmakers have spoken out. Speaking on a panel at the 2014 Beijing International Film Festival director Oliver Stone said he had tried and failed three times to complete co-productions with Chinese film companies due to meddling from authorities. One project was an adaptation of the memoir Red Azalea (first published by Pantheon Books in 1994) by Anchee Min, a lesbian love story set during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s. Same-sex relationships are forbidden by Chinese censors. 20th Century Fox cut all references to Freddie Mercury's homosexuality from Chinese prints of its 2019 hit Bohemian Rhapsody. Even more sensitive is any discussion of the Cultural Revolution and any criticism, implicit or otherwise, of Chairman Mao or the Communist party's actions during those agonizing years.Last year, China blocked Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in…Hollywood over its portrayal of martial arts legend Bruce Lee. In the film, Lee, played by Mike Moh, is depicted as a preening blowhard who is fought to a draw by stuntman Cliff Booth, played by Brad Pitt. Lee's family didn't like it and neither did Beijing, which insisted it be cut from the film. Tarantino, the rare director who is able to insist on final cut, refused.Wakeup Call? If the push and pull between Hollywood and China has mostly been played out in offices and editing rooms, it has now begun to move to a much noisier arena. On May 21, Senator Ted Cruz introduced a bill dubbed SCRIPT ("The Stopping Censorship, Restoring Integrity, Protecting Talkies Act") that would cut off the help studios receive from the Department of Defense if they censor films to placate the Chinese."Hollywood companies have learned that China censors American films, so they often change their films in advance of submitting them to the Chinese market," Cruz tells Newsweek. "Chinese censors control not just what Chinese audiences see, but also what American audiences see." Cruz, one of three U.S lawmakers recently barred by Chinese officials, says his bill is a "wakeup call" to Hollywood and would also prevent the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security from helping studios that submit to Chinese censors. Cruz says the point is forcing producers "to choose between the assistance they need from the American government and the money they want from the Chinese film market."Hollywood is not taking Cruz's bill very seriously. Producer Chris Fenton thinks it should. "Whether this particular bill gets momentum should not be the focus...Surveys have shown voters are wary of China, and it's an election year," he says.Meanwhile Wisconsin Representative Mike Gallagher, a Republican, is lobbying U.S. studios to disclose when their films are presented—at every stage, from screenwriting through completion­—to China's censors. What Gallagher has in mind is a notice in the credits like the "no animals were harmed in the making of this film" disclaimer many films carry.A particularly egregious example of Hollywood appeasement of China, Gallagher tells Newsweek, is the 2012 remake of Red Dawn, produced by the small studio Film District along with MGM and Sony. When principal photography was over, the film was about a bunch of small-town American teens fighting off an invasion by China. In post-production, though, MGM and Sony digitally altered it so the invasion came from North Korea. Gallagher says he doesn't see any pro-Chinese Communist Party ideology in that kind of move by Hollywood, just a desire to make money. He says, "Filmmakers aren't waking up each morning thinking about the nature of the CCP, but it's fair to say they haven't woken to the threat it poses, either.""Hollywood has difficult decisions to make between the bottom line and the values it stands for," says Gallagher. "Hollywood certainly has no reservations about preaching to Americans, and there's no shortage of movies portraying America as evil, bad and racist. But it certainly seems it's on the wrong side when it comes to China, which is engaged in ideological warfare."This is the same ideological battle that the Soviet Union fought and lost when it tried to keep Western movies, music, books and ideas out during the Cold War. The Chinese learned an important lesson from that failure and decided not to ban Western culture. Instead, they have worked hard—and for the most part successfully—to co-opt it.Link to ImageGraphic FEA_China_OPENERIllustration by Alex FineFEA_China_OPENERLoad-Date: July 20, 2020End of Document

EXIM CHAIRMAN KIMBERLY REED DELIVERS REMARKS AT CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: "FUTURE DIRECTIONS OF THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK OF THE UNITED STATES: NEUTRALIZING CHINA AND ADVANCING THE UNITED STATES COMPARATIVE LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD"States News ServiceJuly 31, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 3163 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Export-Import Bank:Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) President and Chairman of the Board of Directors Kimberly A. Reed today delivered remarks (virtually) "Future Directions of the Export-Import Bank of the United States: Neutralizing China and Advancing the United States Comparative Leadership in the World"at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).Following a series of recent remarks made by National Security Advisor Ambassador Robert C. O'Brien, FBI Director Christopher Wray, Attorney General William P. Barr, U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper, and U.S. Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeoexplaining the different facets of America's relationship with China, Chairman Reed underscored the magnitude of Chinese state-backed unfair competition, which undermines U.S. exporters and puts America at a disadvantage in key sectors critical to the United States' long-term economic and national security. She highlighted how our nation is taking a competitive approach to these, and other, challenges posed by Beijing, as outlined in the United States Strategic Approach to the People's Republic of China.Chairman Reed's remarks focused on EXIM's new "Program on China and Transformational Exports" (China Program)one of the most significant initiatives in EXIM's 86-year historywhich was established in the agency's historic bipartisan Congressional reauthorization and signed into law by President Trump on December 20, 2019. The law charges EXIM with a goal of reserving at least 20 percent$27 billionof its $135 billion financing authorityfor the China Program, and with advancing "the comparative leadership of the United States" with respect to China, and supporting "United States innovation, employment, and technological standards," through direct exports in key industries, including 5G, fintech, renewable energy, biomedical sciences, biotechnology, artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced computing, and semiconductors. More generally, EXIM is placing emphasis on technologies critical to long-term American prosperity and security, such as space technology.Following Chairman Reed's formal remarks, she joined Daniel Runde, Senior Vice President, William A. Schreyer Chair and Director, Project on Prosperity and Development at CSIS, who also serves as Chair of EXIM's Sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee, for a "fireside discussion." You can find a full recording of the event here."It is an honor to join CSIS' Dan Runde and more than 200 attendees virtuallyjust over one year since I was sworn in as President and Chairman of EXIM to reflect on the important work we have done to support U.S. exporters and workers, and highlight opportunities for the future," said Chairman Reed. "In the last year, we have successfully reopened, reauthorized, and reformed the agency. In that historic reauthorization, signed into law by President Trump, Congress recognized on a bipartisan basis EXIM's strategic value as a tool to counter the People's Republic of China's unfair and aggressive trade practices. I am excited to continue supporting U.S. businesses and workers by helping to level the playing field for American exporters, as we, through a whole-of-government approach, neutralize Chinese export subsidies, and advance the United States comparative leadership in the world. I'd also like to thank Dan Runde for his service and invaluable insight as Chair of EXIM's Sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee."Chairman Reed added, "Our agency has actively engaged important members of the nation's high-tech industrial base to solicit their views on how the agency can be more helpful in supporting their exports abroad. This outreach will hopefully drive new significant deal flow supporting U.S. jobs. But, weIwant more. A lot moreparticularly deals supporting smaller but growing companies, which have been an exciting source of innovation around the country. Where those capabilities have been developed in the United Stateswe must support their export. With this in mind, EXIM can support U.S. technology innovators in their desire to compete in the international marketplace, which is a vitally important part of our overall economic and national security approach to addressing China's ambitions to technologically dominate worldwide."You can find a full transcript of Chairman Reed's remarks as prepared for delivery below, or by clicking here.Kimberly A. ReedPresident and Chairman of the Board of DirectorsExport-Import Bank of the United StatesRemarks at Center for Strategic and International Studies (Virtual Event)Future Directions of the Export-Import Bank of the United States: Neutralizing China and Advancing the United States Comparative Leadership in the WorldWashington, D.C.July 31, 2020Remarks as Prepared for DeliveryThank you, Dan Runde, for hosting me today. Dan, I so appreciate the great work you are doing by chairing our Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) Sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee. Your commitment and understanding of the connection between the private sector and good governance in extending freedom and prosperity, especially to Africa and the developing world, really comes through in your leadership of the Committee.I also want to thank the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) for all the innovative thinking and sound judgment this organization has applied to our nation's security over so many years, and for working to make the world safer and freer.I join you virtually today from my office at EXIM, which is on the northeast corner of Lafayette Park and overlooks the White House. This agency was created in 1934, and it is an honor to serve as the first woman President and Chairman of the Board of Directors of EXIM. You will see behind me on the walls of this historic office knotty pine paneling, which, as the first West Virginian to lead EXIM in its 86-year history, has a special meaning to me.We all continue to contend with the difficulties brought on by the COVID-19 global pandemic, but Americans will succeed in returning to greatness, health, and peace of mind. Banishing fear today means together re-opening, safely and effectively, the greatest economy the world has ever seenan economy the American people built thanks to President Trump's policies of cutting taxes, reining in regulation, and standing up for American workers.But to return to that greatness we must fearlessly use all the tools we have available. One of the most important tools is export finance.This is where my agency comes in. EXIM fills gaps in private export finance to bolster U.S. job growth. EXIM does this through trade financing solutions such as export credit insurance, working capital guarantees, and guarantees of commercial loans to foreign buyersall of it to empower the exporters of U.S. goods and services.When I look out my window and see the White House, I thank President Trump for nominating my fellow Board Members, Spencer Bachus and Judith Pryor, and me. This bold step led to the full reopening of EXIM after nearly four years of dormancy except to transactions under $10 million. Between 2015 and 2019, EXIM had no quorum of its Board of Directors, and so its ability to perform its mission of supporting U.S. jobs by facilitating American exports was severely limited. And, the world changed a lot over those four years, particularly when it comes to the People's Republic of China. But with the firm support of the President and a strong bipartisan majority in Congress, that quorum was restored with our U.S. Senate confirmation on May 8, 2019. I also appreciate the important contributions U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, who serve as ex officio Members of EXIM's Board of Directors.On July 20, our nation celebrated the 51st anniversary of the historic moon landing. I felt that same sense of American innovation and purpose when, at Andrews Air Force Base on December 20, 2019, President Trump established the Space Force and, later that night on Air Force One, signed into law EXIM's historic reauthorization. Thanks to the President's leadership and bipartisan support in the Congress, EXIM was reauthorized for the longest period in its 86-year historya historic seven years. This gives needed certainty to U.S. businesses and stakeholders, as well as to the world.In the short time since, EXIM has already made great progress on behalf of American business and U.S. workers. In Fiscal Year 2019, EXIM authorized a total of $8.2 billion in financingincluding $2.2 billion for small businessesand this is estimated to support 34,000 U.S. jobs. Thus far in Fiscal Year 2020, as of June 30, EXIM has authorized $1.9 billion in financing that is estimated to support 12,000 U.S. jobs. Just yesterday, the EXIM Board of Directors approved a $97.2 million transaction supporting 800 U.S. jobs, mainly in Florida, that utilized an EXIM COVID-19 economic recovery measure. And we look forward to considering more transactions soon, while also protecting the American taxpayer.Congress mandated in our Charter that EXIM focus on promoting the expansion of EXIM's financial commitments in sub-Saharan Africa. The EXIM Board unanimously authorized one of the largest transactions in EXIM's history, a $4.7 billion transaction assisting the construction of a liquified natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique. It involves 68 U.S. suppliers supporting 16,700 American jobs in Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and the District of Columbia. Follow-on sales are expected to support thousands of additional jobs across the United States. And this transaction is significant not only because of its historic size, the U.S. jobs supported, and the potential for economic freedom for the Mozambique people, but because EXIM's involvement helped displace Chinese and Russian financing from this deal.Speaking of China, that country has changed the nature of global competition over the past years with a pre-meditated strategy of aggressive official export financing. It totaled at least $76 billion in 2019, dwarfing that of any other country. Its official medium- and long-term export credit activity was roughly equal to that of all G7 countries combinedfor the second year in a row.China has been the catalyst for most major export credit agencies becoming more proactive. There were 85 export credit agencies four years ago; now there are 115a striking 35-percent increase from 2015 to 2019.Last month, I was pleased to submit EXIM's annual Report to the U.S. Congress on Global Export Credit Competition. The Report underscores the magnitude of Chinese state-backed unfair competition, which undermines our U.S. exporters and even puts America at a disadvantage in key sectors critical to our long-term economic and national security. Fortunately, our nation is taking a competitive approach to these, and other, challenges posed by Beijing, as outlined in the United States Strategic Approach to the People's Republic of China released in May.Over the last few years, the Trump Administration has pursued a comprehensive, whole-of-government approach to helping the United States maintain its technological edge over geopolitical competitors, particularly, China. National Security Advisor Ambassador Robert C. O'Brien ("The Chinese Communist Party's Ideology and Global Ambitions" at the Arizona Commerce Authority Conference Center), FBI Director Christopher Wray ("The Threat Posed by the Chinese Government and the Chinese Community Party to the Economic and National Security of the United States" at the Hudson Institute), Attorney General William P. Barr (Remarks on China Policy at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum), U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper ("U.S. Vision for Security in the Indo-Pacific Region" at the International Institute for Strategic Studies), and U.S. Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo ("Communist China and the Free World's Future" at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum) recently delivered a series of remarks explaining the different facets and implications of America's relationship with China.When it comes to EXIM, as part of our historic seven-year bipartisan reauthorization, Congress directed that EXIM establish a new "Program on China and Transformational Exports" (China Program), one of the most significant initiatives in EXIM's 86-year history. The purpose of the China Program is "to support the extension of loans, guarantees, and insurance, at rates and on terms and other conditions ... fully competitive with rates, terms, and other conditions established by the People's Republic of China."EXIM's new legislative mandate will enable us to be a bold and innovative partner when our great U.S. companies and workers, seeking to compete against China all around the world, need support and private financing is not available.The law charges EXIM with a goal of reserving at least 20 percent$27 billionof our $135 billion financing authorityfor the China Program, and with advancing "the comparative leadership of the United States" with respect to China, and supporting "United States innovation, employment, and technological standards," through direct exports in key industries, including 5G, fintech, renewable energy, biomedical sciences, biotechnology, artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced computing, and semiconductors. More generally, EXIM is placing emphasis on technologies critical to long-term American prosperity and security, such as space technology.I recruited David Trulio, a senior leader from the Pentagon with tremendous leadership and international business experience in both the public and private sectors, to serve as my Counselor and Senior Vice President for the Program on China and Transformational Exports.Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich recently wrote that without EXIM "there is no practical, clear way to compete against the ever-expanding Chinese economic-military machine." With this new Program on China, EXIM is directly taking on China's opaque and exploitative model of economic development and finance, while at the same time supporting American jobs.Over just the last few months, our agency has actively engaged important members of the nation's high-tech industrial base to solicit their views on how the agency can be more helpful to them in supporting their exports abroad.This outreach will hopefully drive new significant deal flow supporting U.S. jobs. But, weIwant more. A lot moreparticularly deals supporting smaller but growing companies, which have been an exciting source of innovation around the country. Not only in Silicon Valley and New York, but also in places like Austin, Orlando, Denver, Atlanta, Raleigh-Durham, and Phoenix, and even in West Virginiaall of which are maintaining exciting emerging technology ecosystems that need to be supported.Why? Because the mission is that important. The United States and China are increasingly on separate paths in the development and use of powerful, foundational technologies around the world. It began with 5G and drone technology and will likely continue through AI, advanced and quantum computing, and other emerging technologies.Where those capabilities have been developed in the United Stateswe must support their export. With this in mind, EXIM can support U.S. technology innovators in their desire to compete in the international marketplace, which is a vitally important part of our overall economic and national security approach to addressing China's ambitions to technologically dominate worldwide.This is what Congress wants us to do. And, this is what the President wants us to do. In this mission, EXIM must succeed.EXIM also is implementing six reforms from Congress to which I, someone who believes in free markets and prosperity while not unilaterally disarming to the disadvantage of the United States, am personally committed:Increasing transparency;Strengthening taxpayer protections;Improving protections for domestic companies;Ensuring EXIM does not "crowd out" private financing options;Cracking down on bad actors; andWorking to reduce the reliance on export credit agencies globally.To better ensure that EXIM is not competing with private capital, EXIM has amended the agency's economic impact procedures to better assess the potential impacts of its pending transactions on relevant domestic industries. And EXIM has strengthened its determination of "additionality"why a transaction could not go forward without EXIM financing and therefore requires EXIM support. The agency now will require an overall more robust process and more written documentation from applicants to determine additionality, from the inception of each transaction until it is presented for Board consideration.In the past, EXIM has been needed most during periods of stress in global financial markets. This was the case following the 2008 financial crisis when EXIM authorizations increased 80 percent. When COVID-19 impacted our country and the world, EXIM took swift action and we continue to respond to the U.S. and global financial disruptions and instabilities.At the outset of the crisis, EXIM quickly mobilized as part of a whole-of-government approach to focus on the pandemic economic recovery. I am so proud of our 515 employees and contractors at EXIM for how, on a temporary basis, they transformed into a fully-teleworking agency, putting health and safety first as they worked with American exporters to reduce the negative economic impacts of the pandemicespecially when it comes to U.S. jobs.I just want to say what an immense honor it is to be a part of furthering this historic effort to support and advance America's prosperity. EXIM's new vision is "Keeping America Strong: Empowering U.S. Businesses and Workers to Compete Globally." EXIM is going to be serving American businesses of all sizes that seek to export; we are going to continue to be supporting U.S. jobs, and helping to keep America strong for years to come.Thank you again, Dan. I am happy to take questions.ABOUT EXIM:EXIM is an independent federal agency that promotes and supports American jobs by providing competitive and necessary export credit to support sales of U.S. goods and services to international buyers. A robust EXIM can level the global playing field for U.S. exporters when they compete against foreign companies that receive support from their governments. EXIM also contributes to U.S. economic growth by helping to create and sustain hundreds of thousands of jobs in exporting businesses and their supply chains across the United States. In recent years, approximately 90 percent of the total number of the agency's authorizations has directly supported small businesses. Since 1992, EXIM has generated more than $9 billion for the U.S. Treasury for repayment of U.S. debt.Load-Date: August 1, 2020End of Document

China and India are sparring but neither can afford a full-on trade warCNN WireJuly 3, 2020 Friday 10:26 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1246 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Last month's deadly border battle between India and China has already begun to affect business and technology. But the world's two most populous countries have a lot to lose should the dispute escalate into a full-on trade war. New Delhi has indicated that it is willing to exert economic pressure on its neighbor. Trade organizations in the country reported last week that Chinese shipments were suddenly being held up at Indian checkpoints, while authorities in one state paused hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Chinese business deals. And earlier this week India took the dramatic step of banning dozens of mobile apps, including well-known Chinese ones like ByteDance's TikTok, Tencent's WeChat, and social media network Weibo.The backlash has reached the highest political levels: Weibo said this week that it had removed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's account at the Indian government's request.Beijing's response so far has been cautious. Chinese officials said Tuesday that they were "strongly concerned" about the app ban, for example, but they did not threaten any kind of retaliation. And on Friday, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stressed that the two countries should work together, adding that barriers to cooperation "will harm India's interests." Some Chinese state media have called for "cooler" heads to prevail. "As of now, China is only assessing the situation," said Geethanjali Nataraj, an economics professor at the Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA). A "trade war is not going to benefit either of the countries," she added.China's tough lineChina has plenty of leverage, if it chooses to retaliate for India's app ban.It has long been a critical trade partner for India. From April 2019 to March 2020, India bought $65 billion worth of goods from China, accounting for nearly 14% of its total imports, according to Indian government data. Meanwhile, China bought $16.6 billion worth of goods from India. China was India's second largest trading partner for that period behind the United States, though that value of trade does not include Hong Kong.India accounts for a much smaller share of China's total trade. Exports to India comprised only 3% of China's total in 2019, according to Chinese government statistics. And India was only China's 12th biggest trade partner last year.But analysts who spoke to CNN Business stressed that any kind of warfare, economic or otherwise, with an Asian neighbor would be costly for Beijing. The world's second largest economy is already managing pressures on several fronts, including a Western backlash over a new, controversial security law for Hong Kong and its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. China is also managing its own economic struggles, including a historic first-quarter contraction and rising unemployment. "China is holding a tough line on the territorial dispute with India, but it doesn't want to see a confrontation," according to Deng Yuwen, a researcher at the US-based think tank China Strategic Analysis Center, who detailed his thoughts in a video posted online last month.Nataraj of the IIPA pointed out that China also likely doesn't want to jeopardize its trading relationship with India, either, given the fact that the country still sends tens of billions of dollars of goods to India each year."Chinese companies are already facing trade restrictions from [the United States] and other countries, and they are faced with over capacity," she said. "Therefore, it is not easy for China to ignore a big market like India."Even so, there are political considerations at play for Beijing. Deng said that China can't be too "soft" on territorial disputes, or else it could risk angering the public. "The Chinese public doesn't think China should give in to India," Deng added. "In the people's perspective, China and India are like two boxers of different weight classes. It shouldn't be hard for the heavyweight to defeat the lightweight." (India does, however, have significant experience with ground combat and air forces, and recent studies suggest the country maintains an edge in high-altitude mountainous environments, such as the one where the 2020 face-off is taking place.)India's dilemmaIndia, meanwhile, is likely to "lose more" from engaging in a trade war with China, according to Nataraj. Like many other countries, Asia's third-largest economy has been hit hard by the pandemic and the lockdown measures it imposed to prevent the virus from spreading. Industrial production shrank dramatically this spring, while the services industry collapsed. Business activity was still struggling through June, according to data about the services sector released Friday.Nataraj said that many industries in India --- including electronics, pharmaceuticals and IT hardware --- are heavily dependent on imports, particularly from China. Shipping and delivery companies have confirmed that the dispute is already causing disruption. DHL Express India told CNN Business on Friday that it is "temporarily suspending pick up of import shipments from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao due to recent delays in customs clearance of shipments into India." And FedEx said that it is "currently facing backlogs beyond our control, leading to congestion at our facilities.""Though there is nothing wrong in [being] vocal for local [business], the immediate short term anti-China momentum would affect the supply chain of Indian production networks," Nataraj said, adding that arbitrary import restrictions or consumer boycotts will be largely "self-defeating."Potential retaliationEven if both countries have reason to not engage in a trade war, analysts pointed out that raw emotions could push them toward escalation."There is a clear understanding in India that China could retaliate and that India is more dependent on Chinese products than the other way round, but the mood in India is one of acute resentment and anger," according to Kanti Bajpai, a professor at the National University of Singapore who studies Indian foreign policy and India-China relations. At least 20 Indian soldiers died during June's clash with Chinese troops in the Himalayas, according to the Indian army."If the confrontation persists, Delhi may take economic actions on trade as well," Bajpai added.In retaliation, Beijing could "slow walk" some of the market access it has promised India in areas such as pharmaceuticals and agriculture, according to Rick Rossow, the Wadhwani Chair in US-India Policy Studies at the Washington-based Center for Strategies and International Studies.China could also pull back on new investments it was looking to make in India, he said. Investment from China has poured into Indian startups and manufacturing but it was already becoming a point of contention. In April, the Indian government announced that foreign direct investment from countries that share a land border with India would be subject to more scrutiny."The economic consequences of these moves are likely to be modest initially, but the bigger impact could come if India decides to break away from China and secure stronger strategic ties with countries such as the United States, Japan, Australia and France," Rossow added.--- Shawn Deng, Swati Gupta, Manveena Suri, Jordan Valinsky Philip Wang, Isaac Yee and Hanna Ziady contributed to this report.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

As protests spread in U.S., China enjoys turmoilCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 2, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1057 wordsBodyThe cartoon shows the Statue of Liberty shattered, a police officer who shows up in his copper suit. The head of a man lying on the floor in front of the White House, and his facade splattered with blood."Under human rights," says the title of the cartoon, published by the People's Daily, the flagship diary of the Chinese Communist Party, which circulates widely on social media sites this week.As protests over police violence spread in hundreds of U.S. cities, China is lounging over this moment,clinging to riots to trumpet the strength of its authoritarian system and portray turbulence, even as another sign of American hypocrisy and decline. It is a tale that ignores the desirability, many of the country's other problems, including its history of ethnic discrimination, its human rights background and its efforts to quell the protests in Hong Kong.Chinese officials are drilling their U.S. counterparts with protest slogans like "Black Lives Matter" and "I Can't Breathe." The state media shows stories of the "double standard" of the United States to support Hong Kong protesters. Prominent Chinese commentators debate that American-style democracy is a farce, pointing to the country's sloppy response to the coronavirus pandemic and today's racial tensions."This situation in the U.S. will make many more Chinese support their government in their efforts to denounce and counter the United States," Song Guoyou, an academic at Fudan University in Shanghai, said in an interview. "America's moral livelihood is really very weakened."The propaganda push is the latest skirmish in a long-standing power struggle between China and the United States, with tensions between the two countries at their lowest point in decades.President Donald Trump accused Beijing of hiding the coronavirus outbreak that began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, saying China would be held accountable for deaths in the United States and around the world. He also threatened to punish the Asian giant for advancing the adoption of a new broad security law in Hong Kong, by restricting the city's special relationship with the United States.Now, protests in the United States give Xi jinping and Communist Party propagandists a natural line for counterattack.Chinese social media sites are filled with video clips of tense clashes between police and protesters following George Floyd's death last week, after he was killed on the floor by a white Minneapolis police officer, who has since been charged with murder. Television shows show videos of National Guard troops patrolling the city streets, while presenters describe the long history of discrimination against minorities in the United States. Social media sites describe the United States as lawless and chaotic:"This isn't Syria, it's America!" a caption says on a popular site.Global Times, a party-controlled nationalist newspaper, calls on the U.S. government to "take a stand with the people of Minnesota." Its publisher, in a tweet, directly challenged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who had said "we support the people of Hong Kong" in his condemnation of Beijing's move to impose national security rules."Violent protests on the streets of U.S. cities also discredit the United States in the eyes of the commonChina," said Susan Shirk, president of the China 21st Century Center in the U.C. San Diego. "The propaganda describes American politicians as hypocrites living in a greenhouse while throwing stones at China."Shirk said that as America's reputation suffers in China, fewer people might want to express their support for American ideals, such as free markets and civil liberties."Even without propaganda, the Chinese people today find little to admire in the U.S.," he said. "As the U.S. model fogs, the voice of Chinese liberals is silenced."Heavy hand in Hong KongWhile Chinese officials have cheerfully joined the global chorus of criticisms targeting the United States, the unrest put them in a difficult situation.China's government has long maintained strict limits on freedom of expression and activism, and authorities often resort to aggressive tactics to overturn unrest. Police in Hong Kong, where the government is backed by Beijing, have been accused of abusing force, when they sought to suppress protests against the government that convulsed semi-autonomous territory last year.With unequivocal comparisons to Hong Kong, many commentators on the continent have stopped supporting the tactics used by American protesters, rather than denouncing racism in the United States in general terms and resuming the slogans of the protest."The chronic racial wound in America now resurfaces again," according to a report from Xinhua, the state news agency.The Chinese government, in its first official statement on Trump's move against Beijing's national security rules, directly pointed to the United States for its hypocrisy. A spokesman for Chinese foreign minister Zhao Lijian watched Monday as American officials described protesters in his country as "duckists," but glorified protesters in Hong Kong as "heroes."Hong Kong executive chairman Carrie Lam echoed the party line tuesday, accusing the United States of having "double standard.""When it comes to the security of your country, they give you great importance," he said in a regular news report. "When it comes to the security of my country, especially the current situation in Hong Kong, they change the colour to the crystals they look at."Nationalism was fully in force in recent days on the Internet in China, where many people on Weibo, a popular platform denounced "the arrogance" of the United States and Trump. Hashtags about protests in the U.S., including the decision to deploy the National Guard in some cities, were among the most popular trends on the site.Increasing voltageSome are concerned that the propaganda campaign could further increase tensions between the two countries He Weifang, a renowned law professor in Beijing, said that even some government critics are becoming more empathetic with the official line."Every Chinese who has brains," he said, "wouldn't take this as simple as China is successful and the U.S. a failure."However, he added that with the terrible oppression of space for free expression, many brains in the village are gradually being destroyed.By Javier C.

FBI Deputy Director Bowdich Issues Remarks at News Conference Announcing Charges Against Chinese HackersTargeted News ServiceJuly 23, 2020 Thursday 8:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 966 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyFBI Deputy Director David Bowdich issued the following remarks on July 22 during a virtual news conference at the Department of Justice announcing charges against two Chinese hackers for their roles in a global computer intrusion campaign targeting intellectual property and confidential business information, including COVID-19 research:The indictment alleges that Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazh worked with the Guangdong State Security Department (GSSD) of the Ministry of State Security (MSS) while also targeting victims worldwide for personal profit.* * *As Director Wray said in his recent speech at the Hudson Institute, the greatest long-term threat to our nation's information, intellectual property, and economic vitality is the counterintelligence and economic espionage threat from China.China is determined to use every means at its disposal--including the theft of intellectual property from U.S. companies, labs, and universities--to degrade the United States' economic, technological, and military advantages. The scale and scope of the hacking activity sponsored by the PRC intelligence services against the United States and our international partners is unlike any other threat we're facing today. But China's hacking of foreign companies to benefit Chinese state-owned enterprises is only part of its playbook.We're bringing these charges today to put the Chinese leaders directing these cyberattacks on notice: There are serious risks and consequences for stealing our technology and our intellectual property. Even as we stand here today, China is facing a degradation of their image on the world stage as a trusted partner. Other nations partnering with China in economic development projects should closely consider their alliances with a country that has so little regard for international law.FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich and FBI Seattle Special Agent in Charge Raymond Duda are seen at a July 21, 2020 virtual press conference at the Department of Justice announcing charges against two Chinese hackers.FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich speaks at a July 21, 2020 press conference announcing charges against Chinese hackers Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi. Bowdich was joined by other officials, including FBI Seattle Special Agent in Charge Raymond Duda (right).These hackers, directed by the Chinese intelligence services, have targeted and continue to target companies and laboratories in countries around the world. China uses its economic influence to pressure those countries not to publicly expose or challenge their illegal actions. China steals intellectual property and research, which bolsters its economy. And then they use that illicit gain as a weapon to silence any country that would dare challenge their illegal actions. This type of economic coercion isn't what we expect from a trusted world leader. It's what we expect from an organized criminal syndicate.Cybercrime is a major threat to our national security, and it's growing every day. At the FBI, we are tackling this problem the same way we've successfully addressed other types of crime: through deterrence. And we're doing that by identifying the perpetrators of cybercrimes and making every effort to hold them accountable to the rule of law.Through investigation and attribution, our Cyber Division investigators and analysts, in field offices through the country, imposes consequences--not just on the hackers themselves but also on the individuals and institutions directing those hackers and facilitating their actions. Indictments are just one way we do that. I'm proud of the tenacity of the FBI agents and analysts, as well as the assistant United States attorneys who doggedly pursued these perpetrators.Screenshot of top portion of Wanted poster for Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazh, Chinese MSS Guangdong State Security Department hackersSelect image to view posterBy indicting Dong and Li, we're condemning their actions and those of the MSS officers at the Guangdong State Security Department who provided them with material support and direction.Unfortunately, China doesn't just use its hackers to target R&D or intellectual property. As we demonstrate in the indictment, China is also willing to use their intelligence services' cyber capabilities to target Chinese dissidents outside of China and protesters supporting democracy and human rights in Hong Kong.I want to make one important point, which is the same one I have made before: Our concern is not with the Chinese people, or with Chinese Americans, but specifically with the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party. Confronting this threat effectively does not mean we should not do business with the Chinese, host Chinese students, welcome Chinese visitors, or co-exist with China as a country on the world stage. What it does mean is that when China violates our criminal laws and international norms, we will not tolerate it. We're going to hold people accountable. We'll use our unique authorities, our experience, and our capabilities--with the help of our partners at home and around the world--to fight this threat, every day.Thank you.* * *Resources* Two Chinese Hackers Working with the Ministry of State Security Charged with Global Computer Intrusion Campaign Targeting Intellectual Property and Confidential Business Information, Including COVID-19 Research (https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/two-chinese-hackers-working-with-the-ministry-of-state-security-charged-with-global-computer-intrusion-campaign-targeting-intellectual-property-and-confidential-business-information-including-covid-19-resea)* CHINA MSS GUANGDONG STATE SECURITY DEPARTMENT HACKERS (https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/china-mss-guangdong-state-security-department-hackers)Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7184784 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 23, 2020End of Document

TikTok under US national security review suspected of serving ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 29, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 654 wordsBodyThe Chinese TikTok video app is being evaluated by the U.S. government for its potential national security risk and President Donald Trump will receive a recommendation on the issue these days, the Treasury Secretary reported Wednesday.Steven Mnuchin told reporters that the analysis is carried out by the Foreign Investment Committee in the United States (CFIUS), a Treasury-chaired panel that deals with companies and acquisitions that affect national security."TikTok is under review by the CFIUS and we will make a recommendation to the president this week. We have many alternatives," Mnuchin said.This application, whose format of artistic and humorous videos became very popular during the confinement by the coronavirus pandemic - especially among young people - is owned by the Chinese group ByteDance and has almost one billion users worldwide.But Washington suspects it's used by the Beijing government for espionage efforts."We're looking at TikTok and we're thinking about making a decision," said Trump, who has already raised the possibility of banning this platform.Less drastic solutions, including the sale to a group of U.S. investors, are also being considered, according to recent statements by a close Trump adviser, Larry Kudlow."I think TikTok will leave the holding company that is Chinese and will operate as an independent company," he said two weeks ago.He did not want to disclose whether anyone had already been interested in an eventual acquisition of TikTok, but argued that "it would be a much better solution than the ban."But on this issue, as in many others, the White House seems divided.Another close Trump adviser, Peter Navarro, a fierce opponent of China and architect of the trade war unleashed against Beijing, was in favour of taking a stronger step.Navarro has accused TikTok, and another application, WeChat, of sending all the data "to servers in China, directly to the Chinese Army, the Chinese Communist Party and to agencies (officials) that want to steal our intellectual property."- "Defamatory attacks"-TikTok has often had to defend itself against its ties with China, where its parent company has a similar application, with a different name.But the company has always denied sharing data with the Chinese authorities, and assured that it does not intend to accept such requests.On Wednesday, TikTok's executive chairman, Kevin Mayer, reiterated that the group had no connection with the Chinese government."We are not politicians, we do not accept political publicity and we do not have an agenda; our only goal is to remain a vibrant and dynamic platform for everyone to enjoy," he said in a blog post.He added: "TikTok has become the last target (of the United States), but we are not the enemy."Mayer also defended himself against what he called "defamatory attacks" by the US social network Facebook, and considered TikTok's actions to encourage competition in the U.S. market."The whole industry is under scrutiny, and rightly so. Due to the Company's Chinese origins, we are being examined even more closely. We accept it and are up to the challenge," he said.Mayer noted that TikTok has established transparency guidelines and that "all companies must disclose to regulators their algorithms, moderation policies and data flows."Several U.S. lawmakers have urged TikTok to be banned, and a pending bill would make it illegal for federal administration employees to use that app on government devices.In other parts of the world, the networkhas also been questioned. Since June 30, it has been banned in India, topping a list of 59 Chinese applications blocked by New Delhi on its territory to "ensure the security and sovereignty of Indian cyberspace".And the government of neighboring Pakistan, a very conservative Muslim country, recently issued "a final warning" to TikTok to remove content deemed "immoral, obscene and vulgar" from its platform.sms-vog-ad/lluLoad-Date: July 30, 2020End of Document

Investors Eyeing Wall Street; Mick Mulvaney is Interviewed about the Coronavirus Stimulus; Harvard's Reopening Plan; Reviving Nissan Amid Pandemic; Future of Paycheck Protection Program.MORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 7:00 AM ESTJuly 7, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; FinancialLength: 7055 wordsByline: Maria Bartiromo, Dagen McDowell, Cheryl CasoneGuests: Michael Kantrowitz, Jon Hilsenrath, Art Hogan, Joel Shulman, Ashwani Gupta, Glenn HubbardBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, July 7th. Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.Big tech takes a stand against China's crackdown on Hong Kong's freedom. Google, FaceBook and Twitter are saying that they will not release user data to Hong Kong law enforcement.Meanwhile, TikTok pulling its app from the city. This as the United States is looking to ban TikTok and other China-based social media apps.Coronavirus cases still rising, meanwhile, at an alarming rate. Dr. Anthony Fauci is warning that we are still, quote, knee deep, unquote, in the first wave. Cities like New York reopening while other areas, including Los Angeles and Miami, are reversing course.Markets are pulling back this morning after that powerful rally yesterday. Futures indicating a decline in the triple digits this morning, down 263 points on the Dow Industrials after a strong rally kicked off the week yesterday, pushing the Nasdaq to yet another record high yesterday. The Nasdaq at 10,433 points, up 226 points. That was two and a quarter percent yesterday. The Dow was up almost 2 percent, as was the S&P.Who dipped into the Paycheck Protection Program? Companies include law offices, the Girl Scouts, PF Chang's, even Kanye West's clothing company. The list causing controversy this morning.Crime rising in major U.S. cities, meanwhile. Georgia's governor has declared a state of emergency, deploying the National Guard following a weekend of violence in Atlanta.And it's almost time to play ball. Major League Baseball announces its shortened schedule with some big games to open of this season.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.Global markets this morning are under some selling pressure. In Europe it is red across the board. Take a look, the FT 100 down 80 points, the CAC quarante in Paris down 50, and the DAX index in Germany lower by 150. There are signs of economic recovery in Germany, however. Industrial output rebounded in May, rising 7.8 percent.In Asia overnight, markets were mostly lower, with the exception of China, where stocks rose following Monday's big rally after state media reported that China needs a healthy bull market and it is ready to add support to attract investors. The Shanghai composite was up another third of a percent overnight.Joining the conversation this morning, Dagen McDowell, Jon Hilsenrath and Michael Kantrowitz.It is great to see everybody this morning.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you.MICHAEL KANTROWITZ, CORNERSTONE MACRO: Great to be here.JON HILSENRATH, SENIOR WRITER, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL": Good morning.BARTIROMO: And some of the top stories that we are watching this morning, leaders in major U.S. cities now vowing to get crime under control after a violent weekend. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp says that he will deploy 1,000 National Guard troops after at least 30 people were shot in Atlanta over the weekend. Five people were killed, including an eight-year-old girl.In New York, more violence leading to outrage after a video was reported to show a man holding his daughter's hand as he is gunned down. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says the situation is unacceptable. He is blaming the uptick in violence on the coronavirus.Meanwhile, the White House says it's ready to play a larger role in the debate over how to address the violence, adding the country needs to focus on securing its streets.And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says that the Trump administration may soon ban Chinese social media apps including TikTok. Pompeo weighed in on Fox News last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: We're taking this very seriously. What we're -- we're certainly looking at it. We worked on this very issue for a long time.LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX HOST: Would you recommend that people download that app on their phones tonight, tomorrow, any time currently?POMPEO: Only if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Yes, TikTok says it is leaving the Hong Kong market after China imposed a controversial national security law there. The Beijing-based app has been trying to make moves to distance itself from China, including naming American and former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its CEO. It is still owned by China.FaceBook and Twitter suspending requests for data from Hong Kong's government after China recently approved a controversial national security law. The two companies say that they are reviewing the implications of this new law which gives China sweeping powers to crack down on any dissent in Hong Kong.Growing call to boycott Whole Foods, meanwhile, after several employees were sent home from a Massachusetts store after they refused to take off Black Lives Matter face masks. Protesters gathered outside the Cambridge location over the weekend. The very latest demonstration since the incident happened back in June. A Whole Foods spokesperson tells Fox Business the company's dress code policy prohibits employees from wearing clothing with slogans, messages or logos that are not company related.And it's time for the "Word on Wall Street."Joining me right now is National Securities Corporation Chief Market Strategist Art Hogan, ER Shares Founder and Managing Director Joel Shulman, and also with me all morning is Michael Kantrowitz from Cornerstone Macro.Great to see everybody this morning. Thank you for being here.First up, state media says that China needs a healthy bull market. It's ready to add support to attract investors.Michael, we spoke about this earlier. What's interesting to me is all of the controversy around the Chinese Communist Party, and yet Chinese stocks continue to rally.What's your take?MICHAEL KANTROWITZ, CORNERSTONE MACRO: Yes, well, you know, it's different, I think, from today versus many years -- the last maybe five -- five, six years ago was that China spent a lot of money on infrastructure to get the economy going, to get their economy going. Now they're just kind of using jaw-boning to get the stock market up without the aggressive investment that we saw many years ago. So I'm not sure if it's going to have a positive growth effect like we've seen in the past.BARTIROMO: Oh, that's a really interesting point, actually.Technology stocks, obviously, fueling a big part of the gains yesterday and the last several months. The Nasdaq closing at another record high for a third day in a row, marking the 150th record close under President Trump, Michael. Broadly speaking, whether it's China or tech or sectors, tell me where you want to allocate capital today?KANTROWITZ: Sure. So just this morning we actually upgraded two defensive sectors, staples and utilities, which we've had as underweights for the last three months, to -- we moved them up to market weight. Not getting as aggressive and negative to say you want to be overweighting defense, but I think it's time to start adding a little more defense to the portfolio now that we've already seen the market rebound 42 percent, now that the Covid news is getting -- is changing, obviously, from where it's been improving and that could make the economic data a little more mixed in the back half of the year compared to what we've seen the last three months.BARTIROMO: Yes. All right, that's a good point.Art, let's talk about the U.S. economy here. The president of the Atlanta Federal Reserve, Raphael Bostic, warning of a bumpier road ahead and says that the economy's recovery is leveling off as Covid-19 cases surge.What's your take? The last time Larry Kudlow was with us a couple of weeks ago, he said 20 percent growth in the third quarter and 20 percent growth in the fourth quarter.What do you think?ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, SECURITIES CORPORATION: Look, what I think is we've seen a resurgence of case discovery in the south and parts of the southwest. And Bostic's right in the middle of that. So when the Atlanta Fed says we're seeing a bumpy ride in the road ahead, I think he's speaking to what he knows. I think those are companies around the commuter (ph) Georgia area and that part of the south that have actually seen states have to tap on the brakes in the reopening plan. So I think it makes sense to be a bit cautious here and I think the message that Bostic and the rest of the Fed has delivered is, we've got to be careful here and there's plenty of monetary policy behind what we've already done. I think that's the clear message we're getting from him today.BARTIROMO: So what do you want to do then, Art? Are you going to stay away from some of the high fliers like technology or are you going to allocate capital differently?HOGAN: You know, that's such a great question. So, our asset allocation plan right now is, if you're in a traditional 60/40 portfolio, where 60 percent of that is equities, we want you to have a barbell approach. And that barbell approach has those technology momentum names on the one side of that and the other side of that is cyclicality. We want you to add cyclicals to that mix. We think that's going to be the best balance to have in a diversified portfolio over the next 12 to 18 months.BARTIROMO: All right. And let me ask you, Joel Shulman --JOEL SHULMAN, FOUNDER AND MANAGING DIRECTOR, ER SHARES: Yes.BARTIROMO: Your thoughts on tech and where you're seeing money move within the ETFs under your umbrella.SHULMAN: Well -- well, we -- we've seen, you know, certainly a lot of money moving into the technology sides. Healthcare and technology we think continues to be strong. I mean tech has been up 17 percent. But the entrepreneurial health and technology companies have been up over 60 percent. We've got over 25 names that are over 100 percent year-to-date.There's a lot of movement. The shift has gone from the defensive sector into the growth and I think this is a demarcation. Covid has accelerated this shift into health and technology and I think that's going to continue for a while and we continue to see a lot of growth opportunity there.And we also see opportunity for entrepreneurial companies globally, particularly the non-U.S. small cap. Many individuals have already taken advantage of these names, you know, that we're familiar with in health and technology, like Zoom and so forth. And we think that's going to continue for at least this year and through the next few years as well in terms of health and technology, particularly entrepreneurial names.BARTIROMO: Do -- do things start shifting as we get closer to the election?Michael, what's your take in terms of what investors believe will be the policies after November?KANTROWITZ: Sure. If, you know, we knew the outcome of the election, we'd have a much firmer view on that, obviously. It's -- the -- the outcome is going to be less dramatic as -- as the previous candidates, you know, earlier in the year are -- were. So I think, you know, if -- if we have a Biden presidency, that probably takes off $8 or $9 off the S&P earnings. And so I think, ultimately, that would be met with a little more market choppiness than seeing President Trump win again.BARTIROMO: Did you want to jump in, Michael, on -- on tech or what you just heard?KANTROWITZ: Sure.Yes, you know, one of the things -- you know I know we have -- we -- a lot of us still have the -- the ugly memory of tech in 2000. And while we always hate to say it's different this time, it is different this time with tech because tech -- tech and growth in general, as an investment strategy, is really a high quality investment strategy today, whereas in 2000 growth stocks were really low quality, high beta stocks without earnings. And so that's, I think, a really important point to make in terms of comparing today to 2000.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a -- it's a good point because it was totally different back in the '90s, that's for sure.Art, you were there and -- and covering this as well. Let me ask you, is there a screaming buy to you right now, Art? You seemed cautious earlier when you were talking about the broader market.HOGAN: No, I think you -- well, I agree with Michael, I think when you compare where technology is, and Amazon was one of those companies that we were concerned about when we had a tech bubble in the late '90s, and that's certainly evolved into a company that has high quality earnings. It certainly has cash generation and this pandemic has actually proven out that its market share in consumer discretionary and retail is -- is just one piece of the larger business, the Amazon service is obviously a large part of that too.So I think the quality of technology earnings and revenues are light years ahead of where we were back in '99 and 2000.That said, this has been a tech-led rally. So tech and healthcare companies have led for most of this rally. And I would not be surprised whatsoever to see some transition over to cyclical stocks as reopenings successfully happen. Now, if that happens at a slower pace, that rotation is going to be a bit slower.BARTIROMO: All right.HOGAN: We definitely think that you want to have a balance of technology and cyclical in your portfolio.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there.Great panel this morning. Art Hogan, Joel Shulman, Michael Kantrowitz. Michael, you're staying with us all morning. Thank you for that.We'll take a break.Gentlemen, please come back soon. We've got a lot more to talk about with both of you, Art and Joel. We appreciate your time this morning.Much more ahead.Coming up this hour, Nissan's Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta is here talking about the turnaround of that company after Covid-19 and the arrest of Carlos Ghosn.Columbia Business School Dean Emeritus Glenn Hubbard is joining us to talk about the state of the economy.And then in the 8:00 a.m. hour, former Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey is here to talk TikTok and the state of the 2020 race.Plus, we are looking at Parler, the new alternative to Twitter. The CEO will join me to talk about growth and bringing Democrats over to his platform.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Coronavirus stimulus. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell speaking out about a second stimulus check that could be part of the next coronavirus relief package. He says Americans making less than $40,000 a year have been hardest hit by this pandemic. The White House also expressing interest in another round of stimulus.Joining me right now is former acting White House Chief of Staff and former OMB Director Mick Mulvaney.Mick, it is great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.MICK MULVANEY, FORMER ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF AND FORMER OMB DIRECTOR: Maria, thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: So tell me about some of the important things that goes into deciding what should be in the next stimulus package. We're talking about a population of people making under $40,000 in one -- in one area. Others you're talking about getting money directly to employees so that it can go out the door and make sure that employees have money continuing to come in.What is the priority, in your view, in terms of coming up with the next stimulus package?MULVANEY: Yes, the priority's pretty much the calendar. What you're facing, obviously, is -- is an election season into a recession, which is why we've gone fairly quickly from a -- a consensus, sort of at least within Republicans of, let's wait and see to let's pass something, which is (INAUDIBLE) you and I have talked about this before, we fully expect something to pass before the end of July. The only question is what. Passing something during July gives politicians a chance to go home during the fall and campaign with something to talk about.So something we'll pass. And the question is, what should it be? And my fear is that they're looking at it through the lens of trying to pick up political popularity as opposed to looking at how to actually fix the problem. We've not talked yet about this idea of giving people money to go on vacation, which sounds great, I guess, to some folks, but if folks aren't going on vacation because they're afraid of getting sick, giving them money to go on vacation isn't going to solve the problem. So I'm hopeful that what's going on, on Capitol Hill right now is trying to figure out a way to fashion a stimulus that actually helps us solve the reason we're in this recession in the first place, which is solving Covid.BARTIROMO: How successful was the PPP loan program? The Trump administration releasing the recipients of small business PPP loans. The list includes some large companies with ties to politicians, some real insiders, including a California winery co-owned by Governor Gavin Newsom - -MULVANEY: Yes.BARTIROMO: A firm linked to Nancy Pelosi's husband. Kanye West's sneaker line. Robert De Niro's Nobu restaurants took money, 12 of them. How do these businesses get any money, these insiders, like, you know, related to Nancy Pelosi and Gavin Newsom?MULVANEY: Yes, well, you're talking about, what, at least $2 trillion that was supposed to go out in the CARES Act. Any time you're talking about that sum of money, you're going to have those types of circumstances. And I wish that Republicans at least had learned the example from the Democrats in 2009 and 2010 when they passed the American Recovery Act, that you can't really buy elections, that people tend to react negatively to stimulus as opposed to positively because people see the abuse probably more than they see the impact on themselves. And that's not to say that PPP didn't help people. And it certainly did. There's a lot of small businesses who benefited. But to think there wasn't going to be those types of stories in advance was simply naive.I think it's a good time now to step back and say, OK, look, we passed the CARES Act. Less than half of the money from the CARES Act is actually in the system yet. A lot of the money that is in the system is sitting in cash accounts in banks. And the economy already seems to have turned around. So if the CARES Act is working, it's working now and it's starting to help get the economy back on track.I think that's a good time to sort of take that deep breath and say, you know what, we know it's politically expedient to pass a stimulus now, but maybe it's not the best thing economically and maybe we should wait and take a longer look.BARTIROMO: Well, you -- you mentioned the election and obviously that's sort of on the horizon here. We are, what, 120 days away or something like that to -- to the election of 2020.Let me ask you, Mick, about the president and what he needs to do in your view. I mean here we have a country that is, you know, seeing its cities destroyed. You've got infrastructure destruction. You've got shootings rising, crime rising in many, many large cities and, of course, an economy that is stuck in recession. We are expecting growth in the third quarter but we haven't seen evidence of that yet.What does President Trump need to do to, in fact, get a message across and lead in this uncertain time?MULVANEY: Yes, you --BARTIROMO: You know, you see him tweeting about Bubba Wallace. A lot of people, even his supporters, are saying, Mr. President, stick to the message, try to ensure that your message on fixing the economy and bringing back law and order of is resonating.MULVANEY: Yes, and you have already seen some indications of growth. Maybe that's what he should be talking about. I think it's just over 7 million jobs in the last two months. Retail sales are up. Home sales in May, I think, set a record. So there's good news there. How do you take that and turn that into a message that gets you reelected?And one of the things you do is to point out to people that you made America great, to use his term, in the first place. You could do it again. If -- if Joe Biden has a history of anything, it's not being able to get the country out of a slow economy. That eight years under President Obama and Vice President Biden to do that and it didn't work.So if the president can go back to drawing those contrasts between him and Joe Biden, that becomes a race between Trump and Biden, I think the president does extraordinarily well. He shows people, look, if you hire me, this is what you get. If you hire him, you end up with no jobs. If it ends up being a popularity contest or, worse, a referendum on President Trump, I think he's got some real -- some real headwinds to face.BARTIROMO: All right, Mick, we'll be watching. Thanks very much for your insights on all of the above.Mick Mulvaney joining us this morning right here.We'll take a break.When we come back, back on campus or not? Harvard's new plans to reopen this fall include full tuition without the classrooms. That's next. We'll get into it.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Well, Harvard University unveiling its reopening plan for the fall. Here's -- here it is. Forty percent of undergraduates will be back on campus but all classes will be online. You would think there might be a change in the price, but that is not the case here. Harvard tuition will remain the same.Dagen McDowell, your take?MCDOWELL: As smart as that university is supposed to make you, what they're doing is a joke. Where -- Harvard has an endowment of, what, $41 billion and they can't cut tuition just a little bit for students who basically need the price break? Get over themselves.BARTIROMO: Yes.It's a -- Jon, you've got -- you've got kids in college. I mean should tuition be reduced due to online classes? Everything is going to happen online. You're not getting the same university experience.HILSENRATH: I think it's extraordinarily frustrating for millions of parents, including myself, how much this costs and how much we have to pour into it.You know, I'm -- I'm for -- I would direct our readers to a story my colleague Josh Mitchell (ph) wrote recently which showed that some parents are making in-roads by negotiating lower prices individually. And, you know, I think everyone out there, if you've got kids in school, call the school today and tell them you want a -- you want a lower price, demand it, because some people are actually making some progress doing it. So let's overrun their phone lines and get a better deal.BARTIROMO: Yes.And, by the way, I don't know what Stanford University's plans are, but they're facing criticism because of this extensive relationship it has with China. Between 2013 and 2019, Stanford reported it had accepted $58 million in gifts and contracts from China and its communist government. Only Harvard, USC and University of Pennsylvania have taken more of money from China.So the Chinese communist government is not stupid. They are going to the leading universities and ensuring that the propaganda is there and the theft continues in a sustained way.But -- but, Michael, your thoughts in terms of -- in terms of college and kids going back. It will be all online at Harvard and yet the price is the same, no decline in pricing for tuition.KANTROWITZ: Yes, I agree with Jon, that's a -- that's quite frustrating. My kids are fortunately much younger and not quite college age. But, you know, it's -- it's -- there is a risk with college students being obviously living closely -- in close quarters together of Covid spreading. Whereas younger kids that are less susceptible, you know, kids my age, 12 and younger, going back to school I think is going to be a real important step to getting the economy back to allow people to go back to work with younger kids. So it's a balance across ages.MCDOWELL: One of the -- one of the biggest lies sold to American families over the last 30 years is that somehow one of these college degrees is worth $100,000, a quarter of a million dollars, because except for maybe Harvard and Princeton, when you get out, you're -- you have no shot of making that kind of money and paying back those loans you took out. It is a lie that was sold to the American people and all these companies need to step up and start hiring kids out of high school and training them.BARTIROMO: Coming up, Nissan's chief operating officer is here.HILSENRATH: Hey -- hey, Dagen --BARTIROMO: Oh, go ahead. Did you want to jump in there, Jon?HILSENRATH: Well, I want to -- I want to push back a little bit on Dagen because, I mean, there's a lot of research that shows that having a college degree is going to make you much better off in the long run than not going to college. So I don't know about discouraging people from going to college.I will agree with you that the cost is exorbitant in part because the government got into the business of making loans to people and it totally distorted the market for -- for tuition and a college education.BARTIROMO: All right, we will -- we will slip in a break.When we come back, we're talking with the chief operating officer of Nissan. Ashwani Gupta is here to talk about turning that company around after Carlos Ghosn's arrest.Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, July 7th.Markets this morning right here at 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast pulling back after yesterday's big rally. Take a look at futures, indicating the Dow futures down 234 points, the Nasdaq down 40 points, and the S&P 500 down 23. We are expecting a weak opening this morning for the broader averages.Global markets also under some selling pressure. European indices red across the board. Now the Eurozone is headed toward a deeper recession than previously thought. The FT 100 is down 78, the CAC quarante is down 46 and the DAX index is down 145.In Asia overnights markets were mostly lower with the exception of China where stocks rose following yesterday's rally after state run media said that China needs a healthy bull market and is ready to add support to attract investors. And with that, retail investors opened accounts in China in the millions.New restrictions, meanwhile, for international students studying in the United States.Cheryl Casone with those details right now.Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Maria. Some foreign college students will not be able to attend school in the U.S. this fall under new guidelines issued by federal immigration officials. International students will be forced to transfer to another college or leave the country if their school only offers courses online. As of now, this fall, some students are going to be on campus, others going to be remote. It's going to depend on the college. Foreign enrollment at some U.S. schools can be as high as 15 percent in this nation, we should add.Well, we mentioned the big streaming numbers of "Hamilton," the musical on Disney Plus in the last hour, Maria, but despite that milestone, the hashtag cancel "Hamilton" is growing on social media, forcing the creator of the hit musical to respond to critics who say the show glorifies slavery and gives an overly optimistic view of history and that when it debuted in 2015, you know, the world was just different.Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote on Twitter, quote, all the criticisms are valid. The sheer tonnage of a complexities and failings of these people I couldn't get. Or wrestled with but cut. I took six years and fit as much as I could in a two and a half hour musical. Did my best. It's all fair game.Well, Hamilton, who was a founding father, and the first U.S. secretary of the Treasury, married into a slave-owning family. He helped manage the sale of slaves for his in-laws.And, finally, here is a look at what's trending this morning on foxbusiness.com.Peter Thiel's big data analytics company Palantir confidentially files for an IPO. Not clear whether it's going to be a direct listing or not.Colin Kaepernick has signed a deal with Disney for a documentary series that explores racial and social injustice.And Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Lines are teaming up to help develop safety standards for restarting their businesses during the coronavirus pandemic.And those are your headlines from the newsroom, Maria.Back over to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you so much.Guiding Nissan through the global pandemic is next. The Japanese car maker reportedly securing $7.8 billion from creditors, shoring up cash flow as it seeks to recover from falling sales. The company working alongside its partners, Renault and Mitsubishi, to implement its Nissan Next Revival Plan, after seeing its first loss in 11 years and moving past the arrest of former CEO Carlos Ghosn.Joining me right now is the chief operating officer of Nissan, Ashwani Gupta.Ashwani, thanks very much for joining me this morning. We so appreciate your time.What's your plans to turn around Nissan?ASHWANI GUPTA, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, NISSAN: Maria, thank you for having me on the show.Nissan Next is a radical transformation plan which is based on prioritization and focus and that will bring the sustainable growth in the future.Now, what does it mean is we are going to focus on our, number one, core markets, number two, core products, and, number three, the core technologies.BARTIROMO: How much input will the Japanese government have in terms of Nissan's plans to grow?GUPTA: Well, Nissan Next is purely driven by our Nissan management and I think we have the support of our shareholders and our stakeholders to make it happen. And we do believe that with this transformation plan, we will bring back Nissan on a profitable growth path.BARTIROMO: So tell me about the product portfolio, Ashwani, because there is concern that there's an aging product portfolio, reduced daily rental fleet sales and obviously strict incentive policies, and that's part of the issue in terms of cutting volume.GUPTA: Well, at first our overall product lineup was getting old. I think it was more than 40 years of age. And when we make a focus on United States, because United States is one of our core markets and the (INAUDIBLE) United States mean the (INAUDIBLE) success of Nissan globally. So when we talk about the United States, our product lineup is going to be renewed. So in next 28 months we are going to launch eight new products in the United States, which I (ph) will be with the latest technology in terms of safety, in terms of easy to drive, in terms of fun to drive. We already demonstrated that with the high performance sedan we launched, Sentra, and we announced the new Rogue, which -- which will be -- which will be launched later this year.By doing this complete product renewal with the latest technology, what we are trying to create is to shift the focus from volume to value. And this we are going to do with the three pillars. Number one, change the way we do business. Number two, change the product. And, number three, change the culture.BARTIROMO: Yes.GUPTA: And, as a result, we are going to focus more on the retail sales and in the last four months we have demonstrated that the focus on retail sales is bringing more and more value and boosting our brand image in the United States.BARTIROMO: Well, the product changes certainly will be critical.There is a movement now of people wanting you to be CEO. According to Reuters, sources within the company have been pushing for you to take over as CEO. The sources telling Reuters they would want a, quote, natural transition with you sharing the title with current CEO or have him become the chairman with you as the sole CEO.Ashwani, do you feel that you have the autonomy that you need or do you feel that you're answering to many -- many chiefs given the Japanese government and its feelings about Nissan being the jewel of the country?GUPTA: Well, Nissan Next has been prepared and being executed under the leadership of CEO and COO with the complete management team. And as far as I'm concerned, I have two missions. Number one, to recover Nissan and, number two, is to protect Nissan. And with these two missions, we are moving forward as one team.BARTIROMO: You know, we saw what happened with Carlos Ghosn. He, obviously, wanted to merge Mitsubishi, Nissan, and Renault. And had real pushback from the Japanese government. And later he told me, look, if you're not Japanese, you are going to have -- you're going to face problems running one of the leading companies in Japan. That's just the way it is with the government.Ashwani, your heritage is obviously Indian. Do you face pushback from your chairman, from the Japanese government, in terms of moves you want to make? Would you ever merge Nissan with Mitsubishi and Renault?GUPTA: Well, my appointment in Nissan is not a surprise because I'm the oldest person in the alliance, having spent more than 15 years in all the three companies, starting from Renault, then Nissan, then Mitsubishi and then back to Nissan.The second thing is, I do believe that alliance is a tool to boost the performance of each company and I believe in the principle that the three companies should keep their brands distinctive and their P&L distinctive. And alliance should bring the performance to each of the companies. And this principle has not changed in Nissan Next and we are moving ahead with that principle and this is where we announced our alliance plan just one day before we announced our Nissan Next so that we clearly give the message that's how we want to utilize our alliance in our Nissan Next.BARTIROMO: All right, we'll be watching, Ashwani. Thanks very much for joining me this morning. We will certainly be watching the developments at Nissan.Ashwani Gupta joining us there, COO at Nissan.Coming up, a major health warning to report. Florida is on high alert this morning. A deadly brain eating amoeba identified in the state. We are taking a look.And then, take me back to the ballgame. The shortened Major League Baseball schedule is out. It is making a buzz this morning.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on fox business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The future of the Paycheck Protection Program. This morning we have new information in terms of the recipients who did get money. This program helped to -- designed to help struggling small businesses during the Covid- 19 pandemic, also aiding the wealthy and well connected as well. Notable recipients include Kanye West's Yeezy sneaker and clothing brand, the Nobu Restaurant Group, which has Robert De Niro as one of its backers. This as lawmakers are weighing additional stimulus.Joining us right now is Dean Emeritus of Columbia Business School and former U.S. Council of Economic Advisors Chairman Glenn Hubbard.Glenn, it's great to see you this morning. Thank you so much for joining us.GLENN HUBBARD, DEAN EMERITUS, COLUMBIA BUSINESS SCHOOL: Likewise. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Access the PPP program. Do you think it worked?HUBBARD: Well, I think the PPP program was a very good idea to try to keep people tried to their jobs. I think it did work in terms of keeping employment higher than it might have been. Yes, there are problems around the edges. And I think the Treasury Department and Small Business Administration administrated it not as well as they might have. But, yes, on balance, I think the program worked.BARTIROMO: What's your take on the economic growth story for the rest of the year? Do you think that we get out of this recession in the third quarter and start seeing growth?HUBBARD: We're going to see growth. I've been describing this as like a Nike swoosh. So you have a sharp downturn and then a gradual upturn. I think we're going to see that. We've got the low hanging fruit of a recovery. It may be more of a grind. We need a little bit more fiscal support for the economy, for unemployment, for states and a little bit of help from the Fed for small and mid-size businesses and their main street program.BARTIROMO: Jon Hilsenrath.HILSENRATH: Glenn, I want to come back to the PPP question. So I just want to read a list of some of the entities that got money from PPP. The client of Nancy Pelosi's husband, Sidwell Friends, an elite private school in Washington, D.C. that took Obama's children, Grover Norquist's unit, Daily Caller, Newsmax, Kanye West, David Boies, who was the lawyer for Al Gore, The Ayn Rand Institute. You know, there's a lot of talk about draining the swamp in Washington. I just did a calculation. Lobbying spending in D.C. is up at a 3.6 percent annual rate in just the last three years, outpacing inflation.Has the swamp actually been drained in this town?HUBBARD: Well, of course it hasn't. And the cases you mentioned are a problem. But you have to ask yourself, with PPP, if we had put extremely narrow and strict rules, we wouldn't have got it off the ground very fast. We're in the middle of a crisis. I think Congress understood that and relied on firms to self-certify. There are anti-fraud provisions and some - - some people who received funds may be in trouble. But this was always a risk with the program for sure.BARTIROMO: What about this Covid-19 weekly unemployment boost? That's set to expire at the end of the month. Should it be extended?HUBBARD: No. The $600 was too much. It really made not working better than working for many people. In an Aspen Institute Economic Strategy Group report, I and some co-authors have suggested actually boosting unemployment insurance but as a percentage of wages with a number much less than $600. So I think we need some help, but the $600 wasn't targeted very well.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, obviously, it's encouraging people to stay home and getting paid more being at home than they are on the job. Why would you give that up any time soon?HUBBARD: Yes, exactly.BARTIROMO: Yes.HUBBARD: And during the shutdown, that may have been less of a worry. But now that we're reopening and trying to get people back to work, it's definitely a worry.BARTIROMO: Exactly.HUBBARD: Certainly in the Aspen Report, we suggested reforming that but also really strengthening low wage work through the EITC. So there's much we can do, but not the $600.BARTIROMO: Glenn, thank you so much for your insights this morning.Glenn Hubbard joining us from Columbia.HUBBARD: A pleasure.BARTIROMO: Coming up, Walmart summer camp featuring Neil Patrick Harris. The new partnership makes a buzz this morning. That's all next, right here.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Time for the "Morning Buzz."First up, baseball is back. The first MLB game of the shortened season set for July 23rd.World Series champions Washington Nationals will host the New York Yankees.Jon, are you excited?HILSENRATH: I'm excited. I love to see baseball. Even more, I'd love to see my son play his football season this fall. But to tell you the truth, given what's happening with this second wave of coronavirus, I'll believe it when I see it. I just don't have high expectations that this is going to get back to normal. I hope it does. I would love to see it. But -- but it's just hard to have high expectations right now.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's hard to know with the second wave talk, that's for sure.How about this, camp is in session at Walmart. With many outdoor activities canceled this summer, the retail giant is hosting a virtual summer camp with Neil Patrick Harris as the head counselor. Starting tomorrow, Camp by Walmart will feature celebrity guests such as LeBron James, Drew Barrymore is going to do it, who will help host different activities for kids at home. Throughout the summer, up to 200 activities will be available on the Walmart app.Michael, are you signing your kids up?KANTROWITZ: Yes, I'm pretty psyched about it. I think my oldest daughter -- I have three -- is a Broadway fanatic and she's going to be really excited to see that Idina Menzel is giving some singing lessons. So I think it's a great idea. Everyone's looking for things to do with their kids this summer to keep them safe. I also saw that Walmart's doing drive-in pop-up movie theaters.BARTIROMO: You know, it's interesting, I mean, it is a good idea. Will this help Walmart and its app broaden out? Will people say, you know, I really like what Walmart did for my kids in summer camp, I'm going to use the Walmart app to buy stuff and increase its profile.KANTROWITZ: Yes, it's a smart strategy. It's kind of like McDonald's strategy with Happy Meals. You know, you get the kids hooked on -- hooked when they're young. So it certainly will create some goodwill for Walmart and its shoppers.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.All right, lastly, how about this, Justin Timberlake is joining a list of celebrities, including Taylor Swift and Reese Witherspoon, calling to remove confederate monuments. Timberlake writing on Instagram that his home state of Tennessee is, quote, home of many, many confederate monuments. He went on to say, quote, if we plan to move forward, these monuments must come down.It's like a calling card, Dagen.MCDOWELL: I am so glad that Justin Timberlake weighed in on this. This was one of the most important voices in America that we had not heard from.You know what, people might actually pay more attention to him if he sang - - he sang his message and what he means.Listen, confederate monuments are one thing. Many were put up throughout the south during the Jim Crow era as a symbol of white supremacy. So if local towns, communities, counties, even states want to have conversations about how to take down these monuments and what to do with them, that is one thing. But let's not forget that what is going on in this country is not just about confederate monuments. You've seen the desecration, even the knocking down of Frederick Douglass' statue, George Washington, Ulysses S. Grant, even vandalism of a memorial to the first African-American Union soldiers. So let's remember, this is not just about confederate monuments, it's about not knowing history and trying to destroy what people don't understand.BARTIROMO: Yes, what a real shame, I'll tell you.Still ahead, former Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey is here to talk about TikTok and the state of the 2020 race.Plus, the alternative to Twitter. I'll be speaking with the CEO of Parler on the site's surging growth.It's all coming up next hour right here.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live on Fox Business.Load-Date: July 7, 2020End of Document

Barr Says China Seeks To Replace US As World's Preeminent SuperpowerThe FrontrunnerJuly 17, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: LEADING THE NEWSLength: 1363 wordsBodyIn a Thursday address at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Attorney General Bill Barr said China is engaged in an "economic blitzkrieg" aimed at supplanting the US as the world's preeminent super power and making "the world safe for dictatorship." Media reports cast the address, in which Barr accused entertainment, high tech, and other US companies of "kowtowing" to Beijing, as part of an effort by the Trump Administration and congressional Republicans to denounce China and make it a campaign theme.The AP (7/16, Tucker) reports that Barr's speech "is part of a full-court press by the Trump administration to denounce China," as President Trump "is trying to fend off criticism of his handling of the coronavirus and the US economic downturn and to shift the blame back onto Beijing, and assert that he is tougher on China than Democratic rival Joe Biden." The Washington Post (7/16, Whalen, Zeitchik, 14.2M) says Barr's comments are "the latest sign of the Trump administration's increasingly strident stance on China."USA Today (7/16, Johnson, Fritze, 10.31M) says Trump and congressional Republicans "have made criticism of China a major campaign theme for the Nov. 3 election," and Barr's address was "the administration's latest broadside." USA Today quotes Barr as saying, "To tilt the playing field to its advantage, China's communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics: currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisitions, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks, and espionage."Townhall (7/16, Pavlich, 177K) reports Barr said, "The People's Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg, an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government, indeed, whole-of-society, campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world's preeminent superpower." The New York Post (7/16, Moore, 4.57M) says Barr "[laid] out the threat as the most important issue of this century." The New York Times (7/16, Savage, 18.61M) says Barr "focused in particular on entertainment and high-tech businesses, both industries that Republicans sometimes view as too liberal politically," and the Washington Examiner (7/16, Dunleavy, 448K) reports that Barr "accus[ed] Hollywood, Big Tech, and other UA companies of 'kowtowing' to Beijing."The Washington Times (7/16, Gertz, 492K) reports Barr "charged that a slate of major American businesses are being duped as they appease China's communist rulers in a bid to gain market access and favorable trade status with Beijing, which seeks ultimately to dominate the global market." Barr said, "The [Chinese Communist Party] rules with an iron fist over one of the great ancient civilizations of the world. ... It seeks to leverage the immense power, productivity, and ingenuity of the Chinese people to overthrow the rules-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship." Politico (7/16, Swan, 4.29M) reports that Barr "hinted at the possibility that American business leaders who advocate for the party's political interests at its behest could face prosecution under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a US law that requires people to disclose lobbying for foreign governments."Breitbart (7/16, Ng, 673K) says Barr "gave Hollywood studios and celebrities a verbal lashing," and Reuters (7/16, Lynch, Shepardson) reports Barr "took aim at Hollywood companies, including Walt Disney...as well as large technology firms like Apple, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft Corp over company actions with China." The Federalist (7/16, Reynolds, 126K) quotes Barr as saying, "Appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards, but in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you. ... A world marching to the beat of Communist China's drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas."Pompeo: China Knew Of Human-To-Human Virus Transmission Before It Told The World.Fox News (7/16, Creitz, 27.59M) reports on its website that in a Thursday interview with Fox News' Bill Hemmer Reports, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Chinese government "was aware of human-to-human transmission" of the coronavirus "before they shared this with the world." Pompeo added that "the World Health Organization itself was co-opted into the same effort to deny the world the knowledge it needed to respond to this threat, to this threat from the virus that emanated from Wuhan, China." Earlier Thursday, Pompeo told "The Hill during a virtual summit that he believes the rest of the world will make China 'pay a price' for their mishandling of the initial outbreak." Pompeo said in the Fox News interview, "I can see nations who are doing business in China who are rethinking about how to do that. ... If you are buying products that are a result of the slave labor that's happening in the western part of China, if you're a country that's bent the knee to China because they tried to come fish in your waters that are rightly yours ... I can see nations all around the world that are reasserting their claims, their sovereignty."Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth Keith Krach said on Fox Business' Mornings With Maria (7/16), "I don't want to get out ahead of the President on this issue, but I can tell you that we are holding China accountable. They've attacked, in Hong Kong, freedoms of the press, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, rule of law. They've attacked human rights in Xinanjiang. So we've made the comment we will use all tools available. The United States has taken the strongest action of any country to protect those human rights and those freedoms and you would think that CCP would somewhat be apologetic for what they have done with the virus. It should have never happened and I think this is a big issue and we are dealing with that and we are seeing countries in the world joining us."US Officials Mulling Entry Ban Targeting All Chinese Communist Party Members.Reuters (7/16, Spetalnick) reports that the Trump Administration is "considering banning travel to the United States by all members of the Chinese Communist Party and their families. ... Senior officials discussing the matter have begun circulating a draft of a possible presidential order, but deliberations are at an early stage and the issue has not yet been brought to" President Trump. Reuters says "the discussions...center on whether to deny U.S. visas to tens of millions of Chinese," which "would be certain to draw retaliation against Americans who travel to China."China Accuses Trump Of "Unreasonable Meddling" And "Bullying Behavior" Over Hong Kong.The Washington Times (7/16, Meier, 492K) reports that China has accused the US of "bullying behavior" after Trump signed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which "sanction[s] Chinese officials and entities for Beijing's 'repressive actions' against the people of Hong Kong." China's Hong Kong Liaison office said in a statement, "Unreasonable meddling and shameless threats by the United States are typical gangster logic and bullying behaviour."China's Property Boom Continues Even After Pause Due To Coronavirus.The Wall Street Journal (7/16, Xie, Bird, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports that a property boom in China has resumed after brief pause due to the coronavirus. The Journal describes a $52 trillion asset bubble that surpasses the US housing bubble in the 2000s.WPost Criticizes Trump's Plan To Ban TikTok.In an editorial, the Washington Post (7/16, 14.2M) criticizes Trump's plan to "ban the video-sharing app TikTok to punish China for its handling of the coronavirus crisis." The Post says that while "TikTok's provenance does pose real privacy risks that shouldn't be ignored," treating it "as a geopolitical cudgel rather than engaging in a thoughtful assessment about its role here is exactly the wrong approach." The Post says the US "needs a lawful process, based on objective criteria, to evaluate them - or else it only accepts China's techno-nationalism as its own."Load-Date: July 17, 2020End of Document

Barr Says Hollywood 'Kowtowing' To China, Warns US Executives Against Acting As Chinese Foreign AgentsThe Daily CallerJuly 16, 2020 Thursday 07:59 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; usLength: 482 wordsByline: Chuck Ross, Investigative Reporter, chuck@dailycaller.comChuck Ross is a reporter at The Daily Caller.Author ImageBodyLink to ImageAttorney General William Barr said Thursday the Chinese government has achieved a “massive propaganda coup” by shaping the content coming out of Hollywood, while warning U.S. business executives against acting as agents of the communist regime in possible violation of foreign lobbying laws.Speaking at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library, Barr offered a sober assessment of China's efforts to “raid” U.S. companies and institutions with a goal of becoming the world's lone superpower.Barr went through several examples of movie studios and tech companies caving into pressure from Beijing to censor content that paints China in a negative light.Barr pointed to the movie “World War Z,” which originally included a scene showing that the origins of a zombie apocalypse originated in China. Paramount Pictures ordered the scene removed from the movie at the request of Chinese authorities.“This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party,” Barr said.“Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC. America's big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence.”Barr detailed steps that Apple, Zoom and Google have taken to appease the Chinese government, such as self-censoring content available through their services.WATCH:Link to VideoBarr also said that the Justice Department has seen an increase in party officials and their cut-outs working to “cultivate and coerce” U.S. corporate leaders in order to further China's political objectives. (RELATED: US Adds Four Media Outlets To List Of Beijing-Controlled 'Propaganda')Barr said that the Chinese government hides behind “American voices” in order to covertly “elevate its influence and put a 'friendly face' on pro-regime policies.”“The legislator or policymaker who hears from a fellow American is properly more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner. And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result, if its lobbying were exposed.”Barr also issued a thinly-veiled warning to U.S. business executives against working as foreign agents of the Chinese government.“America's corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists,” Barr said, adding, “but you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act.”Barr explained that the law, known as FARA, requires Americans to register as foreign agents if they push policies that advance the interests of foreign governments.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The U.S. Must Follow India's Lead on TikTokNewsweek.comJuly 7, 2020 Tuesday 7:00 AM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 973 wordsByline: Rachel BovardHighlight: India has banned dozens of Chinese-owned mobile apps. The U.S. should follow.BodyIn a move designed to blunt increasing Chinese aggression, India has banned dozens of Chinese mobile apps over concerns the apps "are beholden to the [Chinese Communist Party] under Chinese law" and "extensions of the Chinese state," according to one former Indian security official.Among those apps is the wildly popular video-sharing app, TikTok. Yes, TikTok—the app that features funny dance videos and close to a billion global users, most of them from Generation Z. But the app presents very real security concerns that have drawn the scrutiny of U.S. lawmakers and national security staffers. India, in short, is onto something—and the U.S. should take heed.Chief among the concerns with the China-based app is that the data it collects on its user base—which, in the United States, is largely between the ages of 16 and 24—goes straight back to Beijing and the Chinese government.TikTok's U.S. representatives say they do not store user information in China, and that the company is not "subject to Chinese law." But that is an empty promise, given a new cyber-security law that took effect in January, which requires any company operating in China to give the government access to its data. This includes not only TikTok, whose parent company ByteDance is headquartered in China, but also other American tech companies.In a hearing in 2019, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) blasted the company, which declined to appear at that hearing. "A company compromised by the Chinese Community Party knows where your children are, knows what they look like, what their voices sound like, what they're watching and what they share with each other," Hawley said.Collection of personal data on a massive scale by a tech company is not intrinsically unusual. Google, Facebook and, to some extent, Twitter, all do the same thing. (Consider the gargantuan amounts of data Google has on America's schoolchildren.) American tech giants use that personal data to create creepily efficient products, produce the targeted advertising that reaps them billions in profits and, occasionally, pass it along to the U.S. government. It's unsettling, but it's also all currently legal.TikTok, however, is very likely placing data on American citizens in the hands of an American geopolitical adversary—the Chinese Communist Party—which that adversary could use for information, leverage, blackmail, identity theft or other nefarious purpose.The extent of TikTok's data harvesting, and what is done with it, is the subject of a lawsuit filed by Misty Hong, a California college student. She sued the company in December, alleging TikTok surreptitiously "vacuumed up and transferred to servers in China vast quantities of private and personally-identifiable user data."Hong downloaded the app, but she never created an account. She alleges that, months later, she discovered that TikTok had created an account for her without her knowledge, and that the account included a dossier of private information, including a face scan, based on analyzing several videos she had created, but had never posted.According to the suit, ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, used TikTok (formerly Musical.ly) to secretly gather users' locations, ages, private messages, phone numbers, contacts, genders, browsing histories, cell phone serial numbers and IP addresses. That data was then sent to servers in China.The growing skepticism of TikTok reaches across partisan lines. Last October, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) joined Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) in sending a letter to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence asking for an investigation into TikTok as "a potential counterintelligence threat we cannot ignore."Senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security reportedly reached out to TikTok about managing Chinese political misinformation in the run-up to the 2020 election, a concern magnified by leaked internal guidance and statements from former employees that the company censors content at the behest of the Chinese government. Earlier this month, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) praised users of TikTok for allegedly organizing on the platform to buy up tickets to a Trump presidential campaign rally.TikTok remains under investigation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is looking into ByteDance's acquisition of the Western version of TikTok, Musical.ly, in 2017.Even in the face of mounting evidence that TikTok is far from harmless, there are still those highlighting TikTok as nothing more than proof of a robust free market in tech. But that is a naïve argument that doesn't account for China's use of its private industry to achieve state ends."China would not be above using these apps for large-scale data collection," one cyber-security threat expert toldThe New York Times. "I don't expect that the government is running all these apps, but they may make an agreement with the companies that they have to cooperate once in a while. And it's easy under Chinese law to require them to do so."Americans are slowly waking up to the willingness of China to subvert American interests with private industry. The Federal Communications Commission recently designated Chinese telecommunications companies Huawei and ZTE for similar reasons: "substantial ties to the Chinese government, Chinese law requiring them to assist in espionage activities [and] known cyber-security risks and vulnerabilities in their equipment."TikTok may not yet rise to the level of "assisting in espionage," but there is ample evidence that it could—and an obvious willingness and ability by the Chinese government to encourage it. India has gotten wise to TikTok. Will America follow?Rachel Bovard is senior advisor to the Internet Accountability Project.The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.Link to ImageGraphic TikTok logoMARTIN BUREAU/AFP via Getty ImagesTikTok logoLoad-Date: July 7, 2020End of Document

US announces visa restrictions for employees of Huawei and other Chinese tech companiesCNN WireJuly 15, 2020 Wednesday 5:38 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 975 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON (CNN) BodyWASHINGTON (CNN) --  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday announced visa restrictions on employees of Chinese technology companies, including Huawei, in the latest Trump administration move against Beijing. The US "will impose visa restrictions on certain employees ... of Chinese technology companies like Huawei that provide material support to regimes engaging in human rights violations and abuses globally," Pompeo told reporters at a State Department press briefing. The top US did not elaborate on which employees would be targeted or how many people would be affected.Pompeo's announcement comes a day after President Donald Trump announced he would sign a bill and an executive order punishing China for steps that are widely seen as an attempt to crush democratic freedoms in Hong Kong, and railed at China for "unleashing ... upon the world" the global coronavirus pandemic. In an interview with The Hill later Wednesday, Pompeo added that the US is looking at limits on other Chinese tech companies as well. "Whether it's TikTok or any of the other Chinese communications platforms, apps, infrastructure, this administration has taken seriously the requirement to protect the American people from having their information end up in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he said.In a statement Wednesday, Pompeo said that certain employees will be ineligible for entry into the US "if the Secretary of State has reason to believe the alien's entry 'would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.'"Putting companies on notice"Companies impacted by today's action include Huawei, an arm of the CCP's surveillance state that censors political dissidents and enables mass internment camps in Xinjiang and the indentured servitude of its population shipped all over China," Pompeo said. "Certain Huawei employees provide material support to the CCP regime that commits human rights abuses," he added."Telecommunications companies around the world should consider themselves on notice: If they are doing business with Huawei, they are doing business with human rights abusers," Pompeo said.The Trump administration has long pressured allies against using Huawei technology, warning that doing so could put intelligence sharing at risk. In his press conference Wednesday, Pompeo declared that "the tide is turning" against the Chinese telecom giant.At that press conference, which comes ahead of a trip to London, Pompeo again commended the UK for its decision to ban Huawei from its 5G networks -- an about-face just months after the UK had said it could handle Huawei's presence in the British market -- and said he believed they had made the decision "for the right reasons," and not because of the threat of US sanctions, despite a spokesperson for the UK Prime Minister saying that this was in fact the case."You suggested they did this because of US sanctions," he said at a press conference Wednesday. "I don't actually think that's true. I actually think they did this because their security teams came to the same conclusion that ours have -- is that you can't protect this information. This information that transits across these untrusted networks that are of Chinese origin, will almost certainly end up in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party and so I think they did this for the right reasons."However, the British Prime Minister's spokesman said Wednesday that the "impact of the US sanctions" announced in May was the reason behind the UK's reversal on Huawei's role in its 5G telecoms network.The sanctions "were like nothing we had ever seen before," and made it "impossible" for the UK's National Cyber Security Centre to "guarantee the security of Huawei equipment in the future," the spokesman said.US officials have said they believe that Huawei, which is closely linked to the Chinese government, could use its 5G networks to spy on or sabotage foreign companies and governments. China and Huawei have denied these charges. The super-highspeed networks will be crucial for emerging technologies, such as self-driving cars. China's ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, said Wednesday the UK government's decision to ban Huawei from its 5G telecoms network will affect the willingness of Chinese companies to invest in the UK. Asked during a virtual conference Wednesday about the consequences of the UK's decision, the ambassador said it "undermines the trust between the two countries" and that it was "disheartening.""The way you are treating Huawei will be followed very closely by other Chinese businesses. The mutual trust was undermined. It will be very difficult for the businesses to have the confidence to have more investment."The ambassador also took a dig at the US. "China and Europe should see each other as partners and abandon the cold war mentality," he said, adding: "those who see China as systematic rival or as a potentially hostile state have got it all wrong. They have chosen the wrong target and they are heading in the wrong direction."Wednesday's actions against employees of the tech companies are the latest in a flurry of US administrative actions against China.Trump signed legislation Tuesday night that would impose sanctions on businesses and individuals that help China restrict Hong Kong's autonomy. He also released his executive order aimed at ending preferential treatment for Hong Kong."Hong Kong will now be treated the same as mainland China," Trump had said in the Rose Garden of the order. "No special privileges, no special economic treatment and no export of sensitive technologies."CNN's Nicole Gaouette, Jamie Crawford and Kevin Liptak in Washington, and Luke McGee, Hilary McGann and Sharon Braithwaite in London contributed to this report TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

HAWLEY, BLUMENTHAL CALL FOR DOJ INVESTIGATION INTO ZOOM, TIKTOKStates News ServiceJuly 30, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1014 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Missouri Senator Josh Hawley:Today U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) sent a letter to Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers calling for the Department of Justice (DOJ) to open an investigation into Zoom and TikTok for reported violations of Americans' civil liberties and of their close ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)."Based on numerous reports, we are extremely concerned that Zoom and TikTok have disclosed private information about Americans to the PRC and engaged in censorship on behalf of the Chinese government," the Senators said. "As tens of millions of Americans turn to Zoom and TikTok during the COVID-19 pandemic, few know that the privacy of their data and their freedom of expression is under threat due to the relationship of these companies to the Chinese government. Of particular concern, both Zoom and TikTok have sought to conceal and distract from their meaningful ties to China, holding themselves out as American companies. This concealment is alarming Chinese tech firms are notoriously bound to draconian intelligence laws, media regulations, and extrajudicial pressure that compels them to censor and spy for China's state security services."The Senators continued, "Both Zoom and TikTok have failed to answer even basic questions about their business operations, including who has access to personal information and when they comply with request from China or other governments. We believe that it is imperative that the Department of Justice investigate and determine whether Zoom and TikTok's business relationships, data handling practices, and operational connections to China pose a risk to Americans."The full letter is available here and below.The Honorable John C. DemersAssistant Attorney GeneralU.S. Department of Justice950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, DC 20530-0001Assistant Attorney General Demers:We are writing to urge the Department of Justice to open an investigation into reported violations of Americans' civil liberties by Zoom and TikTok and the national security implications of both companies' relationships with the People's Republic of China. Based on numerous reports, we are extremely concerned that Zoom and TikTok have disclosed private information about Americans to the PRC and engaged in censorship on behalf of the Chinese government.As tens of millions of Americans turn to Zoom and TikTok during the COVID-19 pandemic, few know that the privacy of their data and their freedom of expression is under threat due to the relationship of these companies to the Chinese government. Of particular concern, both Zoom and TikTok have sought to conceal and distract from their meaningful ties to China, holding themselves out as American companies. This concealment is alarming Chinese tech firms are notoriously bound to draconian intelligence laws, media regulations, and extrajudicial pressure that compels them to censor and spy for China's state security services. Even when subsidiaries, product teams, or servers are located outside of the country, when their engineers or management are based in China, sensitive personal data is still within the reach of Chinese intelligence.By hiding vulnerable ties and dependencies on China, Zoom and TikTok have obscured from American consumers that their personal data could be at risk. While Zoom is headquartered in the United States, the research group Citizen Lab found that the Zoom application appears to be developed by three companies in China, including at least 700 employees in China that work in "research and development."[1]Similarly, although TikTok has claimed to be based in the United States or Cayman Islands, it is owned by a Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance. Moreover, although TikTok is quick to claim that the app does not work in China, it is slower to highlight the fact that Bytedance operates a sibling app in China that exactly mirrors TikTok. This naturally raises questions concerning TikTok's other claims of independence from China and calls into question who is actually running the app.Zoom and TikTok also share a recurring and disturbing history of complying with demands by the Chinese Communist Party and silencing criticism of the Chinese government. Although the United States has long prided itself on being a safe haven for dissidents and human rights activists escaping repressive regimes, we are profoundly concerned that both companies could pose a threat to the safety of Americans, their families, and brave activists inside of China working with U.S.-based dissidents.For example, in early June, several Chinese pro-democracy advocates, including a prominent dissident based in the United States, were suspended by Zoom following a demand from the Chinese Communist Party because they had held a peaceful commemoration of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations on Zoom.[2] In addition to being a chilling case of censorship within the United States, Zoom has still failed to answer whether it turned over information about those attending that meeting to the Chinese government. Such disclosures of sensitive information concerning that meeting, and other similar events like online church services, could be a death sentence for vulnerable communities inside of China.Despite repeated promises of transparency and multiple inquiries from Congress, both Zoom and TikTok have failed to answer even basic questions about their business operations, including who has access to personal information and when they comply with request from China or other governments. We believe that it is imperative that the Department of Justice investigate and determine whether Zoom and TikTok's business relationships, data handling practices, and operational connections to China pose a risk to Americans. In addition to opening an investigation, we request that the Department of Justice and its partners in the Intelligence Community provide a briefing to Congress on this issue as soon as possible.We appreciate your consideration of this request.Load-Date: July 30, 2020End of Document

U.S. accuses Chinese nationals of hacking spree for COVID-19 data, defense secretsAirguide Business & AirguideBusiness.comJuly 21, 2020Copyright 2020 Pyramid Media Group Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: Air and Travel Business Features; ISSN: 1939-666XLength: 610 wordsBodyThe U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday indicted two Chinese nationals over their role in what the agency called a decade-long cyber espionage campaign that targeted defense contractors, COVID researchers and hundreds of other victims worldwide, reported Reuters.U.S. authorities said Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi stole terabytes of weapons designs, drug information, software source code, and personal data from targets that included dissidents and Chinese opposition figures. They were contractors for the Chinese government, rather than full-fledged spies, U.S. officials said.U.S. Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers said at a virtual press conference the hackings showed China "is willing to turn a blind eye to prolific criminal hackers operating within its borders.""In this manner, China has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran, and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provides safe haven for cybercriminals in exchange for those criminals being on call for the benefit of the state."Messages left with several accounts registered under Li's digital alias, oro0lxy, were not immediately returned. Contact details for Dong were not immediately available.The Chinese Embassy in Washington referred Reuters to recent Chinese Foreign Ministry comments that "China has long been a major victim of cyber thefts and attacks" and its officials "firmly oppose and fight" such activities.The indictment mostly did not name any companies or individual targets, but U.S. Attorney William Hyslop, who spoke alongside Demers, cited "hundreds and hundreds of victims in the United States and worldwide." Officials said the probe was triggered when the hackers broke into a network belonging to the Hanford Site, a decommissioned U.S. nuclear complex in eastern Washington state, in 2015.Li and Dong were "one of the most prolific group of hackers we've investigated," said FBI Special Agent Raymond Duda, who heads the agency's Seattle field office.A July 7 indictment made public on Tuesday alleges that Li and Dong were contractors for China's Ministry of State Security, or MSS, a comparable agency to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. The MSS, prosecutors said, supplied the hackers with information into critical software vulnerabilities to penetrate targets and collect intelligence. Targets included Hong Kong protesters, the office of the Dalai Lama and a Chinese Christian non-profit.As early as Jan. 27, as the coronavirus outbreak was coming into focus, the hackers were trying to steal COVID-19 vaccine research of an unidentified Massachusetts biotech firm, the indictment said.It is unclear whether anything was stolen but one expert said the allegation shows the "extremely high value" that governments such as China placed on COVID-related research."It is a fundamental threat to all governments around the world and we expect information relating to treatments and vaccines to be targeted by multiple cyber espionage sponsors," said Ben Read, a senior analyst at cybersecurity company FireEye.He noted that the Chinese government had long relied on contractors for its cyberspying operations."Using these freelancers allows the government to access a wider array of talent, while also providing some deniability in conducting these operations," Read said.AirGuide and Pyramid Media connects you to an affluent, influential group of business and leisure travelers from across the globe with AirGuide and Frequent Flyer Destinations Magazine.

CHINA INCREASED DETENTIONS FOR 'EXTREMIST' RELIGIOUS BEHAVIOR IN XINJIANG IN 2019: REPORTStates News ServiceJune 10, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1426 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:By Joshua LipesAuthorities in northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) ramped up detentions of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities last year to implement "counterterrorism" measures that severely violated religious freedoms, the U.S. State Department said in an annual report released Wednesday.According to U.S. government estimates, more than 1 million Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Hui, and other Muslim groups have been detained in a vast network of internment camps in the XUAR since April 2017, the State Department's 2019 International Religious Freedom Report said, although many nongovernmental organizations believe the number is much higher.Detainees were subjected to "forced disappearance, political indoctrination, torture, psychological and physical and psychological abuse, including forced sterilization and sexual abuse, forced labor, and prolonged detention without trial because of their religion and ethnicity" at the camps, which RFA's Uyghur Service has reported may number around 1,300 facilities and have held up to 1.8 million people.The report, which included a separate section on the XUAR this year due to "the scope and severity of reported religious freedom violations specific to the region," said that amidst the detentions, "the whereabouts of hundreds of prominent Uighur intellectuals, doctors, journalists, artists, academics, and other professionals, in addition to many other citizens, who were arrested or detained remained unknown.""The government intensified use of detentions in furtherance of implementing a Xinjiang counterextremism regulation that identifies 'extremist' behaviors (including growing beards, wearing headscarves, and abstaining from alcohol) and the National Counterterrorism Law, which addresses 'religious extremism,'" the report said.In particular, authorities punished people for praying or studying the Quran, and donating to mosques; demanded that individuals remove religious symbols from their homes, and barred youths from taking part in religious activities.They also banned several categories of people from fasting during the holy Islamic month of Ramadan and considered observing the Ramadan fast and participating in the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca to be suspicious behavior. The report noted that satellite imagery indicated that the government destroyed "numerous mosques and other religious sites," and monitored others.Additionally, authorities maintained what the State Department called "extensive and invasive security and surveillance," in part to document the religious adherence and practices of individuals. Some of the monitoring included behavioral profiling and forcing Uyghurs to accept government officials living in their homes and to install mandatory spyware applications on their phones.Many of these measures were undertaken in the name of eradicating the "three evils" of "ethnic separatism, religious extremism, and violent terrorism"a longstanding pretext used by the government to justify its restrictions in the region.In late 2019, several internal government documents were leaked that described the government's mass detention and surveillance programs, including a manual for how to operate internment camps, keep their existence secret, and methods of forced indoctrination. Another document showed that the government initially interned or extended internment of individuals on religious grounds in four camps in one county in Hotan (in Chinese, Hetian) prefecture.Uyghur Muslims also continued to endure significant societal discrimination in employment and business opportunitiesin addition to suppression of language, culture, and religious practiceswhile authorities promoted the Han Chinese majority in political, economic, and cultural life.The report comes as the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020which makes possible U.S. sanctions on Chinese government officials responsible for arbitrary incarceration, forced labor and other abuses in the XUARawaits signing by President Donald Trump.TAR and other parts of ChinaIn the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and other Tibetan areas of China, authorities continued to engage in "widespread interference in religious practices," especially in Tibetan Buddhist monasteries and nunneries, the report said, noting reports of forced disappearance, torture, physical abuse, prolonged detention without trial, and arrests of individuals due to their religious practices.Government and ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and government-approved monks were appointed to manage religious institutions, while authorities continued to restrict the size of Buddhist monasteries and other institutions, evict monks and nuns from monasteries, and prohibit them from practicing elsewhere. Monasteries were forced to display portraits of CCP leaders and the national flag.In July, Wang Neng Shang, vice minister of the TAR and director general of the People's Government Information Office, said the selection of the next Dalai Lamathe Tibetan spiritual leaderwas not the current Dalai Lama's decision to make, and instead must be recognized by the central government in Beijing.In other parts of China, a State Department-designated Country of Political Concern (CPC) since 1999, the government exerted control over religion and restricted activities and personal freedom of religious adherents when it perceived them as threatening state or ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) interests, the report said, while only state-sanctioned religious groups were permitted to hold worship services.The government also continued a campaign of religious "Sinicization" to bring all religious doctrine and practice in line with CCP doctrine, adopting a formal five-year plan on Jan. 7.The State Department noted reports of deaths in custody and that the government tortured, physically abused, arrested, detained, sentenced to prison, or harassed adherents of both registered and unregistered religious groups for activities related to their religious beliefs and practices.MyanmarIn Myanmar, the State Department noted continued violence, discrimination, and harassment against ethnic Rohingya in Rakhine state in the aftermath of an "ethnic cleansing" campaign against the group in 2017 that resulted in the displacement of more than 700,000 refugees to Bangladesh."Rohingya remaining in Burma continued to face an environment of severe repression and restrictions on freedom of movement and access to education, healthcare, and livelihoods based on their ethnicity, religion, and citizenship status," it said, citing the United Nations and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).Those who fled Myanmar during 2019 reported ongoing abuses in Rakhine state, while others spoke of continuing government pressure to participate in a residency verification campaign, which they stated they did not trust.In November the International Criminal Court (ICC) approved a request from prosecutors to investigate allegations of certain crimes committed against the Rohingya, while in that same month, The Gambia filed a case at the International Court of Justice stating Myanmar's actions against the Rohingya violated the country's obligations as a signatory to the 1948 United Nations genocide convention.Several U.N. entities spoke out or released reports on the Rohingya crisis in 2019, with a U.N. Fact-Finding Mission concluding in September that "the threat of genocide continues for the remaining Rohingya." The government denied the mission permission to enter the country and publicly disavowed the report.A second attempt by the governments of Myanmar and Bangladesh to initiate a return in August was refused by Rohingyas, who said they would be subjected to rights abuses if they returned without a guarantee of citizenship.Meanwhile, government and military officials continued to use anti-Rohingya and anti-Muslim rumors and hate speech circulating on social media in formal meetings, public speeches, and other official settings, it said. Facebook removed hundreds of accounts, pages and groups linked to military leadership for propagating hate speech, including anti-Muslim rhetoric.In addition to the Rohingyas, non-Buddhist minorities throughout Myanmara Buddhist majority country that has also been on the CPC list since 1999reported restrictions on religious practice, denial of freedom of movement, closed places of worship, an inability to obtain permits for religious buildings and repairs, and discrimination in employment and housing.Load-Date: June 11, 2020End of Document

Twitter reveals Campaign of Chinese, Russian and Turkish Dereportation on its platformCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 12, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 947 wordsBody       Twitter suspended tens of thousands of accounts linked to china, Russia and Turkey regimes for disinformation and manipulation campaigns. (Flickr)Most of the accounts deactivated by Twitter belonged to or were linked to China's communist regime. In total, some 173,750 users designed for state propaganda and misinformation were removed, of which 23,750 were part of the main core. The other 150,000 were used as content broadcasters to expand the reach across the social network."All of these accounts have been closed but their contents have been stored in a database for scientific research," twitter said, which in recent weeks was embroiled in the "war" controversy with President Donald Trump.This is not unprecedented action, as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter deleted thousands of accounts aimed at discrediting pro-democracy mobilization in Hong Kong in August 2019.From Turkey 7 340 accounts were deactivated and from Russia 1 152. In relation to the Turkish network, which was detected in early 2020, Twitter indicated that it was mainly dedicated to the promotion of President Recep Tayyip Erdo?an and the ruling party. The thousands of Russian accounts removed were related to a website that makes political propaganda backed by the government.What the Chinese Communist Party used these "fakes" forThe disinformation campaign revolved around the local political situation, specifically the Hong Kong case, a regional and special administration within Chinese territory that enjoys greater autonomy and freedoms from the rest of the country governed by the Chinese Communist Party (PCCh).The economic prosperity and growth of the Hong Kong democratic movement has led the Chinese regime to redouble efforts to pass a controversial security law that would undermine Hong Kong's "One Country Two Systems" model.Twitter noted in an analysis note, users shared misleading narratives about Hong Kong management and political dynamics. These widespread theories clearly favored Beijing, which constantly points to foreign intervention within opposition and pro-democracy movements in Hong Kong. Something quite curious, since the use of the social network in Chinese territory is limited and restricted by the PCCh itself.According to the Australian think tank expert group Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), accounts eliminated by the US giant were being used, in particular, to support the management of the pandemic by the Chinese authorities. Twitter agreed with the expert group that China spread information on networks about its response to coronavirus (COVID-19).They also disseminated and positioned views on anti-racist protests in the U.S. This would go in line with the official Chinese voice, which has been pointing out that demands from Washington on the rights of Hong Kongers have been delegitimizing by the U.S. crackdown on protesters.Another matrix that these accounts positioned was the theory that coronavirus originated not in Wuhan China, but in the United States. This was investigated by Benjamin Strick (information operations analysis specialist on social media websites), Olga Robinson and Shayan Sardarizadehfor the BBC. "Hundreds of fake or hijacked social media accounts have been sending pro-Chinese government messages about the coronavirus pandemic on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, as a BBC investigation has discovered," the article reads.It should recall the historic editorial of The Washington Post published just weeks ago, where they denounced the European Union's softening a report accusing Russia and China of a global disinformation campaign regarding the pandemic. Accounts deleted by Twitter would confirm this state propaganda campaign from both regimes.The @washingtonpost accuses Josep Borrell of favoring China and removing from a report references to his poor management of coronavirus, also alluding to blocking information on the outbreak. The diary says it did the same with Russia. pic.twitter.com/Ho3txTLpEL— Emmanuel Rincón (@EmmaRincon) May 1, 2020Other topics covered by the deleted accounts were that of Taiwan and the exiled billionaire Guo Wengui, who is in New York running a campaign against dictator Xi Jinping, also leader of the PCCh. Most users had few followers and failed to gain further repercussions, however, Twitter suspended accounts armed with its rules on manipulation, which prohibit the artificial dissemination and deletion of information.China prohibits its citizens from using social media, but the state does use them"The Chinese Communist Party does not allow the people to use Twitter, but our analyses reveal that it is pleased to use it to sow propaganda and misinformation internationally," said Fergus Hanson, director of the Australian International Cyberpolitics Centre, who collaborated with this network to eliminate the accounts. Apart from this, some of the other blocked networks in China are Facebook and YouTube.The PCCh came out to deny twitter accusations from the Chancellery at a press conference through its spokesman Hua Chunying: "It is illogical to put an equal sign between the Chinese response to the epidemic with misinformation." In addition, he noted that the US giant should close accounts that have been organized and coordinated to "discredit China."When we started the PanAm Post to try to bring the truth about Latin America to the rest of the world, we knew it would be a big challenge.

ON FOX BUSINESS, PORTMAN HIGHLIGHTS NEW LEGISLATION TO COMBAT NATIONAL SECURITY THREATS FROM CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTYStates News ServiceJune 23, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 651 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Ohio Senator Rob Portman:In an interview with Fox Business' Mornings with Maria this morning, Senator Portman, as chair of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), highlighted various PSI investigations that he has led that have exposed the national security threats posed by China. Specifically, Portman discussed the bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act, legislation he introduced last week to help stop foreign governments, particularly China, from stealing American taxpayer-funded research and intellectual property developed at U.S. colleges and universities. Portman, led a year-long investigation into this issue culminating in a bipartisan report and hearing that detailed how American taxpayers have been unwittingly funding the rise of China's military and economy over the last two decades while federal agencies have done little to stop it.Portman also discussed the need for foreign competition for China's state-owned telecommunications companies considering PSI's recent PSI's bipartisan investigation and report detailing the national security threat posed by Chinese state-owned telecommunications carriers operating in the United States and how the federal government provided little-to-no oversight for nearly twenty years. As demonstrated in recent PSI investigations, China routinely exploits the American education and scientific research sectors to further its national interest and engages in cyber-attacks against U.S. companies, like Equifax and Marriott.Excerpts of the interview can be found below and a video can be found here.PORTMAN ON NEW BIPARTISAN SAFEGUARDING AMERICAN INNOVATION ACT TO STOP THEFT OF U.S. RESEARCH and INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY:"Maria you are absolutely right, and what is happening, is and it's been happening for two decades, the Chinese government, and really the Chinese Communist Party when you look back at who is behind this, has been systematically targeting promising American research and researchers, paying them to take that research to China. Not telling either the taxpayer funded institutions like the National Institutes of Health, which just fired 54 of their researchers, 90 percent of whom had ties to China. Not telling the universities or other research institutions, like the Cleveland Clinic in my home state Ohio, where recently someone was arrested for taking over $3 million from China. China set up a replica lab for them in China, they actually took the samples, biological samples from Cleveland to China, so this has been happening for a long time we've got to shut it down our legislation is the Safeguarding American Innovation Act. We introduced it last week, it's bipartisan. We need to pass it. It would address all of the issues we just talked about including foreign governments influence in schools."PORTMAN ON IMPORTANCE OF HAVING WESTERN COMPETITORS TO CHINESE TELECOM COMPANIES:"I would like to see us send a really strong market signal, and that means, that we are open for business. We want competitors. We just finished an investigation, as you know of Chinese telecom companies here in the United States. We found out that one that was under investigation, was being removed from the market but there were three that were not and they have been here for two decades. And all the indications we got in our investigation, was that this was a national security risk for the United States because that data was likely being transferred back to China, and specifically the Chinese Communist Party in involved with these telecom companies. So, I think it's a real problem. I think the market signal would be that if Nokia and Ericsson continue to develop this technology to compete with Huawei, that they have a market here in the United States. That's probably a better way to do it. But we do need to be sure that the western world has an alternative."###Load-Date: June 23, 2020End of Document

U.S. senators asked Justice Department to investigate zoom and TikTok's ties to China threaten national securityCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 30, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 590 wordsBodyDemocratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, wrote to the U.S. Department of Justice Thursday urging an investigation into the Zoom and TikTok applications, with the goal of determining whether their ties to China can pose a threat to national security.Lawmakers said Americans, who are spending more time than usual due to confinements by the COVID-19 pandemic, were replacing personal interactions with Zoom calls and also spent hours watching TikTok videos."We believe it is imperative that the Department of Justice investigate and determine whether the business relationships, data management practices, and operational connections with China of Zoom and TikTok pose a risk to Americans," both senators wrote, according to Reuters.FILE PHOTO: The Zoom Video Communications logo is pictured at the NASDAQ MarketSite in New York, New York, U.S., April 18, 2019.  REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo (Carlo Allegri/)Lawmakers said in turn that companies seek to minimize the scale of their ties with China. "Based on numerous reports, we are extremely concerned that Zoom and TikTok have disclosed private information about the Americans to the (People's Republic of China) and participated in censorship on behalf of the Chinese government," Deputy Attorney General John Demers said in the letter.The senators' letter, issued by Reuters, adds that "both Zoom and TikTok have not even answered basic questions about their business operations, including who has access to people's information and whether they meet requests from China or other governments."TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, has said it stores all data in the United States and is backed up in Singapore.Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal. Carolyn Kaster/Pool via REUTERS (POOL/)"Our content and moderation policies are led by our team based in California, USA, and are not influenced by any foreign government," the company said in an emailed communication."We've never shared TikTok user data with the Chinese government, and we wouldn't if asked," you add.Although it is a California company, Zoom has large R&D; centers in China, where they have more than 700 employees, according to a document submitted to the U.S. government. The company was embroiled in a strong controversy related to the issue in June, when it admitted that it closed accounts of pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong on the orders of the Chinese regime, and indicated that it will continue to do so.In the case of TikTok, the app is being evaluated by the U.S. government for its potential national security risk and President Donald Trump will receive a recommendation on the issue these days, the Treasury Secretary reported Wednesday.Steven Mnuchin told reporters that the analysis is carried out by the Foreign Investment Committee in the United States (CFIUS), a Treasury-chaired panel that deals with companies and acquisitions that affect national security."TikTok is under review by the CFIUS and we will make a recommendation to the president this week. We have many alternatives," Mnuchin said.This application, whose format of artistic and humorous videos became very popular during the confinement by the coronavirus pandemic - especially among young people - has almost one billion users worldwide.With information from Reuters and AFPMORE ON THIS TOPIC:Scandal grows: Zoom admitted he closed pro-democracy activists' accounts by order of the Chinese regime and will continue to do soU.S. looks to restrict the use of TikTok and other Chinese applicationsLoad-Date: July 31, 2020End of Document

House Oversight & Reform Committee Issues Testimony From National Security Institute Founder JafferTargeted News ServiceJuly 16, 2020 Thursday 8:34 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 7894 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Oversight and Reform Committee issued the following testimony by Jamil N. Jaffer, founder and executive director of the National Security Institute at George Mason University, in a remote hearing on cybersecurity preparedness and the National Cyber Director Act (H.R. 7331) on July 15:Thank you for inviting me to discuss our nation's cybersecurity preparedness and the proposed legislation to establish a new National Cyber Director (NCD).I appreciate the opportunity to discuss these important matters and am honored to appear on a panel with such distinguished private sector leaders as former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, Cyber Threat Alliance President and CEO J. Michael Daniel, Cyberspace Solarium Commission member Suzanne Spaulding, and Tenable Chairman and CEO Amit Yoran. I'm likewise honored that our panel is testifying after Congressman Jim Langevin (D-RI) and Congressman Mike Gallagher (R-WI), both of whom have established strong reputations on Capitol Hill as leaders on cyber issues and as bipartisan consensus builders who are focused on the substance of these critically important issues.I look forward to hearing from my fellow panelists and to answering the Committee members' questions.II. The Current Threat EnvironmentAs the members of this Committee all too well know, the cyber threats facing the United States--including our public and private sector--are, in a word, massive. It is no overstatement to say that, for all practical intents and purposes, we are at war in cyberspace.And, unfortunately, as a nation we still remain woefully underprepared to deal with this ongoing and serious conflict.There are, of course, many experts (lawyers in particular) that may quibble with this characterization of the current environment, rightly noting that the usual definitions of an "armed attack" under international law may not have been met or that the activities that have taken place thus far fall below the classic thresholds of armed conflict. These same experts will also likely point out that neither the U.S. government nor any of our adversaries have acknowledged the existence of an affirmative state of war.And yet the fact is that for the better part of a decade, and certainly more so in recent years, our nation has been involved in a consistent and ongoing series of conflicts in cyberspace, albeit fairly low-level conflicts.2Regardless whether we call this state of affairs war or not, there can be no question that it has had a huge impact on our nation and its allies. It is estimated that the cyber-enabled economic warfare conducted by China--primarily focused on the U.S. private sector--drains private companies of billions of dollars a year, with total damage estimates running well into the trillions of dollars.3 As former NSA Director (and Founding Commander of U.S. Cyber Command) GEN (Ret) Keith B. Alexander noted over nearly a decade ago4--and as FBI Director Chris Wray recently reiterated (albeit without citation) earlier this month5--this activity represents the the greatest transfer of wealth in human history. Indeed, Chairman Rogers, who is on this panel today, nearly a decade ago also called our attention to the significant economic threat posed by China, noting that:There is an economic cyber war going on today against U.S. companies. There are two types of companies in this country, those who know they've been hacked, and those who don't know they've been hacked. Economic predators, including nation-states, are blatantly stealing business secrets and innovation from private companies.6 In addition, over the years, our enemies have conducted the types of attacks against the United States and our allies--both abroad and at home--that, had they taken place in domains of warfare other than cyberspace, we might have regarded as tantamount to acts of war. For example, we have seen foreign nation-states like North Korea and Iran engage in the affirmative destruction of data and the bricking of computer systems, rendering them unusable, here in the United States for over half a decade.7 And we know that this threat continues, given that the Director of National Intelligence told Congress last year that Iran is actively "preparing for cyber attacks against the United States and our allies" and is "capable of causing localized, temporary disruptive effects--such as disrupting a large company's corporate networks for days to weeks-- similar to its data deletion attacks against dozens of Saudi governmental and private-sector networks in late 2016 and early 2017."/8We've also seen the highly corrosive effects of Russia's ongoing active measures campaign on the American body politic. This effort--which I predict will eventually be determined to be the single-most effective covert influence operation to date--has had the effect of undermining the American public's confidence not only in our electoral system and a range of candidates for office, but has likewise tainted elected officials from both parties, turned Americans against one another in our federal and state legislatures, on cable television, and in the streets, and has undermined our core rule of law institutions, including the Justice Department, the FBI, and key elements of our Intelligence Community. To be sure our own institutions and their members-- including top elected officials, media, online platforms, and others--certainly have played roles in this problem also, whether by failing to lead effectively (or worse by actively creating additional discord amongst our people), engaging in illegal or unethical activities, or providing the fora where these manipulative activities by foreign nation-states can flourish. Nonetheless, it is clear Russia's efforts to taint American politics through online manipulation has been--and continues to be--all too successful.Worse still, because of our collective inability or unwillingness to recognize this activity for what it is and to join hands across the political divide to confront it aggressively and head-on, the Russians have paid little, if any, price for this behavior. And unfortunately, this fact that has not gone unnoticed other adversaries, like the Chinese, who are already engaging in similar overt and covert influence campaigns around the COVID virus and the killing of George Floyd. These same players may very well seek to engage in similar activities in the upcoming election cycle.Likewise, we've seen the significant threat that both nation-state and criminal actors can pose to key critical infrastructure entities, including those in the financial services and energy sectors.For example, as Chairwoman Maloney noted over three years ago, "[c]ybersecurity is posing a greater and greater risk to the safety and soundness of our financial system."9 J.P. Morgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon underlined this same concern in an April 2019 letter to shareholders, where he stated that "[t]he threat of cyber security may very well be the biggest threat to the U.S. financial system."10 That same year--and for the fourth year in a row--IBM assessed that the finance and insurance sector was the number one most attacked sector, with attacks on these institutions accounting for 17 percent of all cyber attacks in the top 10 most attacked industries.11 And we know that at least some nation-states, like North Korea, have profited significantly from these attacks, with the Director of National Intelligence noting last year that North Korea's "cybercrime operations include attempts to steal more than $1.1 billion from financial institutions across the world--including a successful cyber heist of an estimated $81 million from the New York Federal Reserve account of Bangladesh's central bank,"12 the very hack that led Chairwoman Maloney to seek answers from various American financial institutions in 2016./13And yet, even given the significant cyber threat already facing the financial sector, in mid-April 2020--just three months ago--the U.S. Secret Service and FBI jointly issued a warning that "the COVID-19 pandemic provides criminal opportunities on a scale likely to dwarf anything seen before," noting specifically that "[t]he speed at which criminals are devising and executing their schemes is truly breathtaking" and that the "sheer variety of frauds already uncovered is itself shocking."14 This assessment, moreover, is backed by the very real and troubling statistics.According to CarbonBlack, ransomware attacks increased 148% in March 2020 over the baseline from the prior month, with the financial sector being the biggest single sectoral target, with a 38% increase in attacks.15 In April 2020, Google reported that it was seeing 18 million daily malware and phishing emails related to COVID-19, not to mention more than 240 million COVID-related daily spam messages.16That same month, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) put out an alert highlighting a number of financially related threats conducted by malicious cyber actors seeking to exploit the pandemic.17 Specifically, CISA and NCSC indicated that malware campaigns were actively taking advantage of interest in the coronavirus pandemic, often for financial gain.18 Likewise, CISA and NCSC reported an increase efforts by threat actors to take advantage of the new work-from-home environment, with threat actors seeking exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in remote access software platforms.19 With approximately 300 million workers across the globe working from home, including up to 90% of banking and insurance employees,20 these efforts represent a uniquely challenging threat. And in May, we learned that Washington State suffered massive cyber-enabled unemployment fraud losing the state hundreds of millions of dollars.21Likewise, in testimony before Congress early last year, the Director of National Intelligence noted the serious cyber threat to the energy sector posed by nation-states with advanced capabilities. Specifically, the DNI noted that "China has the ability to launch cyber attacks that cause localized, temporary disruptive effects on critical infrastructure--such as disruption of a natural gas pipeline for days to weeks--in the United States."22 The DNI also stated that Russia is actively "mapping our critical infrastructure with the long-term goal of being able to cause = substantial damage" and specifically "has the ability to execute cyber attacks in the United States that generate localized, temporary disruptive effects on critical infrastructure--such as disrupting an electrical distribution network for at least a few hours--similar to those demonstrated in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016."/23None of this even accounts for the significant threat of collateral damage to private industry and government alike posed by nation-state attacks that conducted for strategic or tactical advantage.For example, the NotPetya attack conducted by Russia and aimed at Ukraine is estimated to have cost over $10 billion worldwide, with the significant majority of that damage being suffered by American and allied private sector companies, who bore the brunt of the otherwise targeted attack.24 Moreover, it is estimated that between 2019 and 2024, U.S. companies risk losing $5.2 trillion in value creation opportunities--nearly the size of the economies of France, Italy, and Spain combined--as a result of cybersecurity attacks, with the largest scope of threats facing the high-tech industry, with more than $753 billion potentially at risk.25 And lest we forget, in recent years, China successfully obtained massive amounts of highly personal and confidential data on Americans through their targeted breaches of the Office of Personnel Management, Equifax, Marriott, and Anthem.26 This data could be used for intelligence purposes, empowering decades of highly targeted HUMINT and other campaigns, as well as to train advanced machine learning models on sensitive American data.27These threats, taken together, demonstrate the extremely challenging cyber threat environment facing the nation at the present time.III. The Cyberspace Solarium Commission ReportReleased in March of this year amongst the backdrop of an expanding coronavirus outbreak, a major oil price war, and a rising tide of cyber threats, the Cyberspace Solarium Commission's report represents critically important way of reconceptualizing cyber defense. For example, the Commission's ideas around planning for the continuity of the economy and strengthening systemically important critical infrastructure entities with direct government support both break fundamentally new ground in an area otherwise chock full of studies and reports.In addition, by providing clear, concise, and actionable recommendations for both Congress and the Executive Branch, the report provides policymakers like this Committee with a roadmap for moving out. This face, combined with the caliber of the Commission's members and staff, including two U.S. Senators and two Members of Congress, all of whom have reputations for working across the aisle, means that Commission's Report can certainly have a substantive impact. And we've seen exactly that. A number of the Commission's recommendations are likely to make it through the legislative process over the next few weeks as the House and Senate complete their consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act, and today's hearing is likewise a testimony to the value of the ideas the Commission put together.IV. U.S. Cybersecurity PreparednessBefore turning to the specific legislative question before the Committee today on the National Cyber Director Act, it is perhaps also important to discuss the other key issue before the Committee: namely, our nation's preparedness to confront the key cyber threats facing our nation.The Commission's report addresses this issue squarely, saying that "[t]he United States now operates in a cyber landscape that requires a level of security, resilience, and trustworthiness that neither the U.S. government nor the private sector alone is currently equipped to provide."28 Worse still, the Commission's report notes that "shortfalls in agility, technical expertise, and unity of effort, both within the U.S. government and between the public and private sectors, are growing."29This stark assessment is, of course, deeply troubling. Given the reliance of our nation on cyberenabled systems to function on a day-to-day basis, as well as the fundamentally innovationfocused nature of our modern economy, the notion that neither the government nor the private sector are where we need them to be in order to provide an effective defense for our nation is wholly unacceptable.One of the key challenges that our nation faces in this regard is the core way in which we think about defending the nation in this new domain of warfare. Historically, our approach to national-level threats, particularly those brought to bear upon us by foreign nation-states, is that the federal government will take on these threats. After all, in the traditional environment we don't expect individual Americans or companies to protect themselves against Russian Bear bombers coming over the horizon.30 Rather, we expect American companies to defend themselves against the typical criminals, using appropriately tall fences and armed guards, not surface-to-air missiles. Buttressing this view, in 2012, then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta made clear that the U.S. government's policy was that "the Department [of Defense] has a responsibility...to be prepared to defend the nation and our national interests against an attack in or through cyberspace."31And yet today in cyberspace there is little question that the government does not provides an effective or comprehensive defense of the nation. While we have established U.S. Cyber Command, and provided it with resources, we have not provided it with anywhere near the kind of resources or authorities it would take to actually defend the nation in cyberspace. Indeed, there is every reason to believe that there is not yet a consensus in our nation today on what role government ought have in defending our cyber infrastructure.Nonetheless, the opposite approach, that we ought leave the private sector to fend for itself in defending against foreign nation-state threat actors is likewise untenable. Requiring American companies to stand alone to defend themselves against nation-states which have virtually unlimited resources--both human capital and economic--is to consign ourselves to failure.32 After all, American private sector companies are generally not in the business of defending themselves against cyberattacks; rather, they operate in order to provide products and services to their customers, whether individuals or other businesses, and to generate economic returns from such business.33 Such companies will inherently be constrained from deploying alone the type of defenses it would take to effectively stop a committed nation-state attacker. And yet, this is exactly where we find ourselves today: as a general matter, we expect every private sector company in our economy--from the largest banks to the smallest bake shop--to defend itself against every attacker, whether the Russian FSB or a script kiddie in a basement room.34 This, of course, makes little sense and it therefore should come as no surprise that we are failing at this effort. The Cyberspace Solarium Commission recognized this challenge and provided its bold support and clear explanation of an idea long discussed by many35 but understood by few: the need for collective defense in cyberspace.Noting that the vast majority of the cyber infrastructure is in the private sector, the Commission argued that "[t]he U.S. government and industry ... must arrive at a new social contract of shared responsibility to secure the nation in cyberspace."36 According to the Commission, "[t]his 'collective defense' in cyberspace requires that the public and private sectors work from a place of truly shared situational awareness and that each leverages its unique comparative advantages for the common defense."37Specifically, the Commission argued that "[w]hile the U.S. government has taken a number of steps to develop situational awareness in cyberspace, there continue to be significant limitations on its ability to develop a comprehensive picture of the threat...the data or information is not routinely shared or cross-correlated at the speed and scale necessary for rapid detection and identification."38To that end, among key recommendations like the creation of a cyber joint planning cell and a new public-private center, the Commission recommended the creation of a joint collaborative environment, namely "a common, cloud-based environment in which the federal government's unclassified and classified cyber threat information, malware forensics, and network data from monitoring programs are made commonly available for query and analysis."39 Ensuring that the government is able to combine all of its data with that of the private sector to truly create broad situational awareness in cyberspace is a critical step towards increasing our national preparedness in the cyber realm.And in doing so, the government must be willing to use the national means at its disposal to collect and share actionable cyber threat intelligence with industry at scale and speed, a commitment which has long been made but rarely if ever actually met. Of course, simply creating situational awareness is not sufficient; in order to truly protect our nation in this new domain of warfare, government and industry must train and fight together, collaborating in realtime to protect both public and private sector networks against common threats.Likewise, of course, individual companies ought also engage in collective defense by sharing cyber threat information across multiple companies and industries. We already see quite a bit of valuable sharing taking place within specific industries through ISACs and through collaborative organizations like the Cyber Threat Alliance. It is important to build upon these efforts by broadening and deepening these sharing relationships and turning them into true, real-time collaborations.To that end, and to the extent this Committee is willing to consider additional recommendations from the Commission's reports, rapid full implementation of the Commission's recommendations on collective defense could represent a strong step forward in protecting our nation.V. Proposals to Establish National Cyber DirectorIn addition to the recommendations described above, one of the Commission's core recommendations for reforming the government's cyber policy and operations structure is to establish a National Cyber Director (NCD), within the Executive Office of the President.40 Under the Commission's proposed construct, which finds itself largely embodied in the legislation being considered by the Committee today, H.R. 7331, the National Cyber Director Act, the NCD would be appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, and be supported by an Office of the National Cyber Director which would have two Deputy National Cyber Directors and a core staff of up to 75 individuals, as well as other experts, consultants, and government agency personnel.41The NCD would, among other things: (1) serve as the President's principal advisor for cybersecurity strategy and policy; (2) develop the U.S. National Cyber Strategy and supervise its implementation; (3) making recommendations on changes to organization, personnel, resource allocations, and policies of various departments and agencies; (4) reviewing agency budget proposals for consistency with the strategy; (5) assessing integration and interoperability of various federal cybersecurity operations centers; (6) reporting to Congress on the nation's cybersecurity posture; leading join interagency planning for an integrated federal response to cyberattacks and cyber campaigns of significant consequence; (7) coordinating the development of joint integrated operational plans, processes and playbooks for the President's approval, including the integration of offensive and defensive plans; (8) exercising and updating such plans; (9) ensuring coordination of such plans with the private sector; and (10) directing the federal government's response to cyberattacks and cyber campaigns of significant consequence, including developing operational priorities, requirements and tasks, ensuring deconfliction and execution of operational activities; and coordinating operational activities with relevant private sector entities.42 The NCD would also be permitted to attend and participate in National Security Council meetings and would further be empowered to convene meetings of the National Security Council, the Homeland Security Council, and the National Economic Council with the concurrence of the relevant Presidential advisor responsible for such entity.43According to the Commission, the idea would be to position the NCD and his or her office similarly to that of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and that the NCD "would not direct or manage day-to-day cybersecurity policy or the operations of any one federal agency, but instead will be responsible for the integration of cybersecurity policy and operations across the executive branch."44 Moreover, in the Commission's view, the NCD would "coordinate interagency efforts to defend against adversary cyber operations against domestic U.S. interests" without "imping[ing] on DoD responsibility for Title 10 activities, Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) responsibility for Title 50 activities, or the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) responsibility for counterintelligence activities," although according to the Commission, the NCD "would be kept fully apprised of those activities."45There is no question that the idea of having a senior individual appointed by the President in the White House charged explicitly with the authority to coordinate the various members of the interagency who have responsibilities in the cyber arena--including offensive and defensive efforts--is a good one. Indeed, given the wide range of agencies that have some piece of the government's offensive and defensive cybersecurity missions, there is every reason to believe that strong, centralized leadership in the White House will help get things done and move the ball faster than without such a strategic position. Indeed, if one just counts the primary action agencies with core responsibilities, which includes (but is not limited to) DHS's CISA, DOD's U.S. Cyber Command and NSA, DOJ's FBI, and ODNI, it very quickly becomes clear that coordination is critical if the government is to achieve unity of effort.And in fact, in the past three Presidential administrations, George W. Bush, Barack H. Obama, and Donald J. Trump, something approaching a position with coordination authority has existed, at least until fairly recently (and some might argue even now, albeit significantly cut down and without the level of influence and authority that most experts would agree is necessary to succeed). Indeed, under Presidents George W. Bush and Obama this position had significant influence and coordination power.For example, under President Bush, Neill Sciarrone, working with Melissa Hathaway in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, was able successfully steer the then-single largest executive branch effort on cybersecurity--HSPD-23/NSPD-54 - President's Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative--successfully through the interagency process to completion.Likewise, in the Obama Administration, successive inhabitants of the office including Ms. Hathaway, Howard Schmidt, and Michael Daniel has significant influence and strong coordination roles as did various Assistants to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism like John Brennan and Lisa Monaco. Indeed, even in the early part of the Trump Administration, there is general agreement that Rob Joyce had significant influence and coordination authority in the cyber arena as did Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Tom Bossert.Given the general agreement that such coordination is advisable, and indeed, necessary, one needs wonder why the Commission's approach might be controversial.The first and most obvious issue that would likely trouble any White House--regardless of political party and relationship with Congress--is the idea of having yet another Senateconfirmed appointee in the White House Office. As it stands today, there are four prominent Senate-confirmed officials in the White House Office, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the United States Trade Representative, Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.Of these positions, two relate directly to matters that are textually committed to Congress, namely Congress's power of the purse (e.g., the ability to tax and spend)46 in the case of OMB, and the Congress's authority to lay duties, imposts, and excises and to regulate commerce with foreign nations47 in the case of USTR. As such, both of these positions are core to the relationship between the White House and Congress. The other two positions relate to areas, at least in the White House that are not particularly core to that executive-legislative relationship.And, as a result, even though successive Presidents appointed individuals to all four positions, there is little question that the Directors of ONDCP and OSTP wield drastically less influence in the White House than the Director of OMB and the USTR.The challenge, of course, with a National Cyber Director, particularly as it relates to a position in the White House Office and as described in H.R. 7331, is that this individual would have responsibilities that are generally understood by Presidents to be squarely in their control, namely matters related to the execution of the President's textual Commander-in-Chief responsibilities. And while Congress may certainly argue that it has a number of textual commitments in this area also, like the declaration of war authority and the provisioning of the armed forces, the reality is that Presidents have long taken the view that matters of national security decisionmaking, particularly in the White House, are firmly committed to their discretion. Thus, it is likely that any President, regardless of party or relationship with Congress, would be strongly opposed to Senate-confirmation of such an individual and, if such confirmation was ultimately required, it may actually undermine rather than buttress the individual position's influence and role within the White House.Moreover, making such a position Senate-confirmed essentially seeks to elevate it to an Assistant to the President role, namely a principal officer inside the White House Office. The challenge with doing so, of course, is that the vast majority of issues such an individual would deal with likely also fall squarely within the ambit of the existing responsibilities of the Assistant to the President for National Security (i.e., the National Security Advisor). As a result, if such a position were to be created, it would likely create core conflict within the White House Office: either an NCD whose national security-related decisions and advice would go directly to the President without the views of the National Security Advisor or you'd have filtering of the views of a Senate-confirmed individual in the White House Office through the National Security Advisor who is, of course, not Senate-confirmed. The legislation clearly envisions the former approach--that is, direct advice to the President--which could very well create its own set of coordination and integration challenges within the White House and with the interagency.This challenge is enhanced, in particular, when it comes to areas of clear overlap between existing White House officials like the National Security Advisor (e.g., in the case of offensive and defensive cyber operations), as well as the Director of OMB (e.g., in the case of budgetary authority).48 Where the situation becomes even more problematic, however, is where the NCD's assigned authorities appear to directly conflict with the authorities of another cabinet-level official. So, for example, when it comes to H.R. 7331's authorization to the NCD to "direct" the federal government's response to cyberattacks and cyber campaigns of significant consequence, including developing operational priorities, requirements and tasks, and ensuring deconfliction and execution of operational activities, one might not be surprised if such a proposal encounters extremely stiff resistance from the President, on behalf of the Department of Defense and the Commander of U.S. Cyber Command. After all, while it is not unusual to have the National Security Advisor play a coordinating function across a wide range of national security matters, it is rarely the case that the National Security Advisor is called upon to direct responsive military activities. A similar problem could also arise with the Secretary of State if, as the Commission envisions, the NCD would be the primary representative of the United States to foreign governments and international bodies on cyber matters.49Finally, the size of the office likewise presents its own challenges. While it is true that the USTR has an office of over 200 individuals and OMB has nearly 500,/50 even at 75 authorized individuals, when one adds in the authority for other outside experts, consultants, and other government agency personnel in support, this number is likely to be viewed as too high for the mission. This is particularly the case given that such an office would be roughly 1/3 the size of the entire National Security Council staff, which itself is currently seen as fairly bloated (even after the Trump-directed staff reductions in 2019)./51VI. Recommendation and ConclusionWith all of these challenges, the question is whether having a Senate-confirmed individual is critical to the effort and, if so, whether placing that person outside the White House Office may be a more successful approach. At the end of the day, a more subtle approach working within the White House may be most advisable. Such an approach could involve Congress working collaboratively with the President to determine how best to ensure the long-term existence of a position focused on cybersecurity coordination with elevated rank (i.e., Deputy Assistant to the President) and to ensure the appointment of individuals with sufficient expertise and cachet to move the office forward, as well as small, elite leadership team of 5-10 individuals, made up of significant footprint of cyber-experienced political appointees and additional detailees to support.One approach to solving this problem may be to adopt the method used by Congress to create the NSC Executive Secretary as well as to require the assignment a coordinator for malign foreign influence campaigns.52 The one challenge this approach raise is the question whether such an individual, required to be appointed by statute, could also be required to be a commissioned officer. Assuming not, Congress may wish to use the same approach it took with respect to Special Adviser to the President on International Religious Freedom (e.g., a sense of Congress provision)53 and could also consider adding specific, directive cyber coordination language to the National Security Council functions, as was done with respect to malign foreign influence campaigns.54 Likewise, Congress could put in statute a requirement that the cyber coordinator must brief Congress regularly as was done with the malign foreign influence campaign coordinator.55 These approaches, done right, could achieve many of the goals sought by the Commission, without creating the key problems described herein.Thank you again for the opportunity to present my views to the Committee. I look forward to discussing your questions and ideas.* * *Footnotes:1 Jamil N.

What is China's military-civilian integration strategy that concerns the United StatesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 22, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 419 wordsBodyYears ago, the Chinese government initiated a national strategy of military and civilian integration (MCF) that seeks to modernize the people's republic of China's military and its defense system.  The goal is to recruit private sector companies to develop fundamentally state-of-the-art technology,in areas that used to be dominated by the state apparatus.In its fight for global leadership, theUnited States argues that under the MCF, the Chinese Communist Party (CFP) has obtained –"by lawful and unlawful means",according to the State Department– intellectual property, research data and technological developments to advance its military objectives.According to the Trump Administration, the government is especially interested in 5G and semiconductors (with Huawei in targeting, last May the country changed its export rules to cut the company's chip supply), big data and quantum computing, among other technologies.  In this context, the White House not only sees the MCF is a threat to its interests,but directly accuses the CFP of stealing American technology.Scale the conflict: U.S. demands China close its consulate in...On the other hand, China's Foreign Ministry spokesmanGeng Shuang stated months ago that"there is no such thing as 'theft' or 'diversion' of foreign technology"and that it is a common international practice to promote the integrated development of the military sectors.For the government of Xi Jinping – which foreign media information personally oversees the integration strategy – Washington has deliberately distorted the MCF's sense.According to the Chinese Executive, this is an essential policy – in fact, it has been mentioned in almost every two sessions since 2014, except this year where the coronavirus pandemic was ubiquitous – as China's role on the international stage grows.US vs China: Accuse two Chinese hackers of theft...During the Two Sessions (the annual meetings of the National People's Assembly and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference) last May, the Chinese authorities avoided talking about the MCF, although silence probably does not reassure the U.S., but quite the opposite.The Asian giant says there is no "hidden military spending"and that it follows "a defensive national defense policy."In line with recent years – and in the context of an economy hit by the effects of the pandemic – the country announced a further reduction (to 6.6%) of its military budget for this 2020,which will be around $179 billion.Load-Date: July 23, 2020End of Document

Neil Bush's Chinese Firm Signed Agreement With Space Contractor Considered An Arm Of The Chinese MilitaryThe Daily CallerJuly 29, 2020 Wednesday 01:00 AM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; investigative-group; investigative-groupLength: 2120 wordsByline: Chuck Ross, Investigative Reporter, chuck@dailycaller.comChuck Ross is a reporter at The Daily Caller.Author ImageBodyLink to Image• Neil Bush is co-chairman of a Chinese company that inked a deal last year with a Chinese aerospace giant that the Pentagon deemed last month to be an arm of the People's Liberation Army.• Bush and his partner, Wang Tianyi, organized a symposium last year that featured guests with the Chinese aerospace company, Communist party officials and Russian space officials.• The U.S. government is increasingly concerned about China's space efforts, as well as its burgeoning partnership with Moscow.Neil Bush, a relative of two former presidents, is the co-chairman of a Beijing-based real estate firm that partnered last year with China's main producer of space and military equipment, which the Pentagon recently deemed an arm of China's military.Bush and Wang Tianyi, his co-chairman at the real estate developer CIIC, organized a symposium in November that hosted Chinese and Russian space officials as well as managers from the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), which produces China's space equipment and much of its military arsenal.CIIC signed a “strategic cooperation framework agreement” with CASC in May 2019 that included hosting the symposium, according to a brochure of the event.“The two sides agreed to cooperate on organizing the 2019 symposium, the exchange of international space innovation technology, and promoting international space expo projects,” the brochure says.While there is no indication that Bush has done anything improper, his work with CIIC and CASC comes amid increased scrutiny in the U.S. of China's geopolitical endeavors.Bush, who is a shareholder in CIIC, has drawn attention in the past over his business dealings in China.In 2002, while his brother was in office, Bush signed a $400,000-per-year contract to advise China's Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the Los Angeles Times  reported. In 2009, he represented the China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., known as Sinopec, in a deal to buy a stake in an oil field in Ghana, according to The Wall Street Journal.U.S. government officials and space analysts have expressed growing concerns about China's space endeavors, as well as increased collaboration between Beijing and Moscow on their space programs.The Defense Intelligence Agency warned in a report in January 2019 that “Chinese and Russian military doctrines indicate that they view space as important to modern warfare and view counterspace capabilities as a means to reduce U.S. and allied military effectiveness.”The report said that China and Russia “have taken steps to challenge the United States” by coordinating their space programs.The Defense Department on June 24 designated CASC and 19 other Chinese companies as military-controlled organizations because of their ties to the People's Liberation Army.Several Russian government officials were invited to the November event, and at least one spoke at the seminar, according to an agenda for the event.Brandon Weichert, a geopolitical analyst and author of “Winning Space,” has warned about China's emerging space threat.“As it stands, China is maybe on average 5-7 years behind the U.S. in space - and they are gaining in the strategic high ground of space,” Weichert told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Should the U.S. not respond adequately, then the Chinese will rule the cosmos and whoever rules space rules the Earth below.”CIIC's space goals are not entirely clear. Speeches from Bush and Tianyi posted on CIIC's website show that they advocate for using space exploration to develop technologies for the health care sector. The company's interest in space appears to have started in late 2017 with the group hosting its first symposium in 2018, according to CIIC's website. (RELATED: William Barr Warns US Executives Against Acting As Foreign Agents)Link to ImageChina launches a to Mars, July 23, 2020. The Long March 5 rocket was developed by China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, a subsidiary of CASC. (Carlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters)In June 2019, an affiliate of CIIC signed a contract with the China Remote Sensing Application Smart Industry Innovation Alliance (RADI), which describes itself as the “backbone for China's remote sensing.”CIIC's website includes numerous photos of Tianyi meeting with Bush in China and the U.S. It also includes photos from the conference last year.Bush is listed on a schedule of the event as giving opening remarks alongside Zhang Keijan, the director the China National Space Administration, and two local officials in the Communist party, Ma Xingrui and Guo Yonghang.Xingrui, the governor of the Guangdong province, is a former general manager of CASC.Bao Weimin, a senior official at CASC, also attended the symposium. He is a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a political advisory group for the Communist Party of China.Tianyi also has connections to China's communist party apparatus.The CIIC website shows he signed a business partnership with David Rothschild, the French banker, on March 26, 2014, with Chinese President Xi Jinping overseeing the event. An agenda for the space symposium lists Tianyi as the executive chairman of the International Peace Alliance. The organization was created under the direction of the National Development and Reform Commission, which oversees all of China's major economic initiatives.Russian space officials, including Lev Zeleny, the director of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, also attended the event Bush helped organize. Zeleny spoke on a panel with Yang Baohua, a vice president of CASC, and Steve Eisenhart, the chairman of the Space Foundation, according to the event brochure. (RELATED: Like Clintons, Bush Family Has Ties To Visa Program For Wealthy Foreign Investors)A spokesman for the Space Foundation said that Eisenhart was on vacation and unavailable for comment.CIIC's relationship with CASC appears to be ongoing. CIIC's website published photos of both Weimin and Baohua, the CASC executives, meeting with Tianyi last week to inspect a space center project in Hainan.The Bush China Foundation, which Neil Bush founded in 2017, is listed as a supporter of the event. Bush's biography on the Bush China Foundation website lists him as a CIIC co-chairman.A spokesperson for the Bush China Foundation said that while the organization was not involved in the planning of the symposium, it has no objection to being cited as a supporting institution.“The Bush China Foundation was listed by the organizers as a 'supporting institution' on the strength of Mr. Bush's involvement in the event, given his capacity as chairman of the Bush China Foundation - one of a number of Mr. Bush's distinct capacities, but the capacity of his that relates most directly to China,” the spokesperson told the DCNF.CASC is a central player in China's space race. A subsidiary of the company called the China Academy of Launch Technology (CALT) built the Long March 5 rocket that launched China's first mission to Mars last Thursday.CALT also produces all of China's liquid-fueled ballistic missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative.According to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC), a congressional commission that makes policy recommendations regarding China, CASC is responsible for manufacturing China's “space launch vehicles, strategic ballistic missiles, satellites, and other space flight vehicles.”The Australian Strategic Policy Institute, an Australian think tank, considers CASC to be a “high risk” organization because of its work with ballistic missiles and espionage activities.An April 2012 report from USCC, the congressional commission, said that China's military had ramped up investments “in a wide range of passive and active means to deny a potential adversary's ability to leverage space-based assets.”“R&D investments include foreign satellite communications monitoring systems, electronic countermeasure systems to disrupt an opponent's use of space-based systems, and developing the capability for physical destruction of satellites in orbit,” the report said.“Chinese space system development is intimately connected with R&D investment into next generation extended range precision strike systems” it continued.The New York Times reported in April 2014 that Chinese authorities deployed CASC to use drones to track Uighurs following unrest in Xinjiang that left more than 100 people dead. The Chinese government has cracked down on the minority Uyghur population.Weichert, the space analyst, was not aware of Bush's space-related endeavor, but he said that the Chinese have in the past used the guise of a peaceful world space policy as a means to gain access to other nations' technology.He said that more than a trillion dollars is at stake through mining minerals in space.“A lot of American businessmen are aware of what's going on up there and they want to tap into that. That's a huge amount of money, and if the American government isn't going to lay the infrastructure to that they'll happily partner with the Chinese,” Weichert told the DCNF.He also criticized what he said was a “utopian ethic” among some businessmen and space analysts who believe that China plans to operate in concert with the U.S. in space.“They plan to use space stalkers as an offensive weapon should conflict ever arise with the U.S.” by targeting early warning missile and surveillance satellites, Weichert said.He also warned about the burgeoning alliance between China and Russia.“That would be a killer combo, sort of like Batman and Superman working together,” Weichert told the DCNF. “American businesspeople would happy get on board with that.”A top Russian space official said earlier this month that the Russian government now prefers to work with China over the United States on space issues.Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Roscosmos, said in an interview with a Russian outlet this month, that he recently spoke with Keijan, who he described as “a very influential person and my good friend.”“We agreed to begin the first steps towards each other precisely by defining the contours and significance of the lunar scientific base,” Rogozin said. “And I do not exclude the possibility that this project will, of course, be open to all comers, including Americans. But the initiative here may be with Russia and China.”NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine has previously warned about China's aggressive push into space, questioning whether the communist regime plans to operate peacefully.“China's activities are in many ways aggressive in space,” Bridenstine told the Nikkei Asian Review. “When we think about the future of space, we want it to be peaceful.”Russia and China each reached a milestone in their space programs this week.China's giant leap came Thursday with the launch of its first mission to Mars.#Tianwen1, #China's first #Mars probe mission, if successful, would also mark a first in human history as it aims to achieve orbiting, landing and roving all in one go. pic.twitter.com/kzCBMIpJqx - Global Times (@globaltimesnews) July 23, 2020The U.S. Space Force announced on Thursday that Russia conducted an anti-satellite test on July 15.Gen. John W. “Jay” Raymond, commander of U.S. Space Command and U.S. Space Force chief of space operations, said that the Russian test showed that the Kremlin hopes “to employ weapons that hold U.S. and allied space assets at risk.”Axios has reported that the Bush China Foundation works closely with the U.S.-China Exchange Foundation, a group operated by Tung Chee Hwa, a Hong Kong billionaire with ties to the communist regime.Bush has been an outspoken defender of Beijing's policies, including to its controversial response to protesters in Hong Kong.In one interview, Bush questioned whether “outside forces” were behind the protesters and questioned what freedoms they had lost to warrant their demonstrations.“My first question would be, what freedoms are you seeking that you don't already enjoy? What setbacks have you incurred,” Bush said in a Dec. 6, 2019, interview with CGTN, another Beijing-controlled news agency.China Daily, a Beijing-controlled propaganda outlet, described Bush in December as being the co-chairman of a symposium promoting the peaceful use of space technology.CIIC did not respond to emails seeking comment.Fiona Murchake contributed to this story. Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Ranking Member Menendez Publishes Minority Report: 'The New Big Brother - China and Digital Authoritarianism'Targeted News ServiceJuly 22, 2020 Wednesday 8:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 896 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, ranking Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued the following news release on July 21:Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today published a new report by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Democratic Staff on China's digital authoritarianism. Commissioned by Ranking Member Menendez, the report serves as the culmination of a comprehensive Committee investigation into China's efforts to develop, export, and institutionalize a new, authoritarian governance model for the digital domain.At a virtual briefing to publish the report's findings, Senator Menendez was joined by Libby Liu, former Chief Executive Officer of the Open Technology Fund and former President of Radio Free Asia, Xiao Qiang, Research Scientist at the UC Berkeley School of Information and Founder and Editor-in-Chief of China Digital Times, and Andrew Imbrie, Senior Fellow at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology. Jodi Herman, former SFRC Staff Director, moderated the discussion."China's concerted effort to develop, expand, export, and institutionalize digital authoritarianism as the future governance model of the digital domain represents a fundamental political, economic, and security concern for the United States, our allies and partners, and the international community at large," said Ranking Member Menendez. "As this report lays out, China is seeking to exploit new and emerging technologies to cultivate digital authoritarianism along multiple paths and is utilizing its entire policy toolkit, including political, economic, diplomatic, and coercive means, to shape the digital domain in its desired image. If successful, China - and not the United States and other like-minded nations - will be writing the future of cyberspace."Entitled "The New Big Brother: China and Digital Authoritarianism," the report is the latest installment in a series of Committee Minority reports commissioned by Ranking Member Menendez to examine the most pressing foreign policy challenges facing our nation, as well as to assess the Trump Administration's failure to protect and harness our nation's diplomatic and security architecture.Published against the backdrop of Beijing's recent passage of its "national security" law for Hong Kong to crack down on pro-democracy protestors, and amid the Chinese government's ongoing human rights abuses against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, the report takes a deep dive into Beijing's exploitation of information and communications technologies, products and services to surveil, repress, and manipulate its own people as well as foreign populations."The highest priority for us as the United States is to build up our alliances with people that share our values because the CCP has been very effective in dividing and conquering the like-minded democracies that we live in and support. How can humans have any dignity if they are robbed of their individuality and their basic human rights?" added Liu. "Whenever they exercise the censorship and surveillance and blockages of people using technologies that the Chinese government has financially backed, underneath that action is an entire world of data that is all being vacuumed into an authoritarian government who is determined to create a social credit system."The investigation conducted by SFRC Democratic Staff offers new insights about how China is leveraging new technologies to assert increased control over its population and strengthening its ties with other nations around the globe. The report underscores how China's government employs facial recognition technology and big data analysis tools to identify, discriminate, incarcerate, and "re-educate" Uyghurs living in Xinjiang, creating a police state that flouts basic human rights and civil liberties. China is not just using these tools at home; it is also working to export its high-tech tools and authoritarian principles throughout the globe. The report concludes: "If left unchecked, China, not the U.S. and our allies, will write the rules of the digital domain, opening the doors for digital authoritarianism to govern the Internet and associated technologies.""China's developing digital authoritarianism has not only strengthened the CCP's rule over 1.4 billion Chinese people, it has also created systemic competition with the United States and other democracies. At its core, this competition is over the value of basic human freedom and dignity," said Xiao Qiang."The United States needs comprehensive strategies that leverage the ingenuity and strength of its broad network of democratic allies and partners in facing the China challenge. These countries are more than unique assets in this area; they are asymmetric ones," added Andrew Imbrie.The full report may be found HERE: https://www.foreign.senate.gov/download/2020-sfrc-minority-report_-the-new-big-brother---china-and-digital-authoritarianismThe Principal Findings and Recommendations Pullout may be found HERE: https://www.foreign.senate.gov/download/china-digital-authoritarianism-key-findingsThe Senator's remarks as delivered may be found HERE: https://www.foreign.senate.gov/download/china-digital-authoritarianism-opening-remarksCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7183400 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: July 22, 2020End of Document

FBI director unleashes on China in speechCNN.comJuly 7, 2020 Tuesday 2:55 PM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 924 wordsByline: By David Shortell, CNNBodyChinese hackers have moved swiftly to target US pharmaceutical and research institutions making progress in the fight against coronavirus, FBI Director Christopher Wray said Tuesday in a wide-ranging speech that included some of the agency's starkest accusations about the country's threat to the US to date.Speaking for nearly an hour at a think tank in Washington, DC, Wray called China the "greatest long-term threat to our nation's information and intellectual property and to our economic vitality" and noted the FBI has more than 2,000 open investigations that tie back to the Chinese government.He asserted that Chinese President Xi Jinping has "spearheaded" a campaign to intimidate dissidents living abroad. And as the coronavirus pandemic continues to multiply in hotspots across the US, he described how the Chinese government has moved to pressure American officials to support its response while simultaneously working to steal research on the virus."The Chinese government is engaged in a broad, diverse campaign of theft and malign influence and it can execute that campaign with authoritarian efficiency," Wray said. "They're calculating, they're persistent, they're patient and they're not subject to the righteous constraints of an open democratic society or the rule of law."Wray's presentation comes as the Trump administration launches a renewed campaign to antagonize the Chinese government. Senior US officials, including national security adviser Robert O'Brien and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have taken swings at the country in recent days.Earlier this week, the White House chief of staff said that President Donald Trump would be signing an unspecified executive order about China as soon as this week.Trump has long sought to pin blame for the spread of the virus on China while downplaying his own administration's failures to stop its spread within the country. In a tweet last week, the President said he is becoming "more and more angry at China" as the pandemic continues to spread.China has also come into focus as the leading point of foreign policy debate between Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden ahead of the election matchup between the two. Boosters of both sides have attacked the other on the issue, with Trump campaign ads painting Biden as "China's puppet."Wray on Tuesday described how the FBI has observed "cyber activity tracing back to China" aimed at US organizations that have made a significant announcement about research relating to the pandemic within hours of their announcements, mirroring other warnings from US intelligence officials in recent weeks.Chinese diplomats are also "aggressively urging" federal, state and local officials across the country to support China's handling of the crisis, Wray said, adding that a state senator, who he did not identify, had recently been asked by the Chinese government to introduce a resolution supporting the country's response to the pandemic."All of these seemingly inconsequential pressures add up to a policymaking environment in which Americans find themselves held over a barrel by the Chinese communist party," Wray said.Wray also offered new details on a Chinese program known as Fox Hunt that he said was "spearheaded" by Xi as a sweeping effort to intimidate political rivals and critics living abroad to return home.Hundreds of "Fox Hunt victims" in the US have been targeted by the Chinese government with "shocking" tactics that amounted to "rogue law enforcement," Wray said."When it couldn't locate one Fox Hunt target, the Chinese government sent an emissary to visit the target's family here in the United States. The message they said to pass on? The target had two options: return to China promptly, or commit suicide," he said, adding an appeal for listeners who felt they had been targeted under the program to reach out to the FBI.The Chinese have defended the program as a legitimate anti-corruption effort in the past, including after reports emerged in 2015 that the Obama administration had warned the government against deploying their law enforcement officials here to search for dissidents.Wray said Tuesday that the Chinese government has prioritized the theft of Americans' personal data to bolster their development of artificial intelligence tools and to help identify targets for intelligence gathering efforts.The Justice Department has brought a number of significant prosecutions against Chinese nationals and government officials in recent years in response to the massive and coordinated efforts, which have been aimed at stealing US intellectual property as well as American's personal data. In February, prosecutors brought charges against four Chinese military hackers for carrying out one of the largest operations -- stealing the private information of nearly 150 million Americans from credit giant Equifax in 2017.Wray also detailed how the Chinese are carrying out a "sophisticated malign influence campaign" using "bribery, blackmail and covert deals" to sway public discourse and government policy. For example, Wray said, China has threatened to cut ties with US manufacturers based in the district of elected officials planning to travel to Taiwan. China has also attempted to co-opt trusted advisers to US policymakers to carry their message about the regime, Wray said.The influence efforts are not aimed specifically at impacting the presidential election, Wray said, but they do have implications for the vote and the Chinese "certainly have preferences that go along with that."Load-Date: July 7, 2020End of Document

Also joining the conversation all morning is Fox Business' Dagen McDowell. Campus Reform.org Editor-in-Chief Cabot Phillips and Optimal Capital Director of Strategy and Market Analyst Frances Newton Stacy.Great to see everybody this morning. Thank you so much for being here. And Stephen, let's kick it off with you. Is earnings the focus or something else? What's driving markets this morning and over the near- term?STEPHEN AUTH, FEDERATED HERMES CIO: Yes, I mean near-term it's going to be pretty choppy, Maria, as I've been saying. It's just -- you know, we're not seeing a sharp recovery on the industrial financial side, the buy side of the market. Most of those earnings are coming out and people are a little bit disappointed I think.So, on the other hand it's not falling apart either and everyone is looking forward to when we get through this crisis we know that stocks are going to be worth a lot more, that's the challenge for investors right now, on a two to three year view stocks are going a lot higher pretty clearly, but the problem is in the near-term we've got a lot of chop.The growth side of the market has already had a great run and, you know, those stocks now have to kind of grow into their prices. So, I think we're kind of just chopping wood and then we've got to get through the election.So, it's -- you know, it's a choppy market from here I think to at least November.BARTIROMO: A lot of important events you just mentioned there. I want to ask you about valuations. You mentioned these companies are going to grow into their earnings. The shares in U.S. companies right now are the most expensive that they have been in almost 20 years.When you look at valuations, particularly in technology and biotech, is it time to lessen up, is it time to start selling or you say just hold on with this choppiness?AUTH: We're all -- yes, Maria, we've been holding there. I mean, we -- you know, we've cut our -- back our overweights on stocks in general, though we're still overweight, because we -- you know, unlike the tech bubble in the '90s, which you and I both managed our way through, these stocks actually have earnings in cash flows. They're not like just clicks and -- you know -- things. And so, you've got a chance here --BARTIROMO: That's a great point.AUTH: -- I think these stocks are -- are -- are big growth compounders. We don't see them as being terribly expensive but they're not cheap anymore, that's for sure. They were cheap back in March, so I think they'll grow into their prices easily enough.I wouldn't recommend people, you know, unload these stocks here. Gen -- across the board, I mean there are some that are -- you know -- gone (inaudible), but --BARTIROMO: Yes, I -- I think you make a really good point. Frances Newton Stacy jump in here, because back in the '90s we were -- we were clicks to the website, now we're actually counting revenue.FRANCES NEWTON STACY, OPTIMAL CAPITAL DIRECTOR OF STRATEGY: Yes, or we're counting China trade, or we're counting unemployment or we're counting the Fed.But my question to you is, do you think that with the recent uptick in commodity prices and the decline of the dollar, do you think that we have more of a stagflationary risk, meaning growth going down, inflation going up, or more of a deflationary risk going forward? And how do you allocate given those two different scenes?AUTH: Well first of all, there's no risk of inflation here. Remember, all this money that's going into the economy globally from fiscal monetary is simply replacing money that was going to -- that would have been made. It's not like excess cash in the economy really.It's keeping the economy liquid, inflation risk is very low. Look at what's going on in the bond market, it tells you what the expectation is there. So, I -- I -- I don't see inflation as a risk at all.And by the way, Maria, with these rates so low, valuations on stocks could still go quite a bit higher actually. In fact, that's one of the reasons to like stocks here, they're probably one of the best investment around, particularly just the dividend story is attractive relative to earn (ph) yields.Stagflation, you know, or --BARTIROMO: But look at the dividend versus the yield on the 30 year, 1.9 percent.AUTH: Yes, I mean we're --BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, when you start looking at dividend payers versus where rates are right now it's pretty extraordinary.Real quick Stephen, is -- is markets -- are markets worried about China? Obviously things are getting heightened here in terms of the -- the discussion between the Chinese Communist Party and this administration.AUTH: I think, Maria, markets expect continued -- you know -- back and forth with China here. You know -- under the covers things are moving along fine. U.S. companies are doing OK over there, but China's a big part of the global economy and we've got to some point get to a Pox Americana or some kind of Pox with them over the next few years.And -- you know -- so, the news headlines will -- will affect markets, but I think long-term we'll be OK.BARTIROMO: All right, we will watch that. Stephen, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much.AUTH: Thank you Maria.BARTIROMO: As always, have a good day. Stephen Auth joining us there.We are just getting started this morning.Coming up, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel is here on the 2020 conventions and the election. With the GOP set to hold its convention in Jacksonville, Florida, next month.The CEO of Petco is here, Ron Coughlin on retail and the coronavirus pandemic. And then at 7:00 am Eastern we have the top stories investors are watching this morning. And the world on Wall Street impacting your money.Plus, Connecticut state Treasurer Shawn Wooden joining us on growing diversity in the corporate world.Phillip Morris International CEO Andre Calantzopoulos is here on the company's second quarter earnings.And then at 8:00 am Eastern we've got House Intel Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes on the Durham Probe, as we look deeper into the wrongdoing at the top of the FBI during that Russia investigation.Plus Senate Foreign Relations Committee Member Marco Rubio is here on the threat from China, as the Department of Justice charges two Chinese nationals with hacking data from U.S. firms.And it is Insta star week. We are looking at one influencer this morning whose visual tricks are leaving the social media world speechless. Don't miss it.All that coming up right after this.BARTIROMO: Now this Fox Business alert, the U.S. ordering the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston. The State Department issuing a statement saying, we have directed the closure of PRC Consulate General Houston in order to protect American intellectual property and America's private information.The news coming after local reports overnight that consulate officials were burning documents in the courtyard upon learning of the eviction.China says earlier -- saying earlier, it will retaliate with, quote, firm countermeasures. Should the U.S. proceed with the move?Joining me right now is retired United States Air Force Brigadier General and the author of the book, "Stealth War: How China Took Over While America's Elite Slept," Robert Spalding.General, it's great to have this morning. Thank you so much for being here.ROBERT SPALDING, RETIRED U.S. AIR FORCE BRIGADIER GENERAL: Good morning Maria, thank you.BARTIROMO: What an extraordinary story that they started burning documents. What is your reaction to what has taken place in terms of the U.S. closing down, demanding that this China consulate close down in Houston?SPALDING: Well it seems -- you know -- when I originally saw this, you know, I though immediately they must be burning documents because, you know, they're getting ready to be evicted. And sure enough that's what it is. But, I think the interesting that I'm hearing is that they were involved in some of the political activism that's going on in the United States.So, it is interesting to note that they had to call the fire department because they had so many documents that they were burning.BARTIROMO: That's unbelievable. I mean, we are now cracking down on these hackers, but we understand how this has been going on for so long.The U.S., yesterday, accused two former engineering students for allegedly hacking computers and stealing trade secrets for more than a decade. These hackers allegedly stole for both profit for themselves and for the Chinese intelligence.Recently targeted firms involved in COVID-19 vaccine research. We talked about this for some time and this has been going on for a while. I spoke earlier this year with Senator Tom Cotton on "Sunday Morning Futures" who pretty much predicted this and talked about the importance of protecting intellectual property.Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: You believe that they are stealing intellectual property right now as we speak. Let's talk a bit about that, because the whole world is - - is looking for a vaccine, and I wonder is China trying now to come out of this trying to save face, look better than the rest of the world, while coming up with a vaccine before the United States? What's happening right now with regards to that kind of science?COTTON: Well, Maria, the Chinese Communist Party has been stealing America's intellectual property for decades and they're not going to magically stop in the middle of a pandemic.In the middle of a pandemic what's the most valuable intellectual property in the world? It's the research that our great laboratories and life science companies are doing prophylactic drugs, therapeutic drugs and ultimately a vaccine.So, I have little doubt that the Chinese intelligence services are actively trying to steal America's intellectual property as it relates to the virus that they unleashed on the world, because of course they want to be the country that claims credit for finding those drugs or find a vaccine and then use it as leverage against the rest of the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: General, he was spot on. That was back in April. Our viewers knew this was coming. How are we going to stop China from continuing to steal intellectual property?SPALDING: Well, the whole point of the National Security Strategy is to begin to decouple them from the innovation technology talent and capital of a free society.You know, everybody's worried about the economic impact of decoupling with China, but in reality what you have is this -- these things, these four incredible things that come out of democracies going into state-owned enterprises which are less efficient than market-driven enterprises. And also, going into the graft of the Chinese Communist Party.So, we're actually, I believe, going to see a -- a net gain in our economy over time as we begin to get them out of our system.BARTIROMO: Well, you know, we've gone two and a half years back and forth on a trade deal. The president has gone back and forth with U.S. officials -- U.S. officials here and officials in China and every time the did another iteration of a trade deal, the Chinese kept saying no, we're not going -- we're not even admitting that we're stealing intellectual property. They don't even admit it, General. And now you've got the rest of the world taking notice as well.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo continuing his trip this morning, this tour of Europe, recently arriving in Denmark. He spoke with British officials yesterday, speaking on the importance of pushing back on Chinese influence.Let me ask you, General, in terms of the rest of the world, are they with us against China?SPALDING: So, this is a think that the media has completely missed. Starting in the first quarter of 2018 we began a diplomatic campaign with our allies and partners. This U.K. decision is not a flash in pen (ph). It's taken over two years to put into place.I was in Europe last fall, in Berlin, in Brussels, talked to the German government, talked to the E.U., talked to NATO, they are all beginning to understand, because of this diplomatic campaign, the challenges Chinese Communist Party poses to their democracies.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean look, you've got the U.K. banning Huawei from its 5G infrastructure. You've got India banning TikTok and 58 other apps. You've got Hong Kong who is pushing back on -- on the overreach coming out of the CCP. Is this China versus the free world?SPALDING: It absolutely is. You know, it's -- we're beginning to resolve into a bipolar world again. What's happening is, China's gathering all of the authoritarian regimes to itself and a lot of the emerging market economies with the Belt and Road Initiative.They just recently signed a strategic agreement with Iran. In the United States what we have been doing slowly, methodically since the first quarter of 2018, is beginning to gather the democracies behind us.What we're looking at is the -- is the beginning of a free trade world and a not free trade world led by China.BARTIROMO: Yes, real quick before we go, General, what about corporate America? You know, companies out there still want to sell widgets and everything else to the 1.4 billion person population in China. Are they getting it, the national security risks are real?SPALDING: No, they're not. And, you know, they still think that they need to be incentivized by doing business in China, doing business with the communist party, that's a problem.BARTIROMO: Yes, it sure is. Brigadier General Robert Spalding, it's great to have you. Please come back soon, sir. Thank you so much. Stay with us.SPALDING: Great to be --BARTIROMO: We'll be right back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We are in the process of developing a strategy that's going to be very, very powerful. We've developed as we go along, some areas of our country are doing very well, others are doing less well.It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better. Something I don't like saying about things, but that's the way it is.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: That was President Trump yesterday in his first coronavirus briefing for some time, issuing a grim warning for Americans. He's also addressed the race for a vaccine yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Two vaccine candidates are entering the final stage of clinical trials this month. This was achieved in record time. It used to be years before you were in a position like we are right now.Four other vaccines will enter final trials in the following weeks and we're mass producing all of the top candidates so that the first approved vaccine will be available immediately.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: So, this is his first briefing since May. Dagen McDowell, when I was watching the briefing yesterday I felt like, wow, things might be poised to get worse from here, and sure enough he said it's going to get worse before it gets better. Your reaction?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR: The president, even based on his polling, needed to stand up in front of the American people and lead and lead on his own, and he did that.If you noticed during the briefing no one else was on the stage, no one else spoke and that he needed to present that he is in charge and be realistic with the American people.And I think what came across is, it's really up to each individual. If you believe in the freedoms that are granted to us, that you've got to take responsibility for yourself, your family and your loved ones and wear a mask and social distance and not go to bars.Working with the private sector, Walmart and all of these retailers are banning -- banning people from coming into stores unless they're wearing a mask and then the private sector being involved really around the globe in the development of this vaccine.So again, I think it comes down to personal responsibility. That came across yesterday.BARTIROMO: Yes, and then he was asked, Cabot, where -- where is everybody. Where is Dr. Birx? He said, she's right outside. Your reaction to that presser yesterday, Cabot?CABOT PHILLIPS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF CAMPUS REFORM: Well, I thought it was certainly the right tone, one that I think should have been coming out earlier. I think it was a tactical error for the president to stay away from the podium and away from addressing the American so long. We certainly saw that indicated in some of the polling.But, I thought this message should have been early, for the simple fact of the expectations game, under promising and over delivering, early on it was a much more positive, rosy message of this is going to be fine, we're doing to do great.So then when things took a downturn the American people said, well wait a second, this isn't what you promised us. If this had been the tone from the beginning, of this is serious, but we're Americans, we can get through this. Kind of putting the onus off on the individual, I think that message would have resonated better from the early start.I do think it's probably a part of him being up there alone at the beginning, is probably due to the big riff -- the riff between he and Fauci and I think that was indicated yesterday. I don't think it was part of the overall strategy, I think that was probably a bigger part of it.MCDOWELL: Maria, the reason it's important for the president to get out in front of the American people on this, because when he is absent from talking about the virus regularly, you have the Democrats calling it the Trump virus and kind of gleefully standing on the suffering and the hardship --BARTIROMO: Yes. Unbelievable.MCDOWELL: -- of the American people to basically boost their own political posture and standing. So, I'm waiting for all of those in Washington and around the country to call out the Democratic governors.There were five governors that sent COVID positive patients back into nursing homes and killed many of our elderly. Five governors, first up is Governor Andrew Cuomo, those five governors are all Democrats.So, let's hear about that and the mistakes and the deaths that resulted from those egregious, horrific errors by Democratic governors.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, it's a great point. We'll take a break. When we come back, it's all about the 2020 race. It is heating up and all of this will be part of it, that's for sure.RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel is reacting to Vice President Joe Biden's latest economic plan. It comes with a big price tag and, of course, higher taxes. We'll talk about it when we come right back.MARIA BARTIROMO, ANCHOR, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Welcome back, good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, July 22nd. Let's take a look at markets here at 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast. Futures indicating a lower opening for the broader averages as tensions with China continue to rise. The Dow futures right now down 112 points, the S&P futures down 11, but the Nasdaq continues that fiery winning streak, it is up again another 10 points this morning, this after the Dow and the S&P 500 extended their winning streak yesterday, but the Nasdaq took a breather, yesterday was down 86 points while the Dow was up 160 yesterday, 4 O'clock on Wall Street.Check global markets this morning, European indices are under pressure as concerns of a coronavirus spikes grow. You've got the FTSE 100 down 65, the CAC Quarante in Paris down 67 and the Dax index in Germany lower by 64. In Asia overnight, markets were mostly lower with the exception of China. The Shanghai Composite slightly higher on the session overnight. Meanwhile, a tsunami warning in Alaska followed a powerful earthquake off the coast. Jackie DeAngelis with the details. Jackie?JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS: That's right, and good morning, Maria. The U.S. geological survey says that the 7.8 magnitude quake struck the Alaska Peninsula late last night. It was centered 65 miles south, southeast of Perryville, Alaska. Just hours after the quake, a tsunami warning was issued, but has since been called off. So far, there are no reports of any injuries or damage.And Boeing's 737 Max is reportedly not expected to fly again until October, delaying passenger flights into early next year. The Federal Aviation Administration is still preparing a proposed directive to clear the troubled plane for flight. And the Max was grounded in March of last year after two fatal crashes ahead of the opening bell. We're looking at Boeing shares down 1.25 percent.And here's a look at what's trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. More than 6,000 United Airlines employees have opted to take voluntary severance packages as the airline tries to reduce the financial impact from the pandemic. United's total operating revenue fell 87 percent to $1.48 billion compared to$11.4 billion last year. The Senate Banking Committee has approved President Trump nominees Judy Shelton and Christopher Waller to join the Federal Reserve.They now go to the full Senate for a confirmation vote. And Wal-Mart is spending about $428 million on a new round of bonuses for its employees working throughout the coronavirus pandemic. The company also closing stores on Thanksgiving Day, giving workers the day off, Maria.BARTIROMO: That is good, actually --DEANGELIS: Yes --BARTIROMO: Jackie, thank you so much. Jackie DeAngelis. We're in countdown mode to 2020 and the election. Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden unveiled his $775 billion proposal to help families with child care during the coronavirus pandemic. This plan calls for rolling back tax breaks on real estate investors and the campaign says 3 million new jobs will be created as a result of this. The former Vice President outlined the initiative in a news conference yesterday. He also took the opportunity to take some swipes at President Trump. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This man simply doesn't understand, he can't deal with our economic crisis without serving and saving and solving the public health crisis. He's unable to explain how he'll actually help working families hit the hardest. You know, he's quit on you. And he's quit on this country.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is the chairman of the RNC, Ronna McDaniel. Ronna, It's good to see you this morning, thanks very much for being here. I guess, first, let's start with your reaction to Joe Biden, he says he's going to create 3 million jobs.RONNA MCDANIEL, CHAIRPERSON, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE: Well, Joe Biden is going to crush the middle class of this country with all the proposals he's rolling out, $4 trillion in tax increases, that will be a tax increase on 82 percent of Americans, $2 trillion in climate spending which he's rolled out, which will end our energy independence, make us more dependent on countries like Iran and kill 10 million jobs in this country.And now he's talking about another $800 billion in his new plan that he unveiled yesterday, which of course, would eliminate the child -- the doubling of the child tax credit that the president put in the tax cuts and Jobs Act. Joe Biden is a disaster for America. He has proven to be a Washington politician. Every answer to every problem is raising your taxes. It will crush our country, coming out of a pandemic that is not the answer to grow our economy.President Trump has it right because he's done it before, and he's already doing it as we saw the good jobs numbers last month, as you've seen him put out the PPP plan that allowed small businesses to get funding, to keep their employees. I think Joe Biden is completely wrong. He'd be a disaster for America, and he would tax and bankrupt our country.BARTIROMO: Yes, Ronna, you said something really important that I want to make sure our audience understands because you just said that under Joe Biden, 86 percent of Americans will see higher taxes. You know, he's been going about this whole, you know, taxing the rich, which plays politically for the populace, but when you actually get down to it and look at the numbers, you can't afford to spend $2 trillion here on a green plan and another trillion dollars here on child care without raising taxes on everybody.And so, it's important to recognize that once you start the spending plan, you're not going to just be able to raise taxes on the rich because there's not enough money.MCDANIEL: Exactly, there's not enough money. So everyone, everyone right now will have a tax increase under Joe Biden. Coming out of a time where, you know, we're dealing with this pandemic, where we've had unemployment because of the pandemic, something by the way that we should be united around. I think it's really shameful to see Democrats continue to try and politicize a crisis like we've never seen before, that the president has navigated us through so well with his leadership, getting the ventilators, getting the testing up-to-speed, the PPE.But this is all hands on deck, and you're starting to see the Democrats more and more try and lay the blame at the president's feet for something that came from China --BARTIROMO: Right --MCDANIEL: Where W.H.O didn't inform us quickly enough and the president has been on the front lines of this and leading us through this every step of the way. And you saw Nancy Pelosi yesterday call the Trump --BARTIROMO: Yes --MCDANIEL: Virus. That's so shameful. And I think Americans should reject not only --BARTIROMO: That's unbelievable --MCDANIEL: Their massive tax increases, but what they're putting forward with this, the pandemic as well.BARTIROMO: So, I mean, the president was very serious about masks yesterday, we are now understanding that masks actually do help. We're a month away from the Republican National Convention, Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams is raising concerns about safety surrounding the event. In a statement, he said, "with a growing list of challenges, be it finances, communication, timeline, I cannot say with confidence that this event and our community will not be at risk". This coming as coronavirus cases surge in Florida, the RNC is now planning outdoor events at the convention.Ronna, why do -- why do a crowded -- you know, a crowded jam-packed convention to begin with? The Democrats say, look, we're going to do it virtually. Why not just do it virtually as well, knowing the risks that we all face of standing close together and not social distancing?MCDANIEL: Well, we really have made a lot of changes and, Maria, we are looking at circumstances on the ground in Jacksonville. So right now, the first three days will be open only to delegates, it's a very small number. We will wear masks, we will social distance, there will be testing. But delegates really want to come out and support this president and talk about why he deserves four more years.And I think we can balance doing that in a healthy and safe way, just like we are with opening our economy --BARTIROMO: OK --MCDANIEL: You know, people are at the grocery stores. We have to go to Wal-Mart like you just said. We're figuring out how to navigate this pandemic and opening up America, having a convention, but doing it with the health and safety precautions that are being given to us by local officials.BARTIROMO: Well, we certainly are going to be living with this. We know that. So we're going to have to adapt because people need their livelihood as well. You've been a fundraising run. President Trump's re-election campaign raising$20 million in its first virtual fundraiser. This coming as the Republican National Committee raised nearly $37 million in June. The party now has a record $100 million of cash on-hand. How do you allocate that capital, Ronna, and what are you hearing from donors in terms of the reception you're getting?MCDANIEL: So, the fundraising has been incredibly strong at every level. The major donors, all the way down to those small dollar donors who are giving$40. And what we're seeing is the enthusiasm is incredibly high. The president did a Zoom call last night with I think 300,000 people on it. But beyond that, Maria, and you'll get this --BARTIROMO: Wow --MCDANIEL: It's not the cash on-hand that makes a difference. It's what I'm investing in. So, I have -- we have 1,500 staff on the ground, we've trained close to 1.5 million volunteers -- so you're seeing stories about us outpacing Democrats on voter registration. You're seeing Democrats raising warning flags that Joe Biden has no ground game. The investment we made early in these states is paying off because we're already seeing that pay dividends with voter registration, turning out our vote and organizing towards November for this all-too critical election where there's going to be more mail voting.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. And Ronna, I did not hear Nancy Pelosi say the Trump virus. That's absolutely unbelievable. Yes, you made a great point. Ronna, thank you --MCDANIEL: Yes --BARTIROMO: So much for being here. Ronna McDaniel joining us there.MCDANIEL: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We'll take a break, when we come back, the changing face of retail during coronavirus. The CEO of Petco is here. You know, I have a really warm spot in my heart for him. I'll tell you why when we come back. Then celebrating Instagram's biggest stars, one influencer's visual illusions is leaving the social media world breathless. You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Retailers attempting to slow the spread of coronavirus across the country. Now Petco joining the list of major retailers like Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Starbucks, requiring shoppers to wear face coverings in their stores nationwide. Joining us right now is the CEO of Petco, Ron Coughlin. And Ron, it is great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining me. With coronavirus cases surging across the country, was this face mask requirement an easy decision for you to make at this point?RON COUGHLIN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PETCO: Good morning, Maria, and I hope you're well, I hope Dusty is doing well as well. It was not an easy decision --BARTIROMO: He's doing great, thank you --COUGHLIN: On one hand -- glad to hear. It was not an easy decision on one hand, but on the other, in terms of the safety of our customers and the safety of our partners, it was. I was actually in Omaha yesterday, and a gentleman walked into the store without a mask on, and I walked up the to him -- I had to admit I was a little worried about it, I said we're requiring a mask, can I get you one? And he said thank you very much, he took the mask and had a great shopping experience.Some of our stores are giving out 50 masks a day. If you think about that, on a 5 percent positive rate for sake of argument, one out of 20 masks might be somebody who has the virus and that's inhibiting it being passed to other customers or our partners. So it's absolutely the right decision.BARTIROMO: Ron, how has business been? I mean, obviously the loss of foot traffic has been a major issue, not just for retail but restaurants as well. How tough has this hit been, and do you expect to bounce back the second half of the year and into 2021?COUGHLIN: There's really been three cycles for us. The first one was a stock-up, and business was very strong as consumers started to stock up. Then we had to reside in place and our brick-and-mortar declined, but our e-commerce took off at that window. And then since June, what's really happened is you've seen a shift in disposable income towards people taking better care of their pets which is awesome for the pets and good for our business.So since June, our business has been up near double digits. And he talked about traffic. There's a dynamic of trip consolidation happening. So they're taking less trips, but they're buying more on each trip in our stores, and then on e-commerce, what we're seeing is them taking advantage of options like curbside pickup or just straight e-commerce or repeat delivery, and our e-commerce business is up over 100 percent. So our business is thriving --BARTIROMO: Wow --COUGHLIN: Right now, thanks to our great team.BARTIROMO: And everybody knows I love Petco so much and you, because I adopted Dusty because you found her, adoptions from the Petco Foundation have been through the roof throughout this pandemic. There's Dusty doing really well, loving her new home in New York with me. Tell me about the adoptions and how it's going. I can't tell you how grateful I am for you -- to you, for helping me find Dusty who lost it all in Houston after the hurricanes, but found love once again with my family.COUGHLIN: We couldn't be happier and thank you for taking Dusty. That is exactly what we hope to do, is find an animal in need and a loving parent like you. The first, I'm bummed because I was going to bring my dog, Yummy, to the set this time. So, next time, when you're open for business in New York, I'll bring Yummy. Fostering is up --BARTIROMO: Oh!COUGHLIN: Thirty percent --BARTIROMO: For sure. I love want to meet her.COUGHLIN: Him -- you can't -- you cannot -- it's hard to find a dog in a rescue right now. My daughter volunteers and they're nearly empty. We expect pet ownership to be up about 4 percent this year, which is obviously good for the pets and good for our business. So it's been a good time for adoptions and for fostering, and that makes us very happy. We estimate the foundation has saved about 50,000 lives this year alone, so they do important work, and you know Suzanne, she does a great job.BARTIROMO: Oh, my goodness, Dagen, how about that, 50,000 lives were saved. Ron says you can't even find a rescue right now because there are such demand. Dagen, weigh in.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: You can't find them if you are willing to adopt and rescue a larger dog. The shelters are usually filled with larger dogs, and I would argue Pit Bulls get a -- or pities get a really bad rap. So, you have to -- there's Dale -- I had to leave my dogs down with my dad --BARTIROMO: There's Dale --MCDOWELL: My dogs are with my dad, trying to heal his heart. There's D- dog, I got him from North Shore Animal League. But -- and there's Ramone too. But Ron, wouldn't you agree that dogs need a loving -- large dogs need a loving home too?COUGHLIN: They do, and sometimes -- you make a good point, Dagen. We -- the shelter that my daughter is volunteering in, there was a mastiff and he had some issues because his parent died, and he's a more difficult dog, but for the right loving home, he is a phenomenal type dog to put in that home, and we need to find homes for them as well. So, you make a great point, Dagen.BARTIROMO: Ron, thanks for doing what you're doing, we so appreciate it and thanks for joining us. Ron Coughlin from Petco, we'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Yes, it is time for the Morning Buzz. First up, hey, Alexa, can I get your number. The loneliness of quarantine is really getting to some as a new study shows 28 percent of people are admitting to being attracted to Amazon's voice recognition software. Cabot, go figure.CABOT PHILLIPS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, CAMPUSREFORM.ORG: A lot of people have been complaining about getting in fights with their significant others throughout the quarantine. This seems to be the opposite issue. I think the real reason, because Alexa doesn't talk back, there's no other arguments to be had because Alexa just listens, that's what people love -- very strange point here, keep in mind, anything you're saying to Amazon's Alexa could probably be heard in a warehouse somewhere by a worker. Careful what you say to her when you're in love.BARTIROMO: Good point. How about this, bringing the restaurant home, TGI Friday is now offering an online butcher shop where you can purchase a selection of the ready to cook meals and turn your kitchen into the restaurant.

Deadly secret of China's illegal fishing fleetCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 25, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 2711 wordsBodyThe battered wooden "ghost ships" float adrift across the Sea of Japan for months, carrying as the only load of north Korean fishermen raved by hunger and whose bodies have been reduced to skeletons. Last year more than 150 of these macabre vessels reached the shores of Japan and in the last five years have been more than 500.The appalling phenomenon baffled the Japanese police for years, whose best guess was that climate change pushed the presence of squid beyond North Korea, taking the country's desperate fishermen at dangerous distances off the coast, where they were homeless and dying into the open.But an investigation by the news division of the US television network NBC News, based on fresh satellite data, has revealed what marine researchers now see as a more likely explanation: that China is sending a previously invisible navy of industrial ships to illegally fish in North Korean waters, violently displacing smaller North Korean ships and leading a decline in the once abundant Squid populations in an order of more than 70 percent.Chinese vessels— about 800 in 2019 - appear to be violating UN restrictions prohibiting foreign fishing in North Korean waters. Such restrictions, imposed in 2017 in response to the country's nuclear tests, were intended to punish North Korea by not allowing it to sell fishing rights in its waters in exchange for valuable foreign exchange."This is the largest known case of illegal fishing perpetrated by a single industrial fleet operating in another nation's waters," said Jaeyoon Park, a data expert at Global Fishing Watch, a global nonprofit organization co-founded by Washington-based Google. The organization specializes in artificial intelligence and satellites that, along with a team of academic researchers, discovered the Chinese fleet.Evidence of violation of restrictionsChina is a member of the United Nations Security Council, which unanimously signed up to recent sanctions on North Korea. But the fleet that violates this ban comprises nearly a third of all Chinese fishing forces from distant waters, according to Global Fishing Watch.Asked to comment on the investigation, China's Foreign Ministry said that "China has consistently and thoroughly complied with Security Council resolutions concerning North Korea." The ministry further added that China has "systematically punished" illegal fishing, but did not acknowledge or deny sending vessels to North Korean waters.In March, two countries complained anonymously through a report to the United Nations on China's violations of these restrictions and provided evidence of the crimes, including satellite images of Chinese vessels fishing in North Korean waters and testimony from a crew of Chinese fishermen who said they had alerted the government to their plans to fish in North Korean waters.The fishing banks of the Sea of Japan, known in the two Koreas as the East Sea, are located between both Koreas, Japan and Russia and comprise some of the most contested and least guarded waters in the world. Until now, the huge presence of Chinese ships in this area was largely obscured because the captains system-shut their transponders, making them invisible to ground authorities, which in most conditions is illegal.However, Global Fishing Watch and its associated researchers were able to document the activity of these vessels using various types of satellite technology, includingone that detects bright lights at night. Many squid fishing boats use extremely strong lights to bring prey closer to the ocean surface, making squid easier to capture. The Chinese also use what is called "pair trawlers", i.e. two boats that go side by side with a net stretched between them that combs the seas, and which are easier to track by satellite as the two ships move together.On the other hand, some of the motif ships in this study kept the transponders of their Automatic Identification System (AIS) on fire when entering North Korean waters."Widow villages" in North KoreaIn recent years, so many North Koreans have disappeared into the sea that along the east coast of the country some North Korean port towns, including Chongjin, now call them "widow villages." According to the Japanese Coast Guard, more than 50 North Korean bodies arrived on its beaches in the last two years.The bleak rise of these ghost boats coming to shore has exacerbated paranoia and inflamed a tense history between Japan and North Korea, leading to Japan's speculation that ghost ships carry spies, thieves or possibly even armed carriers of contagious diseases."If a Korean ship were to get lost, it would come destroyed by the time it ran aground on our beaches," says Kazuhiro Araki, director general of the Kidnapping Investigation Organization, a marginal institution that studies the history of hundreds of Japanese citizens who were allegedly kidnapped by North Korea in the 1970s and 1980s. "But some ships have come to our shores intact, albeit without men on board, and it is possible that these people are spies who managed to disembark." This is not a widespread conclusion, however, and the most likely explanation is that these Koreans are nothing more than ill-equipped fishermen who take desperate risks and venture too far from their coast, according to Jung-Sam Lee, an academic at the Korean Maritime Institute and one of the authors of the new research for Global Fishing Watch. After being whipped by typhoons or beingdrid by engine failures, fishermen are transported by the Tsushima current, which runs in a northeasterly direction, towards the west coast of Japan, Lee says.Covered with seashells and seaweed, these flat-bottomed wooden boats are 4.5 to about 6 meters long and usually carry between five and ten men. They have no toilets or beds, only small jugs of clean water, nets and fishing gear, according to research reports from the Japanese Coast Guard. They fly ragged North Korean flags and helmets are often marked with numbers or inscriptions painted in Korean letters, such as "Department of State Security" and "Korean People's Army".All the bodies found aboard these ghost ships appear to be men's,although the high state of decomposition of some has led Japanese investigators to make great efforts to determine it for sure. Political tensions between countries and the lack of transparency of North Korea's "Hermit State" make it difficult to get an official explanation of the phenomenon.Fishing boats as warshipsIn 2004, China signed a multi-million dollar fisheries licensing agreement with North Korea that resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of Chinese vessels in North Korean waters. International sanctions imposed in 2017 in response to intercontinental ballistic missile launches and Korean nuclear testsaimed to restrict key sources of income from that country.China, a longtime benefactor of North Korea, signed the restrictions after being pressured by the United States, and in August 2017 China's trade minister publicly reiterated its government's commitment to enforce these new provisions.Seafood remains North Korea's sixth largest export, and in recent speeches the country's dictator, Kim Jong Un, pressured the state seafood industry to increase its production."Fish are like bullets and artillery shells," said in 2017 an editorial by Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the Workers' Party of Korea in power. "Fishing vessels are like warships that protect the people and the homeland." Following UN sanctions and as foreign exchange reserves have shrunk, the North Korean government has sought to bolster its fishing industry by turning soldiers into fishermen and sending these ill-formed seamen into notoriously turbulent waters. Restrictions have also intensified North Korea's gasoline shortage. Japanese researchers say some of the Korean fishing boats arriving on Japanese beaches suffered engine failure or simply ran out of fuel.Since 2013, at least 50 survivors of these ramshackle ships have been rescued, but in interviews with Japanese police crew members rarely say more than they were drifting at sea and want to be returned to their homes in North Korea. Autopsies of bodies found on ships usually indicate that men died of starvation, hypothermia or dehydration.In 2013, North Korean fishermen were constrained by the capacity of their 12-horsepower engines and regularly traveled only to a few tens of miles off the coast, a former North Korean fisherman who defected to South Korea in 2016 and now lives in Seoul reported."Government pressure is higher now and there are 38-horsepower engines," said the defector, who called for anonymity for fear of reprisals against his family. "People are more desperate and can get further away from the coast." But marine researchers say the pressures of the North Korean government are not the only factor."Competition from Chinese industrial trawlers is likely displacing North Korean fishermen, pushing them into waters for neighbouring routes," said Jung-Sam Lee, the researcher whose institute also discovered in 2018 that hundreds of North Korean vessels illegally fished in Russian waters.In 2017, the Japanese Coast Guard also reported that it had detected more than 2,000 North Korean fishing boats illegally fishing in Japanese waters. In more than 300 cases, the Japanese Coast Guard used water cannons to force ships to leave the area.Worst location for illegal fishingMany types of fish and sea creatures are disappearing around the world at an unsustainable rate due to climate change, overfishing and illegal fishing by industrial fleets. As these fish stocks shrink, competition grows and clashes on the high seas between fishing nations become more common. Seafood-loving countries such as Japan and South Korea are being displaced by the growing fleets of Taiwan, Vietnam and, above all, China.In 2018, China accounted for about 15% of total global fishing catches, more than the total combined catches of countries in second and third place, according to the United Nations Fisheries Agency. Many of the closest fish stocks to theChina's shores have been exhausted due to overfishing and industrialization, so the Chinese government heavily subsidizes its fishermen, who sail around the world in search of new fishing territories.In recent years China's fishing fleets were responsible for between 50 and 70 percent of squid caught offshore, according to an estimate by the Chinese government. These vessels often fish illegally in other countries' territorial waters, according to the analysis of marine research company C4ADS. According to another index published last year by fisheries and global crime experts, China has the world's worst score for illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.The Sea of Japan comprises disputed water areas for which the surrounding countries—Russia, Japan, and the two Koreas—do not recognize each other's maritime borders. The Chinese's incursion into this region has only escalated local tensions.Chinese fishing vessels are famous for their aggressiveness, are often armed and are known for ramming their competitors and foreign patrol boats, according to U.S. Navy officials and maritime security specialists. Chinese media often refer to the country's maritime clashes with other nearby Asian nations as an extension of the former Three Kingdoms of China, which waged a fierce three-pronged battle for their supremacy.In 2016, tensions escalated between Seoul and Beijing as a Chinese vessel fishing illegally in South Korean waters sank a South Korean coastguard. The Coast Guard was in South Korean waters and was trying to stop a Chinese fishing vessel that was allegedly caught fishing illegally when another Chinese vessel rammed it from behind.In the same order of things, while gathering information in South Korean waters for this investigation, the reporters of this article filmed 10 illegal Chinese fishing vessels crossing into North Korean waters. However, the team of reporters was forced to deflect course to avoid a dangerous crash after one of the Chinese fishing captains suddenly turned to the reporters' team ship and approached within 10 yards with the intention of scaring them.Sighted at night and about 160 kilometres from the coast, Chinese squid ships do not answer radio calls and travel with transponders off.Squid in extinctionAn annual migratory species, the so-called Pacific flying squid, spawns in waters near the southeastern port city of Busan or off South Korea's southernmost island, Jeju. In the boreal spring, the species swims north before returning south, to its birthplace, between July and September.In 2017 and 2018, illegal Chinese ships, which are typically about 10 times larger than North Koreans, captured both squid and Japan and South Korea together, some 160,000 tons, worth more than $440 million each year, according to research published in science advances.Marine researchers fear a total extinction of this squid colony, which has already decreased by more than 70 percent in South Korean and Japanese waters since 2003.The Chinese fleet is primarily to blame for the hasty fall because by targeting North Korean waters, its industrial vessels are capturing the squid before it grows enough to procreate, said Park, the scientist at Global Fishing Watch.Since the Chinese authorities do not make their fishing licences public, Global Fishing Watch says there is no way to verify that all the boats thatenter North Korean waters have been authorized by the Chinese government. However, the organization corroborated that the ships were of Chinese origin through several other sources of information.These sources of corroboration included transponder and other radio communications, records of South Korean Coast Guard officials regularly boarding and inspecting fishing vessels heading to North Korean waters, indicating that vessels left Chinese ports or waters strictly limited to Chinese vessels , records indicating the use of a distinctive type of rigging or ship design from China, and satellite information showing that vessels previously fished in rigorously monitored and prohibited Chinese waters on foreign vessels.The approximately two dozen fishing vessels that the NBC News reporter team witnessed heading to North Korean waters had entirely Chinese flags."When they come, they take over everything," says Kim Byong Su, governor of Ulleung Island, located in the East Sea about 120 kilometers east of the Korean Peninsula. Small strip of land belonging to South Korea, Ulleung is the closest port to North Korea's fishing banks.Mayor Kim says Chinese squid fishermen have decimated the island's two main sources of income, tourism and fishing. At Jeison's market, near the pier, rows of squid hung on ropes are seen as clean clothes bent in the sun, drying to become preserved. Squid vendors estimate that the cost per kilo of squid today is about three times higher than less than five years ago.The island's men over the age of 40 are mostly squid fishermen, but a third of them are now out of work due to declining stocks, the governor says. The fact that such a crucial species for local culture may disappear has shocked this community, whose identity has been defined by squid fishing for centuries.Historically, most Ulleung restaurants served fried, dried or raw squid as a free snack, but now these dishes are absent on many menus.Local encouragement towards the Chinese fleet worsens, according to Governor Kim, when sometimes a year it ravages bad weather and a fleet of more than 200 Chinese squid fishing vessels arrives simultaneously to weather the storm. The governor says he doesn't have the power to tell them to leave.They throw oil, throw garbage, run all night loud smoke-dropping generators, and as they leave they drag the anchors and destroy the island's freshwater pipes, Kim Byong Su explains."The outside world," Kim argues, "he must know what's going on here."----Ian Urbina, a former investigative journalist for The New York Times, is director of The Outlaw Ocean Project, a Washington-based nonprofit news organization dedicated to reporting on environmental and human rights crimes at sea.Clarín and Outlaw Sea Project.Translation: Román García AzcárateLoad-Date: July 26, 2020End of Document

Vatican allegedly hacked by China ahead of key talksAssociated Press InternationalJuly 29, 2020 Wednesday 1:06 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 466 wordsDateline: VATICAN CITY BodyVATICAN CITY (AP) — The Vatican and the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong have been the targets of alleged Chinese state-backed hackers ahead of talks on renewal of a landmark 2018 deal that helped thaw diplomatic relations between the Vatican and China, according to a monitoring group.The alleged attacks by a group called RedDelta began in May with an eye on September talks to renew a provisional agreement on bishop appointments, according to a report Tuesday by the U.S.-based Recorded Future, which tracks state-backed cyber attacks. The attacks were first reported by the New York Times.The Vatican had no immediate comment. The Chinese foreign ministry denied any involvement, calling the report ‘’groundless speculation.’’Recorded Future said that the Hong Kong Study Mission to China — a key link between the Vatican and China — and the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions also were targeted.‘’The suspected intrusion into the Vatican would offer RedDelta insight into the negotiating position of the Holy See ahead of the deal’s September 2020 renewal,’’ the report said. It also could provide ‘’valuable intelligence’’ about Hong Kong-based Catholic entities’ position on the pro-democracy movement.The attacks continued at least through July 21. They included an apparent phishing attempt with a document on Vatican Secretariat of State letterhead directed to the head of the Hong Kong Study Mission to China.China’s estimated 12 million Catholics are split between those belonging to the government-backed Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, which is outside the pope’s authority, and an underground church loyal to the pope. Underground priests and parishioners are frequently detained and harassed.A landmark 2018 deal between the Holy See and China on bishop nominations was aimed at uniting the flock, regularizing the status of seven bishops who were not recognized by Rome and thawing decades of estrangement between China and the Vatican.But some of China’s underground faithful have deep reservations about the deal, seeing it as a sell-out to the Communist government and a betrayal of their long loyalty to the pope.China routinely denies engaging in a state-sponsored program to steal commercial secrets or sensitive government information over the internet, and says it is among the biggest victims of hacking attacks. The U.S. disputes that and says it has traced cyber intrusions to the Chinese military. Earlier this month, Washington indicted two Chinese citizens for allegedly launching hacking attacks against companies in the U.S. and other countries.The Justice Department also said hackers working with the Chinese government targeted firms developing vaccines for the coronavirus. China says Washington has provided no information to back up the charges.Load-Date: July 29, 2020End of Document

China's Huawei faces European Wall of SovereigntyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 8, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 644 wordsBodyIt seemed that the Huawei group had done the hardest thing in Europe to preserve its presence in future 5G networks, but the covid-19 crisis and growing concern about technological sovereignty are shaking up the chinese giant's ambitions.On Monday, in France, the director of the National Computer Systems Security Agency (Anssi), Guillaume Poupard, announced that Huawei will not be the subject of a "total ban" but the operators using it will receive, at best, operating permits limited to up to eight years.Much less than the ten to fifteen years usually granted in the sector.Playing "with the duration of the depreciation of the equipment installed by the operators," says Sylvain Chevallier, a telecommunications specialist at BearingPoint, "the foundations of a more or less slow transition" to a Huawei exit from French mobile networks.For industry experts, the goal of Paris is perhaps to push Huawei towards the exit, giving time to the operators who use it to prepare for its transition."With the first authorizations that should start being announced by the end of the week, we'll know what the address will be. If there are many, it will mean that operators can generally expect to continue with Huawei, or on the contrary, the message will then be pretty clear," says Jean-Luc Lemmens, Idate's director of media and telecommunications.France is not the only country that has doubts. Having considered limiting Huawei's market share in its networks, the UK has hardened the tone.After starting to negotiate with several companies, such as South Korean Samsung or Japan's NEC, the British government is now openly talking about "reducing the share of high-risk suppliers," as Huawei recently declared Digitalization Minister Oliver Dowden.According to the British press, a plan to kick Huawei out by 2029 could be announced this month.In Germany, the government has never made a decision on this. The Social Democrats demand security criteria that would mean the elimination of Huawei, while the Conservatives, with Angela Merkel at the helm, fear the consequences of such a decision in trade with China.What the Chinese group fears most is a domino effect that excludes it from the market in both Europe and the United States.- China watchful -Europe is an essential market for Huawei, insofar as it is almost equivalent to its share in the Chinese market.Until now, the group had managed to prevent European countries from bending to PRESSURE from the United States to exclude it from the 5G mobile network.The White House accuses Huawei of allowing Chinese intelligence services to intervene in their equipment, which the company flatly denies.Representatives of the US administration have often traveled to Europe in recent months to convince European governments, in principle, without much success.Until the pandemic hit, which has once again raised European countries' concerns about the need for economic and technological sovereignty.In the case of France, "there is some inflection in the position of the government that until now was very neutral. It is no longer a question of potential danger but a political issue, which is new," says Sylvain Chevallier.A trend feared by the Chinese government. Beijing has reacted to Guillaume Poupard's interview to call for an "open, fair and non-discriminatory environment" for companies in all countries, including Chinese companies.Above all, because "some European operators have returned to Nokia and Ericsson, anticipating the aspiration for greater sovereignty of their governments. It's areal background trend," Chevallier says."It is clear that in some respects, Huawei is ahead of schedule, in others, they are rather Nokia or Ericsson, it all depends on the needs of the operators in terms of deployment strategy and what they intend to do with the 5G," says Jean-Luc Lemmens.els/aue/dlm/af/zmLoad-Date: July 9, 2020End of Document

Zhao also pushed the theory that the U.S. military was responsible for the outbreak of coronavirus in China's Wuhan province. (RELATED: Twitter Slaps Misinformation Label On Chinese Spox's Tweets Claiming US Army Started Virus)Video of Zhao's statement on the Floyd protests was posted to China Global Television Network's official Twitter account.

Continue reading TikTok unveils $200 million fund for U.S. creatorsTikTok today announced a $200 million fund, aimed at helping top creators in the U.S. supplement their earnings, and potentially coax the next Charli D Amelio out of the woodwork.Called the TikTok Creator Fund, the money is aimed at helping  eligible  creators on the platform earn a livelihood, it said. Eligible for now is defined as 18 years or older, meeting a certain      (unspecified) baseline for followers, and consistently posting original content that is in line with TikTok s community guidelines. The platform will begin accepting applications from      U.S.-based creators starting next month and distribute the capital over the coming year.The promise of payouts is coming at a key moment for the app and its Chinese parent ByteDance . TikTok has been facing mounting criticism in the US, its biggest market by revenues, over how it      handles user data and its ties to China, with calls from the Trump administration to ban the popular app outright.And in response to that, TikTok has been making moves to present a more friendly face to the US. It has pledged to add 10,000 more staff in the US, and this week rumors began to circulate that      investors in the US are considering buying a majority stake in the TikTok business back from ByteDance to establish control of the company out of China s hands.(It s not clear if the latter is testing the waters of sentiment, or just an outright rumour, but as an aside to that, these days, ByteDance and TikTok try to go to great lengths to show they      are not connected, if you go by how they handle their PR: Chinese spokespeople will not answer TikTok questions and refer journalists to the US team.)Vanessa Pappas, GM of TikTok s U.S. business, said in a blog post that ByteDance is starting the Creator Fund at $200 million and plans to increase it over time. She did not disclose how TikTok      would decide what sum would be paid to an individual creator, and whether there would be any additional conditions to getting a payout. (We have asked about this and how many followers creators      might need to have to be eligible, and will update as we learn more.)TikTok already helps its creators sign brand partnerships and sponsorship deals, and it provides monetization for live-streams. The platform also has a $50 million Creative Learning Fund to      introduce teachers to the platform, which has been used by some 1,000 teachers in the U.S. already. And a Creator Marketplace connects brands to creators to collaborate on paid campaigns. Through the TikTok Creator Fund, our creators will be able to realize additional earnings that reflect the time, care, and dedication they put into creatively connecting with an audience      that s inspired by their ideas,  she said.TikTok currently employs about 1,400 people in the U.S. and recently crossed the milestone of 2 billion installs globally. Last year, it said it had 26 million users in the U.S.Several lawmakers including Senators Chuck Schumer and Tom Cotton have expressed concerns in recent months that TikTok s user data could end up with the Chinese government. China-headquartered      ByteDance insists that it does not share any user s data with the Chinese government, and that it stores its U.S.-based user data in the U.S. and Singapore. Earlier this week House lawmakers      voted 336-71 to bar federal employees from using TikTok on government-issued devices.TikTok, which appointed Disney streaming executive Kevin Mayer as its chief executive officer in May this year, also insists that it is a Cayman Islands incorporated firm.For now, it seems that the programs that TikTok is launching are squarely aimed at fighting that fire in the US. It did not respond to a request for comment asking what it was doing to help      creators in other markets supplement their earnings.India, where TikTok has more than 200 million users and over 1 million creators, banned TikTok and 58 other apps developed by Chinese firms late last month over cybersecurity concerns. Its      neighboring nation Pakistan issued a  final warning  to TikTok earlier this week over what it deemed  immoral, obscene, and vulgar content. See Campaign:https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiktokContact Information:Manish SinghTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: July 24, 2020End of Document

The drug maker released its pricing plan this morning as it gets ready to begin charging for the drug next month.The company will charge two prices in the United States. One for patients with private insurance and a lower price for government programs like Medicare. Remdesivir is the first antiviral drug shown to be effective in treating COVID-19 patients. Gilead shares are rising on the news. It is up 3 percent right now.The fight against COVID-19. Coronavirus cases spiking in the United States with tens of thousands new cases yesterday alone. Many states seeing the spike as reopening begins. Texas has shut down bars across the state. California closing bars in seven counties including Los Angeles.Several U.S. states have either paused or reversed their reopening amid the spike in cases.Joining me right now is Wyoming senator, Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Energy Committee member John Barrasso.Senator -- your state is also seeing an increase in cases now. Good to see you. Thank you for joining us.I know that at one point you are really looking at the economic impact as even more hurtful than the actual health care issue. What would you say about the state of play today?SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R-WY): Well, I was in Wyoming this weekend. We continue to reopen smartly. We are doing it safely. We know what we need to do in terms of distancing and masks and proper hygiene.And what you take a look at the numbers across the country there are some spikes. It's a concern. But not a crisis. We are not turning back. We need to continue getting people back to work. We need to get our schools open, our kids back to school. Protect the most vulnerable. And then develop that vaccine that is going to help protect us into the future -- Maria.BARTIROMO: So what do you want to see in terms of the economic -- how the economy plays out here? Do you want to see more stimulus? Where are we in terms of the economic recovery?BARRASSO: Well, you saw the job numbers from last month. That has been significant. We are going to get job numbers again on Thursday and that will be -- that will be telling as to how well we are doing with getting people back to work.The numbers have been good with consumer spending, as well. All those things are very important. People also need to be -- have the sense of confidence that they can go out and spend money and do the sorts of things that they want to do and so that will be a telling statistic as well. I think critical is getting our kids back to school. That makes it a lot easier for parents to go to work.And then in terms of specifics --BARTIROMO: Do you think we will see another stimulus package? At some point?BARRASSO: Well, in terms of --BARTIROMO: Yes.BARRASSO: -- yes, in terms of the specific -- so at this point we are saying we are going to take a reassessment after the 4th of July. A lot of money has already been sent out. There's still a lot that has not yet gone out.So we will take a look and say do we need to do more or not? At this point, if we do, I would say we need to be focused on things that are going to make a long-term impact for our country -- roads, bridges, highways, infrastructure, getting people back to work. Those are jobs that will develop in every state and are ready to go right now. So that is part of it.In addition, what we're seeing is help wanted signs all across the country. I went to a store in Wyoming that was closed and they have help wanted signs outside and they're not open because they can't find workers because of this perverse incentive that is right now built into our unemployment insurance, these bonus payments of $600 dollars.BARTIROMO: Right.BARRASSO: That expires the end of July, as you know. But right now some people are getting paid more to stay home than they are to work.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a very good point.Philip Wegmann -- jump in.PHILIP WEGMANN, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Senator Barrasso -- Phil Wegmann of RealClearPolitics.Pandemics complicate elections with a likely increase in mail-in ballots. Do you think that we should be preparing for a delay in election results come November?BARRASSO: Well, I think that's a very good point. You take a look at some of the primaries that have been held with a lot of mail-in ballots. I think they still haven't declared the winner in the Democrat primary in Kentucky which was a week ago. Because they're counting the ballots there.But yet that whole system seem to work pretty well. They just don't have the results yet. Other states and it sounds like Georgia didn't go as well with the voting in the mail-in ballots.I think by November people are going to be better prepared to deal with it across the board. In Wyoming we sent out to all voters, the secretary of state did, a request for an absentee ballot for our primary so people can vote absentee if they like. The polls will also be open with social distancing. So it's up to each state to make the decision.But you're right. It may take a while to get the final results.BARTIROMO: So Senator -- each state makes the decision on whether or not to do mail-in voting? I mean where do we stand on that because the AG William Barr keeps saying that mail-in ballots open the floodgates for fraud. Are we going to see more mail-in ballots in this upcoming presidential election?BARRASSO: Well, there is a history in the past of fraud in elections. And certainly mail-in ballots can contribute to that. But every state makes its own decisions, whether they have vote by mail or not, when actually early voting starts.Every state makes that decision. Some don't have early voting. Some have a couple of weeks of early voting. Some have up to seven, eight or 10 weeks of early voting. So it is a state by state decision.And then in terms of the ballot counting when it is when they get receive ballots when it's postmarked -- those are all state-by-state decisions.BARTIROMO: Ok. We want to ask you about investigating the deaths of American soldiers -- Senator, because President Trump is pushing back on a "New York Times" report that said that Russian intelligence paid Taliban linked militias in Afghanistan to kill American and British soldiers. The report also claims that the Trump administration was briefed about this in late March but is yet to authorize a response.The President tweeted yesterday that is not true. He says, "Nobody briefed or told me, Vice President Pence or chief of staff Mark Meadows about the so-called attacks on our troops in Afghanistan by Russians as reported through an anonymous source by the fake news 'New York Times'. Everybody's denying it and there have not been many attacks on us."Senator -- what do you say?BARRASSO: Well, you know, I went to Afghanistan with President Trump for Thanksgiving to be with the trooped. If he had heard that this had happened, I think his -- this isn't something he would ever tolerate. He would want to retaliate.When I think about Russia, this is -- I mean it's very disturbing but it's not surprising. This is who Vladimir Putin. And he's cunning. He's opportunistic. He's aggressive.Look this is a guy that cheats on the nuclear arms deals. He tries to undermine our elections. He uses energy as a weapon. All of those things. So nothing that Vladimir Putin has done would surprise me.But I just cannot imagine President Trump knowing and not acting on this. He would want to retaliate and it would need to be something that would be forceful as well as punishing.BARTIROMO: All right. You mentioned infrastructure a moment. The House of Representatives we know set to vote on the $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill this week. The bill aims to stimulate the economy and add jobs amid this coronavirus pandemic.You have your own bipartisan infrastructure bill in the Senate -- Senator. Tell me about that. What is most important in the bill and will this head to the President for signage?BARRASSO: Well, you were right when you said the word bipartisan. The bill that we have in the Senate passed the Senate committee 21 to nothing. It's something that the President has supported, was mentioned it in his state of the union. And it's something that on my committee Bernie Sanders has voted in favor of.It gets money to the states immediately. The things that will do the rebuilding of our nation and get people to work.What the House has passed is really a testament to their love affair with red tape and the Green New Deal. It is a road to nowhere. It is -- they left the Republicans completely out of it. There's nothing bipartisan about it. It is completely partisan.So if there is an additional bill -- a recovery bill for our nation I think that this ought to be included as part of it. What we've done in the Senate in a bipartisan way to get people to work and get projects, built in ways that can be done -- faster better, cheaper, smarter and safer -- all of those things are included in the Senate bill.BARTIROMO: And it's also something the country needs badly, by the way.Senator -- it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much. Always a pleasure to talk with you.BARRASSO: Thanks -- Maria. Great to be with you.BARTIROMO: Senator John -- and to you. Senator John Barrasso joining us.Much more ahead coming up this hour. The Hudson Institute senior fellow Michael Pillsbury is here talking about the latest on China imposing new visa restrictions on Americans.Then suiting up online. One company looks to tailor your suits using artificial intelligence.You are watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.We have a rally underway this morning. Futures indicating a triple digit gain at the start of trading. Up 202 points on the Dow. Up 9.5 on the Nasdaq. Up 16 points on the S&P 500.Despite the fact that the number of coronavirus cases are surging in certain states fueling concerns about an economic reopening recovery. But gains in Boeing are lifting the broader market.Joining us right now is Stifel chief economic Lindsey Piegza. And Lindsey - - it's great to have you this morning.Let me kick it off with your expectations for the second half of the year. Larry Kudlow was on this program last week and he said to expect a 20 percent GDP gain in the third quarter and a 20 percent GDP gain in the fourth quarter. You buying it?LINDSEY PIEGZA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, STIFEL: Well I do expect the GDP to improve in the third quarter but I'd look for a lesser rise, somewhere around 10 percent, just about half of what Larry Kudlow is looking for.And by the end of the year it's likely that we do see the economy get back into negative territory. I do have a lot of concern about lingering restraints on part of the consumer both because of health concerns as well as lingering financial restraints.We also could see a very large second round flare-up in the fall of this virus resulting in perhaps further closures or second round of restriction which we are actually already seeing as you mentioned in some states that have opened too soon.So I am optimistic that we will see a near-term bounce. But longer term that's going to take much longer and a much bumpier road to get on a sustainable upward trend to positive growth.BARTIROMO: So in that in that scenario where we go negative again in the fourth quarter or really reverse from -- from gains in the third quarter -- what industries do you feel will still be growing?PIEGZA: Well, I do think that consumers are still going to be spending. But it's going to be a different type of spending. It's going to be more reflective of what we saw in the second quarter. So consumers are still eating and drinking but they're eating and drinking at home as opposed to going out to restaurants.We are also seeing consumers are still spending on entertainment, so sporting equipment, subscriptions. These things that we can absorb or we can incorporate into our lives more isolated away from the general marketplace.So I do think that these things that we've seen in the second quarter are going to continue to carry forward into the second half of the year.BARTIROMO: Makes a lot of sense. Mitch Roschelle.MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER: Lindsey -- good morning. One thing I'm trying to understand, you know where Uber focused on the quarter over quarter jumps in GDP, whether really down or up but if we look at it over a long term, does our economy when it's fully back to normal, is it going to be at the point that it was before all of this started?So, I'm just less concerned with shape of the recovery but when we fully recover if the economy is still going to be the same size it was before.PIEGZA: That is a great question, and it remains to be seen. But I am a little skeptical that we're able to just easily get back to new normal referring to a pre-pandemic growth rate of around 2 percent to 3 percent.I do think it's going to be several years before we reach that point, if we reach that point. And in fact, looking at the Federal Reserve's longer term projections for the U.S. economy they're also skeptical. Their long-term rates forecast with U.S. economy is just 1.8 percent.So even below that reduced 2 percent level that we saw going into this year prior to the pandemic. So there is the concern that as we struggle to emerge from this virus, there are going to be long term resources, savings that are permanently depleted and leave us at a more retarded level in terms of longer run productive capacity.BARTIROMO: Now, over the near-term Lindsey -- what are you expecting from the June employment report. It's due out this Thursday morning. We are expecting another increase in jobs. The economists are looking at three million jobs added to the economy. We also have some key earnings out this week like Macy's. What would you say about this near-term economic data coming out?PIEGZA: Well, I think we're actually going to see some good news, if you can believe it, in the near term. Last month's report unexpectedly added millions of jobs. I think we add millions more this month. I think we are going to see around two million added with a further decline in the unemployment rate.Now of course, we do expect the unemployment rate to remain in double-digit territory but still a step in the right direction as we're slowly starting to put some workers back into a position of gainful employment.Of course, as we talked about some of the largest, most populous states beginning to roll back some of their easing on restrictions, we could actually see a second wave of lay-offs.But let's take the glass half full. We do expect an additional two million maybe more jobs added in this week's employment report.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Lindsey -- great to get your insights. Thank you so much. We'll be watching, of course.PIEGZA: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: We've got all hands-on deck on Thursday when the jobs numbers come out this week.Coming up, Ivy League changes. Princeton University renaming a building named after an American president. The decision coming up.Stay with us.Plus how your summer road trip could hit your wallet.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Calls for change growing across the country on everything from universities to airports. Princeton University announcing that it will be removing President Woodrow Wilson's name from its public policy school and residential college. The university's board of trustees citing Wilson's racist thinking and policies as the reason.Lee Carter -- Princeton voted four years ago to keep Wilson's name on the buildings but now have done a full reversal. Your take.CARTER: I think it's a fascinating time. When you look at support for these kinds of changes whether it's changes in names, whether it's taking down statues, whether it's -- all of the things that we have been looking at over the last month or so since the tragic murder of George Floyd, we are seeing that only about 53 percent of Democrats support the removal of statues. You see only 25 percent of Republicans support those kinds of things.And now when you go on to think about (ph) changing the name of a school, when you go on to changing the name of an airport and so on and so forth, even less.And so it really is something that is not that popular although it feels like it is in the moment I'm not sure that people feel like this is enough.What we do want is equality and this isn't the way to do it. And so what I'm worried about though is that Republicans rather coming up with equality measures, talking about equality, taking the right stance are going to start demonizing the left and they're going to start attacking the left for these kinds of policies. And I don't think that is the right thing. I think Republicans need to talk about what they're standing for, not what they are against.BARTIROMO: Well, it's interesting that you say that because, you know, I think you are right. You know, most of them say well, we're against this and yet they allow it to happen. So they say they are against it but are they really against it?And in terms of, you know, taking statues down, I mean nobody has the right to go destroy somebody else's property. I don't know why this is just being allowed throughout the country like this. Is anybody going to stand up and say wait this is not your property? You can't just destroy infrastructure of a city.CARTER: I think it's a really, really good question. And I think that there are so many people right now afraid to take a stand, afraid to do the wrong thing. They're nervous about saying the wrong things.Donald Trump has never been nervous about that but there is a lot of people who are. And I think that Republicans need to come up with a stance and a position that shows their support for equality but still stands against these kinds of behaviors.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, Democrats as well. I mean John Wayne Airport in Santa Ana, California could be getting a new name. Orange County Democratic officials passed an emergency resolution to remove the late actor's name and statue citing Wayne's comments on African-Americans, Native Americans and the LGBTQ community in a 1971 interview in "Playboy Magazine".In it Wayne says quote, "I believe in white supremacy apparently".Paul Wegmann -- your thoughts.WEGMANN: I think what we are experiencing right now is that there is no limiting principle when it comes to this type of retroactive censure of history. You can go after a confederate statue one day but if you do not establish a principle about local government figuring these things out for itself, you know like the administration has long argued, next it could be a statue of Abraham Lincoln or George Washington.That was far-fetched (INAUDIBLE) months ago, now we're seeing this happen today. And I think to Lee's point, Republicans need to articulate a better argument other than just pointing that Democrats are doing something that's unpopular.BARTIROMO: Yes, I think it's all really important points here. What is next -- JFK Airport? You know, is that next. When does it end -- Mitch?ROSCHELLE: I think the -- Lee now that this is all part of cancel cultural and I think people aren't standing up and saying this is wrong because they are fearful that they will get canceled for having made that comment. And I think we need to draw a line somewhere and need to Phil's point, we need some guiding principles because we can't just erase all our history.BARTIROMO: Well, that is the thing. I mean JFK was an adulterer right? So is that the standard? What is the standard? Somebody has to come up and take a stance here. And even though the Democrats are saying we are not in favor of this, they are allowing it to happen.You've got, you know, writing on the streets "Black Lives Matter" throughout the streets. I don't know is that what we want in the cities?CARTER: I think what we need to (INAUDIBLE) is some unifying principles that we can all stand behind. I think right now, there's so much rhetoric around what we are against. There's so much tribalism, demonization of the other. And what we need to do is come up with common principles that we all agree with.And that's by the way, what President Trump won on in 2016. He had principles that we all agreed on. We wanted to bring jobs back. We wanted to get the economy going again. And really we don't have that same kind of a movement right now. And that's what America needs.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. And then you see these rioters burning down cities -- something has got to stop. This has got to stop to bring law and order back to our country.Meanwhile this scene -- quite a scene in St. Louis. A couple protecting their home from protesters and it's all caught on tape. Wait until you see what happened here.Much more ahead.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: And it's all caught on tape. Wait till you see what happened here, much more ahead. You're watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, June 29th. Let's look at the market right now, 8:32 am on the East Coast.Futures pointing to a pretty good rally at the start of trading this morning, triple digit gain despite the surge in Coronavirus cases. Dow Futures right now up 158 points, that is off of the highs of the morning. The NASDAQ is negative. It has now, turned back now into negative territory with the decline of 8 points. The S&P 500 currently up 12, half a percent higher.Global markets this morning, slightly higher. European indices are higher across the board here, with FTSE 100 up 43, CAC up 19, and DAX Index up 65.In Asia though, a different story. It was negative pretty much across the board as coronavirus cases surpassed 10 million across the world. Worst performer was Japan and Korea, down about 2%. In fact, retail taking a hit in Japan down 12.3 percent in the month of May. It was much worse than economists had expected.Well, it was a scary scene in St. Louis, Missouri as white couple points guns at a group of protesters. Cheryl Casone with details now, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Maria. And take a look at this video. The unidentified couple were caught on camera in a video shared on social media, aiming guns at the crowd of protesters who were marching to the mayor's home nearby to call for her resignation. This is upscale neighborhood Missouri City.Now Mayor Lyda Krewson, read the names and addresses of several residents who called for her defund city's police department during an online briefing. It is not clear if police were told about the couple pointed their guns at these protesters. But mayor, though, later apologized for everything, saying she didn't mean to cause so much distress.Well, your summer road trip might cost you a little more. The price at the pump jumped $0.6 over the past two weeks. The states began the process to reopen. This morning, the average price is $2.18 a gallon. That is more than $0.50 for the average price this time last year, according to latest survey.And here's a look at what's trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. Former NFL MVP quarterback, Cam Newton has reportedly signed a one year deal with the New England Patriots, worth up to $7.5 million. American Airlines says it will resume selling every set available on its flights starting this Wednesday, lifting one of the precautions it tool to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.And just in time for summer Chick-fil-a is introducing its new mango passion tea lemonade, and they're bringing back their peach milk shaky. All of that starts today, Maria.And those are your headlines, back over to you.BARTIROMO: Sounds good. I like it, Cheryl, thank you so much.Meanwhile, there is unrest in Hong Kong once again. The Communist Party of China announcing it will impose visa restriction on US individuals, just days after the United States imposed sanctions on any Chinese officials accused of curbing freedoms in Hong Kong. This come as the Chinese government is examining a national security law that would tighten its control over the region and anniversary of the Handover is this upcoming Wednesday.On "Sunday Morning Futures", I spoke with Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton about China's aggression and how the coronavirus is being used by communist party as a tool.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: China, you have said and others have said, is using this COVID pandemic as an opportunity to gain more ground. Can you tell me about it?SEN. TOM COTTON (R), ARKANSAS: The Chinese communist party is certainly using the pandemic, to try to assert claims, and take very aggressive action against almost all its neighbors, just go around the horn. You started in India where high up in the Himalayas, China has essentially invaded India. And then in Hong Kong, they've passed legislation that violates their international commitments, or commitments to people of Hong Kong. It is essentially going to turn Hong Kong into the same kind of police state, Mainland China is.And in the South China Sea, they've taken aggressive action against our partners, countries like the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam. They've repeatedly invaded the airspace in recent weeks of Taiwan. And just this past week, they've taken aggressive action against Japan in the East China Sea. China is becoming more aggressive than ever.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Hudson Institute Director Senior Fellow and Director of the Center for Chinese Strategy Michael Pillsbury. And, Michael, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us here.Do you believe that the rest of the world is with us, with the United States in terms of the pushback on China's behavior? Is Europe and other areas of Asia, are they with the United States on this?MICHAEL PILLSBURY, SENIOR FELLOW, HUDSON INSTITUTE: Not really, Maria. In most countries in the world, there is someone like a Tom Cotton who sees the threat, talks about it, maybe introduces legislation. But they're all aware what happens to Tom Cotton's bills. He gets four or five cosponsors. He's got nine pieces of legislation right now in the Senate, almost none have any cosponsors more than three or four.This was happening in Europe, it's happening in Japan, India. This debate on China has been fed by Chinese themselves. Don't worry about us, we're not doing anything. We just want to make Money. And so far, the Chinese are getting -- increasingly arrogant, Maria, as their GDP, they say, surpasses us. They now believe that they're the number one economy in the world.BARTIROMO: Well, what about cracking down on Chinese technology, in Europe as well. The National Security Counsel and other US agencies are pushing Europe to drop its ties with Nuctech, a Chinese state-controlled company that screens cargo.They are screening cargo at ports and it's competing for contracts in a dozen European countries. This on top of the debate around Huawei, because Huawei of course has back doors in its infrastructure where data goes right back to the communist party.PILLSBURY: Well, so far, the campaign on Huawei has not been a big success. This new tech stories on the front page of the Wall Street Journal today, the one you're mentioning. I don't agree with you. We're pushing. It says we're going to ask nicely to European countries who already have the scanning technology not to buy it.But the price is half, and it's quite efficient. So this is another example where the President wants to take the lead in do things against China, but rest of the -- both the Congress and Executive Branch don't really get involved in new things.In the Cold War, Maria, 1947 when it began, we created the CIA, NSC, Joint Chiefs of Staff, many other organizations to deal with Cold War in Soviet Union. There is nothing new set up on China so far, for at least in the last 10 or 15 years. So we're not fighting very hard against these Chinese threats.BARTIROMO: What about the Pentagon reporting, at least 20 companies tied to the Chinese military are operating in our country? I mean, how is it possible that you've got all of these companies trading on New York Stock Exchange, and the NASDAQ that are Chinese companies, basically getting funding from US investors, and many of them are tied to things like the Uyghur population or the military. We know civil military fusion.PILLSBURY: Yes. Well, this is really important, Maria.BARTIROMO: What should be done?PILLSBURY: I think a lot of people want to get -- get the President's attention on the 20 Chinese companies, the Pentagon revealed. By the way, it took 20 years for the Pentagon to reply to a congressional demand to list these 20 companies. They're giant companies that receive subsidies. They are going to be targeted if phase two of the trade deal, which is still on-hold.But this is extremely important. These massive Chinese companies are helping the Chinese military, and we have provided capital, some of them are on New York Stock Exchange. It's really outrageous. The Pentagon is really to be commended for releasing this list of the 20 companies last week.Also Robert O'Brien brought it up in his speech, but nothing has happened yet, Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes, he did. Yes. I mean, it's pretty incredible to me when I talk with these global money managers who want to just throw their ESG down your throat and basically tell you we're are not going to invite, and we're not going to invest in "sin stocks", like tobacco companies or oil companies. And yet, they're perfectly fine managing the money of Chinese communist government, and they're perfectly fine going into China with 1.5 million Uyghurs behind bars, so pretty much in these camps.Now, we've got new information with the Uyghurs, China's government taking extreme measures to control birth rate of Uyghur Muslims. So there's a new investigation from associated press that shows widespread efforts, including pregnancy checks, sterilization, abortions on hundreds of thousands of women raped. Some China experts even calling the effort a "demography genocide", Mike.What can you tell us here about the Uyghur population in China where they would like to pursue their own religion whether it would be Muslim or Tibetan, but the Chinese communist party will not allow that? You have to study Chinese culture and that's why they are in these camps.PILLSBURY: I don't know if you heard the phrase that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo uses. I agree with it very much. He calls his human rights suppression of Uyghurs stain of the century. There's been a lot of discussion of how the Chinese are getting worse and worse in the violation of domestic human rights.But once again, Maria, the President by himself, and a few advisors, can't really take on this kind of issue. We don't have structure, either in the Congress or the Executive Branch, to take on the massive challenge from China. So I don't think much is going to happen in terms of --BARTIROMO: But what about -- what about, Mike. What about the massive challenge of intellectual property theft. Chinese researchers have been sent here, across the United States they are being ousted and outed for, or arrested for stealing American intellectual property, and then sending it back to the communist government?Attorney General Bill Barr, just last week on "Sunday Morning Futures" told me that China and the communist party has gotten much more aggressive, and there are consequences for this. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The DOJ has been efforting to crack down on Chinese espionage. Can you tell me a bit about what the CCP is doing? I know there's been a real rethinking of the relationship between the United States and China.BILL BARR, US ATTORNEY GENERAL: The way I look at it, this is fundamental challenge to the United States. They want to be the leader in all the future technologies that are going to dominate the economy. And so, what's at stake is the economic opportunity of our children and our grandchildren, whether we can continue to be the technological leader of the world.The Chinese have embarked on a very aggressive program during this time of stealing, and cheating, in order to overtake us. They've stolen our intellectual property. When they steal our secrets with our future technology, they are stealing the future of the American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And, Mike, they are doing this in a number of ways, as you know it. Apparently, do you see the CCP having gotten much more aggressive in the last year or so in terms of sending researchers into America? Under the guise of students, under the guise if exchange programs to actually steal agriculture, military, technology information and bringing it back to the communist party?PILLSBURY: Much more aggressive, Maria. I think FBI director said, there's at least 2,000 cases the FBI has opened now go back to China. God bless Attorney General Barr, he certainly on the right track in saying the right things.You know, he wanted to be a China expert at CIA when he left Columbia University. So as he makes jokes about how he's really a China expert, I think he is. This China initiative that the Department of Justice has, very promising, but we need to see how many people they are going to assign to it, how many cases will go to trial.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, I think that's really good point, because the fact is, is that the resources are being strained. They have 2, 000 cases open. Some people think it should be 10,000 to 50,000 cases open, but many of our resources are protecting statues, and stopping looting. That's where we are right now.Michael Pillsbury, it's good to see you this morning. Sir, thank you. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Custom suits can cost thousands of dollars. So imagine buying one without even trying it on. More and more people are doing just that. Jackie Deangelis is here now to explain the new online trend. Jackie, good morning to you.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. Well, as the economies reopening, businesses are adapting to this new normal. They're finding new ways of doing business. This is consumers are demanding options to calm their fears, right?So in the world of, custom suits, it's a traditionally extremely personal purchase. Companies are innovating to go make the process virtual. In the United States, revenue for men's suits is a little more than $2 billion. In China, it's about 3.5 billion. Remember, suits are global and so is the coronavirus.Now, instead of going in, picking up the fabrics, getting measurements taken, you can do most of it remotely. Knot Standard is one of the better known firms and they've created this technology, an app, that literally scans your body for measurements. They've previously used the technology in the store, rolling it out virtually, quickly has been challenging but a priority for them.Taking photos of body, artificial intelligence can literally help figure out person's body shape. And there were plenty of people who were in need of suits who are willing to give it a try. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MATT MUELLER, FOUNDER KNOT STANDARD: We expected a handful of them to raise their hand and say, I'm willing to give this a shot, maybe because I have more time on my hands. And we've had over 500 in a few weeks. So, it's been stunning.(END VIDEO CLIP)DEANGELIS: Despite the fact that Knot Standards hit to its business because of pandemic, it actually says that it started recovering in mid-April, much sooner than other businesses that are just now opening their doors. Because of the convenience of virtual operations, it also has new customers.Nicholas Joseph helps customers choose fabrics and fits with the Zoom-type of consultation. It used to take two hours for a session, and the shower may now takes 10 minutes for those measurements. And the suit is mailed for virtual fitting.Now, Spier & Mackay and other brand, has taken a different approach. No people at all, you tell them what you want. They make it. But this is for those people who are familiar with their process. They know their measurements.So it's interesting, because you've got a company like Microsoft, closing stores, realizing after pandemic, it doesn't need them. The suit industry may not do that but it has realized there are different ways to do business, and they might in fact be seamless, Maria.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. Yes, we'll all learning how to do things differently. Jackie, great story, thank you.DEANGELIS: Sure.BARTIROMO: Jackie Deangelis reporting. Coming up, how this pandemic is changing the way we commute. We're taking a look at that after the break. You are watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. President Trump just tweeting this, "Can anyone believe that Princeton just dropped the name of Woodrow Wilson from their highly respected policy center? Now, the do nothing Democrats want to take off the name John Wayne from an airport. Incredible stupidity," writes the President.We discussed this topic earlier this hour. And I want to get your take, Mitch Roschelle, on what the President should be doing. Do you think people want him to be tough to say to Princeton, well, you're going to remove this name, you're cut off from federal funding. Well, you want to remove John Wayne's name from the airport, we'll federalize the airport.Do people want him to see -- to be tougher given the fact that the governors and mayors are not doing anything? They're just allowing it.MITCH ROSCHELLE, FOUNDER, PWC REAL ESTATE ADVISORY: Yes. I think, you know, the consensus from our panel earlier was that, we're looking for leadership around this issue. Because, if you cancel one thing, then we cancel something else, where does this all end?So I think in the polling data that Lee had suggests that people are not by and large in favor of all of these monument teardowns and name changes. So, I think the answer is, there is a search for some leadership around this issue.BARTIROMO: And particularly the status, Lee, these belong to someone. This is not anyone's property that you can just go destroy.LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY PARTNERS: That's right. I think what people are really looking for, and we did talk about this a lot, is there's got to be a principle that we can apply to say what is right and what is wrong. We can't just say anything and everything is on a table right now.BARTIROMO: Yes.CARTER: This is part of our history. I've heard people make jokes about what are we going to do, write a new Declaration of Independence because of some of the practices of the original, you know, founding fathers. The certain point, we've got to put a stop to it, and we've got to say what we're for, what we are about, and move on.BARTIROMO: Yes. Philip Wegmann?PHILIP WEGMANN, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: The irony here is that Woodrow Wilson spent a lot of his career trying to educate young men at Princeton to move past the founding and to forget about the declaration of the constitution. What's so interesting now is that, the, you know, future alumni are now trying to forget, you know, Woodrow Wilson.And what's interesting is that, Woodrow Wilson's progressivism is not in lockstep with Trump's originalism on the constitution, and yes, he is also defending that (inaudible).BARTIROMO: Yes. We will take a short break, and then more "Mornings with Maria" right after this. You are watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us, everybody.Load-Date: June 30, 2020End of Document

And it is Wednesday, July 22nd.Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.We have breaking news this morning.Overnight, the U.S. ordering China to close its consulate in Houston, as reports come in of documents being burned at that consulate.Meanwhile, China is trying to steal Covid-19 research now. We know this for sure. Two Chinese nationals are accused of hacking into companies here in the United States and other countries, targeting the development of treatments and vaccines. You heard that here first back in April when Senator Tom Cotton joined me on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES."(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: You believe that they are stealing intellectual property right now as we speak.SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AK): I have little doubt that the Chinese intelligence services are actively trying to steal America's intellectual property as it relates to the virus that they unleashed on the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: President Trump, meanwhile, making a grim prediction on the coronavirus yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It will probably, unfortunately, get worse of before it gets better.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Yes, the president also urging people to wear masks and saying a vaccine remains a top priority for his administration.Coming up at 8:10 a.m. Eastern this morning, FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn is here. We will talk about that vaccine coming up.Meanwhile, markets are under pressure this morning. Take a look at futures indicating a decline at the start of trading this morning. The Dow Industrials down 84 points, the Nasdaq is up 20 points, but the S&P 500 this morning also weaker by eight. This after the Dow and the S&P 500 continued a winning streak yesterday. The Nasdaq took a breather with a decline on the session of 86 points at 4:00 on Wall Street.It is one of the busiest days yet for second quarter earnings. Big names are reporting today, including Microsoft, Chipotle, CSX and many will look towards Tesla, which has been on an electrifying run this year. Tesla reports tonight after the close.Plus, this morning, our week-long look at Instagram stars continues. Next hour Zach King, his astounding illusions have earned him over 23 million followers. The magic behind his success coming up.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.Global markets this morning also with a negative tone. Take a look at European indices under pressure as concerns over the coronavirus spiking grows. The FT 100 is down 56, the CAC quarante is down 56 as well, and the DAX index in Germany lower by 52.In Asia overnight markets were mostly lower with the exception of China. The Shanghai composite closed slightly higher while the Hong Kong Hang Seng was down 2.25 percent.Joining the conversation this morning, Dagen McDowell, Cabot Philips and Frances Newton Stacy.Great to see everybody this morning.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you.CABOT PHILLIPS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, CAMPUSREFORM.ORG: Good morning.BARTIROMO: And some of the top stories that we are watching this morning, we begin with a "Fox Business Alert" right now.The U.S. is ordering the Chinese government to close its consulate in Houston. Hours after that announcement, a fire broke out at the building. Things were burning. A State Department spokesperson says it ordered the closure to protect America's intellectual property and information. But then local reports say that classified documents were being burned at the consulate. Firefighters were not allowed on the property because it's considered Chinese territory. China is now vowing to retaliate, calling this an unprecedented escalation.This coming after the Justice Department charged two Chinese hackers yesterday, accused of targeting research on a coronavirus vaccine. Federal officials say they stole hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of trade secrets and intellectual property from U.S. and foreign companies. The DOJ says the stealing of information was to benefit the Chinese government. The indictment did not say if the men managed to steal any of the Covid-19 research or data.President Trump holding his first Covid-19 briefing in more than two months, issuing his warning about the pandemic, which has now killed more than 142,000 American.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better.We are in the process of developing a strategy that's going to be very, very powerful.And the world is suffering, but we're going to get it taken care of.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers are hashing out the details of a new stimulus panning. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the fourth round of assistance will include another round of direct payments to American families. Both McConnell and the Trump administration have said that they want to target lower income and unemployed people.A violent night in Chicago, meanwhile. Fourteen people were shot last night outside of a funeral on the city's south side. Police say an SUV pulled up and started firing. Last night's shooting follows several days of gun violence in the city. Twenty-five people were shot on Monday. Mayor Lori Lightfoot says she will work with federal agents to fight this violence, but she's vowing to keep officers out of the city.Time for the "Word on Wall Street" where we discuss what's driving markets. This morning, how to allocate your money and the economy, of course.Joining me right now is BelPointe Asset Management Chief Strategist David Nelson, Optimal Capital Director of Strategy Frances Newton Stacy, and IHT Wealth Management President Steve Dudash.Great to see everybody this morning. Thank you so much for being here.Tensions with China obviously heightening. The U.S. ordering China to close its consulate in Houston as reports are come in of documents being burned on the site. The State Department says the closure is to protect American intellectual property.David, your reaction? Is this a market mover?DAVID NELSON, BELPOINTE ASSET MANAGEMENT CHIEF STRATEGIST: I don't know if it's a market mover, but it's certainly been going on for some time.Look, China's going to remain an adversary in every sense of the word. It's not just trade. It's not just the economy. But it's foreign policy as well. And the theft of intellectual property goes well beyond just technology and healthcare. Look at their J-31 strike fighters, almost an exact clone of a Lockheed Margin F-35. And that, for me, points to me, as an investor, to areas like defense.BARTIROMO: Well, that's absolutely right. I mean they're stealing things like military data, agriculture data, medicine data. It's -- it's -- it's every sector pretty much.Meanwhile, it is the busiest day for second quarter earnings. Investors are waiting on Microsoft and Tesla today.Steve, what's your expectations for the overall earnings season and any thoughts on what we're going to hear tonight? How have earnings been so far?STEVE DUDASH, PRESIDENT, IHT WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Yes, a little known company no one ever really talks about, Tesla's got their earnings tonight. Listen, it might be the most statistically meaningless earnings report ever out of that company because, one, I mean with the virus situation, everyone's numbers are a little off and you -- that's just (INAUDIBLE). But, two, it doesn't matter what they say, the same outcome happens every single time lately. Short sellers are going to get burnt. Robin Hood investors are going to buy a bunch more And Elon's going to be worth a few billion dollars more by the end of the day.The real question though is, are they able to massage their numbers enough to get inclusion in the S&P 500? Are they going to surprise on that? A lot of people think that that is what the real word on the street people are talking about is can they get there. We believe they probably will.But to our investors, I get this question literally every day. If you're buying a stock or a company that you feel has the potential to continue to surprise on the upside, to continue to beat earnings, then go for it, buy into a company like this and don't listen to anyone else.But if you're just buying it because it's up and that's the only reason why you're buying it, do yourself a favor, Google Tulip (ph) prices, get a little history lesson, because this sure rhymes (ph) a lot with what's taken place in the past.BARTIROMO: Yes.Yes. Or Google 1999 when we were all counting clicks to the website instead of earnings and revenue in the '90s.DUDASH: Exactly.BARTIROMO: But, Steve, the stock has taken off and --DUDASH: Yes.BARTIROMO: You know, it's at $1,600 a share on Tesla. Just from a valuation standpoint, do you want to wait or do you want to buy?DUDASH: But you are thinking like a logical, rational person when you ask that question. That's not what's going on right now. We both know this. This is an emotional based situation with the stock price.BARTIROMO: OK.DUDASH: It doesn't matter that they're producing x number of cars in a single quarter. And that's what I'm saying. I mean we joke a little bit here. But that's why this earning report doesn't matter a ton right now because people aren't basing their investments -- they're not basing the stock price based on reality or by productivity like how many widgets they sell. It's based on emotion right now and that's where it's dangerous. And that's why I was saying like short sellers who keep getting burnt --BARTIROMO: Yes.DUDASH: It's because right now, when this earnings report comes out, it's just a matter of how much they're able to massage the numbers --BARTIROMO: Yes.DUDASH: To get in or not get into the S&P 500. That's the only important part.BARTIROMO: Yes, and --DUDASH: Meanwhile, you have Microsoft reporting earnings tonight.BARTIROMO: All right, we'll wait for those numbers.Yes. Yes, go ahead. Yes.DUDASH: I was just going to say, Microsoft's report, now that one I can't wait to see because, yes, again, the virus stuff, their numbers are going to be a little screwy, but they're forward projections. That's where, as investors, we're going to get a real feel of what a big-time company that has true numbers is projecting for the next quarter. And for a tech sector that's been so hot the last however many months now --BARTIROMO: Yes.DUDASH: That gives us some real indication of what's going to happen in the next few months. Look at the footnotes. That's the best thing tonight.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a good point because Microsoft will really give us a sense --DUDASH: Yes.BARTIROMO: Of what businesses are doing in terms of CapEx, in terms of investing in software --DUDASH: Exactly. Yes.BARTIROMO: Cloud related businesses. So that's going to possibly be a market mover tonight.And then, of course, we've got the hopes of another stimulus package, Frances. Covid-19 vaccine progress also driving the action.What's important here in terms of moving the market? What do you want to hear out of a stimulus package?FRANCES NEWTON STACY, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGY, OPTIMAL CAPITAL: So I would really like to see the payroll tax cut. I know it's not very popular. But the thing is, is that when we come out of coronavirus, the -- the small businesses are going to be the ones that suffer the most. And, you know, there was a statistic that only -- that 55 percent of small business would fail with a three month closure and we're going to have a -- you know, we're rolling back the openings and the pressures on small business and I don't know if everybody, you know, understands the trickle-down effect from the supply side economics, which is basically small businesses build the middle class. And Joe Biden's about supporting the middle class and Trump's about supporting the middle class. But I think the payroll tax cut could be a bipartisan way of doing that.Obviously, deficits, yes, of course we're concerned, but here we are, modern monetary theory. We just have to print our way out of it.And then, as far as the vaccines, I think the vaccines are going to handle the psychological perspective. It's hard to say who's going to be the winner there with the studies going on and, of course, we hope that they're safe given the accelerated schedule. But there's two -- there are two components, the stimulus is the mechanical component of taking risk out of the markets and then, of course, the vaccine is the psychological component. So hoping for the best there, Maria.BARTIROMO: Do any of you believe that markets have started trading on the election or are we -- we're 105 days away from the election, but we know a little about the policies coming out of Joe Biden and he wants to raise taxes and perhaps if Elizabeth Warren has her way put a wealth tax in there.Do markets trade down on that plan?NELSON: I'll -- I'll take that.BARTIROMO: And the president has been very clear, he wants to cut taxes.Go ahead, David.NELSON: What I would say is the election is probably the biggest risk for the market right now, not just because of -- we might lose something like a tax cut and then you'd see S&P earnings fall from say 170 for next year all the way down to say 150. That would be a pretty big hit.But maybe the bigger risk with -- if -- if mail-in ballots are going to be at record levels, on election night we're probably not going to know who the president is. It's probably going to be a pretty close election. It could be days, perhaps weeks before we know who's actually going to be in the White House in 2021.BARTIROMO: That's not good.NELSON: Markets didn't like that in 2000.BARTIROMO: No.NELSON: And markets don't like the uncertainty of something like that. They would react.BARTIROMO: Yes, no, that -- that is not good. I don't think we should be taking weeks to find out who the president is and this ballot -- harvesting of ballots is -- is wrong. Well, we'll certainly wait to see how these markets trade on all of these policies,David Nelson, Steve Dudash, Frances Newton Stacy, you're staying with us, great to see everybody this morning. Thank you.NELSON: Thank you.DUDASH: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We will watch markets, which are down this morning about 60 points.Meanwhile this, violence in Chicago. Fourteen people injured in a shooting overnight. Now the federal government is sending in their own officers. The mayor's response coming up.And then Best Buy boosting pay. That's ahead.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Violence in Chicago continues. A shooting last night outside of a funeral home on Chicago's south side left 14 people injured and several others in serious condition. The Department of Homeland Security is now planning to send dozens of federal agents to the city. Mayor Lori Lightfoot speaking yesterday on how she plans to work with those federal officials and avoid controversy like in Portland.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR LORI LIGHTFOOT (D), CHICAGO: Unlike what happened in Portland, what we will receive is resources that are going to plug into the existing federal agencies that we work with on a regular basis to help manage and suppress violent crime in our city.I've been very clear that we welcome actual partnership, but we do not welcome dictatorship. We do not welcome authoritarianism and we do not welcome unconstitutional arrest and detainment of our residents.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: I mean who said anything about dictatorship and authoritarianism?Dagen McDowell, you had 14 people shot last night, you had 25 people shot on Monday. This is just the last couple of days in Chicago.MCDOWELL: The language the Democrats are using, they're trying to paint President Trump as Adolf Hitler. Let's be clear about that.Mayor Lori Lightfoot tweeted this last night, just, I think, a few hours before that shooting at a funeral home. Under no circumstances will I allow Donald Trump's troops to come to Chicago and terrorize our residents.The terror comes from criminals that this mayor and other people who are left wing and liberal refuse to condemn and prosecute. The terror is coming from criminals. We are living in a world of left wing lunacy where you can't -- where enforcing the laws and fighting crime and protecting the residents are abominations. Some of these individuals are so anti-Trump they literally are pro-crime. That's how insane this world is.BARTIROMO: And even more than that, they're literally bidding for the Chinese Communist Party. I mean Nancy Pelosi called the coronavirus, Cabot, the Trump virus. I mean is she working with the Chinese Communist Party now?PHILLIPS: Well, if that -- for many Democrats, if that means opposing President Trump, they don't have a problem with that. I think many of these issues show just how out of touch the Democrats are ahead of the 2020 election. I think it's going to hurt them. The defund the police movement, for example, for the average American, especially -- take suburban moms, for example, which the Democrat Party is going to have to win over, they are swayed and moved by safety in their communities. And when they look on TV and see these record numbers of crimes starting to increase, the last thing they want to do is defund the police. I think that's a losing movement.To go to the numbers in Chicago, also, the fact that Mayor Lightfoot would have the gal to say that it's the government that's terrorizing people and not her own citizens, more Americans have been shot and killed in Chicago since 2001 than in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. That is a staggering death toll. And for her to try and blame it on anyone but her own failed leadership and the people in her city and the violence that's going on there is absolutely absurd. I think this is a losing message politically, as well as morally.BARTIROMO: Yes, well, we're going to -- we're going to keep watching this, obviously.We want to take a short break, but we've got breaking news on a pact with Pfizer, between Pfizer and the U.S. government for 100 million Covid-19 vaccine doses. We're going to talk with Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the FDA, coming up.But first, diversity in corporate America. We'll take a closer look at how companies should address this pivotal moment in the United States.Plus this, a coronavirus mansion. The Beverly Hills estate built with all the amenities to outlast the Covid-19 pandemic, coming up.You are watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Addressing race and diversity in corporate America.Since the killing of George Floyd, tensions are rising across the country amid calls for justice. My next guest recently wrote an op-ed addressing the need for big business to stand up to racism and act for social change.Joining me right now is Connecticut State Treasurer Shawn Wooden.Treasurer Wooden, it's great to see you. Thanks so much for being here.SHAWN T. WOODEN, STATE TREASURER, CONNECTICUT: Great to see you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Tell me where we are and what inspired you to write this article, where we are on this in America.WOODEN: We -- we are at a crossroads in America once again around race and I was inspired to write the op-ed based on a conversation at the dinner table with my son after Ahmaud Arbery's killing, after Breonna Taylor's killing. And he asked me whether or not it was safe to jog in our neighborhood, and he's a runner. And so that was my personal call to action.And as a treasurer, I have a front row seat to Wall Street and corporate America. I understand the role in influence and privilege that they hold in our society. And I understand that they can do good. And that's why I have called for a coalition of the willing, not the perfect, but CEOs that I'm convening around addressing systemic racism.BARTIROMO: I don't understand why so few leading CEOs and CFOs are black. What is the issue? What is holding this back from having more African- Americans in the corner office?WOODEN: I think there are lots of reasons for it, but it starts from the pipeline in corporate America and a lack of a developed pipeline for diverse talent. It starts in the mentoring and sponsorship in corporations and making people with talent have the opportunities to rise.And it starts from a commitment at the top, quite frankly. And that's why I've been so focused on corporate board diversity, as well as the c-suites.But diversity should be treated as a business imperative. There was an article in "The Wall Street Journal" recently that talked about how kind of diverse and inclusive environments are higher performance workplaces. There's a study, I think it was Boston Consulting Group, that showed that Fortune 500 companies with diverse boards, as compared to those without, outperformed their peers. And so there's a strong economic argument for diversity and that business imperative, I think, with that kind of leadership, will help drive change.BARTIROMO: Yes, I love that point. It's a great point.Dagen McDowell, jump in.MCDOWELL: Maria talks about the representation, or lack thereof, in leadership roles in corporate America among black individuals, black men and women. But I will go to the root of the problem, and I'm curious what you think about this. And I've talked about this repeatedly for a long time. Where your most progressive companies in this nation, particularly in technology, have poor representation in just -- they're in -- among all employees for black Americans. If you look at FaceBook as just one example, among technical jobs at FaceBook, those are held 1.7 percent of those jobs, 1.7 percent are held by black individuals. Even among just the overall all roles, it's still under 4 percent. Where are these liberal progressive companies in providing opportunity to black Americans?WOODEN: I agree with you, although I will note that this is not a liberal, progressive, left, right issue, right? We should approach this work as an American issue and a country still trying to reach our true ideals.And technology industry, horrible, but there are no stand-outs in this regard. I was a partner at a large law firm and less than 1 percent of partners are African-American. This is a problem across sectors. And we do have the talent that exists. I believe a critical piece that's missing, and I've seen it, is the lack of intentionality to actually reflect what America looks like and to identify talent.And I'll give you an example. I think when developing younger talent within organizations, there's a propensity for people to mentor, to take under their wing people that look like them. And when you don't have African- Americans who are in more senior roles, that disadvantages African-American young professionals.BARTIROMO: Yes.WOODEN: And so this is -- this is a problem that we have to be very thoughtful about and we -- we can't treat it as a political issue. But it's an American issue.MCDOWELL: Treasurer, I didn't -- I only -- Treasurer, just to be clear, I only call out the -- the technology world because they do tend to be much more progressive than other parts of corporate America. And they like to talk about their progressive ideals. And I'm just trying to force -- force all of these companies to walk the talk and to do more and that it's unacceptable, the poor representation of black Americans at every corporation.WOODEN: You raise an excellent point and it's a conversation that I've been having as part of this call to action with CEOs about translating all of the words, right, we've had a lot of great kind of PR operations, expressing words around race and diversity and police reform and these things in America, and it's about translating those words into concrete actions to make change that's meaningful.BARTIROMO: Yes. You're right.WOODEN: And those are the dots that I'm working to connect as we speak and -- and it's technology, it's pharma, it's -- you know, you can go on and on.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, for sure.Shawn, thank you for doing what you're doing. We will check back with you. Thanks very much, Treasurer Shawn Wooden joining us this morning in Connecticut.We have breaking news this morning.The Department of Health and Human Services announcing an agreement with Pfizer to produce and distribute 100 million doses of a Covid vaccine. The government will pay $1.95 billion. This agreement also allows the government to acquire an additional 500 million doses. Pfizer has been collaborating with German company BioNTech to develop this -- a vaccine. The stock is up this morning, both of them, Pfizer up about 5 percent on this news. BioNTech is up 7.25 percent. We're going to be speaking with the commissioner of the FDA, Dr. Stephen Hahn, coming up.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, July 22nd. A look at markets right now, 7:33 a.m. on the East Coast.We've got markets mixed here, largely lower. The Dow Industrials down 56 points, the S&P 500 down 5.25, but the Nasdaq is up 21 points as tensions rise with China. Futures are off of the lows of the morning with the Nasdaq looking toward gains this morning once the opening bell sounds. This after the Dow and the S&P 500 extended a winning streak yesterday but the Nasdaq took a breather. Yesterday, the Dow Industrials were up 159 points. That was about two-thirds of 1 percent. The Nasdaq was lower by 86 and the S&P 500 was up 5.5 points at 4:00 on Wall Street.Global markets this morning largely under pressure as the concerns over coronavirus spikes across the country. Those concerns are growing. The FT 100 is down 53, the CAC quarante is down 51, and the DAX index in Germany lower by 48.In Asia overnight markets were mostly lower with the exception of China. The Shanghai composite closed slightly higher. The Hong Kong Hang Seng index was down 2.25 percent.Meanwhile, Snap shares are under pressure this morning following earnings last night.Jackie DeAngelis now with the details.Jackie.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Maria, this is really interesting because Snap's earnings took that hit from the Covid-19 pandemic. The company reported a wider quarterly net loss of nearly 28 percent from last year to $326 million. Now, the owner of Snapchat also disappointing investors after the number of daily active users missed the street's estimate, but revenue did climb 17 percent. Shares of Snap are lower in the premarket by more than 7 percent.And attention Costco shoppers, its popular half sheet cakes are back. The company shocked fans back in May when it suddenly decided to discontinue the sweet treat. Customers filed complaints. They signed change.org petitions. It actually worked. TheCostcoConnoisseur, that's an Instagram account devoted to all things Costco, posted this image yesterday from an undisclosed location of the company's beloved half sheet cakes with the caption, Costco sheet cakes are back by special order only. We reached out to Costco for comment but haven't heard back.All right, and here's what's trending this morning on foxbusiness.com.Best Buy is increasing its starting hourly wage to $15 an hour and giving employees a 4 percent raise as coronavirus drives its sales. The company says its second quarter sales are up about 2.5 percent. And those online sales have jumped 255 percent.Men's Warehouse owner Taylor Brands, well, it says that it's laying off 20 percent of its workforce and closing up to 500 stores as a result of financial losses that it's seeing from the pandemic.And Verizon and Walmart partner up on a new venture that allows Yahoo! Mail users to purchase their groceries straight from their e-mail inbox, Maria.BARTIROMO: It's getting easier and easier.DEANGELIS: Yes.BARTIROMO: Jackie, thank you so much.Jackie DeAngelis.Meanwhile, Philip Morris, the company behind Marlboro and Parliament cigarettes, seeing a stock boost after the second quarter earnings beat expectations. The company also reinstating its full year guidance as sales of its heated tobacco products continue to post strong numbers through the Covid-19 pandemic.Joining me right now is the CEO of Philip Morris International, Andre Calantzopoulos.Andre, it's great to have you back. Thank you so much for joining us.ANDRE CALANTZOPOULOS, CEO, PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL: Thank you for having me. And good morning.BARTIROMO: Characterize the quarter for us, not just in the United States, but what you saw across the world, Andre.CALANTZOPOULOS: Well, I think that was a rather unprecedented quarter, I would say, because, you know, due to the pandemic, obviously we have no reference points for us to navigate and compare. So we saw, due to the confinement, clearly change in the habits of consumers. So it is true that our sales of combustible cigarettes were a hit during the quarter. But the good news is we came out of the quarter better than we expected and most importantly heated tobacco product, as you mentioned at the introduction, continued to grow despite the fact that we had to take our field forces off the ground during the restriction period, especially in Europe, but also many other countries, and we had all our retail stores, essential -- all our physical assets.So we moved to more digital interaction with consumers, including remote coaching when they acquire the product and essentially the whole performance of our heated tobacco product, called (INAUDIBLE), exceeded our expectations, continued to grow and actually we added almost 900,000 new consumers during a very, very difficult quarter. That's, I think, the first highlight.BARTIROMO: Are people -- yes.CALANTZOPOULOS: Yes, please.BARTIROMO: No, no, go ahead. This was the first highlight. What are the other highlights?CALANTZOPOULOS: So, obviously, now we see in Europe restrictions easing, although we're far from being back to normalcy, as you know. We had, obviously, in certain developing countries, especially southeast Asia, also an impact on consumers. Due to the confinement, we had a lot of people that are daily income workers that didn't have access, obviously, to daily salary. So we saw also a decrease in consumption. But there also the situation is easing up now.So I think, moving forward, assuming that we will not have a repetition of national confinement or restriction, and I hope and will hope this will not happen --BARTIROMO: Yes.CALANTZOPOULOS: We assume we will have some local restrictions if they are, you know, epicenters of the pandemic again. So we now have to evaluate what is the real economic aftermath of the crisis and I must admit, and other companies are in the same situation, it's very difficult to exactly quantify. But somehow we have more reference points now, if we go to the 2008 crisis, where we had economic depression. I think we know much better how to navigate this environment, although it will have an impact both on consumption and some down-trading, obviously until the economy recovers.So the second important aspect I think that happened --BARTIROMO: So you are expecting some -- some -- yes, so you are expecting - -CALANTZOPOULOS: Yes --BARTIROMO: Some down trading maybe second half of the year.I wanted to ask you about digital and online in terms of delivery. Do you see increasingly customers buying the tobacco products digitally? Do you think this is going to sustain once we're out of this pandemic?CALANTZOPOULOS: Well, tobacco products, cigarettes are rarely sold online. There are very, very few markets that authorize the sales because it's an excisable product to avoid, you know, crossing borders and so on. So when I refer to digital, it was not about sales of consumable products. It's much more our heated tobacco product, (INAUDIBLE), where people who couldn't physically go to retail stores and acquire devices that are necessary for this product, or have a guided trial on learning how to use the product and also about the -- what is the benefits of the product, but also the fact that this is not a risk-free product and it is containing nicotine, so it's addicting.So we moved a lot of these interactions to digital. They're also is the product is electronic. There are questions consumers have. Also after-sale service. And that we moved fully to digital almost. And consumers reacted very positively to that. So I think, overall, after Covid, both in terms of purchasing habits of consumers, we'll seen more e-commerce purchases. And as far as long as the pandemic is around and it will be around for a while, unfortunately, we will see this.BARTIROMO: Yes.CALANTZOPOULOS: And also the other aspect of that is, as is companies, we learn to work remotely and Philip Morris International, we're trying to integrate now the learnings of the remote working into the day-to-day work as we all come back to the offices. So I think going forward we have much more of a mixed world.BARTIROMO: Yes. Andre, let me -- let me ask you -- I wanted to ask you about the heated -- the heated tobacco products in Europe and emerging market. There is some conversation about a slowdown happening in Japan. But before we go there, Andre, what can you tell us about the safety of vaping? Because there is some concern on the part of parents about the safety of vaping. What can you tell us?CALANTZOPOULOS: Well, you know, there has been a lot of controversy around vaping in the U.S. So what I would say is -- I mean the issue started clearly with what we call a valley. So essentially, you know, people inhaling an aerosol that created lung problems and we also had, unfortunately, and regretfully, deaths.So -- but this product after investigation by both the FDA and the Center for Disease Control proved to be much more related to people putting an oil, the cannabinoid (ph) oil --BARTIROMO: Yes.CALANTZOPOULOS: And our lungs are not made to dissolve fats. So that's why it happened.BARTIROMO: I see.CALANTZOPOULOS: If we have properly manufactured, especially closed system products, then if they are properly manufactured, I think, although the product create nicotine and they are addictive --BARTIROMO: Yes.CALANTZOPOULOS: In terms of relative safety to cigarettes --BARTIROMO: Yes.CALANTZOPOULOS: Clearly they are better products than cigarettes. And in terms of safety of the product themselves, they shouldn't create a problem.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, this is an issue, I know, that is important because parents are seeing their kids use vaping products.Andre, it's great to see you. Thank you so much.Andre Calantzopoulos joining us there, the CEO of Philip Morris International.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Charged for defending property. Missouri Governor Mike Parsons says he would pardon the St. Louis couple who brandished guns on their front lawn when protesters swarmed their property. Mark McCloskey joined Sean Hannity last night.Listen to what was said about the charges from the St. Louis circuit attorney.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK MCCLOSKEY, LAWYER: The circuit attorneys for the city of St. Louis is an elected official. She works on our tax dollars. And she has taken it upon herself not to protect law abiding citizens against criminals, but to protect criminals against law abiding citizens.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano.Judge, good morning. Great to see you.Your reaction?JUDGE NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Well, the charge of brandishing a gun is -- if you read the full charge, it's brandishing a gun for an unlawful purpose. The McCloskey's surely brandished their guns, but it was for a perfectly lawful purpose. Missouri has a castle doctrine which basically says you can use a weapon to keep intruders off your property and out of your house. And when Justice Scalia wrote the Heller decision, that's the modern definition of the right to keep and bear arms, he said it is a personal right and it applies in the home and in the land around the home. So there's really no legal basis for this charge. But it's a very serious charge.I think the prosecutor herself, Maria, has some doubts about the charge and I'll tell you why, because at the same time she announced it, she said she would not oppose letting the McCloskeys go into a pre-trial diversion program, basically six months of probation, it's not a guilty plea. At the end of the six months, the charge is dismissed.Let me tell you, from my experience, prosecutors never, ever, ever, ever, you can add as many evers as you want, make this proposal at the same time that they announce the charges unless they have doubts about whether or not they can prove the case.BARTIROMO: OK.NAPOLITANO: This is another example of states -- and Missouri's pretty good on gun rights, but it's another example of state officials wearing away, attacking the federally protected right to keep and bear arms.BARTIROMO: I see.Let me switch gears, Judge. I've got to ask you about Jeffrey Epstein's situation. A lawyer for Epstein's alleged associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, now asking for a gag order. They want a gag order on her case in order to protect her chances of a fair trial. President Trump was asked about her and the case during yesterday's Covid briefing. Here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I just wish her well, frankly. I've met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach and I guess they lived in Palm Beach. But I wish her well.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: He said he didn't know anything about it but that he wishes her well, Judge.Where are we on this case? What do you think?NAPOLITANO: Well, she's innocent until proven guilty. Obviously, the publicity, because of the connect to Epstein, is horrific for her.In terms of the motion to silence people, the feds should be silenced. Look at how the FBI has leaked information about the president. The feds are the best leakers in the world. But she can't get a judge to silence the lawyers of her victims. They have a First Amendment right and they're not in the case.BARTIROMO: Right.NAPOLITANO: But when the feds try to poison the jury pool, whether it's FBI agents, federal prosecutors or some people in between them in the federal government, they do affirmative harm to the Constitution. She's entitled to a fair trial. She's entitled to have a jury, a fair jury, not a polluted jury, decide whether she committed these crimes.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there, Judge, and we'll keep watching that. Judge Andrew Napolitano, great to see you, sir, thank you.We will be right back.We've got Congressman Devin Nunes top of the hour. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Luxury realtors not letting the pandemic get them down, getting creative to put house hunters into that dream home.Gerri Willis with the report.Gerri.GERRI WILLIS, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria.That's right, realtors have found a new market, people afraid of Covid-19.Listen.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WILLIS (voice over): Looks like just another Beverly Hills mansion on the market with all the bells and whistles. Pool, check. Oh, and a fountain. A grand entryway, yes, this house has it too. Want to play cards? Well, you can do that as well.ROCHELLE ATLAS MAIZE, NOURMAND AND ASSOCIATES: We just came on the market and we are priced just under $19 million. People come through the property. They -- they don't want to leave the downstairs.WILLIS: But, wait, there's a difference. This is a Covid-friendly home. There's a Covid cleaning room in the garage, complete with automatic bootie dispenser for when friends visit. You can grab a mask, bottle of water and a robe (INAUDIBLE). For the family, the movie theater has been transformed into a Zoom room, complete with space for kids to do homework and mom and dad to do business meetings, oh, with a little popcorn, of course.Atlas Maize says the design of the home of the future, not just mansions, will look more like this house, with the exception of one thing, a special delivery from the famed Beverly Hills Hotel, which, by the way, is right around the corner. Free dinner for three months.MAIZE: So you can have the famous McCarty salad and a chocolate souffle five nights a week.(END VIDEOTAPE)WILLIS: Maria, better yet, you never even have to leave the mansion.BARTIROMO: Pretty cool stuff, Gerri. A souffle every day. Wow, OK.Gerri Willis, thank you so much. That sounds great.WILLIS: You're welcome.BARTIROMO: We will take a break. When we come back, celebrating Instagram's biggest stars. One influencer's visual illusions are leaving the social media world breathless. Wait until you meet him. He is here next hour.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live on Fox Business.Load-Date: July 22, 2020End of Document

Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, July 10th.Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Coronavirus spikes putting reopening plans on pause in several hot spot states. Texas, California, Florida, all reporting their highest number of daily coronavirus deaths yesterday. U.S.-China tensions continue to rise. Beijing now says it will retaliate after the White House imposed sanctions on the Chinese officials involved in Uyghur human rights abuses.The 2020 race.

President Trump says Biden has been taken over by the radical left. Biden also takes a chapter out of the president's playbook, introducing a buy American plan.Markets this morning are pointing to a lower opening. Take a look at futures indicating a decline at the start of trading, down 80 points on the Dow Industrials. The Nasdaq is down 16 and the S&P 500 lower by eight points right now.This after the Nasdaq closed at another record high yesterday.

The FT 100 up 35, the CAC quarante up 23, and the DAX index up 63.Two of U.K.'s -- of the U.K.'s largest retailers, Boots and John Lewis, are cutting jobs. More than 5,000 jobs.In Asia overnight it was red across the board. In fact, the Chinese Shanghai composite snapped its winning streak after rising nearly 17 percent over eight days. That's because the Chinese Communist Party said to stop buying. Chinese funds started to sell to cool down the rally after state media reported that there were concerns about the strong run. It was up 17 percent in eight days. In Hong Kong, schools have been closed due to a spike in coronavirus cases and the Hong Kong Hang Seng index was down almost 2 percent, as was the Shanghai composite.Now some of the top stories that we are watching this morning.In a new Fox News interview, President Trump laid out his vision for the U.S. economy if elected for a second term.The president promising to find a vaccine as well for Covid-19 by year-end.Joe Biden takes on President Trump and the economy. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee was in Pennsylvania, pushing a $700 billion plan to force the federal government to buy more American made products and services.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And the federal government spends taxpayers' money. We should use it to buy American products and support American jobs.During my first term alone, we'll invest $400 billion in purchasing products and materials our country needs to modernize our infrastructure.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Biden's push to produce critical medical equipment and drugs in the United States, instead of being forced to import them from China and other countries, is obviously exactly what the president has been talking about in his America first agenda. Moving the supply chains has been the president's key policy.Florida quickly becoming the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, reporting 120 deaths. In California, 149 deaths were reported yesterday, the single highest number since the start of the pandemic. And in Texas, the number hitting the triple digits for the first time with 105 deaths in Texas. Arizona also seeing a staggering situation, prompting Governor Doug Ducey to limit all indoor dining to less than 50 percent of capacity.United Airlines and its pilots union reaching tentative agreements on early retirements and voluntary furloughs. The deals coming after United said earlier this week that 36,000 people, nearly half of its workforce, could be furloughed by October 1st. Airlines that received government loans cannot lay off or furlough workers until September 30th. United Airlines shares this morning in the pre-market are trading down about 3.5 percent right now.Time for the "Word on Wall Street." The latest on what's driving the markets and the economy this morning.Joining me right now is Optimal Capital Director of Strategy and Market Analyst Frances Newton Stacy, the CEO and managing partner of the Bahnsen Group, David Bahnsen is here, along with Fairlead Strategies Founder and Managing Partner Katie Stockton.Great to see everybody this morning. Thank you for being here.First up, ending, quote, shareholder capitalism. That is what presumptive Democratic Presidential Nominee Joe Biden said and he's vowing to do it if elected. He says President Trump focuses too heavily on the stock market and he said this yesterday in a speech in Pennsylvania. He discussed raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent.Frances, what could a Biden win mean for the economic recovery after this pandemic?FRANCES NEWTON STACY, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGY AND MARKET ANALYST, OPTIMAL CAPITAL: Well, this comment on shareholder capitalism is absolutely insane. What he's saying is that they pay a lower tax rate than everyone else. But everybody should remember that that money has already been taxed in most scenarios unless you have a retirement account. That's money -- that's double taxation on the earnings on those -- on that money. So that's kind of a little bit ridiculous.And does he not understand that people invest in companies, companies have money then to grow and to hire. So quelling investment in companies is going to have our unemployment picture looking very dire for a much longer period of time.BARTIROMO: Yes, and, you know, when he says the idea of shareholder capitalism, I guesses he's meaning -- I mean I don't know what he means by that. I mean do you have any idea what he means by ending shareholder capitalism?STACY: I feel like he's referring to the tax rates. I feel like he's -- this is a part of his redistribution of wealth plan. And I guesses he's saying that this is the reason for the wealth gap. And it really -- you know, he's not understanding that this is part and parcel to the employment picture. And I think that that's sort of misleading.BARTIROMO: It's also a free market. I mean what are you going to do, curb free markets?And then there's this, curbing China gains. Two government owned funds in China sold stocks to stem a potential bull market. The Shanghai composite snapped its winning streak after seeing a boost of more than 16.5 percent in the past eight days.David, let's talk here because when the Communist Party says something, the country follows suit. And a week ago the CCP said, we want a bull market as part of our economic recovery and, like that, millions of Chinese retail investors started opening accounts. Now the CCP says it's gone too far, so they completely reversed course.Your take on what's going on in Shanghai?DAVID BAHNSEN, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, THE BAHNSEN GROUP: Yes, there's a historical precedence for this in 2015 where they tried to intervene and boost up equity markets and then had to come peel it back. And -- and, unfortunately, this is a lesson that governments seem to never really learn. Communist governments, I guess, are more guilty of it. These interventions come at a cost.And so we know that intervening into equities is very distorted when governments are buying as a non-economic actor and then promoting others to do the same. Someone ends up holding the bag because it distorts value.BARTIROMO: Yes.By the way, David, you wrote a whole book on Elizabeth Warren and her economic policy. What are your thoughts on what you heard from Joe Biden yesterday?BAHNSEN: Yes, I wanted to jump in --BARTIROMO: A lot of people say Elizabeth Warren is going to be the key voice on the economy.Yes, no, I know you know a lot about this. You wrote a whole book on it.BAHNSEN: Yes.BARTIROMO: But a lot of people now believe that if Biden were to win, Elizabeth Warren is going to be the key economic voice.BAHNSEN: I think the bullish case would be that he's going to pretend Warren and Sanders will be the economic voice throughout the campaign and then after elected he would switch back to a bit more classical or traditional Democratic set of influences. But the reality is, we don't know.This shareholder capitalism attack is actually a byproduct of this whole social justice movement. Larry Fink (ph) is talking about it. You remember, Maria, the business roundtable last year saying corporations should no longer exist for benefit of shareholders.BARTIROMO: Yes.BAHNSEN: That's what he's getting at. It's dangerous. It's economically ignorant. And, God, do I miss Milton Friedman.BARTIROMO: Well, I'll tell you one thing, I mean this -- the absolute hypocrisy of some of these global money managers who are telling me, I want to have this ESG BS and not invest in sin stocks, I don't want to invest in oil companies, I'm not going to invest in tobacco companies because they're sins, and yet they're perfectly fine managing the money of the CCP. It's so hypocritical it's unbelievable.You've got massive human rights abuses by the CCP and yet they're perfectly fine investing money in China and -- and -- and for the Chinese Communist Party and yet they're telling us not to invest in oil of companies. Really?OK, let me look at the broader markets here because we are on the doorstep of the second quarter earnings season next week. Futures are slumping today amid the coronavirus worries.One stock that is still seeing major gains, Tesla.Katie, walk us through this. The stock soaring 25 percent in just the last week on Tesla, Katie. You're looking at the charts. What do they tell you?KATIE STOCKTON, FOUNDER AND MANAGING PARTNER, FAIRLEAD STRATEGIES: Well, it's hard to chase stocks here, of course. It's just to justify the gains that we've seen, except that there's momentum and it's really a sentiment- driven market right now. We've seen that in the broader market. The S&P futures obviously trading off a little bit this morning.The markets don't like uncertainty. They're a little bit skittish. But you're not seeing it in those sort of large cap technology leaders and these so-called robin hood stocks. Those stocks are still working. They're still exhibiting leadership. And it's helping to boost the tape. And I don't think that they'll be going down significantly anytime soon based on the momentum there.BARTIROMO: So, Katie, would you buy the Nasdaq here? What are we talking about, 26 all-time highs this year. It continues. The momentum is incredible. Partly, Tesla, partly biotech, big tech, driving the Nasdaq to record territory.STOCKTON: The Nasdaq 100 index, or the QQQ ETF has exposure to those market leaders. The FANG plus M or plus Microsoft stocks. I think that you stay with the existing leadership in this tape.I want to add exposure to the market because I do think that the S&P 500 will return to those February highs before the next significant pullback. And, of course, that's 8 percent to 9 percent higher than current levels. The reason for that is that we've seen short-term momentum improve since June when the market was consolidating. That consolidation phase was quite healthy. And it shows this kind of healthy level of skepticism in the marketplace. That is actually from a contrarian perspective at (ph) positive.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. Thank you so much, Frances Newton Stacy, David Bahnsen, Katie Stockton, great to see you all. We so appreciate your time this morning on the "Word on Wall Street."Much more ahead this morning. Coming up this hour, Georgia Congressman Doug Collins is here to talk about 2020 and the Durham investigation. When will we get that?And then the 8:00 a.m. hour. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy with the latest on China, TikTok, the Supreme Court rulings and the 2020 race.Plus, Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan joining me to talk all things economy and the possibility of more stimulus. All that coming up.Plus, tick season has arrived. Experts are predicting it will be one of the worst tick seasons. We're going to tell you how to protect yourself coming up.All that ahead.But first, one Colorado town is threatening jail time if you do not wear a mask in public. We will take a look at that.Then, North Carolina Congressional Candidate Madison Cowthorn will join the panel next. We will talk about his campaign, the big issues in the 2020 race for the White House.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Getting students back in class. President Trump urging states to reopen schools this fall, even with coronavirus spikes across the country.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have to get our schools open and stop this political nonsense. And it's only political nonsense. It's politics. They don't want to open because they think it will help them on November 3rd. I think it's going to hurt them on November 3rd.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Some governors are against the president's plan. Washington Governor Jay Inslee saying that his state will decide when schools open, not the federal government. And in Michigan, Governor Gretchen Whitmer took to Twitter, writing this, I want to make this clear, I will not send our kids and their education workforce into our schools unless it is safe to do so, plain and simple. I have made decisions based on science and facts to keep Michiganders safe since the beginning and won't stop now.Joining us right now this morning is Emily Jashinsky, Matt Schlapp, and joining the conversation is North Carolina Republican Congressional Candidate Madison Cawthorn.Great to see everybody this morning. Thanks so much for being here.Madison, let me kick this off with you.Your take on this back and forth about opening schools. Obviously the governor of Michigan's making a statement to reach the president.MADISON CAWTHORN, NORTH CAROLINA REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE DISTRICT 11: Well, you know, I think it's ridiculous to keep schools closed. I believe the death rate, the mortality rate, for people under 25 years old with Covid-19 is 0.0008 percent. And so I think it's very, very safe for us to be able to get back into school.You know, I echo what the president said, this is all politically motivated. And, you know what, I think it's -- it's very arrogant for a few people in government to try and determine what we should do as a public -- for public health for our nation and for our economy. So I believe we need to get our schools back open.BARTIROMO: Matt, what do you think? You've got five kids.MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: Yes, I've got five kids. You know, we teach them math and science. Actually, Merce (ph) and I literally teach them math and science now.And here's what the scientists are saying. The CDC says to Governor Whitmer, there is no evidence that there is any risk to health by opening up these schools. Here's what Denmark and the Scandinavian countries have done, they've opened up their schools even though they were a little nervous in the beginning and they've seen no outbreak of the virus.Why? Because all the science shows us exactly what Madison just said, that kids are the least risky pool. And if they close down the schools, Maria, the next step is they're going to close down this economy again. If they shut down this economy one more time, not for health reasons, but for political reasons, it's only blue states and socialist governors trying to say they want to do this, it's all about stopping Trump. The president's exactly right, he should encourage and incentivize every school to open safely in the fall.BARTIROMO: Is it -- is it only blue states that are pushing back on the president asking to open schools?SCHLAPP: Yes. Yes. Look -- look at all the -- Jay Inslee literally ran for president from the state of Washington.BARTIROMO: Right.SCHLAPP: Gretchen Whitmer has been trying so hard to audition to be the vice president for Joe Biden. I mean, this is so riddled with politics. I think there's going to be a moms revolt if these governors continue to play politics with kids. It's supposed to be about the kids, Maria, remember that?BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.Emily, what's your take?EMILY JASHINSKY, COMMENTARY WRITER, "THE FEDERALIST": Well, I think those quotes you just read off from Governors Whitmer and Inslee are absolutely hilarious, Maria, because the Democratic Party has suddenly discovered the virtues of federalism and I wish that they would perhaps use this experience to teach them that maybe they need to apply the principles of federalism to their education programs in general and we need to defederalize a lot of it. So I -- you know, I find that very amusing, but it's hard to grasp, actually, the impact that keeping kids home from school is having on their socialization. And so I think it's very important to come up with a way to get this done.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's true.All right, coming up, tick season is here. Experts are predicting that this tick season will be the worst on record, if not one of the worst. What you need to know coming up.And then TikTok planning to distance itself from China. How do you do that when you're a Chinese company. It's making a buzz this morning.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Lyme disease alert. Experts are warning of a major increase in ticks carrying Lyme disease due to the mild weather. Lyme disease and coronavirus share several of the same symptoms. It's fever, headache, fatigue and chills.Joining me right now is family physician, Dr. Jennifer Caudle.And, Dr. Caudle, it's great to see you again this morning.Lyme disease not a new problem. Why is it so bad this year? Assess the situation for us.DR. JENNIFER CAUDLE, FAMILY PHYSICIAN: Well, really one of the things that we're concerned about is that people have been cooped up all spring, really. A lot of us are just anxious to sort of get outdoors. And as people get outdoors, getting to trails and hiking and things of that nature, the concern is that while we might be wearing masks to prevent coronavirus, we may forget about the things we need to do to prevent Lyme disease. And that's, of course, wearing a -- you know, using appropriate tick repellant and other preventative measures that we talk about. But that's really what one of the concerns is, is that we just may not be thinking about it.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, talk about Lyme disease symptoms that mirror Covid- 19 symptoms.CAUDLE: Yes. So -- and that's also another concern. So you mentioned some of them appropriately. We've got fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, fatigue or feeling tired. Those are symptoms that are very common with Lyme disease certainly in the beginning stages. They're also many common symptoms of coronavirus, right?You know, of course, Lyme disease often has a characteristic rash that we do not see in Lyme disease. But the other symptoms, which we call are -- they're non-specific. That means they could be, you know, one of many different diseases, they do overlap. And so that is also a concern, why we have to prevent tick bites and Lyme disease because what we don't want is a situation where we're wondering if we have Covid-19 or if we've got actually Lyme disease or something else.BARTIROMO: So how do we present it? How do we avoid getting Lyme disease? Is there a shot or a medicine that we need to know about to prevent or fight this?CAUDLE: Yes. So, first of all, it's important to know that Lyme disease is -- it's a disease caused by a bacteria that's carried by a black leg tick. It's a certain type of tick. Lyme disease is most common in the northeast, it's in the upper Midwest and some on the -- on the west coast, the northwest coast, rather. And it can happen in other areas, but it's less common. So it's first important to know if Lyme disease tends to be common in your area.The other places that we -- you know, in terms of locations that people go to are wooded areas, trails, brush areas, weeds and things like that, hiking and that type of thing. So prevention really has to do with avoiding tick infested areas, of course. But you also want to wear an EPA or Environmental Protection Agency approved tick repellant that has something like DEET or another appropriate ingredient in it. You can treat your clothing with something called Permethrin which will actually help to repel ticks. Wear long sleeved clothes. Light colored clothes will help you identify ticks on your body, help you see them better.It's also important, though, you know, if you're on trails, walk in the center of the trail. Don't walk into the brush or into the sort of wooded areas. And then when you get home, check your body. Check your body from head to toe and make sure you shower soon after you get home.BARTIROMO: Real quick, Dr. Caudle, what if we get bitten and we know that we have a tick bite? What do we do?CAUDLE: Yes. So what I would actually do is -- there is a proper way -- there's a right and a wrong way to remove a tick. The cdc.gov has really great instructions on properly how to remove a tick. But I would then call your doctor because depending on how long that tick has been in you or what have you may determine what happens.And, by the way, there is treatment for Lyme disease, I should be very clear. It's a course of antibiotics for a few weeks. So understand, there is appropriate treatment. People can get treated for this. But call your doctor after removing a tick to find out if there's additional steps you need to do.BARTIROMO: OK. Got it.All right, Jennifer Caudle, always great to see you. Thank you so much. Have a great weekend.CAUDLE: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We will see you soon. Thanks for the tips.CAUDLE: You as well.BARTIROMO: Coming up, Georgia Congressman Doug Collins is here to talk about 2020 and the Durham investigation.We'll be right back after this.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX NEWS HOST: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Friday July 10th.Here's a look at market 7:31 am on the East Coast. Futures are indicating lower opening for the broader averages this morning. The Dow Futures down near the lows of the morning. Now down about 100 points. The NASDAQ Futures lower by 15 and the S&P Futures down 9.25.This, despite the fact that we had another record high yesterday. The NASDAQ closing at an all-time high. Once again yesterday, the Dow and the S&P 500 were lower. But check out the NASDAQ with a gain of 55 points at 4:00 o'clock on Wall Street yesterday in uncharted territory of 10,547 on the NASDAQ.Meanwhile this, the Northeast is bracing for heavy wind and rain from Tropical Storm Fay. Cheryl with the details now. Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: Here we go Maria. Is the earliest sixth named storm on record and is expected to make landfall near New York City tonight. The storm is currently just offshore the Delmarva Peninsula. There is the live map on your screen.Parts of Long Island and Connecticut could be hit with wind gusts of up to 60 miles an hour and three to five inches of rain. Tropical storm warnings are up from Cape May, New Jersey all the way up to Watch Hill, Rhode Island right now.Well, at least two companies apparently are battling to become the new owner of Brooks Brothers. According to "The Wall Street Journal" Sparc Group which is backed by Authentic Brands and Simon Property Group and WHP Global may be looking to take control of the bankrupt company.Sources say that both bidders plan to keep most Brooks Brothers stores open. Company filed for bankruptcy this week after COVID-19 lockdowns forced retailers to close stores.And here's a look at what is trending this morning on FoxBusiness.com. Disney World reopens tomorrow without some fan favorites, cutting the parades, the fireworks and meet and greets with Disney characters.Starbucks will start requiring customers to wear face masks or face coverings at all of its stores throughout the United States. That starts next Wednesday. And Uber's "Name Your Price" feature, which allows drivers to set their own fares is expanding to more California cities. And those are your headlines. Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you. We are on countdown mode to the 2020 election. President Trump speaking to Fox News' Sean Hannity last night about rival Joe Biden and his lurch to the Left on issues from the economy to crime. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE United States (via telephone): Let's face it, he's been taken over by the radical Left. He has no clue what they're doing and what they getting him into. This is worse than Bernie Sanders that is at his best.I think they brainwashed him - they brainwashed him. He doesn't know where he is. He doesn't know what he's doing. And our country will suffer. Our stock markets will crash. Bad things will happen. They will defund the police. They will abolish the police.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Georgia Congressman and House Judiciary Committee Member Doug Collins. Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much for being here.REP. DOUG COLLINS (R-GA): Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: I got to get your reaction to Biden yesterday. He's come out with this $700 billion plan, talking about "Buy America," which is what, of course, President Trump's plan is. But also, saying he wants to do away with shareholder capitalism. What's your take?COLLINS: I mean, look, it's amazing when he wakes up and what he says. I mean, it's just - they're moving - the Democratic Party right now is basically anchorless. They do not have principles. Except now they're just trying to please everybody who say they would like to vote for them.And what they're doing is, they're going further and further to the Left with the most shrill voices, talking about economies, and moving from our capitalist system, moving away from the small business, moving away from the things that made our country great. Toward a socialist economy, toward one - frankly, it is just sort of a free rein, do whatever you want to do. And what that takes us away from is our rule of law.Joe Biden needs to - if he wants to continue this thing, go for it, because I think it puts a really strong peg on what is really going to happen with President Trump getting four more years, President Trump came in and took over from a weak administration. He made it stronger.What's going to happen in four more years? It's going to be stronger, a stronger economy, a stronger military, a stronger world presence, a stronger judicial system from judges and appointments. That's what this President will offer for four more years. Joe Biden is just fishing, trying to figure out what people actually want to hear.BARTIROMO: In the meantime, we've got the defunding of police going on across the country. What's your take on this? There you are in the middle of Georgia, in Atlanta, you're seeing it up close and personal where police officers are calling in sick, they're not coming to work. They don't have the support of the mayor or the governor.COLLINS: Yes, it's amazing for us right now. The mayor and the Fulton County District Attorney have basically hamstrung the police down here to where they don't know what to do and how to do their jobs and they're in this movement that takes it away from them.They do their job properly. In anytime anyone tells you, Maria that they're wanting to defund the police, it is basically just disrespecting the place. It's disrespecting what all of them do every day to keep a sight. And if they're willing to keep moving on this, what we're seeing is, is you're going to have more and more people not want to get in.Can you imagine? Police forces that are currently struggling in the current size they are and you're cutting police officers away, you're cutting resources away. Why are the ones who are left want to stay? Then you're going to see what actually the defund police movement actually is.It is disrespecting not only law enforcement, but it's actually taking communities and saying we don't care about you, because you're taking away the very civil structure that has made communities safe to be around.BARTIROMO: Really a scary moment in time with all of this. Congressman, let me switch gears and ask you about the timeline of the investigation into the origins of the Russia probe and corruption at the top of the FBI.Sources telling Fox News that U.S. Attorney John Durham is looking to wrap up the investigation by the end of the summer. The AG - of course, AG Bill Barr told me in an interview, exclusive, two weeks ago that we are likely going to have real developments by the end of the summer. Several lines of the probe, though are not complete. Where are we in this?COLLINS: Well, it's something that needs to finish up. It does need to finish up, I think, by this summer. I mean, look, we're talking about an investigation that spans all the way back to the previous election. And the work of some in the Department of Justice Comey, Strzok, McCabe, Page, even Brennan, Clapper, even into the White House and the Oval Office.And so they were actually interfering with our previous election. We need to get this out now. My concern is, through the COVID virus, through other things that have slowed up having investigations and having interviews and even grand juries, that there has been some slowing.But this needs to speed up. We need to have this before the election, because after the election, again, is the tendency to put things aside. But Attorney General has said we will investigate this and report.Durham needs to bring that report out. We need to hold those accountable, because we don't hold them accountable, Maria, then what's going to stop somebody else from saying, well, I'll do this again and nobody's going to care. This has to be done, because it should never happen to a President, it should never happen to a candidate ever again.BARTIROMO: It's just extraordinary, some of the things that they did against this President. Let me ask you about this tax return decision. The Supreme Court ruling seven to two that New York state prosecutors can access President Trump's tax returns. But at the same time, the court declined to give Congress access those tax returns, having been subpoenaed by Democratic led House committees, including yours. The President responding during his interview with Hannity last night. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP (via telephone): I'm under tax audit, I have been for a long period of time. We made a deal a long time ago. And once I ran for politics, that deal was like a - we didn't make it. So I'm under a continuing audit. I was disappointed, and at the same time, it was - because I think we - a president should get protection from thousands of prosecutors out there. Thousands all over the country. They could go after you, and you're supposed to be running the country.(END VIDEO CLIP)COLLINS: Yes.BARTIROMO: Congressman, where is this going?COLLINS: Well, unfortunately, the Supreme Court gave a prosecutor just freedom to go on a fishing expedition, which is just wrong, especially a partisan one that we're looking at right now. Many of the things that they were originally investigating have either been settled or are have finished and now we're reupping this.But let me just go back to something, because I fought hard against Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff and the rest on this issue of the Congress and getting these this information. The Supreme Court upheld exactly what they should upheld.The Democrats want everybody to believe they were doing everything proper, that they were doing everything they should, and they were nothing but a partisan witch hunt, a hack job that Pelosi and Schiff and Nadler were on.And I'm glad to say that the rule of law will actually stood up. And then we do have congressional oversight. We should be doing what we should be doing - making sure the administration is - on any administration from anytime, Congress should do its job. But when you go overreach, and you have overreach like this, I'm glad to say that it got slapped down just like it should have done.BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, this is a question that I've been asking you and a lot of your colleagues now for weeks. How much time are you guys spending investigating President Trump versus investigating national security and things like China, who's been eating our lunch now for decades, and yet your colleagues have been looking under the bed for ghosts in the Russia collusion narrative, which never materialized and you missed China the whole time? I mean, really? Jerry Nadler it continues to investigate Trump and ignores all this other stuff.COLLINS: Tell me how Speaker Pelosi, Jerry Nadler, Adam Schiff can look at the American people in the face and say we've been on the job working for you. They haven't, that's a joke. For the Speaker or any of them to say that we're trying to work for the American people, when they've given the record of the 116th Congress, it's more than a do nothing Congress.It is a do something Congress. It's an investigate the President. It's a political hack job from a Congress that said we wanted to help people, and instead, all they have been doing, as you said, looking behind the doors, looking under the bed, trying to find something against this President because they don't seem to care about actually changing people's lives. They only care about the November election and trying to defeat Donald Trump.BARTIROMO: Yes. Wow, look at their constituents. Look at San Francisco, that's a mess. Look at California. I mean, it's just amazing. Congressman, good to see you. Thank you so much.COLLINS: Oh, it's good to see you.BARTIROMO: Congressman Doug Collins for joining us there on all of the above.Coming up, the 2020 economic outlook. We'll see you soon, Congressman. Thank you. Former Vice President Joe Biden saying that he wants to bring an end to the era of shareholder capitalism. We're taking a look at what that means, coming up.And then one Colorado town threatening jail time if you don't wear masks in public. We're taking a look at that. You're watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Coronavirus concerns, the shutdown, impact on the economy weighing on investors this morning. Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading. The Dow Futures are down 87. The NASDAQ down 21. And the S&P down 8.75.But don't forget yesterday the NASDAQ hit another all-time high despite the Dow and the S&P 500 finishing the day lower. The NASDAQ went in uncharted territory second straight record close. 26 record closes, I think, this year. The NASDAQ up 55 points to 10,547.Joining me right now is the Chief U.S. Equity Strategist at Citi, Tobias Levkovich. Tobias it's great to see you again. Thanks so much for being here. Your reaction to what's going on in markets. NASDAQ keep going at record highs, market also, the broader averages not too far from record highs, despite all of these worries.TOBIAS LEVKOVICH, CITI CHIEF U.S. EQUITY STRATEGIST: So, look, investors are piling into what we will call secular growth, free cash flow generators, bulletproof balance sheet type of stocks and it's just not U.S. investors or concerns about too many retail investors getting involved, but rather foreign investors as well. Similar to what we saw almost back in '98, '99, 2000, were foreign investors wanted to get into the secular growers, and for the most part, they were concentrated in the US.BARTIROMO: And what are you doing now, in the face of all of this? Do you want to own these stocks here? Do you want to buy in now or wait for a decline before getting in?LEVKOVICH: So we would probably wait for the decline. Our primary sentiment metric, what be call "Panic-Euphoria Model" has been in euphoria now for four weeks. The last time we saw this was back in late January, right before the selloff and again, back in September 2018, right before the selloff.So we are concerned that investors a little bit beyond their skis right now. We're looking, for example, for a 2,900 S&P 500 target year end, and we're at 3,100 and change. So we do think there's still some volatility to come.There's been a lot of good news priced in. And as you noted kind of in your in your opening, Maria, the notion about this coronavirus infection spread again caused kind of an elongated period for - what might now be a much more sluggish economic recovery in the hopes for quick V shaped one.BARTIROMO: Tobias, are markets focused on the election yet? The presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden doubling down on his call to change the economy yesterday, as well as capitalism as we know it. Watch us.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And it's time corporate America paid their fair share of taxes. We thought in our administration, we should lower the tax in the high 30s to 28 percent, then lower it to 21. I'm going to raise it back up to 28. Let's make sure that workers have the power and the voice. It's way past time we put an end to the era of shareholder capitalism.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Tobias, what's the impact of all of this? Why do you think?LEVKOVICH: So I love at this point raising my Canadian flag and show (ph) my personal citizenship and I don't have to vote. But, separate of that, look, I think investors are on one side concerned. We talked to a number of clients about this. On one side, they're concerned about corporate taxes going up, personal taxes potentially going up.On the other side, they are looking at potentially more predictable trade policy, and not having to worry about tweaks at 10:00 pm. So there's kind of a mix amongst investors about, on one hand, it's kind of bad. On the other hand, it might be a little bit better. So they're not as worried as you would have thought.I think the bigger issue is investors might see (ph) the capital gains tax where to go up (inaudible) and would be potentially forced to sell earlier, rather than later if the tax rate went up meaningfully. Again, it just - just think of it, currently, the capital gains taxed at 20 percent.But if you're going to try to do - treat it as ordinary income taxes, for example, you'd almost double that. And I think a lot of financial advisors would tell their clients, Hey, guys, why not take the profits today, as you note markets are near record levels. Over the past 10 years people have made a lot of money. Take it today and could that cause a market pullback. I think that's something we are concerned about.BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, that would mean that we get a serious sell off at the end of the year. By the way, Biden has said that he wants to raise taxes as well as capital gains taxes. You're right. And Elizabeth Warren wants to institute a wealth tax. And I know that she's a key advisor for him.Let me get your take on earnings. They start in earnest next week. Bank earnings first, at JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, obviously Citi, Goldman Sachs all reporting second quarter results next week. Tobias, what's your take on the second quarter reporting season and the kickoff next week with the banks.LEVKOVICH: So let's start with the broader numbers. Current consensus down about 44 percent year-over-year from second quarter. And look, we shut down not just manufacturing economy, but service economy as everybody was sheltering in place. None of us were going to our yoga classes or our barber shops, et cetera. And in that sense, this is kind of unique. And, we think the numbers are going to be worse than that 44 percent.But I think investors are giving the second quarter kind of a hall pass in the sense that it's kind of a non-recurring event, economies are reopening and they're looking forward to the momentum and acceleration of trend.I think the key issue is going to be more guidance. And to great extent, Maria, a lot of investors are looking at 2021, 2022 type earnings to do their valuations. And even on that basis, current consensus for 2021 is $164 for the S&P 500. We just did a survey two weeks ago, 75 percent of our clients, over 140 institutions participated in the survey, said that 164 number is high.Now, with regards to the bank earnings, one of the things that has been happened more recently and is more capital markets related, is you've seen a lot of issuance of equity and debt. So underwriting fees are probably up meaningfully, trading volumes have been significant. And companies have already kind of told you that, that that's helpful to their bottom line.The question on the other side of this, what happens to credit losses? What are the provisions that are we taking for credit cards, (Technical Difficultly) or loans at larger institution, that's going --(Technical Difficultly)--BARTIROMO: All right. We will be watching that all next week, obviously with the banks. Tobias, thank you. Tobias Levkovich, we'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Time for the "Morning Buzz." First up, TikTok looking for change. The video app coming into fire for its ties to the Chinese Communist government. Now, the company says it's considering a new management board or setting up headquarters outside of China. Emily, will these changes help?EMILY JASHINSKY, THE FEDERALIST COMMENTARY WRITER: No. This is smoke and mirrors, and I don't think we should be falling for it. As long as tick dance is - TikTok is owned by ByteDance this is meaningless, as far as I'm concerned, because the threat that they will have to be compelled to give over the massive amounts of American data they collect still exists.And I would encourage everybody to delete TikTok from their phone. It is actually a security risk to you as an individual in this country. So this is smoke and mirrors and I do not think that Americans should fall for it.BARTIROMO: It's very important what you say, because it is an opportunity to surveil American citizens. So you right, TikTok is a Chinese company. It is caught - it has been caught surveilling iPhones. And, of course, if you're a Chinese company, you're a Chinese company and the Communist Party is in charge, period.Next, dating during quarantine made easier. Tinder adds a video feature. Check this out. It's for people to get to know each other before exchanging personal information and meeting in person. Madison, what do you think?MADISON CAWTHORN, NORTH CAROLINA REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE DISTRICT 11: Well, not only is this politically motivated coronavirus pandemic really destroying a lot of people's summer plans, the economy and even potentially students going back to school in the fall, but also its messing up a lot of people's dating lives.I've got a lot of friends who are still looking for their soulmate, their wife, their husband, and I know they're really going to enjoy being able to at least use this video to talk to other people.BARTIROMO: Yes. We're going to talk more about your platform in North Carolina coming up in the program. But let me get to this, finally, fun in the sun without the hangover. Tips are now being offered to drink safely, avoid a massive headache. They include drinking a lot of water along with alcohol, limiting sun exposure and avoiding drinks with a lot of sugar. Matt, you in?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm in Maria, I've really learned how to - my drinking habits and how they flowed during quarantine and shut down. And let me tell you, I can assure you do the lot less of it.BARTIROMO: Well, there's that. All right guys, stay with us. We'll be right back with more "Mornings with Maria."Load-Date: July 10, 2020End of Document

Tik Tok app leaves Hong Kong for China's new National Security ActCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 7, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 803 wordsBodyTikTok, TikTok, TikTok... Tiktokers are everywhere. More than 2 billion downloads worldwide has the short video app created by a 37-year-old Chinese software engineer named Zhang Yiming. But Zhang's pockets (14.58 billion euros, according to Forbes) have grown at almost as fast as accusations that its implementation is uninsurable and governed by the cessation and interventionism of the Communist Party of China have done in recent months.That signaling comes from afar. In fact the first conatos emerged when in 2017 the Douyin app, popular in the Asian giant and owned by the company ByteDance, founded by Zhang, was renamed outside the Chinese borders TikTok to expand internationally. The younger audience hooked on that fast system to record, edit and share funny videos, with an algorithm that selects content tailored to consumer tastes.But from the United States, they have not ceased to sow doubts about the security of the application, even though the company has repeatedly repeatedly reiterated that its users' data is not stored in China or shared with the Xi Jinping censor government. "We are considering restricting users' access to the TikTok app because of concerns that the Beijing government is using it as a means of monitoring," Said Mike Pompeo, US Secretary of State, yesterday.If this were to happen, Donald Trump's administration would not be the first to ban TikTok. Two weeks ago they were ahead of the government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Among the 59 Chinese applications banned was the short video, which has 661 million downloads in India, almost 30% of its global market. The reason, according to the authorities: "These applications are detrimental to the sovereignty and integrity of the country".Even other countries such as Australia, according to local media, are also considering banning implementation. "TikTok does not share information from our users with any foreign government, including the Chinese government, and would not do so even if it could," they argue from the company, now run by former Disney executive Kevin Mayer, who has also wanted to take it a step further to demonstrate his commitment to privacy, as evidenced by the news he has jumped these days to the waters of Hong Kong.TikTok has confirmed that it will leave the former British colony's application market after Beijing imposed the new National Security Act that threatens the autonomy that china has enjoyed since China regained its dominance 23 years ago. A decision already taken days ago by other companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Google at the request of the Hong Kong Police of user data based on the new legislation.All of these companies have reported that they "pause" the requests of city authorities while analyzing whether the law violates human and civic rights. "In light of recent developments, we have decided to halt the operations of the TikTok app in Hong Kong," a company spokesman told Reuters."TikTok's decision to stop Hong Kong operations from its popular video app seems unusual, but it's strategic. The company has fought to combat suspicions that it operates under Chinese law or under the control of Beijing. That's why TikTok has struggled to try to change its global image, and this movement could be another step to achieve it," says Karishma Vaswani, BBC Asia analystPowers to the Police to interceptCommunicationsHong Kong's new security law - which punishes with up to life imprisonment what China broadly describes as secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces - empowers the police to intercept private communications and censor online media without a court order. Measures that are implemented in Article 43 of the regulations.The head of the local executive, Carrie Lam, said today that this assumes that Hong Kong will once again be one of the safest cities in the world after last year's strong pro-democracy protests. "Compared to other countries' national security laws, it is a fairly moderate law. Its scope is not as broad as in other countries and even in China," says Lam.For protonMail engineers, an encrypted email service used by activists around the world to avoid being hunted, this law, looking at it from the perspective of technology networks, is a "great firewall that China has created around Hong Kong," they explain in statements to this newspaper.According to one of the organization's analysts, Edwars Shone, these regulations "will immediately limit Hong Kong's freedom of media and internet. They allow the Police to force Internet service providers (ISPs) and social media platforms to enforce censorship, without a court order. But most importantly, the people of Hong Kong can no longer expect their rights to be protected. Hong Kong will not be treated differently than mainland China."Load-Date: July 8, 2020End of Document

Barr criticizes US reliance on Chinese productsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 16, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 427 wordsBodyWASHINGTON (AP) — The United States relies heavily on Chinese products and services, including head coverings, medical gowns, and other personal protective equipment designed to curb the spread of coronavirus, Justice Secretary William Barr said Thursday.Barr further reported that Chinese government-linked hackers are stalking U.S. universities and companies to steal data related to vaccine development, filing such an accusation against Beijing just hours after other Western agencies filed similar claims against Russia.Barr's speech at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan, is part of an intense campaign launched by Donald Trump's administration against China. Trump tries to evade criticism of his handling of the coronavirus crisis and its devastating economic impact, and blame Beijing. At the same time, he accuses his Democratic rival Joe Biden of being too docile against China."The People's Republic of China is currently engaged in an economic bombardment—an aggressive, orchestrated campaign involving all levels of government (indeed, society) to seize the leadership of the global economy and overtake the United States as the pre-eminent global superpower," Barr said.In recent weeks, U.S. government officials have increased their rhetoric about China's alleged economic espionage. As an example, national security adviser Robert O'Brien wrote an article in The New York Post and FBI Director Chris Wray issued a speech last week in which he accused China of trying to steal American research and scientific innovations. He claimed the FBI launches a China-related counterespionage investigation every 10 hours.Barr's speech is a broad condemnation of what he called China's tactics for global supremacy in the 21st century and pressuring large American corporations to implement pro-communist policies. He warned that U.S. business leaders could be violating federal rules against undue political influence if they do not disclose their contacts with Beijing, and that universities that obtain funds from China's government could inadvertently lose control of their academic research.Hollywood has also fallen under Chinese influence, barr denounced, who accused some filmmakers of committing self-censorship aligned with China's propaganda."Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedoms. A world that marches to the drum beats of communist China will not be conducive to institutions that depend on free markets, free trade and the free exchange of ideas," the secretary of justice said.Load-Date: July 17, 2020End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 31 of 487Sens.
