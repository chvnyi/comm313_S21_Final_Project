These deals could affect broader markets.Joining me right now to talk about that is the Head of Equity Strategy at Stifel, Barry Bannister; also joining the conversation this morning all morning is Fox Business' Dagen McDowell; pollster and the President of Maslansky & Partners, and the author of Persuasion, Lee Carter is here as well. Great to see everybody this morning. Thank you so much for being here.And Barry, let me kick this off with you. We got a little bit of a merger Monday here with some major deals. What's your take on what this tells us, I guess, some of this stuff was on the shelf and now it looks like we are back to business.BARRY BANNISTER, HEAD OF EQUITY STRATEGY, STIFEL: Well, we've always been back to business, because ever since March the Federal Reserve has given us incredibly low interest rates. What we have is the tonic of free money, and when you have high share prices, which is currency for deals, when you have a lot of cash in the system and money is better than free; it's a negative real rate. You are going to have deals, you are going to have a bid-up technology sector. It doesn't really surprise me that there's M&A pickup, there has been for a little while now.BARTIROMO: What's your take on Oracle becoming the winner here for the U.S operations of TikTok?BANNISTER: This is interesting. It's really not about TikTok. I mean, I don't think little meme videos are that important to society compared to, for instance, Microsoft software, which is important to society and business. But what is important is the control of data. And so this is a proxy for the technology cold war that we are in. And we are going to be in a technology cold war with China for decades.BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right. And I wonder if the actual technology changes and if we are going to have a different technology in China versus the United States in terms of this power struggle on tech, which is something that the Chinese have been trying very hard to compete with the United States, the Chinese Communist Party.BANNISTER: When you look at the Chinese, though, the tech companies, they tend to be strong at home and in some cases not as strong abroad. So China's model works well inside China, but outside of that, it doesn't export that well. I think the U.S. will still have a powerful world role in terms of technology going forward.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about this report out of Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, they are saying that the selloff could be coming to an end. Both banks indicating that the selling at this point is behind us but also say that November's election is obviously a key source of uncertainty in the coming months.Barry, what's your take in terms of this market, it really won't quit? Are you expecting this rally to stay where it is, given the federal reserves record interest rates that you just mentioned?BANNISTER: Well, if you think about it, Maria, the S&P 500 Index, for example, was 3,100 in June, it peaked at almost 3,600 in early September. We were right in the middle of that range and I actually think we go down to the 3,100 level before October is over.So what do we have here? We have got a lasting damage to the person-to- person side of GDP and jobs, that's not coming back anytime soon. We've got the partisan rejection of targeted fiscal aid, which by the end of the year, will show up in the economy. And so the stock market is four months ahead of the economy and that should be discounted right about now.We've also got fairly weak inflation, I expect oil prices to drop to $30 very soon. And as a consequence, real interest rates, real yields would go up slightly as inflation drops, and that would hurt these technology valuations. So I think there's about 7 percent to go on the S&P 500 correction, a little more on the tech stocks in the next 6 weeks or so.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Barry, it's great to get your take this morning. Thanks so much.Barry Bannister this morning from Stifel.BANNISTER: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We got lots of movers on Wall Street this morning due to all these deal news. Another stock to watch is Amazon, the retail giant announcing overnight it is hiring 100,000 workers in the United States and Canada. Of course, we are going into the holiday season. It's typical that they'll hire a temporary, but this seems like a very strong notice for Amazon, stock is up almost 2 percent, as you see there.We are just getting started this morning.Coming up the race for the White House. We are taking a look at the 2020 campaign trail with now 50 days to go until Election Day. Who is leading in the new Fox News polls, we will bring them to you.Then TikTok sale, what Oracle's winning bid means for users and followers in the United States.You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The countdown to November is on, 50 days until Election Day. President Trump holding two rallies this weekend in Nevada, including his first indoor event in nearly three months. It drew some criticism amid the coronavirus pandemic certainly, and he slammed Joe Biden last night saying that he is not fit for the presidential job.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: This man is totally unfit to be president. Up here, he's totally unfit. Kim Jong-un doesn't know about the problems that Joe has. We need very sharp people, I'm sorry. Joe is not qualified for this position.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The president is headed to California today, meanwhile Biden campaigning in Delaware today and then Florida tomorrow. Our former presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg, saying that he is prepared to spend $100 million in Florida alone to help the Biden-Harris ticket.Joining me right now is Republican strategist and former Nevada State GOP Chairwoman, Amy Tarkanian; and former vice president Biden senior adviser and transparent business chief transparency officer, Moe Vela.Great to see you guys. Thank you so much for joining us.Amazing, Amy, that Michael Bloomberg says he is ready to spend $100 million in Florida. That is a lot of money, and he is doing it just in Florida. How impactful would this be?AMY TARKANIAN, FORMER NEVADA STATE GOP CHAIRWOMAN: Well, obviously he's going to be able to buy lots of air time and then flood the air waves with pro-Biden TV ads and radio ads, and that is very helpful. However, if we look back, historically, at some other candidates, who had the most amount of money, I mean, Jeb Bush, he had a ton of money and he didn't do so well. And you also had Hillary Clinton, who had a lot of money as well, and she's not our president.So I don't think it's going to actually put him over into the W column, but it is definitely going to help.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's pretty incredible. Mo, what's your reaction to that number?MOE VELA, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN SENIOR ADVISER: Well, I find it interesting actually. Good morning, Maria, first of all. Thanks for having me back.I find it interesting that--BARTIROMO: Thank you.VELA: --the Trump campaign and Ms. Tarkanian, for example, you guys were bragging when you were ahead in cash advantage, but now all of a sudden when you're not ahead in the cash advantage, it's not such a big thing, right? Clearly, $100 million from Bloomberg is going to make a difference in Florida. But let's be honest here, it's not the money that's going to make a difference in Florida, it's the fact that the president last week, I guess, and the week before, called our military and vets suckers and losers. And he withheld information regarding COVID that ended up in the death of our fellow Americans. It's not about who pumps in money, you guys.BARTIROMO: Now that's not true, Moe. He did not withhold any information. That's not true. But let me show you this new Fox News polls showing that the national - Yes, go ahead, Moe. What did he withhold? You want to go into this, what did he withhold?VELA: It's on tape, Maria. He actually said to Bob Woodward.BARTIROMO: What? What did he withhold?VELA: That he knew this was - let's go back and roll all the tape, OK, because I don't want to - I don't want anybody to say that I'm misleading anybody. He told Bob Woodward, he knew it was much more severe than what he said every week when he was on tape. He was golfing, he was holding political rallies.BARTIROMO: Yes.VELA: Knowing this was killing people.BARTIROMO: No. That's just not true. It's just not true. I don't need Bob Woodward to tell me what the president has done. The president told me directly. I interviewed him in Davos on January 22, I know exactly what he said and I know what he did. And on January 31, he stopped all travel from China and Joe Biden called him a xenophobe, as a result. Nancy Pelosi was dancing up the storm in San Francisco's Chinatown, said come on down, we're having a ball in China, everybody is on top of each other. So let's be a little more realistic.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Let's know the new Fox News polls here and they show that the national race is tightening, Joe Biden holding a 5-point lead over President Trump right now. Groups within the country favoring Biden, include women, suburbanized seniors, meanwhile men, whites, rural voters all siding with President Trump. The issues, the only area where voters trust President Trump more is the economy, according to these polls. So your guy is obviously in the lead, Moe, how is he going to stay there?VELA: Maria, I don't put a lot of stock in polls, to be really honest with you, whether we are ahead or behind. I don't vacillate on that. I do look at patterns and trends. The vice president has held a lead now for a long time, so that is a pattern and a trend I'm keeping a close eye on. It's going to be a much tighter race than people think, but I do think that Vice President, Biden, will prevail. He is going to prevail and he is going to hold that lead, because again, to me this is a value's election. If you're OK with lying, with racism and hatred, vote for Trump. Really simple.TARKANIAN: Yes. I don't believe the poll at all.(CROSSTALK)TARKANIAN: Yes, I don't believe the poll at all. Here in Nevada is the perfect example, we are predominantly a blue state at this point, but we had thousands upon thousands turn out for both rallies. We also had a boat parade in Lake Mead, which had almost a thousand boats in itself.When the president announced that he was going to be here, within 15 minutes the Biden-Harris campaign jumped panicked and now we have Kamala Harris coming into town. Because they know that the president is making inroads here in Nevada. McCain lost by 12 points, Romney lost by 8, and the president lost in 2016 by less than 2 percent. And we know that the president doesn't like to lose, so he's working really hard to win over the Nevada voters.BARTIROMO: Well, I will tell you. This is a close race. Amy, Moe, we will be talking more. Great to talk with you both this morning. We so appreciate your time.Amy Tarkanian and Moe Vela, we will see you soon, guys. Thank you so much.TARKANIAN: Yes.BARTIROMO: Coming up TikTok sale, the Chinese app rejected Microsoft's bid. It's now an in exclusive negotiations with the winning bidder, which is Oracle. We are going to have more on that coming up.Then fashion forward protective gear, Louis Vuitton rolls out a luxury face mask. You will not believe the price tag.You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The TikTok talks taking a huge step forward on the week that the deadline to make a deal happens. The Chinese social media app chose Oracle as its new U.S. partner making an 11th hour decision to pass on Microsoft.Joining me right now is technology analyst and CoinDesk Executive Editor, Pete Pachal. Pete, it's great to see you this morning. What's your reaction to Oracle being the winner here?PETE PACHAL, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, COINDESK: Well, that sound you heard last night was a lot of TikTokers breathing a sigh of relief, probably a very badly choreographed one, but my reaction is a little bit of surprise certainly. I kind of thought Microsoft had this in the bag at least the way they were kind of posturing about it and they certainly look like kind of the big loser here.I mean, Satya Nadella was campaigning pretty openly to be the chosen one here and it doesn't look like any kind of deal maker in the wake of this. But hats off to Oracle, they have gotten - seems like they've gotten a deal. But the big thing to remember there is this isn't an outright sale, at least according to the reports. They're basically going to be the technology partner of TikTok in the United States. And it sort of remains to be seen whether that's enough, because the condition put on by the Trump administration last month seem to be - need to be some kind of outright sale. So we will see how it goes.BARTIROMO: I guess, my question would be, what does this mean in terms of the data and user information at Oracle? How many people at TikTok will go work for Oracle, because the Chinese Communist Party has been very strategic in terms of getting on the inside of companies to get data transfer? That's why we have seen a string of indictments this year, from the Department of Justice on academics, professors, who have been identified by the CCP to actually work with them to transfer data of users and of Americans to the Chinese Communist Party. Is that going to be the case here? How many TikTok workers will work with Oracle?PACHAL: Yes, it's a really good question. So I think the (inaudible) sort of we're getting at the heart of why Oracle may be the chosen one here? So Oracle, certainly, has a very good reputation in terms of just being, knowing how to do those kind of logistics and securing data. And it's going to be a probably very complicated relationship that they set up with TikTok and its U.S. operations, so that there are some more church and state, sort of, separations on what the ByteDance network, or what China essentially has access to, and what remains in the U.S.What's really a big factor here is data sovereignty, and where the data on U.S. users actually resides, and generally that will need to be in the U.S. and that needs to be like in essentially the rock bottoms.BARTIROMO: Dagen?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Is this going to even - I just raised the issues, is this even going to pass muster, this Oracle deal, this partnership, if you will, with the White House and the committee on foreign investment in the U.S.?It still has to be reviewed and maybe this isn't a loss for Microsoft, maybe it's a win for Microsoft, because it doesn't want to get in bed with the Chinese Communist Party in a way that it still remains to be seen what is in this deal, this partnership for Oracle. Maybe this just kicks the can down the road and after the election, this gets revisited in a way that if Oracle winds up with egg on its face.PACHAL: Yes, it's possible. And it's not just the U.S. government, it's also the Chinese government. So they in August, shortly after the deadline was imposed for the sale, came out and said that they would impose some new laws on to make sure that data-sharing companies, essentially couldn't give away the golden goose and in the case of TikTok, that would be their algorithm. So it's the algorithm that makes sure the recommends of all the videos that basically ensures people keep scrolling in the app, which a lot of people see as some of the key value in the app.So when - since Oracle is not just the trusted technology partner, it seems like they will not have access to that algorithm, and they are probably more just interested in the user data, as you mentioned on TikTok's users. I mean, Oracle, in recent years, has really ramped up their marketing cloud efforts. So I would definitely see a possibility here that they are going to use that user data to enhance those - that part of their business, while at the same time letting them scale up their cloud.Their cloud is actually, cloud business is rapidly rising, but it's still not on par with Amazon and Microsoft, which are number 1 and 2.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's amazing how the Chinese Communist Party is so front and center in all of this. It's also partly, I think, one of the reasons for the deal with Arm, Nvidia acquiring Arm from SoftBank because of the semiconductor chips that are being isolated from the Chinese Communist Party and Huawei. So there is a China component to all of this.Pete, we will keep watching. It's great to see you this morning. Thank you so much.Pete Pachal joining us there on this string of deals that we are talking about this morning.Coming up, robot surgeons. Yes, you heard right. They are on the way. We are taking a look at AI, artificial intelligence are to be used in operating rooms across the country.And then one airline predicting a travel bounce-back with a condition. Stay with us. We will bring it to you.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Monday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, September 14th. Let's take a look at markets, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast, we've got major deals happening this morning, an upbeat news on the coronavirus vaccine, and that is lifting investors sentiment. Take a look at futures, Dow futures up 215 points, Nasdaq futures up 144 and the S&P futures right now higher by 33. This after the Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 mark their second consecutive week of losses on Friday. As you see, it was another tough week with all the major indices down, but the Nasdaq getting crushed down 4 percent in the last week.Global markets this morning are mixed, take a look at European indices, you've got virtual trade talks happening between the European Union and China taking place today. FTSE 100 down 15, CAC Quarante up 3, Dax Index lower by 17. The big SoftBank-Nvidia deal helping fuel markets in Asia overnight, take a look there and you'll see markets higher across the board, the best performer was Korea, Kospi Index up 1.30 percent. Meanwhile, the Gulf Coast preparing for Tropical Storm Sally, Jackie DeAngelis with the details now. Jackie, good morning to you.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. Well, Sally is expected to become a hurricane before making landfall near the Louisiana-Mississippi border overnight. New Orleans now issuing a mandatory evacuation for parts of the area. The storm already bringing heavy rain and flash flooding to parts of Florida, Sally is the earliest 18th named storm on record. And the CEO of United Airlines warning that there will be no recovery in the aviation industry without a COVID-19 vaccine. Scott Kirby tells "CBS" that he doesn't expect that to happen until the end of next year.United plans to lay off 16,000 workers next month unless the government comes up with another stimulus plan. Kirby adding that the entire economy faces more layoffs if that help doesn't arrive. We're checking on shares of United Airlines parent company in the pre-market, they're up almost half a percent. Meantime, Dominic Thiem winning the U.S. Open last night. His first grand slam. He made a dramatic comeback beating Alexander Zverev in the tournament's first ever fifth set, tie-breaker final. And on the women's court, Naomi Osaka winning her second U.S. Open, beating Victoria Azarenka for the title. Osaka making a statement during the tournament wearing masks with the names of seven black Americans killed by police, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, Jackie, thank you so much, Jackie DeAngelis. We've got new tensions this morning between the United States and China following the detention of 12 Hong Kong activists set sea by mainland Chinese authorities. Family members holding a news conference over the weekend, pleading for their relatives' return. Joining me right now is the author of the book, "The Coming Collapse of China and the Great U.S.-China Trade War", Gordon Chang. Gordon, it's great to have you this morning, good morning to you. Your thoughts on what's taking place this weekend with these hostages.GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR: Well, the United States believes China has obligations to the international community over Hong Kong, China believes that it's an internal matter. The U.S. has the better of the argument because China and Britain signed this signed off British joint declaration of 1984 which is a treaty, and unfortunately China right now is trying to end all of the promise autonomy to the territory. People are fleeing, they're fleeing to Taiwan, people in Hong Kong are really upset, they sort of lost hope in some sense, so this is a continuing situation where the U.S. is trying to give some sort of inspiration to people who feel that China is just violating all of its promises to Hong Kong.BARTIROMO: In the meantime, the U.S. ambassador to China Terry Branstad stepping down amid these rising tensions. The former Iowa governor spent more than 3 years in Beijing, Gordon, what do you make of this move that he's now stepping down?CHANG: Well, there was this flap last week over the op-ed that the United States wanted to put into people's daily, which is the most authoritative publication in China, Beijing refused. You know, Branstad has really not been a factor in the sense because China policy is made by the president himself. I'm surprised Branstad has lasted as long as he did.BARTIROMO: Yes, what's your take on where we are right now with China, Gordon, and so much to discuss with its bad behavior in terms of intellectual property theft. The president basically saying, look, it's fine if we decouple, not to mention the handling of coronavirus and of course, the human rights abuses.CHANG: Well, the United States for the first time in decades is just saying that, you know, we will no longer accept this unacceptable behavior because too often in the past, previous administrations, Republicans and Democrats just sort of let China slide. And that was especially true during the Obama administration. So although, there's tension, this is a good thing because it means that the United States is actually defending its interest, and we haven't done that since perhaps the Eisenhower administration.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's pretty extraordinary what this administration has done. Meanwhile, we're learning about deals that have taken place in the past where the Chinese Communist Party was able to acquire major American companies. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro was with me yesterday on Sunday morning futures talking about how Hunter Biden and his dealings with China show that they were giving the Chinese Communist Party a pass. He said this on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES", watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: How is it possible that this company in Michigan was able to get acquired by a company that is Chinese military --PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE TRADE ADVISER: Yes --BARTIROMO: Related?NAVARRO: The question we all need to ask Joe Biden is when he took Hunter over -- Hunter Biden over on Air Force 2, did he know Hunter was going to come back with pallets of cash, over $1 billion for Bo --(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Gordon, what about that? I mean, this is a company that is tied to the Chinese military, the PLA, and actually it was able to acquire a company in Michigan. This is more of the same that we've been seeing, Gordon. What would a Biden win mean for the U.S.-China relations?CHANG: Yes, we've got to be deeply concerned because the 2015 acquisition of this Michigan automotive company Henniges was just unacceptable, and it was, I think, indefensible. They were selling it to a military-linked company in China. This company had valuable technology, and Hunter Biden as well as I guess the nephew of the Secretary of State Kerry were involved in this. This just reeks, and I think that this acquisition should be reversed by the Trump administration. Whatever power it has, it needs to do that to show China that we are not going to allow corruption to permit the acquisition of U.S. companies.BARTIROMO: Yes, you really haven't heard a lot of this on the left, the president's critics. But Ted Cruz was among those yesterday warning about the threat from China on "SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES". Here is the senator from Texas.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: On China, in terms of where we are, there would be a very different approach depending on who wins this election in terms of our long-term relationship with China, yes?SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): Absolutely. China is I believe the single greatest geopolitical threat facing the United States for the next century.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: What would the U.S. be able to do to push back on that threat, Gordon?CHANG: Well, you know, we first of all, I think need to sever trade and investment relations because we're enriching a hostile regime that's configuring its military to fight Americans. I mean, you know, China declared a quote, unquote, "people's war" on the U.S. last May, May of 2019, and that shows the hostility of the Chinese regime to us. You know, we've been ignoring what Beijing has been saying, and every time we do that, Americans pay for it. So this -- at this time, I think the U.S. needs to take extraordinary measures to defend American sovereignty.BARTIROMO: And real quick before you go, Gordon, the Ant Group which of course is a unit of Alibaba is going to be going public in Hong Kong. What's your thought about Ant Group, formerly known as Ant Financial Services, this company with 1.2 billion users, the vast majority reside in mainland China, a successful deal, I guess, the Chinese Communist Party wants a successful deal to show the world that everything is working fine in Hong Kong. It's going to be going public in Hong Kong very soon this week.CHANG: Yes, this is going to be the world's largest IPO in all probability and, you know, we've to remember that a lot of U.S. investment banks have been involved, and they're going to be selling at shares to the American public. I'm not so sure that's a good idea for a number of reasons. Remembers Ant's been involved in transactions that, you know, China buy up U.S. company Money Gram. We should not be allowing U.S. investment banks in on this deal.BARTIROMO: Well, they're all involved, Goldman Sachs, I mean, they're all -- this is -- you know that this is big business. So we'll see if the banks bulk at that. Gordon, we'll be watching the Ant Group when it goes public, this is going to be a big deal certainly to -- for a lot of reasons. We will come back to you on that. Thank you, Gordon, great to see you.CHANG: Thank you so much, Maria.BARTIROMO: Gordon Chang. Coming up, unrest across America, former NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly is here, weighing in on the crime spikes gripping the nation. And then robot surgence, they are on the way, we're going to take a look at how artificial intelligence is already being used in the operating room. Plus, the freshest vacay ever, score a stay at the "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" mansion, we'll tell you how? You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, robot surgence. Yes, you heard that right there? Said to be only years away from the operating room. Doctors already using million-dollar artificial intelligence devices to assist in surgeries that require more precision than human hands. Joining me right now is the author of the newly released book "Male Aesthetic Plastic Surgery". Board certified plastic surgeon Dr. Douglas Steinbrech. Dr. Steinbrech, thanks very much for joining me this morning, great to see you. The "Wall Street Journal" is reporting on a Singapore-based effort to give robots a so- called AI skin, artificial skin, complete with the sense of touch. Your thoughts on robots in the operating room.DOUGLAS STEINBRECH, BOARD CERTIFIED PLASTIC SURGEON: I think robots can be a really great technical tool, so that's Dr. Ti(ph) and he was at the University of Singapore. These robots can really help us as long as they give us technical information. And if we can use that and use that information, but then use our artistic touch, I think that we can definitely be able to do a better job for our patients, and technically, do more technically difficult procedures with the help of these robots and with the help of the artificial intelligence.BARTIROMO: So, the more difficult the procedure, the need for what? A steady hand or what does the --STEINBRECH: Innovations --BARTIROMO: Technology bring that a human can't do?STEINBRECH: Right, it's both things, both cases. First, you can get better information about the skin. For instance, here marks in an "Esquire" article, and it all talked about using a computer algorithm to measure how strongly the facial muscles contract in different areas. And then it gives us some feed out on a road map that the doctor can use to do injections based on how strong those are, and it matches up with that information. So, that's a technical tool. Another example is orthopedics. Back, it used to take 2 hours for a doctor to bore in the hip joint and then put in a metal, a metallic joint, they can now do that with an MRI fed into a machine, fed to the robot and the robot can bore into that hip joint in 30 seconds to 2 minutes rather than taking an hour and a half and it can fit with precise, exact precision of the joint into the bone.BARTIROMO: Wow, that is incredible. Dagen McDowell, what do you think about this? Weigh in here, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Doctor, don't you need to convince patients though that this is just a supplement to the work that human doctors do? When you start talking about robots, particularly operating on your face or other parts of your body, you've got a big hurdle to overcome, do you not?STEINBRECH: Huge hurdle. And that's why -- that's the other thing. There are 3 things that are required, if we're going to start to have these people -- these robots come in, there's also a human interface, to be able to do that, particularly what I do which is aesthetic plastic surgery, you need the artistic sense and you need to be able to individualize. You also need the technical feel. The doctor needs to feel the tissues in front of them, and the third thing the computers sometimes don't have is good taste. For what I do, that's so important.MCDOWELL: Yes --STEINBRECH: So, we're not quite there, and maybe a little bit of hype, but we definitely are going to be seeing more of this in the near future.BARTIROMO: So, do you use any AI-based algorithms because there are companies reportedly using AI-based algorithms to streamline even the Botox process. Is this something you would consider for Botox?STEINBRECH: I would consider using it as a tool, but right now for me, everything I do is based on an artistic sense, understand what the patient wants and moving ahead with their desires, and also my experience being an injector. So I rely on myself. But I definitely can see these coming in the future, particularly as we see that these computer and these algorithms and the robots are getting more -- are getting better and better and better. We're going to see it in anesthesia, we're going to see it in surgery, because just like we're seeing cars drive, now, we're going to see the safety and the algorithms of these Uber cars that are self-driving cars, that they're going to be much more safe than drivers and human error that comes with drivers, that also happens along with surgeons who just humans and anesthesiologists.Now, at some point, we're going to see that the computers and robots can do a better job than actually the surgeons who are only humans.BARTIROMO: Wow, that's pretty fascinating stuff. Dr. Steinbrech, you'll have to come back and tell us all about it as we continue to see new developments. Great to have you this morning, thank you.STEINBRECH: Thank you. And Maria, I really enjoyed -- I know you love AI and I enjoyed your artificial intelligence documentary from last week was just fascinating and outstanding. Thank you so much for that.BARTIROMO: But thank you so much for that, I really appreciate it. That was really fascinating actually, artificial intelligence documentary. We'll see you soon, Dr. Steinbrech, thank you so much sir. Coming up, the countdown to November, former White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders is here to talk about the campaign and these new Fox News polls that we want to bring to you. But first, fashion-forward protective gear, Louis Vuitton rolls out a luxury face shield, yes, it comes with a luxury price tag, we will be back right after this break.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Time for the Morning Buzz. First up, you can now wear the crown. Will Smith teams up with Airbnb to give fans a chance to stay in the mansion featured on the "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air". Guests greeted by the Smith's music collaborator DJ Jazzy Jeff and enjoyed Air Jordan sneakers to play basketball in the bedroom. A full closet of clothes, it is just $30, a reboot of the series coming to "NBC's" Peacock. Dagen, sounds like a fun stay.MCDOWELL: No, Will Smith is not going to be there like -- period. He's not going to be there. He -- Jazzy Jeff is the one who greets you. Again, who wants to go to California right now anyway? California is just still struggling with lockdowns. By the way, you do have to live in L.A. County to even qualify to stay there.BARTIROMO: Finally this, being safe and stylish. Louis Vuitton introduces a face shield featuring gold studs, it is signature LV monogram pattern. It's expected to sell for nearly $1,000. Lee, you're in the market for one of these face coverings?(LAUGHTER)LEE CARTER, POLLSTER & PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY PARTNERS: I kind of think it's hilarious, and I can't decide what's funnier? That people just spend a $1,000 on something that the CDC isn't sure is going to help or if this was really just part of Louis Vuitton's cruise line which obviously is going to have a hard time to see since a lot of people I don't think are going to be cruising. But I do think this is going to be a trend that we're going to see a lot of designer masks, a lot of designer mask chains and now face shield though, so let's see who is going to win that --BARTIROMO: Yes --CARTER: The fashion battle here.BARTIROMO: Yes, that I agree with.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: We'll just smack it off of someone's face?(LAUGHTER)Boogie ridiculous --BARTIROMO: You mean, the -- you mean the Louis Vuitton -- the Louis Vuitton one --MCDOWELL: Yes!BARTIROMO: All right, top financial analyst coming up, helping you watch your wallet next hour right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.

REMARKS BY DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFFREY A. ROSEN AT AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF CHARGES AND ARRESTS IN COMPUTER INTRUSION CAMPAIGNS RELATED TO CHINAStates News ServiceSeptember 16, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1137 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of Justice:Remarks as Prepared for DeliveryGood morning. With me today are FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich, Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers, Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin and Acting Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI's Washington DC Field Office James Dawson. We are here to announce coordinated, wide-ranging actions to disrupt the malicious cyber activities of a group commonly referred to as Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)-41, as well as a related international criminal enterprise involving APT-41 actors. Cybersecurity experts have referred to APT-41's activities as "one of the broadest campaigns by a Chinese cyber espionage actor [] in recent years."We are announcing today multiple efforts to disrupt these activities. First and foremost is that we have unsealed three indictments that, collectively, charge five Chinese nationals with computer hacking and charge two Malaysian nationals for helping some of those hackers target victims and sell the fruits of their hacking.Our charges allege two distinct categories of criminal conduct:First, as the core of APT-41's computer hacking, the Chinese defendants targeted well over 100 victims worldwide in a variety of industries and sectors that are, sadly, part of the standard target list for Chinese hackers. These criminal acts were turbo-charged by a sophisticated technique referred to as a "supply chain attack," in which the Chinese hackers compromised software providers around the world, and modified the providers' code to install backdoors that enabled further hacks against the software providers' customers.Second, and as an additional method of making money, several of the Chinese defendants compromised the networks of video game companies worldwide (a billion-dollar industry) and defrauded them of in-game resources. Two of the Chinese defendants stand accused, with two Malaysian defendants, of selling those resources on the black market, through their illicit web site.Now, in addition to these unsealed indictments, I am pleased to announce that, through the cooperation of Malaysian law enforcement authorities, the two Malaysian defendants were arrested on Sunday evening and now face extradition proceedings.Identifying those responsible and holding them to account is our primary mission, but criminal investigation and prosecution alone are not enough to make the Internet safer.So there is a third part of today's announcement. Specifically, in addition to these criminal charges, and the two arrests, the Department of Justice and the FBI have been working with seven private sector partners, including Microsoft Corporation, Google, Facebook, and Verizon Media, to identify and neutralize the computer infrastructure that APT-41 uses to conduct its crimes: its virtual private servers, malware, malicious domains, and other tools. We have done this through a combination of public and private actions, including technical measures to block this threat actor from accessing victims' computer systems, issuing a public safety announcement outlining their tactics, techniques, and procedures (to aid network defenders), and by taking control of, or otherwise disabling, their accounts pursuant to court orders or terms of service violations.The bottom line is that we have used every tool at the department's disposal to disrupt these APT-41 activities.Ideally, I would be thanking Chinese law enforcement authorities for their cooperation in this matter and the five Chinese hackers would now be in custody awaiting trial. Unfortunately, the record of recent years tells us that the Chinese Communist Party has a demonstrated history of choosing a different path, that of making China safe for their own cyber criminals, so long as they help with its goals of stealing intellectual property and stifling freedom.Less than two months ago, Assistant Attorney General Demers was at this podium to announce an indictment in another hacking case in which the Chinese government tolerated the defendants' criminal activity because those defendants were willing to work on behalf of the Chinese intelligence services. And here we are again. In this case, one of the Chinese defendants is accused of boasting to a colleague that he was "very close" to the Ministry of State Security and would be protected "unless something very big happens." The hacker and his associate agreed not to "touch domestic stuff anymore."We know the Chinese authorities to be at least as able as the law enforcement authorities here and in like-minded states to enforce laws against computer intrusions. But they choose not to.But know this: no country can be respected as a global leader while paying only lip service to the rule of law and without taking steps to disrupt brazen criminal acts like these. No responsible government knowingly shelters cyber criminals that target victims worldwide in acts of rank theft.Responsible nations not only condemn criminal conduct, they root it out and punish it.Responsible nations disavow criminals within their borders and bring them to justice.Responsible nations work with other countries' law enforcement authorities and ensure that justice is served in a court of law.The PRC has done none of these things.You can take three additional observations from this press conference today. First, the Chinese government has the power to help stop crimes like these.Second, the Chinese Government has made a deliberate choice to allow its citizens to commit computer intrusions and attacks around the world because these actors will also help the PRC.But, third, the Department of Justice will do everything it can to disrupt these crimes by exposing the techniques, tactics, and procedures used by APT-41, enabling the private sector to disable them, and working with our law enforcement colleagues around the world to arrest the hackers when we can.We appreciate our partnerships with the private sector, such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Verizon Media, and foreign law enforcement partners who have been a force multiplier in the fight against these international criminals. Such partnerships send a clear message that governments and the private sector are prepared to work together to defend against significant cyber threats.Today, on top of all the measures I've mentioned already, we are exposing this threat to the international community, to cybersecurity experts, and to the greater public, and we will never stop pursuing the individuals responsible for these alleged criminal acts, here and abroad, and anywhere they travel.Now, I will turn the podium over to Acting U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin, who will discuss the allegations in the indictments in greater detail.Load-Date: September 16, 2020End of Document

ByteDance rejects Microsoft's offer to buy TikTok.

"Either we take down TikTok in this country for security reasons, or it will have to be sold," the U.S. president said. It is recalled that on August 3, Trump declared that the Chinese video-sharing app would cease to work in the United States if it was not sold to a U.S. company by September 15.            Read Also Microsoft and Walmart compete with Oracle and make offer by TikTok                 In recent times, US policymakers have been expressing fears about the app, with many of them saying it could pose national security risks due to data that may pass on to China and propaganda that may come to the contrary.  According to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, it is concerned that Chinese technology with a Presence in the U.S. will provide data to the Beijing authorities. Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported, quoted by Lusa, thatnegotiations for the sale of TikTok's operations in the United States had been complicated due to the question of whether the application's core algorithms could be included in the business. These algorithms decide which videos users see without first requiring them to follow other users or specify their preferences.According to the U.S. newspaper, the algorithms were integrated into the business until August 28 when the Chinese government introduced restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence technology, such as the one that powers TikTok.The Chinese decision followed Trump's efforts to force the sale of TikTok in the U.S., where the app has 100 million users. These export restrictions mean that ByteDance will need to obtain a license to export any restricted technology to a foreign company. The question is whether its algorithms need the approval of the Chinese government to be transferred and, if so, whether Beijing will authorize the transfer, Lusa stressed. Now, according to the South China Morning Post, the basic algorithm will even be out.Load-Date: September 14, 2020End of Document

RUBIO URGES THE PRESIDENT TO ADDRESS THREAT POSED BY CHINESE MOBILE APPLICATION QQStates News ServiceSeptember 14, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 549 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) urged President Trump to add QQ a social media and messaging mobile application owned by the same Chinese company as WeChat, Tencent Holdings Ltd to the Executive Order on Addressing the Threat Posed by WeChat."The links between the Chinese government and Communist Party to this high-risk software could not be more pronounced as Tencent's chief executive, Pony Ma, is a member of China's national legislature, the National People's Congress," Rubio wrote. "The identical ownership and similar functions of the two applications highlight the common threats that they pose, including data privacy risks, as well as espionage and censorship at the direction of the Chinese government and Communist Party. I therefore urge you to add QQ to the Executive Order on Addressing the Threat Posed by WeChat."In August, Rubio announced in an op-ed that he would "introduce legislation to create a framework of standards that must be met before a high-risk, foreign-based app is allowed to operate on American telecommunications networks and devices." Additionally, Rubio welcomed two Executive Orders by President Trump to address the national security threat posed by TikTok and WeChat. Last October, Rubio was among the first lawmakers to warn of the danger posed by TikTok when he requested that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) launch a full review of the national security implications of TikTok's acquisition of Musical.ly. This review by CFIUS remains ongoing.The full text of the letter is below.Dear Mr. President:This administration has correctly identified the hazards posed by high-risk Chinese telecommunications hardware and software to America's national and economic security and taken bold actions to counter these threats. One such set of measures was the pair of Executive orders issued on August 6, 2020, related to mobile applications TikTok and WeChat. To build upon these necessary steps, I write to request the addition of the Chinese mobile application, QQ, to the Executive Order on Addressing the Threat Posed by WeChat.QQ is a social media and messaging mobile application owned by the same Chinese company as WeChat, Tencent Holdings Ltd (Tencent). As the Executive order's 45-day deadline approaches, there has been a significant increase in downloads of QQ in the United States. This past May, researchers from the Citizen's Lab at the University of Toronto issued a report finding that Tencent surveilled and censored private messaging on its applications. The links between the Chinese government and Communist Party to this high-risk software could not be more pronounced as Tencent's chief executive, Pony Ma, is a member of China's national legislature, the National People's Congress.The identical ownership and similar functions of the two applications highlight the common threats that they pose, including data privacy risks, as well as espionage and censorship at the direction of the Chinese government and Communist Party. I therefore urge you to add QQ to the Executive Order on Addressing the Threat Posed by WeChat.Thank you for taking this important matter into consideration.Sincerely,Load-Date: September 14, 2020End of Document

RUBIO, MERKLEY, CORNYN, CARDIN RENEW REQUEST FOR FORMAL PUBLIC DETERMINATION ON CHINA'S ATROCITIES IN XINJIANGStates News ServiceOctober 26, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 754 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), John Cornyn (R-TX), and Ben Cardin (D-MD) sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo renewing their request for the State Department to issue a formal determination of whether the atrocities being committed in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) amount to genocide.Earlier this year, Rubio and Merkley were joined by Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Representatives James P. McGovern (D-MA), Christopher Smith (R-NJ) and 73 members of the Senate and the House in sending a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin regarding the ongoing atrocities in the XUAR against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities.Rubio is Cochair of the bipartisan and bicameral Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) and member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.Merkley is a CECC commissioner and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he serves on the Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy.The full text of the letter is below:Dear Secretary Pompeo:We write again with regard to new evidence about systematic and extensive human rights abuses being committed in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) in the People's Republic of China. Analysis of satellite imagery shows that Beijing is expanding its ability to permanently detain ethnic minority populations. More than 380 detention centers and prisons were either newly built or greatly expanded since 2017, demonstrating again that the long-term intent of the Chinese Communist Party is to forcibly assimilate or eliminate Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities.The atrocities being committed in the XUAR require a robust response. In addition to mass internment and forced labor, we wrote you in July about women forced to undergo sterilizations and abortions so the Chinese government can control the family size of ethnic Uyghurs and Kazakhs. Systematic efforts to coercively limit the population of ethnic minority communities is appalling and, along with Beijing's policies of mass internment and forced labor, likely constitute atrocity crimes under U.S. law.It has been long-standing U.S. policy to ensure that Chinese government officials responsible for the coercive enforcement of population control policies are held to account (see 8 U.S.C. 1182e). Given the egregious intent undergirding these policies in the XUAR, we ask that you continue to employ Global Magnitsky sanctions and other measures for any individuals or entities complicit in the implementation of the mass arbitrary internment, forced labor, and coercive population control policies as well as any other human rights abuses.But more than additional sanctions are needed. The United States has made the prevention of genocide and other atrocity crimes a priority though the ratification of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in 1988, and the enactment of the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act (P.L. 115-441). We renew our request for the Department to issue a public determination of whether atrocity crimes are being committed in the XUAR and if these crimes amount to genocide. Doing so will further focus the Administration's resources to address and expose offenses in the XUAR and demonstrate U.S. leadership to the international community.We also ask that the Department focus additional diplomatic resources to encourage the United Nations to take meaningful action. Recently, more than 50 United Nations Special Experts were joined by a global coalition of 321 civil society groups to ask for the creation of an independent human rights mechanism on the Chinese government's systematic and egregious human rights abuses, including in the XUAR. These efforts need consistent and vocal U.S. support to ensure there is global attention and condemnation of the Chinese government's policies.Lastly, the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act (P.L. 116-145) requires a public report on human rights conditions in the XUAR. Given the independent researchers' and journalists' important work on this topic, we ask that the Department consult with them and incorporate that data, along with the government's own research and intelligence collection, into the required report to Congress.We stand ready to assist your efforts to address the Chinese government's egregious human rights abuses.Sincerely,Load-Date: October 26, 2020End of Document

US warned Nevada not to use Chinese COVID tests from UAEAssociated Press State & LocalOctober 15, 2020 Thursday 6:17 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWS; STATE AND REGIONALLength: 980 wordsByline: JON GAMBRELL and MICHELLE L. PRICE, Associated PressDateline: DUBAI, United Arab Emirates BodyDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — U.S. diplomats and security officials privately warned the state of Nevada not to use Chinese-made coronavirus test kits donated by the United Arab Emirates over concerns about patient privacy, test accuracy and Chinese government involvement, documents obtained by The Associated Press show.The documents illustrate how the U.S. government actively — if quietly — tried to keep the state out of a project involving the Chinese firm BGI Group, which is the world’s largest genetic sequencing company and which has expanded its reach during the coronavirus pandemic.U.S. intelligence agencies have warned that foreign powers like China could exploit samples to discover the medical history, illnesses or genetic traits of test takers, though they have not offered any public evidence. Internal emails and documents obtained by the AP from the Nevada governor’s office through a public records request show U.S. authorities expressing such concerns specifically about BGI.“I hope the Nevada COVID-19 task force leadership is aware of this so they can make an educated decision and know some of the U.S. Government’s concerns,” William Puff, a Homeland Security regional attaché at the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi, wrote in an email forwarded to Nevada officials.The warnings from the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department led the office of Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak in April to direct a Nevada hospital not to use any of the donated 250,000 test kits as officials turned down an offered laboratory deal.Geopolitics could play a role in the U.S. warning. President Donald Trump and his administration have been locked in a trade war with China and also have actively lobbied its allies not to use telecommunication equipment from Chinese firm Huawei, for instance, citing security concerns.The donation offer to Nevada also involved a shadowy Emirati company called Group 42, which partnered with Shenzhen-based BGI to create a rapid-testing system in the United Arab Emirates. G42 and government officials in the UAE did not respond to multiple requests for comment.In response to queries from the AP, BGI said in an email that G42 made the donation to Nevada on its own without BGI’s knowledge and that BGI never had direct contact with the state. BGI’s COVID-19 tests have approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use on an emergency basis and are used in some labs in the United States — but “BGI has no access to either patient samples or patient data,” it said.“BGI Group takes all aspects of patient data protection, privacy and ethics extremely seriously, and is committed to full compliance with all applicable regulations in the countries in which it operates,” the company said.G42 and BGI partnered to create a similar lab in Abu Dhabi in March, part of a mass testing campaign in the Emirates that has conducted over 11 million tests in a nation of 9 million people.The UAE proposed building a similar lab in Nevada that would rapidly process samples from polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests. Those genetic tests, using long cotton swabs that collect samples from deep inside a person's nose and throat, can detect an active case of the coronavirus.The unusual offer from the UAE came amid a nationwide shortage of test collection kits in the U.S.In an email sent to Nevada officials on April 20, Puff, the Homeland Security attaché, alleged without offering evidence that G42\u2032s coronavirus tests were “closer to 60% accurate” rather than the 90% claimed by the firm. BGI long has maintained its PCR tests have "high accuracy," though factors like “the sampling process, storage and transportation of samples” can affect results.Puff also raised concerns about the potential risks of Americans sharing their medical samples with BGI.“The embassy has concerns with G42’s relationship with the Chinese government and BGI, and patient privacy concerns,” Puff wrote. “The guidance we received from the U.S. Department of State is we should decline testing from G42.”The Nevada governor’s office quickly responded on the same day to the warnings of Puff and other U.S. officials. Michelle White, the Nevada governor’s chief of staff, wrote in an email that they "highly recommend that you discontinue these tests and any usage of testing equipment immediately.”Sisolak’s office did not respond to phone and email messages from the AP seeking comment.Scott Kerbs, a spokesman for Nevada's University Medical Center, which received the G42 supplies, told the AP that while UMC used 20,000 specimen collection kits offered by G42, the 250,000 kits donated were never used only as they were incompatible with its system.The U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center has warned state health officials about “potential threats posed by foreign powers in connection with COVID tests." That's even as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Chinese tests from BGI and others for use on an emergency basis.The U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi quietly declined an offer by the Emirati government months earlier to conduct free coronavirus testing of its diplomats over its concerns about Chinese involvement. It did not publicize that information either to the estimated 75,000 Americans living in the Emirates.Responding to questions from the AP, the State Department declined to offer any details about its discussions with the Emirati government. The UAE insists all genetic data is being kept private and is not shared with BGI.“The Department shares information with private U.S. citizens abroad regarding safety and security threats that might affect them,” the State Department said. “In this case, the Department did not deem the use of BGI COVID-19 tests to be a threat to safety.”___Price reported from Las Vegas.

ByteDance puts the future of TikTok Global in China's hands and fights Trump in courtCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 24, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 578 wordsBodyThe saga for control of TikTok continues its course amid an obvious confusion that should be clarified by next Sunday. After all, september 27 expires the extension offered by the Department of Commerce last week to ban the download of the popular app on platforms like Apple's App Store or Alphabet's Google Play.Seeing them coming and taking advantage of the time that on Sunday a Federal Judge of a Californian Court froze a similar decision on Tencent-owned WeChat, TikTok has already filed a preliminary court order against the Trump Administration on Wednesday. This legal maneuver aims to protect its services in the US against a possible ban. The application, filed in a District of Columbia Court, thus responds to regulations issued by the Department of Commerce.Meanwhile, ByteDance, the parent company of the popular video app, confirmed Thursday that it has officially presented to Chinese authorities its agreement to partner with Oracle and Walmart to create a new US-based company, named TikTok Global. The company requires a license after Beijing recently imposed new technology export legislation and will need the Chinese government to welcome it before moving forward with the plan announced last week. Gao Feng, spokesman for China's Ministry of Commerce, confirmed Thursday at a press conference that he received Bytedance's request for the export of technology and that it will be managed in accordance with the new regulations.The situation does not provide clarity to an agreement in which the terms remain disparate, especially as regards who will control TikTok Global. ByteDance insists that you will have 80% of the new entity. Americans say they'll control a majority stake. Oracle and Walmart will own only 20% of TikTik Global but it is true that U.S. venture capitalists such as General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital already own 41% of ByteDance.Depending on how you want to calculate the resulting percentages both sides can defend a control of more than 50% of TikTok Global, which has a value of approximately $60 billion and is expected to go on the stock exchange in the coming year if the deal survives.Another important question is who will control TikTok technology. Beijing has prevented ByteDance's algorithms from forming part of the sale. U.S. Homeland Security board members want to ensure not only that U.S. user data is protected on U.S. Oracle servers but also that no data is diverted and that the algorithm is not used to disseminate misinformation or influence trends. The source code is expected to remain in China, but Oracle will have access to it. The functioning of this relationship is still unknown. That's why the deal's still in the air. U.S. Attorney General William Barr and other senior White House officials have not yet approved it and are wary of curbing risks to national security, even though President Donald Trump offered interim support that he subsequently questioned. This shows how even within the US government there are factions confronted with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as the main supporter of the agreement.In China, where the government has not officially stated its views, the local media has been in charge of harshly criticizing this process. Global Times and China Daily publishers are also joined by state news agency Xinhua, which has rated US pressure on ByteDance to sell its popular appas an act of "modern piracy."commentsforum0WhatsApp  Facebook  Twitter  Linkedin       Load-Date: September 25, 2020End of Document

MONGOLIAN SCHOOLS STAY EMPTY AMID ONGOING PROTESTS AS CHINESE POLICE SEEK 'TROUBLEMAKERS'States News ServiceSeptember 3, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1028 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Schools and classrooms remained largely empty across the northern Chinese region of Inner Mongolia on Thursday, amid an ongoing civil disobedience movement protesting plans to end Mongolian-medium teaching in the region's schools.Police began a region-wide operation seeking the leaders of protests and the organizers of school boycotts among the region's 4.2 million ethnic Mongolians.Police in Xing'an League and Ulanhot city were meanwhile out looking for school-age ethnic Mongolian children to force them back into school.Japan-based ethnic Mongolian scholar Khubis said high-school students in Shiliin-Gol League had begun a hunger strike over the plan to end first-grade classes in the Mongolian language."Four students in the third grade of a Mongolian-medium high school in Xilin Gol went on hunger strike [on Sept. 1] to protest the new Chinese language education policy," Khubis told RFA."More than 300 ethnic Mongolian employees of the state-run Inner Mongolia Radio Station signed a petition saying that they could not accept the new Chinese-medium education policy," he said.New editions of Mongolian-language textbooks were found to have had chapters on Mongolians' pride in their homelands and love of their language deleted, while sections in Chinese had been added to the text, Khubis said.Meanwhile, authorities in Urad Middle Banner -- a county-like division -- put out urgent directives ordering all ethnic Mongolian civil servants or public employees to return their children to schools by Sept. 2, or face immediate firing and disciplinary action.Ethnic Mongolian herders said they had seen large numbers of armored personnel carriers on the streets in some areas, while the local government is saying that the protests were "incited by overseas forces."And ethnic Mongolian academic Arichaa said roadblocks have been set up at borders between banners and cities."Many roads between banners and counties have been blocked since Sept. 2," Arichaa said. "At the border between Naiman and Kulun, there have been clashes between parents and police."Social media shut downA mass social media shutdown had made it harder for parents and teachers to coordinate their actions, Arichaa said."Parents and teachers cannot communicate via phone calls, or WeChat," Arichaa said, adding that at least two people had reportedly been detained on suspicion of "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble," a charge often used to target peaceful critics of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.On Sept. 2, police in Kezuohou Banner issued a notice calling on nine people involved in recent protests and class boycotts in Ganqika, Agula, Hailut and Gilgalang townships to turn themselves in.Anyone with information leading to their detention is offered a 1,000 yuan reward.Across the border in the independent country of Mongolia, scholar Chimag said academics had organized a protest in the capital, Ulaanbaatar, outside the Chinese embassy."They were hoping that the Chinese government would reconsider the policy it has started implementing, and restore the old system," Chimag said.Ethnic Mongolian parents from across the region have continued to send video clips to the New York-based Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center (SMHRIC).The group estimated that, on the first day of the new semester on Sept. 1, around 300,000 ethnic Mongolian students had joined the boycott.It said more than 100 people have been listed as wanted by police in Horchin district of Tongliao city, Zaruud Banner, Naiman Banner, Tongliao Development Zone, Horchin Left Wing Middle Banner, and Horchin Left Wing Rear Banner.The posters accuse the people on the list as being suspected of "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble," it said.It said reports had emerged that at least two Mongolian parents have committed suicide in protest at the authorities' extreme pressure to send their children to school."One is a mother and teacher from the Shuluun-huh Banner in Shilin-gol League," SMHRIC said."The other, a father whose wife is a teacher, was forced to send his child to school under tremendous pressure from the authorities in Tongliao."Mongolia and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. Credit: RFA GraphicsDegrading cultural identityIn New York, PEN America said the new education policy "threatens to degrade ethnic Mongolians' language rights and cultural identity."It said the policy, which went into effect this week, would remove Mongolian-language instruction for several key subjects."PEN America is concerned that the new policy ties into larger governmental efforts to push the assimilation of ethnic minorities at the expense of their ability to express their cultural identities," the group said in a statement."This new policy flies in the face of its own commitments under both domestic and international law, to listen to the concerns of Inner Mongolian citizens, and we call on the Chinese government to reverse the policy and re-commit to the observance of minority language rights," James Tager, deputy director of free expression research and policy at PEN America, said in the statement.The group pointed to widespread censorship of news of the protests, with the government shutting down Bainuu, a Mongolian-language social network that once boasted more than 400,000 users."By responding with censorship of their social media posts and targeting of peaceful protesters, the government is only further erasing their voice," Tager said.China's constitution, as well as its Regional Ethnic Autonomy Law, explicitly protect the linguistic rights of ethnic minorities, including guarantees of the freedom of ethnic nationalities to use their own spoken and written language, PEN America said.It said China also has commitments under international law to safeguard minority language rights, including through articles 29(c) and 30 of the Convention of the Rights of the Child, and article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, both of which have China as a signatory.Reported by Qiao Long for RFA's Mandarin Service.

CSIS: TikTok is Running Out of Time - Understanding the CFIUS Decision and Its ImplicationsTargeted News ServiceSeptember 3, 2020 Thursday 9:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2137 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Center for Strategic and International Studies issued the following commentary entitled "TikTok Is Running Out of Time: Understanding the CFIUS Decision and Its Implications". The commentary was co-authored by William Alan Reinsch, senior adviser and chair in international business, and Jack Caporal, associate fellow with the chair in international business, and Patrick Saumell and Isabella Frymoyer, interns with the chair in international business:TikTok is a well-known social media platform that allows users to share short homemade videos. Its popularity in the United States grew rapidly in 2019, one year after its parent company ByteDance, a Chinese company, merged Musical.ly into its existing TikTok app. ByteDance's 2017 purchase of Musical.ly has since faced scrutiny in the United States due to national security concerns. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) opened an investigation in 2019 over the Musical.ly acquisition, and in August President Trump announced plans to ban TikTok if it is not bought by a U.S. company in the fall. TikTok subsequently filed suit against the U.S. government, alleging the ban violates its Fifth Amendment rights.Q1: What's going on with TikTok in the United Sttes?A1: When TikTok became the second-most downloaded app in the United States on Apple's App Store in the fourth quarter of 2019, its widespread use elevated concerns about the possibility of user data being made available to the Chinese government. As the application's popularity grew, it came under multiple U.S. national security investigations.The rapid transition of users from a U.S. platform, Musical.ly, to a Chinese-owned platform, TikTok, raised concerns over Chinese access to U.S. user data. In July 2020, the Federal Trade Commission opened an investigation into whether TikTok violated U.S. privacy law by collecting information about children under the age of 13 without parental permission.That same month, the Trump administration announced it was considering banning the use of TikTok in the United States. Vague explanations were originally given for the decision, such as the move being an effort to protect U.S. citizens' personal data or retaliation over China's handling of coronavirus. Then, in early August, the administration announced it would ban TikTok if the Chinese-owned platform was not sold to U.S. buyers by September 15, using the results of the CFIUS investigation as justification. Buyers quickly emerged. Microsoft has expressed interest in acquiring the platform to expand into social media networks and leverage opportunities to promote its other brands, such as LinkedIn and Xbox. This week, Microsoft and Walmart teamed up on a bid. Twitter is also rumored to have expressed interest in buying the platform, although it is unlikely that it could outbid Microsoft and Walmart. Oracle has joined up with General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital as an alternative to Microsoft.Q2: What is the role of CFIUS?A2: CFIUS is an interagency group that reviews proposed foreign investments in the United States--specifically mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers--to determine whether they threaten U.S. national security. If a CFIUS review finds a threat, the president has the authority to block investment or require mitigating measures, if (1) other U.S. laws are inadequate or inappropriate to protect national security; and (2) there is "credible evidence" of a threat. The presidential determination must occur within 15 days after receiving a report from CFIUS.The 2018 Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) legislation strengthened and modernized the CFIUS process. FIRRMA came into effect on February 13, 2020, broadening the scope of CFIUS to include transactions in which a foreign government has a direct or indirect substantial interest and non-controlling investment in U.S. businesses involved in critical technology, critical infrastructure, or sensitive U.S. personal data. Last, and most relevant to the TikTok case, it included a "sense of Congress" that provides additional factors for CFIUS and the president to consider when reviewing a transaction, including access to "personally identifiable information, genetic information, or other sensitive data on United States citizens . . . that may exploit that information in a manner that threatens national security."Q3: What does the TikTok investigation suggest about CFIUS's approach to data?A3: CFIUS's decision to investigate ByteDance's acquisition of Music.ly would have been unlikely five years ago, but over the last few years, CFIUS has been more willing to get involved in cases concerning potentially sensitive U.S. data. Nonetheless, when ByteDance purchased Musical.ly in 2019, it did not anticipate the purchase would have national security implications and did not submit the transaction to CFIUS. However, CFIUS began an inquiry and eventually a full investigation into the acquisition later that year after U.S. lawmakers called for the panel to look into the deal.CFIUS's decision on TikTok follows a pattern of investigations in which CFIUS has sought to protect U.S. personal information from foreign entities. In 2018, a $1.2 billion deal between MoneyGram and China's Ant Financial was blocked despite a mitigation proposal to assuage concerns over Chinese access to data that could be used to identify U.S. citizens and their transactions. In March 2019, CFIUS ordered Kunlun Tech to divest Grindr over expected concerns about access to personal data such as location, sexual preferences, and HIV status. This trend continued in March when the Trump administration directed Beijing Shiji Information Technology to divest all interests in StayNTouch based on a CFIUS decision. While no official reasons were announced, StayNTouch's handling of travel-related personal information and software tools that leverage ID scanning and facial recognition technology likely raised concerns.One distinction in the TikTok case is the condition that it will not be banned if a sale can be made to a U.S. company by September 15. Previous CFIUS cases forced the termination of deals and divestments from companies despite proposed or adopted mitigating actions.Q4: What are the national security reasons to justify this decision?A4: James Lewis, director of the CSIS Technology Policy Program, recently published a commentary titled "How Scary is TikTok?" in which he outlines the national security charges that the platform is facing. By his estimation, the main security risks with TikTok are (1) Chinese intelligence harvesting and exploiting U.S. personal information; and (2) Chinese influence operations. In his view, neither are serious.The first concern is that Chinese intelligence can exploit users' personal information collected by the platform. TikTok does collect data, but the extent to which that information is passed on to Chinese intelligence is not clear. TikTok obtains information on users from social media, third-party services, and other users of the platform. It also automatically collects usage and device information, location data, messages, metadata, and cookies, as many other apps do. TikTok also previously sought clipboard access to users' phones, which could have exposed passwords. However, this feature is not exclusive to TikTok and is now disabled from the app. Even though there is no evidence of Chinese authorities acquiring the data collected by TikTok, the possibility of it being harvested creates a potential national security risk. However, the Chinese government can request information from all companies operating in China under its Cybersecurity Law of 2017, which creates a risk that sensitive U.S. data held by TikTok could be transferred to Chinese authorities. Chinese corporate actors say there is leeway to negotiate the scope of such requests, although it's not clear how accurate that claim is. Regardless, given that the platform is predominately used by young adults, the majority of TikTok users' data is likely to be of limited value to the Chinese government.TikTok has taken steps to create separation from China. In a bid to avoid Chinese censorship, the app is not available in China (a separate version called Douyin is available to Chinese users). TikTok stores user data in Virginia and Singapore. And TikTok ceased operations in Hong Kong following the adoption of the national security law that led the United States to determine the city lacked the autonomy from China it once had. Despite these moves, CFIUS still found that TikTok presented a risk to U.S. data security and sought action to prevent ByteDance from accessing U.S. users' data.Fears about Chinese access to U.S. data are not unfounded. China has shown a clear interest in collecting U.S. data, proven by the 2015 OPM hack, the 2017 Equifax hack, and the Marriot hack from 2014 to 2018. While data obtained from TikTok would not be as targeted as the information collected in these hacks, it would still have potential utility for Chinese intelligence. TikTok data could be exploited in the future for U.S. citizens that become government employees or private sector employees working on sensitive topics. Collected data also could be used to develop profiles on Americans for microtargeting information, as seen in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.The second reason TikTok is being scrutinized is its potential to be used in Chinese influence operations, either through propaganda or censorship. TikTok's parent company ByteDance has previously collaborated with the Chinese government. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute found that Douyin, ByteDance's TikTok equivalent for Chinese users, is used to disseminate state propaganda. However, there currently are no accusations of non-domestic applications, like TikTok, being used to spread Chinese state messaging. These techniques are also unlikely to be effective among U.S. teens given the missteps of previous Chinese influence operations.The charge against Chinese censorship has more evidence. Like other digital platforms, TikTok must abide by the free speech or censorship laws in the country of operation. The United States has restrictions on limitation of free speech; however, private social media companies can police content on their sites. There is concern that TikTok is blocking politically sensitive content because of influence from the Chinese government rather than violations of its terms of service, which would be illegal under U.S. law. TikTok claims it "does not remove content based on sensitivities related to China." Recently, however, an American account that condemned the detention of Uyghur Muslims in China was suspended. TikTok claimed the account was suspended because of a prior post. Still, there are other examples of content moderation that warrant scrutiny of TikTok's content removal policy, such as the lack of videos on the platform showing the Hong Kong protests.Q5: What are the larger implications for this ban on the U.S.-China technology relationship?A5: Historically, the United States has acted as a foil to the Chinese government's heavy-handed control of its citizens' speech. However, by walling off data transfers to a single country on national security grounds, the United States risks setting a precedent that could be adopted by other countries to limit data flows from the United States or require data localization. For example, India is debating a data protection bill that would require local storage and processing of Indian data. In justifying the legislation, Indian officials have cited Senator Josh Hawley's (R-MO) declarations supporting data security to prove the need for data localization. This is despite the fact that data localization undermines security and creates an expensive obstacle for businesses to overcome.Furthermore, with the United States tightening restrictions on Chinese companies, tech giants like Tencent and Alibaba will be less likely to target U.S. markets when expanding overseas. Chinese companies operating in the United States are already being forced to adopt strategies such as divesting assets, adjusting government data storage, and limiting themselves to minority stakes in investments. These tactics are also being used by U.S. companies operating in China. This trend suggests that two separate technology spheres are developing as both the United States and China seek to spread influence but must deal with increasing regulation. The European Union's evolving approach to data regulation may create a third sphere. Three separate data spheres, all with different rules, prohibitions, exceptions, and frameworks, will also be costly for global innovation and business.[Category: Political]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7224933 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 3, 2020End of Document

The former researcher at the Hong Kong School of Public Health told Fox News host Tucker Carlson Tuesday night that China does not want “people to know this truth.”Twitter declined to provide a comment to the Daily Caller News Foundation. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Majority Of Intelligence Community Agencies Believe Coronavirus Leaked Out Of Wuhan Lab, Senior Intel Official Says)Yan released a paper Monday that she claims shows how the virus could have been “conveniently created” in a lab over the course of six months. The paper, released on open-access repository website Zenote, lays out how “SARS-CoV-2 shows biological characteristics that are inconsistent with a naturally occurring, zoonotic virus.”“So, together with my experience, I can tell you, this is created in the lab ... and also, it is spread to the world to make such damage,” Yan told Carlson before detailing her credentials. She worked at the World Health Organization reference lab in the University of Hong Kong, “which is the top coronavirus lab in the world,” Yan said.Link to ImageDr. Li-Meng Yan on Fox News with Tucker Carlson. (Fox News screenshot)Yan told Fox News in July that Chinese government was aware of the novel virus well before it claimed it did.Many scientists dismiss the claim that the virus was created in a lab. Researchers in California, for instance, published an article in the journal Nature in March mapping out the virus' genetic sequence, which they say proves that COVID-19 evolved naturally. “Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,” the researchers wrote.The virus evolved naturally to bind to human cells in a much more effective way than anything scientists could have developed in a lab, the researchers said. Computer models are not very good at helping the virus bind to human cells, the study said, citing simulations researchers conducted in a lab setting.Fox News White House reporter John Roberts reported in a May 2 tweet that a senior intelligence source told him that “there is agreement among most of the 17 Intelligence agencies that COVID-19 originated in the Wuhan lab.”“The source stressed that the release is believed to be a MISTAKE, and was not intentional,” Roberts wrote.U.S. officials believe the virus originated in Wuhan, China, in late December before spreading to the United States. Some experts have also speculated that the virus emanated from the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, a so-called wet market where vendors sell live animals for consumption.Twitter rolled out a policy in May providing warning messages on some tweets containing disputed or misleading information about the pandemic.Moderators filter such content through three categories: misleading information, disputed claims and unverified claims, Twitter noted. Misleading information will carry a label or be outright removed, depending on the severity of the content, while unverified claims will not have any action taken against them. Disputed claims will contain a label or a warning.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Trump Administration to Ban Use of WeChat, Downloads of TikTok on SundayUSNEWS.comSeptember 18, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; National News; Vol.; No.Length: 744 wordsByline: Claire HansenHighlight: WeChat users will be most affected immediately, while the executive actions are also likely to shape details of a new deal between Oracle and TikTok's Chinese parent company.BodyThe Trump administration will effectively ban the download and use of the Chinese-owned messaging app WeChat on Sunday, citing concerns about data privacy and national security. The U.S. at the same time will bar the download and maintenance of TikTok, the hugely popular social media app, because of similar security concerns. A total ban on TikTok is planned for Nov. 12 but may be averted if a deal between U.S.-owned Oracle and TikTok's parent company results in the implementation of data safeguards, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business Network on Friday. [MORE:Global Image of the U.S. Plummets]The actions mark the latest in the Trump administration's ongoing fight with the Chinese technology companies that own the apps and are likely to shape the details of the new deal between Oracle and TikTok. President Donald Trump has painted himself as being "tough" on China, making that approach one of the core tenets of his presidency and, now, his reelection campaign. WeChat users will for now be most affected by the actions. The app is widely used in the U.S. by Chinese-Americans, immigrants and others to stay connected with each other as well as with family and friends in China. The app has about 19 million daily active users in the U.S., according to analytics firm Apptopia, and more than a billion users in China. In addition to messaging services, it also has social media and payment functions. The Trump administration has repeatedly raised concerns about the collection of data by both apps and the possibility that that data could be accessed and used by the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party. "While the threats posed by WeChat and TikTok are not identical, they are similar. Each collects vast swaths of data from users, including network activity, location data, and browsing and search histories. Each is an active participant in China's civil-military fusion and is subject to mandatory cooperation with the intelligence services of the CCP. This combination results in the use of WeChat and TikTok creating unacceptable risks to our national security," Ross said in a statement Friday. Lawmakers have also raised concerns about TikTok over issues including censorship, data collection and children's privacy. TikTok has about 100 million monthly active users in the U.S., according to the company, which has denied charges that it poses a security threat and insisted that it would never share American users' data with the Chinese government. The company has also stressed that data collected from users in the U.S. is stored on servers in the U.S. and Singapore, and not in China. The company has also argued that it collects less personal data from users than some U.S.-based tech companies like Facebook and Google. The U.S. will specifically ban "any provision of service to distribute or maintain" either TikTok or WeChat on Sunday, and will also bar all fund transfers and payment services on the WeChat app. Sunday's effective ban on WeChat comes in the form of a prohibition on internet hosting services that allow the app to function, as well as the prohibition of "any utilization of the mobile application's constituent code, functions, or services in the functioning of software or services developed and/or accessible within the U.S." A similar ban on TikTok looms unless certain data provisions are implemented. Trump first announced in August that TikTok would be banned unless its U.S. operations were acquired by an American company. A number of bidders, including Microsoft and Oracle, entered into discussions with ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, about a deal. Oracle on Monday announced that it had won the bid, but details of the agreement are sketchy. The company said it has been chosen as TikTok's "trusted technology partner" but did not mention a sale or acquisition. Claire Hansen is a staff writer who covers immigration, gun policy and marijuana policy, as well as general news.

Federal Lawsuit Claims Yahoo Management's Secret Pact with China Supported Torture, Imprisonment of Pro-Democracy ActivistsPR NewswireSeptember 2, 2020 Wednesday 11:10 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 778 wordsDateline: SAN JOSE, Calif., Sept. 2, 2020 BodyPR Newswire Attorneys for renowned Chinese activist Ning Xianhua have filed a federal lawsuit alleging that Yahoo Inc. founder Jerry Yang and CEO Terry Semel provided Mr. Ning's Yahoo emails to Chinese authorities in a joint effort to silence pro-democracy dissidents in China and to aid Mr. Ning's capture, imprisonment, and torture by Chinese government officials. Yahoo's successor companies, Oath Holdings, a division of Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) and Altaba Inc. (NASDAQ: AABA) are also named as defendants in the case.According to the lawsuit, Mr. Ning, a survivor of the Tiananmen Square massacre, used his Yahoo email account to "privately spread pro-democracy messages and publications, coordinating with other activists through communications he believed to be secure."The lawsuit alleges Yahoo enabled the Chinese communist regime to monitor Chinese citizens' private emails, including correspondence between Mr. Ning and U.S. residents, through a series of confidential agreements between Yahoo management in California and the Chinese government. In return, the Chinese government provided the company with commercial access to more than 100 million Chinese internet users and the possibility of enormous profits.Based on pro-democracy messages in emails disclosed to Chinese authorities, Mr. Ning was arrested on charges of subversion and subjected to extreme physical and mental abuse, documented in detail in the filing – both prior to and during his seven-year prison term that began in 2004. After his release, Mr. Ning suffered additional arrest and torture, leading him to escape from China in 2016 and receive asylum in the United States. Mr. Ning now lives in New York City, but due to his limited English proficiency and physical injuries he suffered during his detention and torture, he depends on others in the Chinese community for his basic needs."The Yahoo Defendants have always concealed and never disclosed that they provided PRC (People's Republic of China) officials with information that led to Mr. Ning's arbitrary arrest and conviction, inhumane torture, and resulting permanent injuries," the filing states. "Mr. Ning hopes that, through this lawsuit, the Yahoo Defendants are finally made to answer for the torture and injuries befalling Mr. Ning as a result of their misconduct."The lawsuit alleges claims under the Alien Tort Claims Act, which allows foreign nationals to seek remedies in U.S. courts for human rights violations committed outside the United States with the assistance and knowledge of domestic companies. The filing further alleges violations of the federal Torture Victims Protection Act, which provides a civil remedy against anyone who conspires in the torture or extrajudicial killing of individuals in foreign countries."The documented collusion between a U.S. company and a communist regime is appalling, and the resulting torture of Chinese citizens is gut-wrenching," says famed trial lawyer Mark Lanier of Houston's The Lanier Law Firm, who is co-counsel for Mr. Ning. "We have a respected, global corporation knowingly condoning these violations, all in the name of corporate profits.""Mr. Ning's human rights were cruelly violated by Yahoo's secret actions with Chinese authorities," says Paul L. Hoffman, co-counsel for Mr. Ning and partner in the Los Angeles-based firm of Schonbrun Seplow Harris Hoffman & Zeldes LLP.  "U.S. law forbids this kind of complicity in these egregious human rights violations. We are proud to represent Mr. Ning in seeking the justice he deserves under U.S. and international law."The lawsuit isNing Xianhua v. Oath Holdings Inc., f/k/a Yahoo! Inc. et al,filed in United States District Court in San Jose.About the Lanier Law FirmFor more than 30 years, the men and women at The Lanier Law Firm have worked tirelessly, throughout the United States, to find unique and effective solutions for their clients.

U.S. banned Chinese imports made from forced labourCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 14, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 414 wordsBodySince Monday, the United States banned imports of certain Chinese products originating in Xinjiang Province, with a Muslim population, on the grounds that they are made of forced labour.The U.S. Department of Homeland Security. (DHS) reported in a statement that the Customs and Border Protection Office issued five WRO orders, which is a figure employed by Washington to prohibit imports of goods it considers to be the result of forced labour.In the note, DHS explains that the Chinese products subject to these five orders "were produced by state-sponsored (Chinese) forced labour in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, where the Chinese government is involved in systematic human rights abuses against the Uighur peopleand other ethnic and religious minorities.""Adopting this action, DHS is fighting illegal and inhuman forced labour, a type of modern slavery, used to make goods that the Chinese government is trying to import into the U.S.," said DHS undersecretary-in-office Ken Cuccinelli.The orders affect computer equipment, hair products, cotton and clothing,supposedly manufactured in internment camps and in prisons in Xinjiang.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stressed in another statement that this measure "demonstrates that the world will not tolerate human rights abuses by China against Uighurs and members of other minority Muslim groups, including subjecting individuals to forced labour and taking themaway from their freedom."Washington estimates that more than one million Uighurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and other members of Muslim minorities were detained by the Chinese government in internment camps in Xinjiang, where they could have been abused and tortured.On the other hand, the State Department lowered travel recommendations to China on Monday from level 4 to level 3.In this way, the U.S. authorities go from recommending that their citizens not travel to the Asian country "because of the overall impact of COVID-19" to "reconsidering travel to China, including the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region," due to the pandemic and "arbitrary enforcementof local laws."The pandemic, which US President Donald Trump blames china for - often refers to the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus"- has strained relations between Washington and Beijing.On 31 January, the representative banned travelers from China from entering the US, a move he later applied to travellers from the European Schengen area, to prevent the expansion of the pandemic.Source: EFEAfgLoad-Date: September 15, 2020End of Document

Trump administration cracks down on Chinese imports linked to enslaved laborUPISeptember 14, 2020 Monday 5:43 PM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 631 wordsByline: JEAN LOTUSDateline: Sept. 14 BodyThe Trump administration announced Monday that U.S. customs agents would temporarily seize imports of hair products, clothing, cotton and computer parts from Chinese companies determined to use enslaved labor from the Uyghur Autonomous Region.The U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued five withhold release orders to delay importing of products from businesses identified as using state-sponsored forced labor in areas where the Chinese government is "engaged in systemic human rights abuses against the Uyghur people and other ethnic and religious minorities," the agency said."DHS is combating illegal and inhumane forced labor, a type of modern slavery, used to make goods that the Chinese government then tries to import into the United States," Ken Cuccinelli, acting DHS deputy secretary, said in a statement. "When China attempts to import these goods into our supply chains, it also disadvantages American workers and businesses," Cuccinelli added.The order included products made in Lop County in Xinjiang at so-called vocational schools, which the U.S. government labeled as highly coercive re-education internment camps where unfree workers live under duress and their movements are restricted.Textiles, clothing and cotton from Yili Zhuowan Garment Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Baoding LYSZD Trade and Business Co. and Xinjiang Junggar Cotton and Linen Co., Ltd. were identified as using convict or forced labor where workers were employed under "intimidation and threats, withholding of wages, and abusive working and living conditions."Computer parts from Hefei Bitland Information Technology Co., Ltd. in Anhui, were also identified as being manufactured by workers in abusive conditions, the federal government said.A withhold release status from Customs and Border Patrol gives companies three months to document that their goods pass an audit report of the supply chain, showing that merchandise was not made with forced labor. Customs agents will hold the goods until the paperwork is approved, according to the department's protocol.The Commerce Department in July announced that computer manufacturer Hefei Bitland was one of 11 Chinese companies implicated in human rights abuses.Hefei Bitland identified corporate partners on its website including Google, HP, Haier, iFlytek and Lenovo, the New York Times reported. Restrictions on imports of computer parts are in part to blame for laptop shortages in some school districts, the Raleigh, N.C., News Observer reported.The agency identified companies that worked with the Chinese government to collect involuntary biometric data, including DNA analysis targeting Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang and used forced labor, Wilbur Ross, U.S. secretary of commerce said."Beijing actively promotes the reprehensible practice of forced labor and abusive DNA collection and analysis schemes to repress its citizens," Ross said.Since 2016, 14 Chinese companies have been flagged by the Commerce Department for using enslaved labor.The Trump administration threatened to ban all Chinese imports of cotton and tomatoes last week, but U.S. agricultural interests worried that China would retaliate with trade restrictions, The New York Times reported.In August, the AFL-CIO, ACLU and other civil rights groups filed petitions urging a crackdown on all garments and cotton imports originating in Xinjiang.Brands such as Adidas, Calvin Klein, Carter's, Gap, Hart Schafner Marx, H&amp;M, Nike, Tommy Hilfiger and Victoria's Secret were identified in a list of 83 buyers that worked with factories identified with enslaved labor."The system of forced labor is so extensive that there is reason to believe that most cotton-based products linked to the Uyghur Region are a product wholly or in part of forced labor," one petition said.Load-Date: September 14, 2020End of Document

Internet Governance Project: China's Data Security Initiative - Still Stuck in the Sovereignty BoxTargeted News ServiceSeptember 17, 2020 Thursday 9:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1011 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: ATLANTA, Georgia BodyThe Internet Governance Project issued the following article:The Trump administration has unleashed a number of aggressive actions blocking China from access to those parts of the transnational digital economy anchored in the United States. These actions are based on the premise that exposure to Chinese ICT products and services are national security threats, because China's Communist government will exploit them to access data about American users and networks.On September 8, China issued a response. It is an 8-part data security framework that, Beijing claims, is designed to balance "an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for mutual benefit" with national governments' "responsibility and right to ensure the security of important data and personal information bearing on their national security, economic security, and social stability."In some ways the response is promising. It is diplomatic. The Chinese are not targeting exposed American companies such as Apple or Microsoft in the same way that the U.S. is targeting Huawei, WeChat and ByteDance. Verbally, at least, the Chinese are promoting multilateral cooperation in the pursuit of data security rather than unilateral tit-for-tat actions and reactions. The framework recognizes many commonly held cyber norms in the West, such as the idea that "ICT ...providers should not install backdoors in their products and services to illegally obtain users' data, control or manipulate users' systems and devices."The reassuring words of the framework, however, only create an illusion of potential comity. They paper over the structural contradiction between the anarchic system of territorial sovereignty and an internet economy that thrives precisely because it ignores territorial boundaries. While it recognizes data governance as a problem requiring a global solution, it is so deeply rooted in sovereignty that it cannot get us out of the deepening hole we are currently in. Indeed, China's mercantilist policies in the digital economy helped to dig the hole.The eight elements of China's proposed framework are listed below, at the end of this piece.Note first how the Chinese framework repeatedly refers to data as something that belongs to states. The Chinese framework is based on the idea that data security is a collective right safeguarded by states, as opposed to individual rights of users safeguarded by contracts with service providers or globally applicable human rights protections recognized by states. Therefore, states' claims of national security can always override any agreements between ICT product and service providers and their customers. As long as personal data is perceived as a "national resource" over which states exercise territorial sovereignty, we will remain stuck in the box we are currently in, as the world's two biggest internet economies view each other with mistrust because they are geopolitical and military rivals. This means that China's data security framework cannot move the world out of its current predicament.Item #1 calls for "an open, secure and stable supply chain of global ICT products and services," but China has translated "secure supply chain" to mean "domestically owned" in the case of cloud services and other areas, and now the US is doing the same thing. The result? A breakdown of global supply chains.Item #3's admonition not to engage in "unauthorized collection of personal information" is honored mainly in the breach by the Chinese and U.S. governments. China's numerous breach-producing APTs are still highly active, and the U.S. is not about to give up the NSA's formidable capabilities for mass surveillance (of, mostly, foreigners).Item #5 says "States ... shall not obtain data located in other States through companies or individuals without other States' permission." A fine norm if one is wedded to the sovereigntist framework, but the Americans don't trust China to adhere to it, and vice-versa.Global Initiative on Data Security* States should handle data security in a comprehensive, objective and evidence-based manner, and maintain an open, secure and stable supply chain of global ICT products and services.* States should stand against ICT activities that impair or steal important data of other States' critical infrastructure, or use the data to conduct activities that undermine other States' national security and public interests.* States should take actions to prevent and put an end to activities that jeopardize personal information through the use of ICTs, and oppose mass surveillance against other States and unauthorized collection of personal information of other States with ICTs as a tool.* States should encourage companies to abide by laws and regulations of the State where they operate. States should not request domestic companies to store data generated and obtained overseas in their own territory.* States should respect the sovereignty, jurisdiction and governance of data of other States, and shall not obtain data located in other States through companies or individuals without other States' permission.* Should States need to obtain overseas data out of law enforcement requirement such as combating crimes, they should do it through judicial assistance or other relevant multilateral and bilateral agreements. Any bilateral data access agreement between two States should not infringe upon the judicial sovereignty and data security of a third State.* ICT products and services providers should not install backdoors in their products and services to illegally obtain users' data, control or manipulate users' systems and devices.* ICT companies should not seek illegitimate interests by taking advantage of users' dependence on their products, nor force users to upgrade their systems and devices. Products providers should make a commitment to notifying their cooperation partners and users of serious vulnerabilities in their products in a timely fashion and offering remedies.[Category: Computer Technology]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7236226 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 17, 2020End of Document

They'll each give brief opening remarks and then we'll move into a question and answer session.And before going to that, I do want to, you know, run you through how the question and answer session will work. You know, if you want to ask a question feel free to we want to see a conversation, so feel free to shoot me chat directly. There's also a form on the event page that you can ask a question. I'll be moderating that throughout the event. I'll also send that Google form to the chat, so that you all have easy access to it. And depending on time, we also can open it up to a broader open discussion.So without further ado I'd like to introduce our two speakers today. Starting us off will be Bonnie Glaser. She's a senior adviser for Asia and director of the CSIS China Power Project. And she'll be followed by Michael Green. He's the senior vice president for Asia at CSIS, and our Japan chair as well. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bonnie.Bonnie S. Glaser: Well, thank you, Caleb. And thanks to all of you for joining the call today. I want to start with just a couple of points about the context of the taskforce report that we will be releasing today. In the past decades there's obviously been some very critical changes in the security environment around Taiwan that have implications for U.S. interests. The cross-strait military balance has shifted in favor of the PRC decisively. The PLA has made steady progress in its buildup of capabilities against Taiwan and its development of anti-access/area denial capabilities that are aimed at increasing the cost for the U.S. of intervening to defend Taiwan in a crisis. And both of these trends have led to an erosion of deterrence across the Taiwan Strait.Earlier this year, of course, China imposed national security legislation on Hong Kong, denying its people of the freedoms that they were guaranteed under the Sino-British arrangements. And there's growing concern that Taiwan could be Beijing's next target. Taiwan is also facing very serious gray zone challenges of hybrid threats from China. And these include frequent air and naval operations by the PLA in close proximity to Taiwan, including flights across the center line and circumnavigating the island. There's poaching of Taiwan's diplomatic allies, denying Taiwan any form of participation in the international community. Disinformation has become a very big problem. Cyberattacks are constant. And there's warnings by the PRC to other countries to limit their interaction with Taiwan. So real efforts at isolating Taiwan.There's also, of course, been a crucial and I would say likely enduring shift in U.S. strategy. Strategic competition with China has become a central focus of U.S. strategy. And I believe this will continue to be the central focus regardless of the outcome of the election. And that's something my colleague Mike Green will talk more about. And finally, American attitudes toward China have become increasingly negative, and attitudes towards Taiwan are becoming more positive. There's been some really interesting polling data that has come out lately from Chicago Council on Global Affairs and Pew. But we at CSIS have also conducted a poll which we rolled out a week ago. We found that 54 percent of Americans seen China as the country that poses the greatest challenge to the U.S. And Russia was a distant second, at only 22 percent.So against this background, we decided that it as timely to assess the efficacy of longstanding U.S. policy and the policy framework toward Taiwan. So last January, CSIS established a taskforce with the goal of discussing various components of the U.S. bilateral relationship with Taiwan, and our policy approach toward Taiwan, and considering what changes might be made going forward. Our bipartisan taskforce has 16 members, includes senior officials from previous administrations, as well as experts on business, trade, technology, law, national security, and human rights. And my colleague Mike Green and I, along with Richard Bush from the Brookings Institution, are the co-chairs. We will be making that report public today.A core premise of our taskforce was that American interests require that Taiwan remains a secure, stable, healthy, resilient, prosperous, and innovative democratic society that is free from predation and coercion. And it's also, of course, in U.S. interests that Taiwan remains integrated into the global economy and the international community and continues to serve as a provider of global public goods.Our report is divided into several chapters. It examines the different components of U.S. policy. It looks at economics and technology, defense and security, bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, international organizations and Congress. And each of these sections assesses trends as well as problems and opportunities.The report contains numerous actionable policy recommendations in each of these categories, and they're designed to be targeted and specific so that the incoming administration can make immediate use of them. And I'm just going to talk briefly about a few of those recommendations.We endorse negotiating a free trade agreement with Taiwan. And in doing so, we are joining a chorus of experts and a majority of U.S. senators who recently wrote a letter to USTR Bob Lighthizer. Taiwan's economic wellbeing is inseparable from its security. The Trump administration has provided strong support for Taiwan in a number of areas, but there hasn't been a single bilateral meeting to discuss negotiating trade agreements.President Tsai Ing-wen has taken a politically courageous step, expanding expending, excuse me precious political capital in announcing a unilateral lifting of restrictions on the import of U.S. beef and pork. A U.S. response is warranted, and we believe that we should negotiate a free trade agreement.Second, Taiwan plays a critical role in global supply chains, especially information and communications technology. We advocate bringing Taiwan into plurilateral discussions on export controls, cybersecurity, and IT supply chains that the United States is already holding with other like-minded partners like Australia and Japan.Third, regarding Taiwan's role in international organizations, the U.S. should strengthen coalitions with some of these like-minded countries and take joint actions aimed at expanding Taiwan's participation in key international organizations. We recommend that the G-7 issue a joint statement supporting Taiwan's reinstatement as an observer to the World Health Assembly. Taiwan's performance in controlling the spread of COVID-19 is exemplary. There have been 543 cases and seven deaths to date. Taiwan has earned a seat at the table in the World Health Assembly.In the security realm, the next administration should undertake a high-level interagency comprehensive review of Taiwan's security. And this includes PRC intentions and capabilities. And based on that review, along with Taiwan, we should develop a new set of tools to strengthen deterrence and better shape the policy of PRC leaders. This includes, of course, upgrading U.S. military capabilities and improving diplomatic and military channels to communicate U.S. intentions in a crisis to PRC leaders.We also propose that the U.S. launch a Pacific defense excuse me a Pacific deterrence initiative. This would be an analog to the European defense deterrence initiative to fund a set of responses to address the eroding military balance in the region.There are many more actionable policy recommendations that we make in the report. I've just mentioned a few. I'm going to turn the floor over to my colleague Mike Green, who is going to talk a bit about how a second Trump administration or a Biden administration might respond to these recommendations.Michael J. Green: Thank you, Bonnie, and thank you all for joining us.You know, when think tanks put out a task-force report like this, often the temptation is to go for a moonshot, some big headline like sign a security treaty with India or pull out of NATO. That's not where U.S.-Taiwan cooperation is these days or where the politics of Taiwan are.This is a task-force report put together by a group, bipartisan group, that has worked on Asia policy, Taiwan policy, trade and defense policy, for 30-40 years. And it's really more of a blueprint, and we think a blueprint that either a Biden or a second Trump administration would find itself quite comfortable implementing.And the reason we're in that moment now with Taiwan is because there is this bipartisan consensus that has emerged. I was the senior director and special assistant to President Bush for Asia in the 2003/4/5 time period, and we had enormous polarization over Taiwan policy in the U.S. And in the '90s late '90s I worked in the Pentagon and there were huge divisions within the Clinton administration, between the Clinton administration and Congress over Taiwan. You could pretty much pick out in think tanks, you know, who was pro-Taiwan and who was pro-China. Those days are largely behind us.The support for Taiwan in the Congress is very broad and very bipartisan. As you can see from the makeup of our task force, this is a range of experts across different ideological parts of the spectrum, different functional areas from trade to defense to diplomacy and law. And there's a broad consensus this group that reflects the consensus, I think, in the country that we have a stake in Taiwan's success.And Bonnie referenced the survey we did at CSIS that we published last week. It's a very large survey in Europe, Asia, and the United States of experts and the general public. We asked thought leaders in the United States about 450 leaders in education, national security, human rights, labor, business, ag we asked we asked, how much risk should the United States be willing to take to defend allies if they're threatened by China? And 10 on a scale of one to 10, 10 was the highest level of risk. The mean for our security-treaty allies Japan, Korea, Australia was about nine; but for Taiwan it was eight, which is very high. And I think this and across all sectors, by the way: agriculture, labor, Republicans, Democrats. And I think this shows you that certainly thought leaders, and I think the public probably as well, realizes what's at stake with Taiwan.And we touched on it in the report, but I think to put a finer point on it, I think Congress thought leaders in industry, and think tanks, and the private sector, the Congress have seen a couple of things that are really quite striking this past year.The Hong Kong national security act and the crackdown in Hong Kong happened as Taiwan was having an open, free, and fair election, and an election where the evidence is very compelling that China tried to do the kind of interference attacks on social media that the Russians did to us. The Chinese are experimenting on the most aggressive forms of election interference in Taiwan. And so Taiwan, you know, is in the frontlines of democracy, which is clearly a theme for President Biden's campaign and clearly something in our polls that Americans care about.Then we saw Taiwan's performance on COVID-19. As Beijing was covering up what happened in Wuhan and then very aggressively with wolf warrior diplomacy demanding praise around the world for its efforts, Taiwan pretty quietly did an outstanding job on COVID.And then the other factor is Tsai Ing-wen herself. President Tsai, though she comes from the DPP, which is a party that has traditionally supported independence from China which if, of course, very, very controversial she has been extremely careful and extremely consistent in her cross-straits policy, in her relations with the U.S. to make sure she is not the source of problems; that she is a source of reliability/stability. And this has had an effect. This report would have been very hard to write and achieve this level of consensus in this blueprint for action with Taiwan 10 years ago or 15 years ago, either under a Ma Ying-jeou or a Chen Shui-bian government. Those governments polarized the U.S. debate in different ways. President Tsai's government has made a compelling case the Americans that Americans support Taiwan across 90 percent of people who watch Taiwan, very broad. And so this was a report and a blueprint that was possible because, I think, of Tsai Ing-wen's leadership right now.The recommendations are actionable. The bilateral investment treaty is probably the biggest lift for the next administration, but a bilateral investment treaty is not it's not TPP. It doesn't require the kind of tariff-lowering that creates problems politically on the Hill these days with some members of Congress from some districts. And while quite a few members of Congress would oppose a bilateral investment treaty with China because they don't want China's investment in the U.S. and they don't want U.S. offshoring to China, Taiwan is different. Taiwan manufacturing is welcome in the U.S. And Taiwan is a safe rule of law destination for American investment. So a BIT I think is doable.Other aspects of our recommendations will come more naturally with a Biden administration than Trump administration, but one thing that we think is critical is to capitalize on the growing support for Taiwan outside of the U.S. and Japan two countries that have traditionally had very, very warm ties with Taipei. You can see this in Europe. And you can see this in Australia and in India. You can see how China's coercion, 360 degrees, is increasing sympathy and support for Taiwan. And so that's a transatlantic dialogue. That's something a Trump II administration, if it's serious about Taiwan, will have to bring to relations with Europe.Europe is not irrelevant to our China problem. And the compete state of disrepair in U.S.-NATO and U.S.-transatlantic relations right now is a problem for our China policy and for Taiwan. But a Biden administration also, while I'm quite confident would be uniformly supportive of Taiwan, has to be a little bit conscious of some of the history of the Democratic Party. In our CSIS survey we asked around the world which candidate would be better at dealing with China. And Joe Biden won by a wide margin everywhere, especially Europe.Indian and Vietnamese experts said Donald Trump would be better. Taiwan chose Biden experts chose Biden, but it was very close. So I think a Biden administration also needs to be conscious of some of the history of the Democratic Party in earlier periods of U.S.-China relations. But that's mostly impression. I think in fact the support for Taiwan is so strong and so bipartisan that there's no substantive problem. But impressions do matter a bit.And finally, I'll end with this issue, which we didn't take a firm position on. We left it open for further discussion and debate. And that's the question Richard Haass of Council on Foreign Relations has raised when he proposes that the U.S. should end strategic ambiguity, that we should say clearly that the U.S. will defend Taiwan. I think Bonnie and I, and pretty much everyone on our panel, thought that is a bridge too far. The problem with strategic clarity is, number one, you don't know it's fine with Tsai Ing-wen. You don't know who's coming in the future (laughs) in Taiwan politics, who might take advantage of that in ways that are not helpful.But I would argue even more to the point if we want to dissuade China from coercion against Taiwan, we need to not only demonstrate that the U.S. will support Taiwan militarily, we need to demonstrate there will be costs to China in its relations with Europe, and Japan, and other countries. And if the U.S. takes a strategic clarity position, we make it harder to build that multinational support for Taiwan. But I do think and we do recommend in our report we look at ways to ramp up our declaratory support for Taiwan, to make it clear that Chinese coercion, which is more and more evident in the Himalayan Mountains, and the South China Sea, and the East China Sea with Japan, in Hong Kong we make it we need to make it more evident that there will be consequences.And so in the Bush administration we stated that we opposed unilateral efforts to change the status quo by either side Taipei or Beijing. It seems to me, in my view, that's the basis for a new statement that we will actively oppose efforts to unilaterally change the status quo. And right now those are coming primarily in the form of coercion from China. But this is something that really has to come from the mouth of the secretary of state, national security advisor, somebody senior in the next administration. And we can script it, but we left open a debate about that and described the parameters and the pros and cons of different approaches.So we think it's an actionable set of recommendations. And I suspect you'll see a lot of these things happening. And it will be good for Taiwan. It will be good for Asia. And it will be good for the world. So I'll end with that. And Bonnie and I welcome your questions. Thank you.Caleb Diamond: Thank you, all. And I think at this point we can move into the question and answer session.(Gives queuing instructions.)And while people are queuing up, I do see there are two a few questions while our speakers were delivering their opening remarks. So let me turn to those first.So I guess the first question received is: In the present situation, if China invades Taiwan, will the United States you know, is there enough political support for Taiwan on Capitol Hill that the U.S. will be really able to provide direct support to Taiwan? And does the Department of Defense have the capabilities to protect Taiwan in a you know, in the instance of a Chinese invasion?Bonnie S. Glaser: Well, maybe I'll start by saying that there is more support today for Taiwan on Capitol Hill than we've ever seen, and there's always been for decades significant support for Taiwan. But today that has that has reached a new high. And part of it is concern about China and China's actions that are undermining democracies worldwide, but certainly also its pressure on Taiwan. So I think that congressional support would definitely be there.And as Mike has talked about, I think American support would be there as well. It always matters what the contingencies are, but as Mike already discussed we don't see any scenario in which in the near future Taiwan is going to be taking an action that will be seen as somehow reasonably provocative toward Beijing. So this is if it were to happen, it would likely be instigated by China.There's been a lot of discussion recently about how the United States needs to bolster its capabilities. This was one of my arguments in my rebuttal, which I published in Foreign Affairs, to Richard Haass' paper. And I think Mike Mazarr was another one who addressed this issue in his rebuttal. There needs to be, certainly, a bolstering of U.S. capabilities to intervene. That doesn't mean that the U.S. is going to be intimidated and deterred from intervening if that fight were to were to happen tomorrow, but the Chinese have made significant progress in their capabilities to impose costs on the U.S. should it should it choose to intervene.Now, I'd, finally, say that we need to appreciate how difficult it is for the PLA to seize and hold Taiwan. First, it's a matter of actually landing on the beach, and then potentially the a PLA force could be involved in a in an insurgency in Taiwan. We shouldn't rule out the fact that the people of Taiwan, like the people of Hong Kong that protested millions on the street would actually stand up and fight to defend their democracy and their country. So the PLA is still building amphibious landing capabilities. It has a large number of missiles that the Chinese could destroy Taiwan, but I don't think that that is their objective.So I, myself, think that the Chinese are focused on preventing Taiwan from becoming a de jure independent state; that reunification is actually not a near-term goal for Xi Jinping. That is a long-term effort that the Chinese Communist Party is engaged in. For now, China has prevented Taiwan from going independent. And I think that Xi Jinping is actually focused much more on his domestic challenges, including ensuring that Taiwan that China doesn't end up in the middle-income trap. So I think that unification is just not the first thing that Xi Jinping thinks about when he wakes up every morning.Michael J. Green: So on the question of an invasion and whether the U.S. would respond, historical analogies are always problematic, but in 1941 America was far more isolationist than it is today, and the U.S. Navy in the Pacific was weaker than the Imperial Japanese Navy, and the Japanese Cabinet of Prime Minister Tojo was convinced the U.S. would not fight. And of course, we did.In June 1950, Stalin, Mao, and Kim Il-sung were convinced the U.S. wouldn't fight, and we did. And the mood in the United States before June 1950 and the official U.S. policy was that we were getting out of Korea, but we still fought.So I think and there are other examples. I think the recurring pattern in Asia is when a rival hegemonic power strikes a blow to try to assert its hegemony over the region, the U.S. has always fought. The problem is the adversary has always failed to recognize that, which is why this debate about strategic clarity is interesting and important. How do we demonstrate deterrence? I think our survey helps to show that with a very high risk tolerance of American thought leaders and the American public to defend Taiwan.But, you know, an invasion, I think, is extremely unlikely. And remember, all-out war could end up with regime change, not in Taipei but in Beijing. It's an extremely risky proposition for any Chinese government. I think the more likely scenario is some escalation in gray-zone coercion through cyberattacks or things like that.And, you know, strategic clarity is not so helpful in that context, because the attack is not so clear. And so our strategy really has to be looking at ways to impose costs on Beijing, not only to deter them from attack, but costs for gray-zone coercion in cyberspace or in international space for Taiwan's presence in international associations and organizations.And that gray zone requires not just military tools. It requires diplomatic tools. It requires and it's not just a U.S. problem or a U.S.-Japan problem. It's a global and regional problem. And that's where this U.S.-Taiwan policy needs to go, not the on-off switch of attack, defend, but how do we deal with the creeping increase in gray-zone coercion on Taiwan. And we have a lot of tools, including trade and support for democracy and our alliances to do that, I think.Caleb Diamond: And our next question actually builds pretty well off the first two. And it's: What is the view in the two U.S. political parties about Taiwan's own effort to strengthen its conventional defenses against China? And how is that view shaping broader willingness to help defend Taiwan? Or I guess you were talking about unconventional capabilities as well.Michael J. Green: I'll lead off on that one, Caleb.I think, with the growing concern in both among Republicans, Democrats and independents who follow defense and foreign policy, along with that growing concern with the danger of Chinese coercion against Taiwan, is a focus on Taiwan's own capability to defend itself. And over the last two or three years we've seen a growing number of articles in, you know, places like War on the Rocks, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Policy, think-tank reports, all saying the same thing. Taiwan has got to better prepare to defend itself.And if you listen to how President Tsai or the Taiwan defense establishment talks these days, it's clear that they know it and that they are girding their loins and are doing more to be prepared, because if there's a sense in Washington that Taiwan's not willing to defend itself, then the U.S. is you know, the political establishment is not going to risk American lives.But I think the signal from Taipei is quite it's really quite interesting. I mean, I think Tsai Ing-wen is really signaling quite strongly that Taiwan will defend its democracy. And she has public support for that. So now the question is what kind of capabilities? And Taipei is moving towards what it calls an asymmetrical strategy where it develops ways to hurt China if China tries to invade or blockade. And it's moving in that direction.But I think most experts in the U.S. would argue more needs to be done to have survivability if Taiwan comes under missile attack, to have sustainability so that there's enough ammunition and missiles to keep fighting. These are the kind of issues we're now talking about. And we address these in our report.The report is primarily, you know, aimed at U.S. policy. But the premise is that Taiwan also has to do its part. And I think it signals that Taiwan is stepping up. But there's more to be done.I'll let Bonnie pick up if she'd like to.Bonnie S. Glaser: I'll just add that we have, I think, a really good section on defense and security in our report and some important recommendations. Taiwan, as Mike has just said particularly President Tsai Ing-wen, I think, has recognized that Taiwan needs to invest more in its defense. She's reversed the trend of declining defense budgets. She is spending time visiting forces, making public speeches. In her recent October 10 speech she once again underscored the need for Taiwan to develop more modern, effective, asymmetric defense capabilities.We are about to hear the notifications some of them have already been reported that have gone to Congress. And some of those items, I think, are exactly what Taiwan needs to make itself more resilient and defensible and survivable, and the coastal defense cruise missiles are an example of that. And then there are things like sea mines that Taiwan is actually manufacturing itself, not buying from the United States because, apparently, we don't manufacture them.So not all the reporting, I think, has been correct in that regard. But this is a clear trend in Taiwan. The overall defense concept is the right idea. The other day the national security advisor, Robert O'Brien, once again referred to Taiwan needing to make itself a porcupine.You know, the first time I think that idea of a porcupine strategy was created was in 2008 by an expert called Bill Murray, who was at the Naval War College, and he wrote about Taiwan needing to adopt the porcupine strategy.So here we are 12 years later. We're still talking about the same concept. But I would say that Taiwan is making progress toward developing these kind of asymmetric capabilities. There's more to be done, absolutely.Caleb Diamond: Well, the next question I received sort of switches gears toward trade. It's a two-part question. So if Trump is elected, should we expect to see a negotiation for a U.S.-China phase-two deal? And if that happens, will there be room for a U.S.-Taiwan bilateral trade agreement? And the flip side of that, if Biden wins, how would Joe Biden deal with U.S.-China trade? And, you know, as well as that, how would he deal with a U.S.-Taiwan bilateral trade deal?Michael J. Green: Well, we talk in the report about the technology sector as an important focus, and the Trump administration pulled out of TPP, has, you know, been hostile to the World Trade Organization, has really thrown out, you know, seven decades of American support for the Bretton Woods system and international trade. It's really quite shocking to our allies and partners and the U.S. business community.And the president said, well, he prefers bilateral negotiations because that's how he did business. So we've had some bilateral negotiations that are instructive for what trade relations with Taiwan could look like, and, in particular, the U.S.-Canada-Mexico negotiation, which was NAFTA 2.0 as some economists call it, NAFTA 0.7 because it really reduced free trade. But there was a chapter on digital trade that was quite important. And then in the U.S.-Japan case, because Japan and the U.S. were beginning to have a tariff war, the Trump administration wasn't going to rejoin TPP but it did need to get some agreement with Japan for our agricultural exports, and so smart negotiators put into that U.S.-Japan agreement also a chapter on digital trade.So if we think about digital trade, data reciprocity, protection of our domestic markets from predatory behavior by Huawei or other Chinese firms and that kind of thing, you know, the leading manufacturers of semiconductors in the world are the U.S., Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. And so, you know, I can imagine a Trump or a Biden administration seeing the value in building Bonnie called it a plurilateral agreement, a smaller agreement.Europe is harder because of data privacy issues that divide us with Europe. That's for later. But starting off with a smaller Asia-Pacific grouping, maybe including Canada and Australia and others with Taiwan in it, would make a lot of sense because TSMC, Taiwan's semiconductor company, is right in the front lines of decoupling.Will they invest in the U.S.? Will they manage supply chains to keep China from leapfrogging, you know, Huawei's big gap, and Chinese 5G the Achilles' heel for China's 5G is semiconductor fabrication, and Taiwan's world class. And so a trade agreement that locks in some rules around that makes a lot of sense.You know, a bilateral investment treaty with Taiwan, as I said, could also make sense. I don't think a Biden or a Trump administration is going to have the political instincts or wherewithal to embrace a broad agreement like CPTPP in the first year or two. So this kind of digital trade or data reciprocity agreement, which the Japanese are pushing among others, is a good start and some of the most important rulemaking. And Taiwan would have a really important role to play by virtue of the technological advantages that they bring.Bonnie S. Glaser: I certainly hope that a Biden administration or second Trump administration will make trade agreements with Taiwan a priority, and particularly a free trade agreement. The first six months of this year Taiwan was our ninth-largest trading partner. And Mike has talked about the importance of Taiwan in supply chains and technology protection. It's uncertain whether either administration would make this a priority, but I would just add that as a member of the World Trade Organization, Taiwan has every right to sign trade agreements with countries around the world. It doesn't use the name Taiwan, but Republic of China. But those agreements have been negotiated before.During the Ma Ying-jeou era, Taiwan signed free trade agreements with Singapore and with New Zealand. And at the time, those were sanctioned, supported by Beijing, because they had a better relationship with Taiwan. But that should not be a precondition for signing trade agreements with Taiwan . So as I said earlier, I think it's very much in U.S. national interests, and perhaps if we go forward with negotiating trade agreements with Taiwan, then other countries will do so as well. And I would particularly cite Japan and Australia as having very important trade relationships with Taiwan.Michael J. Green: I think if I could just follow up on that Bonnie makes a very important point. I'm not optimistic that either a Trump or a Biden administration will enter into, you know, free trade agreements in the WTO context, meaning substantially all liberalization. That's why I focused on a sectoral, digital trade agreement. But I wouldn't rule out a free trade agreement with Taiwan. I think there's a logic to it. Most of the U.S. free trade agreements at the beginning of administrations are primarily pursued for strategic reasons. I was in the Bush White House when we began the U.S.-Singapore, U.S.-Australia, and U.S.-Korea free trade agreements.And the motivation was, in large part, strategic, with key allies, key partners. And I could and the reality is, we were a number of us were preparing for a possible Taiwan free trade agreement in the Bush administration. And we could not do it. And the reason was, to be very candid, because there was no confidence that Chen Shui-bian would manage the politics well, that he might seize that as a political tool, and not doing the hard work required for a free trade agreement. So there was even some momentum in the Bush administration for this. So I wouldn't rule out that a Biden, or even a Trump administration, might consider as one tool to support Taiwan for strategic and economic reasons both, you know, a free trade agreement. I wouldn't bet on it, but I wouldn't rule it out. I think Bonnie makes a good case.Caleb Diamond: Next question is about the China Taskforce Act that was introduced yesterday, which combines legislative recommendations, including several that are pro-Taiwan. So the question is: How might this act change U.S.-Taiwan and U.S.-China relations?Michael J. Green: Bonnie is your silence a request for me to go first? (Laughter.)Bonnie S. Glaser: I have just skimmed the act. There's seven components. But I have not yet looked into the details. Do you want to want to take this, Mike?Michael J. Green: Sure. I mean, I think look, there are over our colleague Scott Kennedy is tracking legislation on China. There are over 200 pieces of legislation this year on China. And until yesterday 12 had passed, now 13, relating to China, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, trade. They're all tough. None of them are popular in Beijing. This is one more. I think congressional legislation that solidifies our support for Taiwan is helpful. The legislation always allows some waiver for the president to, you know, exert his own or, her own judgement about how to apply the law.But I think Congress showing bipartisan support, not only for Taiwan but for human rights in Xinjiang, and Tibet, for Hong Kong's autonomy, and so forth is very, very helpful. And it's not partisan. I mean, in the past, these kinds of bills on China were very partisan. They're not now. And so I think it's a good thing. One of the things we say in our report is that Beijing needs to recognize that the feelings on Taiwan about China are the reflections of a Democratic society, of people who are afraid of the one-country, two-systems model because of what's happening in Hong Kong. And for the same reason, I think it's helpful for the administrative branch to demonstrate that the feelings about Hong Kong in the Congress reflect a bipartisan and broad consensus among the American people so it gives leverage to the administration.But that raises the question how does the administration use it, which I think is another discussion, and it has to be used carefully. We're not in our report we make it very clear things that provoke China just for the sake of provoking China are not necessarily helpful, but things that strengthen support for Taiwan in a sustainable way not a symbolic way are. So how this is applied by the administration is really a critical piece of the answer, and we'll have to wait for, you know, 20 days to find out.Caleb Diamond: Our next question is: So it was reported in Japanese media that President Trump was considering a sudden visit to Taiwan. Do you think, you know, that that's a possibility or just a rumor? And then: What can we expect in the Taiwan Strait in the next three months?Bonnie S. Glaser: Well, I think everybody on this call knows about the anecdote in John Bolton's book about President Trump comparing Taiwan to the nib of a Sharpie pen and China to the Resolute desk, and we know that he got burned very early on even before being sworn in as president when he had the phone call with President Tsai and was provoked a strong reaction from Beijing. Subsequently, I don't think we have seen much said by President Trump about Taiwan, and there have been many reports that he's been concerned about some actions that might be taken to strengthen ties with Taiwan because they might undermine trade negotiations between the United States and China.Now, to some extent this is an unpredictable president, but I myself don't think we're going to wake up tomorrow morning or any morning in the in the next few months and see President Trump landing in Taipei. But maybe Japanese media may be good at creating those kind of rumors, and Mike could talk about Japanese media. But I don't I don't think that's going to happen. But will there be other actions taken over the next few months, whether President Trump is reelected or not? I do expect to see more steps taken to deal with challenges from China and perhaps to strengthen ties with Taiwan. And the announcement of more arms sales is just one example of that. But I don't think that we're going to see anything that is really surprising, like a visit by President Trump to Taiwan.Michael J. Green: Nobody would be happier to have Donald Trump, when he's 11 points down in the polls, spend three days out of the country this close to an election than Joe Biden, so I'm sure Joe Biden is fully in favor of Donald Trump going anywhere outside of the United States for three days. I think it's extremely unrealistic.But it is it is interesting because, as Bonnie knows, prominent Chinese scholars in the mainland are stating that there will be an October surprise where Donald Trump will take some military action or provocation in the Taiwan Strait. And that is ludicrous also, but dangerous that not just, you know, sensational outlets like the Global Times but serious Chinese scholars are saying this. And it's worrisome because what it shows you is Taipei and Beijing don't really know what Donald Trump really thinks about Taiwan and what he would really do.And if you're North Korea, being unpredictable is an asset. But if you're the United States of America, it's a liability. And it's one reason why in our report we really emphasize the importance of continuity, predictability, steadiness because you don't want China to think you'd just sell out Taiwan, but you also don't want Beijing to think you would deliberately provoke a conflict using Taiwan as a pawn. And the fact that Taipei, Tokyo, Beijing have these wild theories about what President Trump will do all of which are potentially really inflammatory in the Taiwan Strait that's not good. That's not good. And you've never seen a presidential campaign before, including even Ronald Reagan's, where the press in Asia thought the president of the United States would do something so such a wrecking ball, take such a wrecking ball to stability in Asia. That really is why, you know, continuity, steadiness, predictability are so important for the United States of America in this delicate equation in the Taiwan Strait.Caleb Diamond: So our next question is about and I believe is about what happened in Fiji a few days ago. There was a conflict, a confrontation between Taiwanese and Chinese diplomats. And so the question it's a two-part question. And the first part is: What can the U.S. and Taiwan do or actually, combined, it's one question. What can the U.S. and Taiwan do to combat sort of these wolf-warrior diplomats? And how can the U.S. and other countries in the international community ease tensions between China and Taiwan and other third countries, mostly the Pacific islands, as Beijing seems to be more aggressive in pushing the one-China principle?Michael J. Green: You know, the PLA and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs have been extremely aggressive in the South Pacific. And Chinese ambassadors in these small island states have gone on social media in English and posted things, saying Australia is your worst nightmare. Australia is not your friend or New Zealand is not your friend. China is your friend. I mean, they have, not just in private but publicly, attacked Australia and New Zealand, two countries for which these islands are incredibly important strategically.And the reason of that is that in Japan and in Australia and New Zealand, for the first time in a long time, people are governments are talking about actively working with Taiwan in those Pacific-island nations where Taiwan has diplomatic recognition, including an agreement between the Japan Bank for Intellectual Cooperation and Taiwan, to do infrastructure development. And I think, because of this wolf-warrior diplomacy, you'll see more support for Taiwan playing a role to support infrastructure and democracy development.Historically, Taiwan has played the diplomatic-recognition game against China the same way China has big bags of cash; you know, building sports stadiums. And Australia, New Zealand, the U.S., Japan to some extent, France, which is a major player in the Pacific, has been talking to Taipei about Taiwan using its soft power and its support for democratic norms and its COVID diplomacy and infrastructure support, aligning efforts more with the U.S., Japan, Australia, New Zealand and France. And I think the Tsai government is quite open to that, and it will be helpful.The challenge, of course, is that there are parts of the Pacific where China has diplomatic relations and it's harder for Taiwan to play. And it's pretty clear that the Chinese side engages in what experts call elite capture, which means bribing people. But that's all the more reason to shine a light of transparency and accountability and help these countries with their civil society and governance and democracy, so that their leaders aren't bribed.So it's game on, and it's complicated. But I think Taiwan is going to have more of a role. And I think other countries for the first time are really starting to appreciate that.Bonnie S. Glaser: I would just add that this is a problem because China's foreign-ministry officials are probably getting awarded for engaging in these kind of actions in places like Fiji. There have always been incentives given to Chinese foreign-ministry officials who put pressure on Taiwan and who enable these building of greater support among Taiwan's diplomatic partners for China. So this has been going on for decades. And there is now obviously, this has just been increased, you know, a hundred-fold around the world.I don't know whether Xi Jinping is very aware of the costs of doing so around the world, but certainly there's support for this domestically in China. So what we need to do is to increase the costs to China and, as Mike said, to shine a light on what the Chinese are doing. Other governments, including the United States, should be speaking out publicly and criticizing this kind of behavior.We should say so publicly that it is unacceptable, and we should communicate our concerns to the Chinese government privately. But unless we do so in ways that really increase the costs and get that message up to Xi Jinping, it's going to be very difficult, I think, to really convince China to change this kind of behavior. So we need to do more to work with Taiwan as well, as Mike talked about, in infrastructure building and enhancing their presence and giving them an opportunity to convey public goods and participate in these in various countries. And the South Pacific is one of the toughest places.Caleb Diamond: So we have at least, I have two more questions. And we are running low on time. So I ask that we keep these answers short. So the first question is: What is the reason we do not have any response from USTR on the topic of the trade agreement with Taiwan? Is it issues of bandwidth, or personal preference, or what else?Michael J. Green: Well, I think we have at USTR right now one of the best tacticians in the history of that office. Ambassador Lighthizer knows as a former USTR official and lawyer for steel companies he knows exactly how antidumping rules, trade rules, Section 232 can be used aggressively to well, from his perspective to keep jobs in places like Pennsylvania and Ohio. And that is overwhelmingly the priority.Previous U.S. trade reps have focused like a laser on American jobs and competitiveness, but they've also seen as part of their mandate the U.S. national interest and advancing key strategic relationships, and playing a leading role in rulemaking the shaping the external environment not just trying to, you know, keep a couple jobs here and there in the U.S., which is important but there's a much broader mandate most U.S. trade reps take on.So a Taiwan free trade agreement is you know, it's a strategic concept about rulemaking, about future of technology competition. Not steel but, you know, 5G, AI, and the Internet of Things. It's just not the way this USTR tends to think about their job. And we'll see who comes into that job next, but I think there is a compelling case Bonnie just made it for examining an FTA with Taiwan.Bonnie S. Glaser: So I would just add one sentence, and that is that Ambassador Lighthizer answers to President Trump. And the two of them have been most concerned and attached priority to our negotiations with China, and the phase one agreement with China, and making sure that China makes the purchases of American products that I committed to make. And I think that that is by far the most important reason in preventing a USTR from taking up the issue of negotiations of a free trade agreement with Taiwan.Caleb Diamond: Thanks to both of you. And so the last question is: Secretary Pompeo is visiting Sri Lanka this month. Is there any possibility that he'll visit Taiwan while he's in Asia?Bonnie S. Glaser: In my conversations with State Department officials, I have been told that there is no consideration being given to having Secretary of State Pompeo drop in in Taipei, but of course everything is within the realm of the possible. But I think these rumors are being generated around maybe even in Beijing, just as the narrative is being created that the United States is going to come up with an October surprise and maybe even start a war in the South China Sea or the or the Taiwan Strait. I think in some ways these narratives are being created to serve China's interest in making the United States look like it is unpredictable and that it is the source of instability in the region. So I just don't pay much attention to them.Michael J. Green It's also possible that people within the administration are floating this. You know, there's been a pattern in the last year or so where unnamed officials have leaked often to us, often to think tanks that a major announcement's coming out from Secretary Pompeo on things like strategic clarity or clarifying our support for claimants in the South China Sea or other things like that. And when the actual announcement comes out, it's usually someone at a lower level and it's usually a more modest adjustment to U.S. policy. So this is not the first time if the sources for this rumor are the State Department, it wouldn't actually surprise me, and it would not be the first time that we were promised some, you know, huge announcement and game changer for American policy in Asia, and at the end of the day it was a fairly modest thing.But I will tell you that of any secretary of state in the last 30, 40 years, if somebody's going to go to Taipei right before an election, it's Mike Pompeo. But I wouldn't bet on it.Caleb Diamond: Well, this we ran right at 11, so you know, perfect timing. And to any of those whose questions we didn't get to, please, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I would be happy to set up an interview with Bonnie or Mike. You know, we'd be happy to accommodate that.So I just want to thank all of you for joining us today. We'll have a transcript out shortly, within two hours at the most, and we'll send it out so you can refer to that. And again, please don't hesitate to reach out to us if you'd like an interview. And as Bonnie mentioned and Mike mentioned, the report will be coming out later today. So I just want to again thank you and thank both of our panelists for joining today. Thank you.Michael J. Green: Thank you all. Thanks, Caleb.Bonnie S. Glaser: Thank you. Thanks, Caleb.(END)Load-Date: October 21, 2020End of Document

US CHALLENGES INJUNCTION AGAINST WECHAT APP STORE BANSStates News ServiceSeptember 21, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 356 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):By VOA NewsSeptember 21, 2020 11:54 AMThe U.S. Commerce Department said Monday it is challenging a federal judge's injunction against its order that Apple and Google remove WeChat from their U.S. app stores due to data privacy and national security concerns.The department's original order, issued Friday, also included another Chinese-owned app, TikTok, and expressed the Trump administration's concerns about the way the apps collect user data and the potential for that information to be shared with Chinese government agencies.China has rejected the U.S. allegations of a security threat, and on Saturday condemned what it called "bullying" that violated international trade standards.U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler responded Sunday to a request for an injunction from WeChat users by putting the Commerce Department's order on hold, ruling that the Trump administration's actions would restrict users' free speech rights under the First Amendment.WeChat has about 19 million active daily users in the United States. The service, owned by Chinese tech company Tencent, is popular with Americans who use it to communicate with family and friends in China.Video-sharing service TikTok earned a short reprieve from its part of the Commerce Department order after announcing an agreement to form a new company with U.S. tech giant Oracle and retailer WalMart together holding up to a 20% share.Speaking to Fox News on Monday, Trump said his administration would not approve the agreement if ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese owner, has any control."If we find that they don't have total control, then we're not going to approve the deal," Trump said of Oracle and WalMart. "We will be watching it very closely."Those comments are in contrast to those Trump gave Saturday when he said he approved of the agreement "in concept" and had "given the deal my blessing."The Commerce Department has delayed the app store ban for TikTok until September 27, and given the company until November 12 to resolve national security concerns before facing a wider range of restrictions.Load-Date: September 21, 2020End of Document

Global Forklift Industry; The global market for Forklift is projected to reach US$23. 9 billion by 2025 driven by the strong focus shed on automation and production efficiency in the era of smart factory and industry 4. 0. Smart manufacturing is the new revolution that will mark the next generation of production and warehousing.GlobeNewswireOctober 23, 2020 Friday 5:42 AM PTCopyright 2020 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: MARKET RESEARCH REPORTSLength: 5933 wordsBodyNew York, Oct.  23, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report "Global Forklift Industry" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p05798622/?utm_source=GNW  Self-aware, self-optimized, self-configured equipment with the ability to wirelessly communicate with each other; advanced networking; real-time controls; more closer alignment of business management and plant floor activities and supply chains; additive manufacturing are few of the disruptive smart factory trends currently underway. Among these, "automation" lies at the heart of the smart factory concept. Almost like the beating heart, automation provides the foundation for the creation of knowledge-embedded manufacturing operations. Automating labor intensive operations is the starting point for automation, and as the most labor intensive process in manufacturing and warehousing, material handling is at the bottom of the automation pyramid. Defined as the movement of products and materials throughout the manufacturing process, material handling is labor intensive and expensive. Benefits of automating material handling include reduced human role in unproductive, repetitive and labor intensive tasks and the ensuing freeing up of resources for other core activities; greater throughput capability; better space utilization; increased production control; inventory control; improved stock rotation; reduced operation cost; improved worker safety; reduced losses from damage; and reduction in handling costs. Forklifts are an essential piece of material handling equipment. They are powered industrial trucks used for moving large quantities of materials around the plant floor and assembly lines and also for loading goods onto delivery trucks. Used in the manufacturing industry for over 50 years, demand for forklifts will benefit in the midst of concepts like industry 4.0 and lights-out manufacturing and the significant capital earmarked for `smart` machinery. Innovations like driverless forklifts and autonomous forklifts will bring in the highest gains in the market in the coming years. Autonomous forklift eliminates need for human supervision and accomplishes tasks in a cost and time effective manner. Developments in sensors (Lidar) and intelligent sensing, sensor fusion, robotics and artificial intelligence are all helping automate driving and operation of forklifts in industrial complexes. Continuous technology advancements in the future will likely witness these machines become completely self-reliant, marking the first step in the much fantasized scenario where automation continues 24/7 even when the factory lights go out. The United States and Europe represent large markets worldwide with a combined share of 49.8% of the market. China ranks as the fastest growing market with a CAGR of 3.8% over the analysis period supported by the Made in China (MIC) 2025 initiative that aims to bring the country's massive manufacturing and production sector into the forefront of global technology competitiveness. Faced with new and changing economic forces, the Chinese government through this initiative is stepping up investments in cutting edge robotics, automation and digital IT technologies to competitively integrate into the global manufacturing chain dominated by industrialized economies such as EU, Germany and the United States and move from being a low cost competitor to a direct added-value competitor.Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05798622/?utm_source=GNW I.

Judge agrees to delay US government restrictions on WeChatAssociated Press State & LocalSeptember 21, 2020 Monday 2:23 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWS; POLITICAL NEWS; STATE AND REGIONALLength: 587 wordsByline: STAN CHOE, AP Business WriterDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) — A judge has approved a request from a group of U.S. WeChat users to delay looming federal government restrictions that could effectively make the popular app nearly impossible to use.In a ruling dated Saturday, Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in California said the government's actions would affect users’ First Amendment rights, as an effective ban on the app would remove their platform for communication.WeChat is a messaging-focused app popular with many Chinese-speaking Americans that serves as a lifeline to friends, family, customers and business contacts in China. It's owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent.The group of WeChat users requested an injunction after the U.S. Commerce Department said Friday it would bar WeChat from U.S. app stores and keep it from accessing essential internet services in the country beginning Sunday at 11:59 p.m.Early on Monday, WeChat was still available for download at Apple and Android app stores.The Trump administration has targeted WeChat and another Chinese-owned app, TikTok, for national security and data privacy concerns, in the latest flashpoint amid rising tensions between Washington and Beijing. The administration contends that the data of U.S. users collected by the two apps could be shared with the Chinese government.On Saturday, President Donald Trump said he supported a proposed deal that would have TikTok partner with Oracle and WalMart to form a U.S. company. There is still a chance that TikTok could be banned in the U.S. as of Nov. 12 if the deal isn't completed, under the restrictions put in place by the Commerce Department.However, a restriction to bar TikTok from app stores in the U.S., similar to what WeChat faced, was pushed back a week to Sept. 27 after Trump backed the latest TikTok deal.On Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News that the government will ensure that under the TikTok-Oracle-WalMart deal, no American's data would end up in the possession of the Chinese government. Trump reiterated on a TV show on Monday that he could still withdraw his approval if the deal didn't satisfy his concerns about security and who controls TikTok, which is currently owned by Chinese company ByteDance.“There can be zero security risks,” he told “Fox & Friends.”In the WeChat case, the users argued that the moves targeting the all-in-one app with instant-messaging, social media and other communication tools would restrict free speech.In her ruling, Beeler found that a WeChat ban “eliminates all meaningful access to communication in the plaintiffs' community,” and that an injunction would be in the public's interest. Furthermore, specific evidence about WeChat posing a national security threat was also “modest,” she wrote.The U.S. government earlier argued that it would not be restricting free speech because WeChat users still “are free to speak on alternative platforms that do not pose a national security threat.”Kerri Kupec, a spokesperson for the Department of Justice, said the department was reviewing the judge's order.The dispute over WeChat and TikTok is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to counter the influence of China. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.___AP technology writer Zen Soo in Hong Kong and reporters Michael Balsamo, Zeke Miller and Martin Crutsinger in Washington contributed to this report.Load-Date: September 21, 2020End of Document

KILDEE, STABENOW, PETERS: TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MUST ENFORCE CHINA TRADE DEALStates News ServiceOctober 27, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 707 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Michigan Rep. Dale Kildee:FLINT Congressman Dan Kildee (MI-05), Chief Deputy Whip of the House Democratic Caucus, along with U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Gary Peters (D-MI), today sent a letter to the Trump administration, to call attention to how China has failed to live up to its purchase commitments under the Presidents Phase 1 China Deal, including for solar grade polysilicon.A recent national report in the Wall Street Journal highlighted how China's failure to live up to its commitments have cost jobs in Michigan. Hemlock Semiconductor, a Michigan company that makes polysilicon used in computer chips and solar cells, has laid off 50 Michigan workers due to President Trump's trade policies and failure to hold China accountable."Everything we see in the market shows that we cannot trust the Chinese to keep their word and that this critical industry might not survive until February 2021 when the Chinese will surely fail to meet its commitments. Thus, we implore you to take additional enforcement action immediately to support the solar grade polysilicon industry , " the letter reads in part.Below is the full text of the letter:The Honorable Robert LighthizerUnited States Trade Representative600 17th St. NWWashington, D.C. 20006Ambassador Lighthizer:We write to you with concerns that China is failing to take any of the actions necessary to live up to its purchase commitments for solar-grade polysilicon, making compliance impossible and leading to a major loss of American jobs and the elimination of a critical domestic industry.The "Economic and Trade Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the People's Republic of China" (Phase I China Deal) states that China has committed to purchase solar-grade polysilicon. This was welcome news to Hemlock Semiconductor (HSC) in Michigan, which manufactures solar-grade polysilicon. Unfortunately, all indications show that China will not meet its commitments.Because these materials are critical to the future of manufacturing, China has targeted this industry for expansion under its Made in China 2025 plan. To further its Made in China 2025 goals, China continues to block U.S. polysilicon exports from its market with high tariffs, while heavily subsidizing its own producers and aggressively supporting domestic advancements in polysilicon manufacturing. In fact, within days after the Phase I China Deal was signed, the Chinese government renewed tariffs on solar-grade polysilicon.These efforts by the Chinese have devastated the U.S. polysilicon industry, and the stakes of reopening the Chinese market have never been greater. American polysilicon companies have already been forced to lay off 1,300 workers, mothball a $1.8 billion manufacturing facility, operate at a significantly reduced utilization and delay other investment and production. On June 18, HSC announced that due to the failure of China to meet its commitments, they needed to reduce their workforce by 50 jobs. The U.S. polysilicon industry faces additional plant closures and job losses unless the Chinese market is reopened soon.We appreciate that you and Ambassador Gerrish have raised this issue with your Chinese counterparts. At the same time, your office continues to state that China has one year to fulfill its commitments and that they believe China will meet its commitments. Everything we see in the market shows that we cannot trust the Chinese to keep their word and that this critical industry might not survive until February 2021 when the Chinese will surely fail to meet its commitments.Thus, we implore you to take additional enforcement action immediately to support the solar grade polysilicon industry, including a formal request under Article 7.3 of the Agreement for specific information on the immediate steps that China will take to remove barriers to Chinese purchases of solar grade polysilicon. We greatly appreciate your dedication to trade enforcement. This is no different and we urge you to act now. Thank you for your consideration.Thank you for your consideration.Sincerely,Representative Daniel T. KildeeSenator Debbie StabenowSenator Gary C.

US accuses five Chinese citizens of hacking more than 100 companies in US and other countriesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 17, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 398 wordsBodyThe United States accused five Chinese citizens of hacking more than 100 American and other companies and institutions, including social media and video game companies, as well as universities and telecommunications providers, the authorities reported.The five defendants are still fugitives,but prosecutors say two Malay businessmen accused of conspiring with alleged hackers to profit from attacks on video game companies were arrested in that country this week and face extradition.The allegations announced by the Justice Department are part of a broader effort by President Donald Trump's administration to denounce China's cybercrime. In July, prosecutors accused hackers of working with the Chinese government to attack companies that develop coronavirus vaccines and steal hundreds of millions of dollars in intellectual property and trade secrets from companies around the world.The accusations and the number of victims revealed on Wednesday were significantly wide. U.S. officials said hackers had been operating for a year, stalking various commercial and academic sectors.They indicated that it was conducted by a group based in China known as APT41. That group was accused last year by cybersecurity firm FireEye of conducting Chinese state-sponsored operations and being financially motivated.The Justice Department did not directly link hackers to the Chinese government, but officials said the hackers were likely to act as representatives of Beijing because some of the victims were dissidents and students in Taiwan.Those targets "are a registered trademark of espionage,"said acting federal prosecutor for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, where the allegations were filed.In addition, one of the five defendants told a colleague who worked closely with China's Ministry of State Security and would be protected"unlesssomething very important happens," and that he agreed not to attack targets in China, Justice Undersecretary Jeffrey Rosen revealed. Rosen criticized the Chinese government for not fighting cybercrime or prosecuting hackers."Weknow that Chinese authorities are at least as capable as law enforcement authorities here and in related states to enforce laws against computer intrusions, but that they have chosen not to,"Rosen said.There was no immediate response Wednesday from the Chinese embassy in Washington to an email requesting comment.Load-Date: September 18, 2020End of Document

Congressional Research Service Report: 'Patricia Moloney Figliola Specialist in Internet & Telecommunications Policy'Targeted News ServiceSeptember 26, 2020 Saturday 9:11 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3667 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Congressional Research Service issued the following report (No. R46543) entitled "Patricia Moloney Figliola Specialist in Internet and Telecommunications Policy". Here are excerpts of the report issued on Sept. 25 and written by Patricia Moloney Figliola, specialist in internet and telecommunications policy:TikTok is a globally popular video-sharing smartphone application (app) owned by ByteDance Ltd., a privately held company headquartered in Beijing, China. It is under increasing scrutiny by the U.S. government as a potential privacy and security risk to U.S. citizens. This is because ByteDance, like all technology companies doing business in China, is subject to Chinese laws that require companies operating in the country to turn over user data when asked to by the government. Researchers differ over how TikTok's collection of user data compares with other social media apps and whether TikTok poses a unique threat to the privacy and security of its U.S. users.TikTok launched in the United States in August 2018. The app is available in over 155 countries in 39 languages and has approximately 800 million monthly active users. In the United States, the app has approximately 49 million monthly active users. TikTok's appeal lies heavily on what has been called its "addictive" video feed, For You. The app builds this feed through a "recommendation engine" algorithm built on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and data mining practices.According to the company, the recommendation engine relies on a complex set of weighted factors to recommend content, including hashtags and videos watched previously, as well as the kind of device a person is using. TikTok critics cite problems with how much data TikTok collects from and about its users and with how that data is stored--and could be shared.On August 6, 2020, President Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at stopping TikTok from doing business in the United States. Once in effect on September 27, 2020 (an extension from the original date of September 20), the order will prohibit any U.S. company or person from "transacting" with ByteDance. On August 14, 2020, the President issued a second Executive Order stating that ByteDance, its subsidiaries, and partners must divest from all assets that support TikTok's operations in the United States and destroy all previously collected U.S. user data. Divestiture may be accomplished by finding a U.S. buyer for TikTok. The requirements are designed to limit the Chinese government's access to current and future data from U.S. TikTok users. ByteDance does not want to divest from TikTok and has sued the Trump Administration.On September 14, 2020, Oracle announced that it had reached an agreement with ByteDance to "serve as [the company's] trusted technology provider" in the United States. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that he had received the proposal. From the terminology used, it appears that the deal may involve a partnership between the two companies rather than a sale. This arrangement would keep the source code of the For You recommendation engine in the hands of ByteDance.It is unclear if this deal satisfies the conditions in President Trump's Executive Orders. Secretary Mnuchin said that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States will review the proposal and present President Trump with its opinion.On September 19, 2020, Oracle announced that Walmart would be joining the TikTok acquisition. Some believe TikTok and other Chinese-owned apps pose a serious security risk to the United States because Chinese companies are subject to China's laws that require compliance with government requests for data. Others believe that TikTok has fallen into "the crosshairs of a global technology battle" based on technology trade protectionism (this concept, also called "techno-nationalism," refers to a country's refusal or reluctance to import other countries' advanced technology, as well as to export, or to allow other nations to benefit from, its own advanced technology).Similar situations may arise in the future with other apps created by foreign companies. Options that Congress may consider include (1) developing an overarching legal and regulatory framework to protect the security and privacy of U.S. citizens' data and communications, and (2) developing a uniform, transparent process to assess and mediate risks posed by foreign apps.* * *Contents:Background ... 1What Is TikTok? ... 1* TikTok's Recommendation Engine ... 2* Data Collection, Storage, and Sharing by TikTok ... 3- Data Collection ... 3- Data Storage ... 4- Data Sharing ... 4White House TikTok Executive Orders ... 4* Prohibiting Transactions with ByteDance ... 5* Requiring Divestiture of ByteDance from TikTok ... 5- ByteDance Reaction to Divestiture Requirement ... 5China's Cybersecurity Law and Export Rules ... 6Status of Potential Oracle and Walmart Partnership with TikTok ... 6Discussion ... 8* Threat to Security ... 8* Technology Trade Protectionism ... 8Related Congressional Activity ... 10* Hearings ... 10* Legislation ... 10Conclusion ... 11Tables:Table 1.

What Is WeChat? ... 12Contacts:Author Information ... 12* * *BackgroundTikTok is a popular video-sharing smartphone application (app) owned by ByteDance Ltd., a privately held company headquartered in Beijing, China. The app is under intense scrutiny by the U.S. government as a potential privacy and security risk to U.S. users. A major concern is that ByteDance is subject to Chinese laws that require companies operating in China to turn over user data when asked to by the national government. On August 6 and August 14, 2020, President Trump signed Executive Orders aimed at stopping U.S. persons and entities from doing business with ByteDance/1 and requiring ByteDance to divest from any holding used to support the operation of TikTok in the United States./2Researchers differ over how TikTok's collection of user data compares with other social media apps and whether TikTok poses a unique threat to the privacy and security of its U.S. users, including many minors.WeChat, another Chinese-owned app, is often mentioned in conjunction with TikTok, but the two apps are quite different. TikTok has a single function--short video--while WeChat has multiple--voice and data messaging, social media, and digital payment. WeChat is used in the United States primarily by the Chinese language community, whereas TikTok is used more widely. On the same day as the TikTok order, President Trump also signed an Executive Order prohibiting any U.S. individual or entity from engaging in any transaction related to WeChat and its owner, Tencent Holdings Ltd./3While issues with the two apps are often conflated, their functions, technical capabilities, and the data collected from their users are different. Only TikTok is discussed in this report. Background information about WeChat is in Appendix.What Is TikTok?On August 2, 2018, U.S. users of the Musically app, a short video service headquartered in Shanghai, China, with a U.S. office in Santa Monica, CA, found that it had been merged into TikTok. Musical.ly had been acquired by ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, in November 2017 for $1 billion as a means to enter the U.S. market. The TikTok app is available in over 155 countries in 39 languages, and has approximately 800 million monthly active users./4In the United States, TikTok has approximately 49 million monthly active users/5 and the company maintains offices in Los Angeles and New York. When ByteDance first released the TikTok app in September 2016, videos could be no longer than 15 seconds, but now users are allowed to link together four 15 second segments./6Longer videos recorded outside the app can also be uploaded to the platform.ByteDance is currently estimated to be worth over $100 billion./7The company's core product in China is Toutiao, which means "Headlines." Toutiao began as a mobile news recommendation engine, but has evolved into a platform to deliver content and targeted advertising in other formats as well (e.g., text messages, images, question-and-answer posts, microblogs, videos).TikTok's Recommendation EngineTikTok's appeal relies on what has been called its "addictive" video feed, For You./8The app builds this feed through a "recommendation engine" using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and data mining practices. How each user's feed is constructed had been a tightly held secret until recently. On June 18, 2020, TikTok published a blog post, "How TikTok Recommends Videos #ForYou."/9The company says its algorithm relies on a complex set of weighted factors to recommend content based on user preferences, including hashtags and videos watched; videos "liked," shared, and commented on; as well as the kind of device a person is using. Each user's feed is unique.Table 1 lists the specific factors the company says it uses.Table 1. "For You" Feed Factors and ElementsTable omitted: https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46543According to TikTok, [a]ll these factors are processed by our recommendation system and weighted based on their value to a user. A strong indicator of interest, such as whether a user finishes watching a longer video from beginning to end, would receive greater weight than a weak indicator, such as whether the video's viewer and creator are both in the same country. Videos are then ranked to determine the likelihood of a user's interest in a piece of content, and delivered to each unique For You feed.The blog post was seen by most as an effort to provide more transparency to the public as the U.S. government was increasing its scrutiny of the company's practices./10Data Collection, Storage, and Sharing by TikTok Critics, as well as some members of Congress, cite as problematic the amount of data that TikTok collects from and about its users, how that data is stored, and how it could potentially be shared with the Chinese government and used in influence campaigns/11 or against U.S. citizens./12Based on these concerns, both the Democratic and Republican national committees, the Department of Defense, and some private firms, such as Wells Fargo Inc., have banned or discouraged the use of the TikTok app./13Data CollectionAccording to its privacy policy,/14 TikTok collects a range of user information, including location data and internet address, keystroke patterns, and the type of device being used to access the app.The app also collects and stores a user's browsing and search history within the app, as well as the content of any messages exchanged using the app. Additional information can be collected based on user permission: phone number, phone book, and social-network contacts; GPS data; user age; user-generated content (e.g., photos and videos); store payment information; and the videos "liked," shared, watched all the way through, and re-watched. TikTok states that the app collects less personal data than many other apps, such as Facebook and Google, both of which track user activity across devices (TikTok claims that it does not)./15The data that TikTok collects from users appears in many regards to be comparable to what other social media companies gather and use./16Some critics have described TikTok's approach to data mining as aggressive/17 and that its ability to track user behavior while using the app, as well as access to a user's photos, videos, and phone book and geolocation tracking (based on user permissions), means that it can build extremely detailed behavioral profiles of its users that could potentially be shared with the Chinese government./18On August 11, 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported that TikTok avoided privacy safeguards in Google's Android operating system to collect users' mobile device MAC addresses, unique identifiers that allow "the app to track users online," and concealed this activity with an additional layer of encryption before ending the practice after 15 months in November 2019./19Data StorageTikTok claims to store all content created by U.S. users--as well as data about those users--only on servers located within the United States and backed up in Singapore. Those servers are owned or controlled by TikTok, but the company denies that it shares or would share this data with the Chinese government,/20 stating that:The key personnel responsible for TikTok ... are all Americans based in the United States--and therefore are not subject to Chinese law. U.S. content moderation is likewise led by a U.S.-based team and operates independently from China, and, as noted above, the TikTok application stores U.S. user data on servers located in the United States and Singapore./21Data SharingDespite these assertions, TikTok's website says that information can be shared with its parent company in China or other affiliates (usually advertisers), which operate under Chinese law./22Further, a lawsuit filed in federal court in December 2019 asserted that user data was harvested and sent to servers in China./23* * *Content omitted: https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46543* * *Related Congressional ActivityCongress began taking an interest in TikTok as early as October 2019, when Senator Marco Rubio reportedly called for a formal investigation into whether TikTok posed a national security risk./56Later that month, Senators Charles Schumer and Tom Cotton sent a letter/57 to the Acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, expressing their concerns about TikTok and the national security risks they believe it poses. More formally, Congress has scrutinized TikTok in two hearings, and Members have introduced three related bills.HearingsThe Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism has held two hearings on, among other topics, the impact of Chinese smartphone apps on U.S. citizens' privacy:* "How Corporations and Big Tech Leave Our Data Exposed to Criminals, China, and Other Bad Actors" was held on November 5, 2019./58* "Dangerous Partners: Big Tech and Beijing" was held on March 4, 2020./59 TikTok was invited to testify at these hearings, but declined to appear./60LegislationThree bills have been introduced that would prohibit the use of TikTok and WeChat on U.S. government devices:* S. 4452/61 is a bill to prohibit federal employees from downloading or using WeChat on government devices. It was introduced on August 5, 2020, by Senator John Kennedy and referred to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs the same day.* S. 3455,/62 the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, was introduced on March 12, 2020, by Senator Josh Hawley. This bill was passed by the Senate on August 6, 2020, and received in the House the following day. (See S.Rept. 116-250.)/63* H.R. 6896,/64 also called the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, is the House companion bill to S. 3455. It was introduced on May 15, 2020, by Representative Ken Buck and referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform and the House Committee on Administration the same day.ConclusionThe variety of apps available to U.S. users is enormous. Situations similar to the case of TikTok may arise in the future with other apps created by foreign companies. Congress may consider taking one or both of two parallel approaches to address such situations: (1) developing an overarching legal and regulatory framework to protect the security and privacy of U.S. citizens' data and communications, and (2) establishing a uniform, transparent process to assess the risks posed by foreign apps and establish mechanisms to mediate those risks.* * *Footnotes:1 President Donald J.

Judge agrees to delay US government restrictions on WeChatAssociated Press InternationalSeptember 20, 2020 Sunday 5:40 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWS; POLITICAL NEWS; STATE AND REGIONALLength: 539 wordsByline: STAN CHOE, AP Business WriterDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) — A judge has approved a request from a group of U.S. WeChat users to delay looming federal government restrictions that could effectively make the popular app nearly impossible to use.In a ruling dated Saturday, Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in California said the government's actions would affect users’ First Amendment rights, as an effective ban on the app would remove their platform for communication.WeChat is a messaging-focused app popular with many Chinese-speaking Americans that serves as a lifeline to friends, family, customers and business contacts in China. It's owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent.The group of WeChat users requested an injunction after the U.S. Commerce Department said Friday it would bar WeChat from U.S. app stores and keep it from accessing essential internet services in the country beginning Sunday at 11:59 p.m.The Trump administration has targeted WeChat and another Chinese-owned app, TikTok, for national security and data privacy concerns, in the latest flashpoint amid rising tensions between Washington and Beijing. The administration contends that the data of U.S. users collected by the two apps could be shared with the Chinese government.On Saturday, President Donald Trump said he supported a proposed deal that would have TikTok partner with Oracle and WalMart to form a U.S. company. There is still a chance that TikTok could be banned in the U.S. as of Nov. 12 if the deal isn't completed, under the restrictions put in place by the Commerce Department.However, a restriction to bar TikTok from app stores in the U.S., similar to what WeChat faced, was pushed back a week to Sept. 27 after Trump backed the latest TikTok deal.On Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News that the government will ensure that under the TikTok-Oracle-WalMart deal, no American's data would end up in the possession of the Chinese government.In the WeChat case, the users argued that the moves targeting the all-in-one app with instant-messaging, social media and other communication tools would restrict free speech.In her ruling, Beeler found that a WeChat ban “eliminates all meaningful access to communication in the plaintiffs' community,” and that an injunction would be in the public's interest. Furthermore, specific evidence about WeChat posing a national security threat was also “modest,” she wrote.The U.S. government earlier argued that it would not be restricting free speech because WeChat users still “are free to speak on alternative platforms that do not pose a national security threat.”The White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the injunction, but Kerri Kupec, a spokesperson for the Department of Justice, said the department was reviewing the judge's order.The dispute over WeChat and TikTok is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to counter the influence of China. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.___AP technology writer Zen Soo in Hong Kong and reporters Michael Balsamo and Martin Crutsinger in Washington contributed to this report.Load-Date: September 20, 2020End of Document

Q&A: Will the Trump administration be able to ban TikTok?Associated Press InternationalSeptember 28, 2020 Monday 9:04 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 605 wordsByline: MATT O'BRIEN, AP Technology WriterBodyA federal judge on Sunday postponed a Trump administration order that would have banned the popular video sharing app TikTok from U.S. smartphone app stores.A more comprehensive ban remains scheduled for November, about a week after the presidential election. But the judge, Carl Nichols of the U.S District Court for the District of Columbia, cast doubt on the government's argument that TikTok is a national security threat because of its ties to China.The ruling followed an emergency hearing Sunday morning — hours before the app-store ban was set to take effect — in which lawyers for the Chinese-owned app argued that the ban would infringe on First Amendment rights and do irreparable harm to the business.Here are some questions and answers about the dispute.WHAT DID THE JUDGE SAY?Nichols, who was appointed to the bench by President Donald Trump last year, said in a ruling unsealed Monday that the “government has provided ample evidence that China presents a significant national security threat.”But he added there is “less substantial” evidence that TikTok itself presents such a threat or that a ban is an effective way to address it.Trump is trying to use his emergency authority under a 1977 law enabling a U.S. president to regulate international commerce to address unusual threats. But Nichols said that law has an exception to protect personal communications and disseminating information across borders — which he said would include much of the content found on TikTok.Nichols also sided with TikTok's arguments that the app-store ban would cause it to lose users and advertisers, driving them to “alternative platforms and eroding TikTok’s competitive position” even if TikTok were ultimately to win its case.WHAT IS TIKTOK?TikTok is a smartphone app for making and watching short videos that’s popular with teens and young adults, with typical posts centered around lip syncing, dancing or comedic pranks and sketches.TikTok says it has 100 million U.S. users and hundreds of millions globally. It has its own influencer culture, enabling people to make a living by posting videos on the service, and hosts ads from major U.S. companies.It's owned by Beijing-based tech company ByteDance. Like other social media services, the app collects a lot of personal data about its users. The Trump administration says it poses a threat because Americans' user data could fall into the hands of the Chinese government because Chinese companies are subject to intrusive laws compelling their cooperation with intelligence agencies.TikTok has countered that Trump is targeting it for political reasons, tying his August executive order in part to a prank in which TikTok users mobilized to depress turnout at a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.WHAT'S NEXT?Trump has said TikTok could avoid a U.S. ban if it's sold to an American company.TikTok is still scrambling to firm up a deal tentatively struck earlier in September in which it would partner with Oracle, a huge database-software company, and Walmart in an effort to win the blessing of both the Chinese and American governments. The company also last week sought China's approval to export its artificial intelligence technology, after the Chinese government set new restrictions in a move to gain leverage.TikTok said in a statement that it was pleased with the U.S. court ruling and continues to work to turn its deal proposal into an actual agreement.

It is also projected that growing M2M connexions across different industries would fuel the growth of 5G development market size during the forecast period.This report summarises the recent significant developments in the implementation of 5G in five major regions, including Korea, China, Europe, Japan, and the United States, and analyses potential impacts.Get Detailed Analysis of COVID-19 Impact on 5G Development Market:https://reports.valuates.com/request/sample/MICR-Semi-2I18/5G_Development_in_Korea_United_States_China_Europe_and_JapanCOVID IMPACT ON 5G DEVELOPMENT MARKETThe pandemic has affected the speed and timeline for global 5G commercialization. Different isolation mechanisms also made the introduction of 5G base stations more difficult. The extension of 5G spectrum bidding plans has been announced by some nations, which has also decreased customers' ability to embrace 5G.View Full Report:https://reports.valuates.com/market-reports/MICR-Semi-2I18/5g-development-in-koreaREGION WISE 5G DEVELOPMENT MARKET SIZE ANALYSISUNITED STATES:The introduction of 5G is expected to bring about massive transformations in the U.S., technology, media, and telecom industries in the nation; the U.S. is expected to get a substantial market share. The U.S. government is making strides in promoting the 5G industry with new spectrum allocations.During the forecast period, the United States (U.S.) 5G development market size is anticipated to show a double-digit growth rate. The United States was the first nation to offer commercial 5 G services. By the end of 2018, numerous telecommunications providers in the U.S. intend to introduce 5G wireless services around the world.In the United States, sales growth has been higher than any of the other mature markets. This trend has been driven largely by higher use of both voice and messaging services, as well as a more recent rise in user engagement, leading to higher data use levels.SOUTH KOREA:South Korea has established itself as the early market-leader for 5G development due to funding from various private and public entities. It is expected that most of these investments will concentrate on the implementation of next-generation media and entertainment infrastructure, transport and logistics, healthcare, and manufacturing. Such investments are estimated to propel South Korea's demand growth over the projected period.CHINA:China has emerged as one of the most active 5G-promoting countries and is projected to be one of the top four markets driving 5G growth in Asia. During the forecast period, China is projected to become the largest 5G market in the world.EUROPE:The European 5G development market is improving the usability of M2M / IoT connexions and the rise in demand for mobile broadband services in Europe. However, the slow speed of digitization is hindering business growth. On the other hand, the growth in government programs for the creation of smart cities drives the growth of the 5G development market size.Analysis of Change in Chinese Telecoms 5G Deployment Plans Following China's Early 5G Commercialization.China MIIT (Ministry of Industry and Information Technology) granted 5G licenses to China's three major telecom operators, including China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom, as well as China Broadcasting Network, allowing them to provide commercial 5G services.This move marks the commercialization of 5G six months ahead of schedule. The Chinese government's decision to grant 5G licenses ahead of schedule is to keep up with the U.S., Korea, Switzerland, and the U.K., which have launched commercial 5G services. By doing so, the Chinese government hopes to boost domestic demand to help Huawei overcome the U.S. ban, which has affected its business dramatically.This report provides an overview of 5G service licenses granted to three major Chinese telecom operators as well as looks at their 5G network coverage and examines how their 5G network structure has shifted from S.A. (Standalone) 5G N.R. to NSA (Non-standalone) 5G architecture.Inquire for Regional Data:https://reports.valuates.com/request/regional/MICR-Semi-2I18/5G_Development_in_Korea_United_States_China_Europe_and_JapanKey CompaniesAltiostar AT&T Bouygues Telecom China Mobile China Telecom China Unicom Cisco Datang Mobile Deutsche Telekom AG EE Eir Elisa Ericsson Fujitsu Huawei Huoshenshan Hospital Intel KDDI KT Leishenshan Hospital LG U+ NEC Nokia NTT DoCoMo O2 Orange Quanta Samsung Sercomm SFR SK Telecom SoftBank Sunrise Swisscom Telefonica Telia Three T-Mobile Verizon Vodafone ZT.Buy Now for Single User:https://reports.valuates.com/api/directpaytoken?rcode=MICR-Semi-2I18&lic=single-userSUBSCRIPTIONWe have introduced a tailor-made subscription for our customers.

Showcase USA introduces U.S.-China Trade Solution: Program to help companies start selling in China using cross border e-comm...Send2PressOctober 20, 2020 Tuesday 11:00 AM GMTCopyright 2020 ASC Services II Media, LLCAll Rights ReservedSend2PressCopyright 2020 Send2PressLength: 886 wordsByline: ABC Showcase USADateline: LOS ANGELES, Calif., Oct. 20, 2020 Body Cross border e-commerce is re-writing the rules for international business and particularly for how small and medium sized brands reach the ever growing, but elusive China market. Traditional stocking distributors and importers have been replaced by e-commerce marketplaces that allow Chinese consumers to purchase foreign brands directly from the source via supply points in the United States or through bonded warehouses in China. ABC Showcase USA a leading provider of cross border e-commerce services, international trade and logistics, announced a major expansion of services to assist U.S. brand suppliers to access a comprehensive solution to help sell directly to consumers in China through cross border e-commerce.Cross border e-commerce is dramatically transforming the way foreign brands penetrate the Chinese market. This year more than $250 billion dollars in commerce is expected through cross border e-commerce in China and more than 600 million active online consumers are expected by 2023. Perhaps even more exciting, U.S. companies can start selling their products in China without needing to first commit to costly regulatory approvals, re-labeling or modifications.The rise of cross border e-commerce has brought with it an unprecedented opportunity for American companies to tap sales directly from Chinese consumers. Even with the specter of protracted trade friction between the United States and China, cross border e-commerce offers U.S. brand holders a sensible work around to sell their products in China avoiding high tariffs. New-to-export companies can begin selling their brands direct to consumers in China including in highly regulated product categories such as health supplements, beauty products, pet food, and packaged foods with no need to directly ship their inventory overseas and thus bypassing a traditional stocking distributor. The Chinese government has recently lowered duties on most consumer goods sold through cross border sales to 9.2 %. Coupled with the expanded Chinese individual personal exemption, consumers can now import up to 5000 RMB($720.00) duty free.The team at Showcase USA has simplified the cross border e-commerce process to offer companies a customizable solution to help quickly launch their products rapidly in China. Since the start of 2018, Showcase USA has managed the successful launch of U.S. apparel, beauty, packaged foods, supplements, and innovative consumer goods on Kaola.com, Tmall.com, WeChat and other leading cross border marketplaces.According to Mark Matsumoto, company co-founder,  The Showcase USA program allows U.S. companies a low-risk method to start selling direct to Chinese consumers in as little as 30 days.

Chinese Official Wishes Trump 'Speedy Recovery' While State-Run Media Outlets Mock Trump Virus ResponseUSNEWS.comOctober 2, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; World Report; Vol.; No.Length: 551 wordsByline: Claire HansenHighlight: A top Chinese government official wished the Trumps well. State-aligned media outlets were less kind.BodyChina sent mixed messages Friday in response to news of President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump's coronavirus diagnoses. A top Chinese Communist Party official joined the outpouring of well wishes from global leaders including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Russian President Vladimir Putin. But state-run media outlets posted scathing comments chiding Trump for playing down the COVID-19 threat. [READPresident Trump, Melania Trump Test Positive for Coronavirus]Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying tweeted late Friday morning that she was "saddened" to hear that the Trumps had contracted the virus. "Hope they both have a speedy recovery and will be fine," Hua said in a statement posted roughly 10 hours after the news broke. State-controlled media pushed a different message earlier Friday. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted in English that Trump and the first lady had "paid the price" for their actions. "President Trump and the first lady have paid the price for his gamble to play down the COVID-19. The news shows the severity of the US' pandemic situation. It will impose a negative impact on the image of Trump and the US, and may also negatively affect his reelection," Hu said. The State Department in June designated the Global Times as being controlled by the Chinese government, adding it to a list of eight other media enterprises. China Daily, the country's official English language newspaper and another outlet which the State Department has designated as being under government control, noted in an article that Trump has shirked public health recommendations during the pandemic. "The positive test is yet another reminder that the coronavirus continues to spread, even as Trump has tried desperately to suggest it no longer poses a danger. Since it emerged earlier this year, Trump, the White House and his campaign have played down the threat and refused to abide by basic public health guidelines -- including those issued by his own administration ­­­-- such as wearing masks in public and practicing social distancing," the article said. The pandemic has soured an already frosty relationship between Washington and Beijing. Beijing has pushed back on Trump's repeated efforts to blame China, where the virus originated, for the pandemic. Trump has taken to calling the coronavirus the "China plague," the "Wuhan virus" and other similar monikers in a bid to emphasize his point when speaking in public. News of Trump and the first lady's positive test results was the most searched topic in China on the social media app Weibo in the hours after the news broke, according to the Associated Press. Claire Hansen is a staff writer who covers immigration, gun policy and marijuana policy, as well as general news.

Lawsuit Against US Agency for Global Media Leadership Would Bolster Editorial Independence at International BroadcastersTargeted News ServiceOctober 9, 2020 Friday 9:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4296 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press issued the following news:Five senior executives at the U.S. Agency for Global Media who CEO Michael Pack suspended en masse in August sued the agency, Pack and his aides on Thursday to enforce the statutory "firewall" that preserves the editorial independence of the congressionally funded broadcasters administered by the USAGM.Addressing Pack's repeated firewall breaches has been a priority for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. Following attacks by President Trump and the White House on Voice of America, which is administered by the USAGM, the Reporters Committee sent letters to the Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs Committees urging Congress to preserve the firewall.The Reporters Committee, which operates a legal hotline, has served as a resource for journalists and others affected by Pack's firewall violations. Reporters Committee attorneys have also written extensively about the need to preserve the international broadcasters' editorial independence and have published legal analysis highlighting how Pack's various moves since taking over at USAGM have technically violated the firewall.The suit challenges an array of efforts to interfere with broadcaster operations, including direct editorial interference by Pack aides through investigations of alleged "bias"; Pack's refusal to process J-1 visa renewals for foreign journalists; the mass removal of the executives themselves; and the sidelining or termination of key editorial personnel.The lawsuit, filed by attorneys at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, comes on the heels of a hearing by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs in late September, during which Pack refused to appear despite being subpoenaed. At that hearing, lawmakers from both parties expressed serious concern with Pack's leadership at USAGM. The Reporters Committee echoed those concerns in a letter to the Committee on Sept. 24.Congress established the USAGM in 2016 to replace the Broadcasting Board of Governors as the administrative body responsible for Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks and the Open Technology Fund. OTF is not a broadcaster but a separate nonprofit that advances internet freedom by funding censorship-circumvention technology.While Congress centralized some powers in the CEO of USAGM in 2016, it reaffirmed the statutory firewall that requires the CEO to "respect the professional independence and integrity" of the broadcasters. The firewall has been an express legal mandate since the mid-1970s and has since been affirmed and strengthened under administrations of both parties.According to the lawsuit, Pack -- President Trump's appointee as CEO, who took office in June -- has repeatedly violated the firewall by, for instance:* Suspending the plaintiff executives for attempting to enforce the firewall, reassigning the standards editor at VOA, and terminating the executive editor of Radio Free Asia;* Initiating investigations by aides in the "front office" (political hires versus civil servants) into alleged "bias" in the broadcasters' newsrooms, in stark contrast to past practice where the broadcasters would retain independent auditors to investigate standards violations; and* Refusing, wholesale, to process J-1 visa renewals and contracts for foreign journalists, which has already forced many to leave the United States, crippled smaller language services that depend on their essential journalistic skills and has placed many in fear of having to return to home countries that may retaliate against them for their work on the public's behalf.The lawsuit also follows recent public statements by leadership at USAGM decrying "partisanship" at the broadcasters.On Oct. 2, for instance, Pack issued new "Guidance on Conflicts of Interest" that offered examples of conflicts requiring journalists to recuse themselves from covering stories. The document gave the example of J-1 visa holders, who "must follow normal procedures and recuse themselves from any story involving J-1 visas."On Oct. 6, the USAGM released a statement citing the policies and noting "substandard journalism" at the broadcasters. The statement continued, "It is unfortunate that there is selective outrage by some members of Congress and the press at implementing federal agency policy."At base, the firewall is a legal mandate to ensure that the broadcasters can gather and report the news consistent with the "highest professional standards of broadcast journalism." Accordingly, while "bias" of any stripe at the broadcasters may violate that mandate, the broadcasters themselves are responsible for policing journalistic standards within the newsroom.As the Reporters Committee wrote in the letter to Congress in advance of the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing in September, "interference by the CEO in editorial decision-making, even in the face of perceived 'bias,' is itself a firewall violation."The statutory firewall is the product of the long history of U.S. international broadcasting, which began formally with the launch of Voice of America during World War II to counter Nazi shortwave broadcast propaganda.During the Cold War, a debate raged between policymakers who sought to use the broadcasters to overtly influence domestic politics behind the Iron Curtain, and others who, through experience, realized that providing "surrogate" news services to audiences starved for hard news was more effective in combating totalitarianism. Indeed, U.S. international broadcasting was at its most effective when it could report, openly and critically, about the U.S. government itself.Regardless of ideology or party, the temptation to use U.S. international broadcasting for political ends will never go away. That's why the firewall separating politics from the newsroom is so central to the enterprise.* * *April 28, 2020To: The Honorable Eliot Engel, Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, United States House of Representatives, 2170 Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20515,The Honorable Michael McCaul, Ranking Member, Committee on Foreign Affairs, United States House of Representatives, 2170 Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20515Re: Preservation of editorial independence at Voice of AmericaDear Chairman Engel and Ranking Member McCaul:The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press writes to express its deep concern with recent White House statements attacking Voice of America. The statutory "firewall" protecting VOA's editorial independence, which Congress again affirmed three years ago, is essential for its work. Any attempt by government officials to interfere with the independence of publicly funded media raises the specter of state control and coercion, which should be anathema to all Americans. We ask you in your oversight role to protect VOA's autonomy.As the Committee is aware, the firewall has three components.First, VOA's charter, drafted in 1960 and signed into law under President Gerald Ford in 1976, mandates that VOA news will be "accurate, objective, and comprehensive" and that it will not represent any "single segment of American society."/1 VOA must present "a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions."/2 Second, the 1994 International Broadcast Act, signed by President Bill Clinton, set out a series of standards and principles for U.S. international broadcasters when it consolidated authority over non-military U.S. international broadcasting under the United States Information Agency and the new Broadcasting Board of Governors, which was then a component of the USIA./3 For instance, broadcasting must "be conducted in accordance with the highest professional standards of broadcast journalism"/4 and broadcasters must produce "news which is consistently reliable and authoritative, accurate, objective, and comprehensive."/5 The 1994 law also mandated that the director of the USIA and the BBG "respect the professional independence and integrity" of U.S. international broadcasting services, including VOA./6 When the administration of U.S. international broadcasting moved to the BBG and the USIA was abolished in 1998, Congress retained that language unchanged (save for substituting the Secretary of State for the director of the USIA)./7Third, the National Defense Authorization Act for 2017, which created the U.S. Agency for Global Media and vested administrative authority over U.S. international broadcasters in the chief executive officer of the USAGM, again retained the requirement that the administrators of U.S. international broadcasting "respect the independence and integrity" of the broadcasting services, including VOA./8 That requirement is codified in federal statute./9Taken together, these elements of the firewall are essential protections for VOA's editorial independence, particularly when reporting on high-profile, politically sensitive stories such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The firewall has allowed VOA to become America's largest international broadcaster and a trusted news source around the world--particularly in countries with state-controlled media or widespread censorship. Congress must ensure that this journalistic autonomy is not eroded.The recent White House attacks on VOA misrepresent its reporting in a way that suggests that the ultimate target is VOA's special editorial protections from political interference. In its coverage of the COVID-19 crisis, VOA has nearly 20 times debunked Chinese misinformation./10On April 8, 2020, the day before the White House attacked VOA, a VOA website posted a fact-check detailing why China's official timeline on when it identified the first COVID-19 cases is false. /11In late March, VOA reported that China was undercounting positive COVID-19 cases by omitting asymptomatic carriers, and that the death toll in Wuhan was estimated to be far higher than the official figure./12VOA has reported extensively on Chinese misinformation efforts, including dubious claims that the People's Liberation Army has seen zero cases./13Indeed, like other news outlets in the United States, most of VOA's reporting staff has been "effectively barred" from working in China./14 We are dismayed that China has sought to interfere with independent reporting on this global crisis by revoking credentials for journalists from the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal./15But even with China's attempts to frustrate factual reporting on the pandemic, VOA Director Amanda Bennett has made clear in responding to the White House's attacks that "VOA continues to bring news from inside China to its global audiences and to Chinese citizens."/16 Bennett also cited the firewall in VOA's response to the White House: "One of the big differences between publicly funded independent media, like the Voice of America, and state-controlled media, is that we are free to show all sides of an issue and are actually mandated to do so by law . . . ."/17In contrast to the extensive record cited by Bennett showing VOA reporting fairly, objectively, and comprehensively on Chinese misinformation, the White House has inexplicably attacked VOA for spreading Chinese "propaganda."/18 The one news story referenced in the White House broadsides is an Associated Press report picked up by VOA that stated: "The 3 lockdown that served as a model for countries battling the coronavirus around the world is set to end after 11 weeks: Chinese authorities are moving to allow residents of Wuhan to once again travel in and out of the sprawling city where the pandemic began." /19 The same story also reported "questions about the veracity of China's count [of COVID-19 cases]."/20 No reasonable reader could see the story in question as simply regurgitating Chinese misinformation.The VOA firewall is in place precisely so that U.S. international public broadcasting is not seen as propaganda by viewers, listeners, and readers around the world. Rather, the animating principle behind publicly funded international broadcasting is that an objective, unbiased, editorially independent international broadcaster--one that is free to report critically about the United States itself--is a stronger tool of public diplomacy than state-controlled media. "The long-range interests of the United States are served by communicating directly with the peoples of the world by radio," reads VOA's charter. "To be effective, the Voice of America must win the attention and respect of listeners."/21During a public health crisis the government should be leaning into, not away from, protections for the editorial independence of news organizations, especially when those organizations receive government funding, a group which may grow as Congress addresses the economic fallout from the ravages of COVID-19 on local and regional media. Legal and structural protections, like the VOA firewall, are essential to protecting the independence of all publicly funded media. We urge the Committee to continue to defend the VOA and preserve the independence of U.S. international broadcasting from any political pressure.Please do not hesitate to contact Gabe Rottman, director of the Technology and Press Freedom Project at the Reporters Committee, grottman@rcfp.org, with any questions.Sincerely,Bruce D.

Risch, Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate, 423 Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20510The Honorable Bob Menendez, Ranking Member, Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate, 423 Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20510Re: Preservation of editorial independence at Voice of AmericaDear Chairman Risch and Ranking Member Menendez:The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press writes to express its deep concern with recent White House statements attacking Voice of America. The statutory "firewall" protecting VOA's editorial independence, which Congress again affirmed three years ago, is essential for its work. Any attempt by government officials to interfere with the independence of publicly funded media raises the specter of state control and coercion, which should be anathema to all Americans. We ask you in your oversight role to protect VOA's autonomy.As the Committee is aware, the firewall has three components.First, VOA's charter, drafted in 1960 and signed into law under President Gerald Ford in 1976, mandates that VOA news will be "accurate, objective, and comprehensive" and that it will not represent any "single segment of American society."/1 VOA must present "a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions."/2 Second, the 1994 International Broadcast Act, signed by President Bill Clinton, set out a series of standards and principles for U.S. international broadcasters when it consolidated authority over non-military U.S. international broadcasting under the United States Information Agency and the new Broadcasting Board of Governors, which was then a component of the USIA./3For instance, broadcasting must "be conducted in accordance with the highest professional standards of broadcast journalism"/4 and broadcasters must produce "news which is consistently reliable and authoritative, accurate, objective, and comprehensive."/5 The 1994 law also mandated that the director of the USIA and the BBG "respect the professional independence and integrity" of U.S.international broadcasting services, including VOA./6 When the administration of U.S. international broadcasting moved to the BBG and the USIA was abolished in 1998, Congress retained that language unchanged (save for substituting the Secretary of State for the director of the USIA)./7Third, the National Defense Authorization Act for 2017, which created the U.S. Agency for Global Media and vested administrative authority over U.S. international broadcasters in the chief executive officer of the USAGM, again retained the requirement that the administrators of U.S. international broadcasting "respect the independence and integrity" of the broadcasting services, including VOA./8 That requirement is codified in federal statute./9Taken together, these elements of the firewall are essential protections for VOA's editorial independence, particularly when reporting on high-profile, politically sensitive stories such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The firewall has allowed VOA to become America's largest international broadcaster and a trusted news source around the world--particularly in countries with state-controlled media or widespread censorship. Congress must ensure that this journalistic autonomy is not eroded.The recent White House attacks on VOA misrepresent its reporting in a way that suggests that the ultimate target is VOA's special editorial protections from political interference. In its coverage of the COVID-19 crisis, VOA has nearly 20 times debunked Chinese misinformation./10On April 8, 2020, the day before the White House attacked VOA, a VOA website posted a fact-check detailing why China's official timeline on when it identified the first COVID-19 cases is false./11 In late March, VOA reported that China was undercounting positive COVID-19 cases by omitting asymptomatic carriers, and that the death toll in Wuhan was estimated to be far higher than the official figure./12 VOA has reported extensively on Chinese misinformation efforts, including dubious claims that the People's Liberation Army has seen zero cases./13Indeed, like other news outlets in the United States, most of VOA's reporting staff has been "effectively barred" from working in China./14 We are dismayed that China has sought to interfere with independent reporting on this global crisis by revoking credentials for reporters from the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal./15But even with China's attempts to frustrate factual reporting on the pandemic, VOA Director Amanda Bennett has made clear in responding to the White House's attacks that "VOA continues to bring news from inside China to its global audiences and to Chinese citizens."/16 Bennett also cited the firewall in VOA's response to the White House: "One of the big differences between publicly funded independent media, like the Voice of America, and state-controlled media, is that we are free to show all sides of an issue and are actually mandated to do so by law . . . ."/17In contrast to the extensive record cited by Bennett showing VOA reporting fairly, objectively, and comprehensively on Chinese misinformation, the White House has inexplicably attacked VOA for spreading Chinese "propaganda."/18 The one news story referenced in the White House broadsides is an Associated Press report picked up by VOA that stated: "The 3 lockdown that served as a model for countries battling the coronavirus around the world is set to end after 11 weeks: Chinese authorities are moving to allow residents of Wuhan to once again travel in and out of the sprawling city where the pandemic began." 19 The same story also reported "questions about the veracity of China's count [of COVID-19 cases]."/20 No reasonable reader could see the story in question as simply regurgitating Chinese misinformation.The VOA firewall is in place precisely so that U.S. international public broadcasting is not seen as propaganda by viewers, listeners, and readers around the world. Rather, the animating principle behind publicly funded international broadcasting is that an objective, unbiased, editorially independent international broadcaster--one that is free to report critically about the United States itself--is a stronger tool of public diplomacy than state-controlled media. "The long-range interests of the United States are served by communicating directly with the peoples of the world by radio," reads VOA's charter. "To be effective, the Voice of America must win the attention and respect of listeners."/21During a public health crisis the government should be leaning into, not away from, protections for the editorial independence of news organizations, especially when those organizations receive government funding, a group which may grow as Congress addresses the economic fallout from the ravages of COVID-19 on local and regional media. Legal and structural protections, like the VOA firewall, are essential to protecting the independence of all publicly funded media. We urge the Committee to continue to defend the VOA and preserve the independence of U.S. international broadcasting from any political pressure.Please do not hesitate to contact Gabe Rottman, director of the Technology and Press Freedom Project at the Reporters Committee, grottman@rcfp.org, with any questions.Sincerely,Bruce D.

What's next for TikTok app in USA?; Trump administration eyes China, data privacyUSA TODAYSeptember 21, 2020 MondayFIRST EDITIONCopyright 2020 Gannett Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: MONEY; Pg. 1BLength: 573 wordsByline: Jessica Guynn, USA TODAYBodyFacebook, Twitter and YouTube have your data. Why not TikTok?The Trump administration said Friday that it would bar two popular Chinese-owned mobile apps WeChat and TikTok from U.S. app stores as of midnight Sunday, escalating the U.S. standoff with China."Today's actions prove once again that President Trump will do everything in his power to guarantee our national security and protect Americans from the threats of the Chinese Communist Party," Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.On Saturday, the president told reporters Saturday that he approved a bid by Oracle and Walmart to take over TikTok's U.S. operations. "I have given the deal my blessing, if they get it done that's great, if they don't that's OK, too," Trump said. "We'll see whether or not it all happens, but conceptually I think it's a great deal for America."The Trump administration contends the data collected from American users by TikTok and WeChat could be accessed by the Chinese government."The Trump administration is looking to make sure U.S. TikTok consumer data stays out of Beijing," said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives.Owned by China's ByteDance, TikTok collects user data as do all social media companies."The only difference is the worries around a backdoor to Beijing around user data," Ives said. "Data issues for Facebook, Google and others are viewed much differently by the Beltway compared to the TikTok situation given the Chinese ownership."TikTok says it does not store U.S. user data in China and that it would not hand over that data to the Chinese government.This is the first time a Chinese-owned social media company has commanded the attention - and personal information - of so many Americans, raising national security concerns, said Brian Wieser, president of business intelligence for GroupM.TikTok, which has become a wildly popular platform to share videos in the United States, is estimated to reach about 100 million users here. The Trump administration's worry: The view into the lives of Americans that all the personal information collected could provide the Chinese Communist Party, Ross told Fox Business on Friday."What they collect are data on locality, data on what you're streaming toward, what your preferences are, what you're referencing, every bit of behavior that the American side is indulging in becomes available to whoever is watching on the other side," Ross said. "As you know, China has been taking all kinds of data from all sorts of internet activities and that's what we're trying to squelch."The TikTok ban is the latest move by the Trump administration to counter Chinese influence in the U.S. The president's trade war has blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and cracked down on companies like Huawei. The activities of U.S. tech companies in China are curtailed by Beijing."The U.S. has never made very clear exactly what the national security concerns are and the actions directed at China seem as much about trade and competition and tech's future as national security," said University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias.The collection of the personal information of Americans by data brokers and others is a major problem, but not necessarily a national security problem, said Kirsten Martin,a professor at the University of Notre Dame."Beijing could use any social media platform to target Americans or any ad network to target Americans on any site," Martin said. Load-Date: September 21, 2020End of Document

Trump's TikTok power play may fall shortPolitico.comSeptember 15, 2020 Tuesday 8:30 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1342 wordsHighlight: The proposed deal between Oracle and the Chinese-owned video app isn't the outright sale the president demanded. And it may not resolve U.S. security concerns.BodyPresident Donald Trump aimed for a clear-cut win over China when he demanded that TikTok's Beijing-based parent sell the popular video-sharing app to an American company or be banned from operating in the United States.Now he may have to settle for less.The proposal put before his administration this weekend wouldn't sell the company outright. It's unclear if it will resolve national security concerns about China's access to data on TikTok's 100 million U.S. users, or Chinese control of the algorithm that fuels the app. And the deal came together only after Beijing pulled a power move of its own, by expanding its authority to veto transactions that give up Chinese intellectual property.The president must now decide whether to accept the proposed deal, which would create a tech partnership between TikTok and Oracle, a California-based company closely aligned with Trump. If he rejects it, TikTok could have to cease doing business in the U.S. come Sunday under an order he signed last month.Terms of the proposal were still unclear Monday, although Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said they came with a promise of creating thousands of new American jobs. Also undefined: whether the companies will meet Trump's demand in August that the U.S. Treasury be "well compensated" for making the deal possible.The outcome has symbolic importance for Trump, who has portrayed his reelection as crucial for U.S. hopes of countering China's rise to global dominance."You have the president wanting to be tough on China, not wanting to back down on this ban threat, and so he's kind of painted himself into a corner," said Paul Triolo, a longtime government analyst who now heads the Eurasia Group's geo-technology practice. Meanwhile, he noted, Xi Jinping's government has no desire to be seen "allowing Washington to dictate the sale of a big, important Chinese tech company.""This isn't something that can be solved with the political wave of a magic wand," Triolo added. "The details are going to have to make sense to both sides."One of Trump's congressional allies, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), urged the administration to "promptly reject" the proposal, saying it fails to satisfy concerns about China's influence over the app."An ongoing 'partnership' that allows for anything other than the full emancipation of the TikTok software from potential Chinese Communist Party control is completely unacceptable," Hawley said.TikTok has denied that it's tied to the Chinese government and has said it would refuse any request by Beijing for its users' data.Oracle and ByteDance have disclosed no details of the deal. But they confirmed Monday that they've put forward a proposal for TikTok's future in the U.S. that must now win the Trump administration's blessing.That could be a difficult sell, China watchers warned. Accepting anything short of a sale would contradict Trump's own demands for TikTok. Just Thursday, he told reporters that the company had two options: "We'll either close up TikTok in this country for security reasons or it'll be sold." China hawks say that choice was based on the notion that TikTok's data would be safer in the hands of a U.S. company. So any deal that doesn't resolve the underlying fear about U.S. data being funneled to Beijing shouldn't win the president's approval."If the plan as described for Oracle doesn't meet that objective, then it shouldn't go forward," said Klon Kitchen, director of the Center for Technology Policy at the Heritage Foundation. "The idea of selling to a U.S. company, that was just one of the solutions short of just an outright ban, but the sale itself to U.S. company isn't the objective."Mnuchin told CNBC on Monday that the administration received a proposal over the weekend that purports to address security concerns and, among other provisions, would create a global headquarters for TikTok in the U.S. and generate about new 20,000 jobs. TikTok now runs its U.S. business from Los Angeles and previously pledged to create 10,000 jobs in the U.S. over three years.Mnuchin said the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., an interagency group that examines business deals for national security implications, will review the proposal this week and plans to make a recommendation to Trump.Mnuchin said the administration's priority remains protecting the data of TikTok's U.S. users from being passed along to the Chinese government. "We'll be looking to have discussions with Oracle over the next few days with our technical teams," he said.The arrangement with Oracle first came to light Sunday after Microsoft announced that ByteDance had rejected its competing bid to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. Microsoft previously said it had been in talks to acquire TikTok since earlier this summer, and CEO Satya Nadella spoke with Trump in early August to convince him of the sale's merits.Just days later, Trump issued an executive order requiring ByteDance to cease transactions in the U.S. effective Sept. 20 because of concerns about its ties to the Chinese government. He later signed a separate executive order giving the company 90 days to sell TikTok to a U.S. company, adding that the deal would need the administration's approval.As negotiations between ByteDance and potential suitors were underway, the Chinese government issued regulations of its own. The Ministry of Commerce added algorithms and artificial intelligence technologies, such as those that power TikTok, to an export control list, meaning the government must approve any sale before it can be completed. The Chinese government has since indicated via state media reports that it would not support a forced sale of TikTok to a U.S. buyer.The Chinese government hasn't said whether it consented to the Oracle deal, though ByteDance has said it would "strictly comply" with Chinese regulations.The deal would have one advantage going for it in Washington: In selecting Oracle, ByteDance has picked a partner that has made no qualms about cozying up to the Trump administration. Even as other Silicon Valley heavyweights kept interactions with the president to a minimum, Oracle executives have become close allies of the president and helped fuel his reelection campaign.Oracle's billionaire chair, Larry Ellison, hosted a high-dollar fundraiser for Trump in February at his Rancho Mirage, Calif., home and the company's CEO, Safra Catz, shelled out $125,000 to back the president's re-election effort in May, campaign finance records show.Trump's actions come amid broader political and economic tensions with China that have dominated Trump's time in office and become crowd-rousing rhetoric on the campaign trail. He has touted a trade deal with China as a key success of his administration and blamed Beijing for the United States' failure to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic, which Trump has repeatedly called the "China virus.""I took the toughest-ever action to stand up to China's rampant theft of American jobs," Trump said at a Nevada rally Sunday night, while adding a shot at Democratic challenger Joe Biden. "Biden's agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in the U.S.A."The TikTok deal is the latest result of Trump taking aim at a Chinese technology company from the Oval Office based on accusations that its ties to the government pose a national security threat.Trump has achieved some success driving the Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE out of U.S. wireless networks and pressuring American allies not to use Chinese-made gear for next-generation 5G networks. He also issued an executive order Aug. 6 banning transactions with the messaging app WeChat, which is owned by the Chinese conglomerate Tencent."This administration has been somewhat trigger happy on the use of executive orders to target Chinese companies and I think going into November, going into the election, we are going to see more and more sanctions against Chinese companies," said Samm Sacks, a cybersecurity policy and China digital economy fellow at New America, a Washington-based think tank.Load-Date: September 16, 2020End of Document

VICE MINISTER OF COMMERCE AND DEPUTY CHINA INTERNATIONAL TRADE REPRESENTATIVE WANG SHOUWEN HOSTED A DIALOGUE WITH SOME MEMBER COMPANIES OF JCIPO BY VIDEO-CONFERENCEStates News ServiceOctober 1, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 606 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China:On October 29, Vice Minister of Commerce and Deputy China International Trade Representative Wang Shouwen hosted a dialogue with some member companies of JCIPO by video-conference. The two sides had in-depth exchanges on China's business environment and issues Japanese enterprises are interested in. Yasuhiro Sato, President of JCIPO and Chairman of Mizuho Financial Group, and heads of 28 Japanese companies, including Toyota Motor, Nippon Steel, Toyota Tsusho, Kiraboshi Financial Group, SOMPO, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Toshiba and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and Minister Song Yaoming of the Economic and Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy in Japan participated in the meeting.Wang Shouwen said that China will unswervingly push forward reform and opening up, and strive to create a market-oriented, law-based and international business environment. President Xi Jinping has stressed on many occasions that China should speed up the formation of a new development pattern with the domestic circulation as the mainstay and with domestic and international development reinforcing each other. The Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee made comprehensive arrangements for it. The new development pattern means deeper reform, opening up at a higher level and more market opportunities for goods, services and investment. China welcomes Japanese enterprises to participate in the construction of the new development pattern and share China's development dividend. China is also willing to listen to the opinion and suggestions of Japanese enterprises on China's business environment.Wang Shouwen said that, since the beginning of this year, the Chinese government has taken a series of measures to keep foreign investment stable, including fully implementing the Foreign Investment Law, shortening the negative list for foreign investment market access, speeding up the revision of the Catalogue of Encouraged Foreign Investment Industries, implementing the Regulations on Optimizing Business Environment, promulgating the Rules on Handling Complaints of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, promoting the development of free trade ports and FTZs, upgrading the development of national economic development zones, and promoting the negotiation of RCEP and China-Japan-ROK FTA. He pointed out that, this year, the Chinese government has introduced a large-scale policy on tax cuts and fee reduction to help enterprises cope with the epidemic, and it also applies to foreign-invested enterprises. At the same time, the Ministry of Commerce has set up a team dedicated to major foreign-funded projects to fully assist foreign enterprises to resume work and production and solve problems in their operations.The representatives of Japanese companies spoke highly of the remarkable achievements made by the Chinese government in fighting the epidemic and supporting enterprises to resume work and production, and looked forward to China's further opening up and optimization of its business environment to bring new development opportunities for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and trade. Japanese companies share the optimism about the growth potential of the Chinese market, and their confidence in further development in China becomes stronger.Representatives of Japanese companies also put forward opinion and suggestions on issues such as the return of foreign executives and technicians to China, cooperation in the FCV industry, and facilitation of customs clearance. Wang Shouwen gave responses accordingly.Load-Date: November 4, 2020End of Document

It's been a busy one, guys. Great to see you.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That was an amazing interview with --MARK TEPPER, CEO, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS: Yes.MCDOWELL: -- Joe Germanotta. We're going to talk more about these restaurants reopening as the best interview I've heard on that subject, Maria.BARTIROMO: He was terrific on it and I want to get into it with you because this has a real impact to jobs and the economy.Meanwhile President Trump is defending himself following the release of parts of an interview with Bob Woodward revealing the president intentionally downplayed COVID-19 to avoid panic.Joining me right now is Florida senator, acting chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, Senate small business and CEO Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, chairman member and of the Senate Foreign Relations and Senate Appropriations Committees Marco Rubio. Senator it's great to see you this morning. Thank you very much for joining us.SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): Thank you. That is a lot of jobs, isn't it? You just read out.BARTIROMO: Yes, you've got a lot of jobs. You're a busy guy, I know that. Look, you've been working on so much in terms of getting a stimulus, reacting to this coronavirus with stimulus and I recognize you have been doing a lot in terms of small business.Give us your reaction to what we're hearing from Bob Woodward and what the president said and did once COVID was -- was pretty much known to all of us.RUBIO: Well, look, I haven't read the book. I'm -- we have so much going on here. I'm not going to probably read that or any of the other books that are out. But let me say a couple things about it and I did listen to part of the audio ok.Now what -- first of all, what the president did, I mean despite what you heard on that tape, they did the ban of entry from China. They began to move the operation in government. They ultimately mobilized private industry to have ventilators. At one time there was a real fear that we would have a shortage of those.We are going to have a vaccine faster than any time in the history of the world and it's going to be a real vaccine, not a fake Russian one. So these are all things that have happened and have been mobilized. And they deserve credit for it.Now do I prefer that the American people have been told, more fully, sort of the risks and the threat early on? Sure, I think, there is always the risk of course, that if he had done that in January or early February I could guarantee you, that we would have seen the same reaction that we got when he did the China travel ban and it would have been criticism.He's trying to deflect from him impeachment. Oh he's trying to rob people. In fact there were multiple media outlets that were downplaying the virus threat to the country.So -- but that said, I think in hindsight, you know, few extra weeks of having on the front end, and having done more about it. It would have certainly been helpful. but I don't think that negates all the positive things that they have done to help us respond to this truly unprecedented and historic challenge.BARTIROMO: Yes. In the meantime, the president has been the first president to actually pushback on China and its bad behavior. You've been working a lot on this. Now I've talked to you about this because protecting intellectual property has become top of the agenda.The U.S. revoking visas for more than 1,000 Chinese nationals, a State Department spokesperson noting that those banned are quote, "high-risk" graduate students and research scholars representing a small subset of those entering the United States, for education.Senator, what can you tell us about this? You've have been at the forefront of protecting our information from China. Today calling on Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to review the acquisition of an American nutrition company GNC to a Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical company. How does this happen?RUBIO: Well first of all, that company -- one of the things the Chinese state-owned enterprises have been able to do is to go in as investors and sort of buy up these companies or get ahold of them when they're in distress.Now people say well, who cares about a vitamin company GNC. It not their intellectual property, in that case, it's data. GNC holds data on millions of Americans that have been their customers. If anyone has ever gone to a GNC, you know, you get this account. They take down your phone number. They take down your purchase history, your information, your payment history.Data -- personal data on individuals is probably the most valuable commodity in the world today because everything is going to be built on big data. Everything from intelligence to national security, to the way we sell commercial products, the delivery of precision medicine. And to just turn that over to a country like China that has a clear, not just mercantile, it's economic policy but a predatory one in which they seek not simply to overtake the United States but to dominate geopolitical and economic power in the world is a self-inflicted wound.So, you know, that's the reason why we care about the GNC sell, it's not the vitamins, it's the data and that means needs to be reviewed because that's the data of millions of Americans that are going to belong to the Chinese government.BARTIROMO: That's the same issue when it comes to hotels. There are hotels that are owned by Chinese companies. When you go up to check in, they are taking your picture, they're taking your data -- all of this data is being mined and are -- is the Chinese Communist Party tracking that, tracking American citizens?RUBIO: Well, they most certainly have the ability to if they so wanted it. And any company that tells -- a Chinese company that tells you that that is not true is being disingenuous.Chinese law basically says if we tell you we want the data you have to give it to us. By the way, that's the issue with TikTok. It's not the videos. It is the data. They are collecting extraordinary amounts of data on the people using it, and -- and that happens to be younger Americans. Today their teenagers 10 or 15 years from now they'll be our national security leaders and 25 years from now they'll be the CEO of important companies.And all of that data accumulated over time gives them information, not just about them but the people in their lives. Most 14-year-olds don't own their own phones. That phone is provided to them by a family and parents and others again. And again, I just can't emphasize enough how important data is in the 21st century, and how being able to steal it and operationalize it the way Chinese government can poses a threat to this country.BARTIROMO: Really, really important points that you are making, Senator because that data can be used against us. It's also being used to empower the Chinese military. The Pentagon recently unveiled a list of 20 companies that it says are controlled or owned by the Chinese military including Huawei, many of them -- Hike Vision -- why is this so important as we learned earlier this week that now, the Chinese communist party has built a larger navy than the United States, Senator.RUBIO: So, the United States government, you know, Microsoft has worked for the Department of Defense but don't own Microsoft we don't own AT&T, we don't own Google or Amazon. In the case for these companies, they are structured like independent but you no company in China is independent. None they are all under the control of government.So imagine if you are one of these companies, the state technology company and you are now, providing like Huawei, rural service for broadband and rural service for 5G and so forth. They have to be strategically located near an important American military installations. Or you make these surveillance cameras that have been installed in military facilities.All of that creates the opportunities for backdoors where China doesn't have to send spies, they can just uses a backdoor to get into the camera, get into the Internet, get into the 5G network and have a real time presence in our country, near military bases here and our basis around the world through companies that they control and have to do whatever the Chinse government and military tell them to do.So it's -- it's a very dangerous situation that's important.BARTIROMO: Which is why you have been aiming to stop or limit the amount of investment into the Chinese military from the United States, you know, in terms of stopping investments into China that is what the president tried to do with stopping the thrift fund from investing in Chinese companies that are in many cases building military equipment. He did that with the railroad retirement as well.What is your take on these big IPOs coming? There's XPang (ph), there's Chin Data (ph), and of course then, there's the Ant (ph) Group that's going to go public in Hong Kong.Is this going to some way or another absorb U.S. investments into China to empower their own military? Do people understand --RUBIO: Yes, there's no doubt.BARTIROMO: -- this. And where is this going, Senator. Do you think corporate America understands that maybe they should start thinking about national security issues when it comes to America's safety and not selling their widget to 1.4 billion people.RUBIO: Well, I think some company do, many don't. They are looking for a rate of return on their shares. They want value for their shareholders or want good quarterly performance and investing in companies that have almost exclusive access to the most populous nation on earth. It's attractive to them both in the short and midterm. But that's a big investing in companies almost exclusive access is attractive to them both in the short and midterm.But that is a big, blind spot for us because it's ultimately also driving American investment dollars away from creating jobs, and places in our country that have been deindustrialized and gutted and towards building these national champions that pose a threat to our national security.And you talk about the thrift savings fund. Think about the ironing of this. Members of the U.S. military have their funds invested for retirement in that fund. I mean that money's being used to invest in companies that are building the weapons designed to kill them.That's how ridiculous it isBARTIROMO: Unbelievable. Yes, that is ridiculous.All right let me switch gears, ask you about the Senate aiming to pass the stimulus plan today, Senator, providing $300 a week for unemployment through December 27. Where are the sticking points? Does this bill have any life? I mean do you think this is actually going to pass?RUBIO: Well it should because will make things better. And that's the thing. You can't have, you know, we can't do everything. If we can do something to make things better, this will help people. It isn't ultimately, probably going to become law because I believe Nancy Pelosi and Senator Schumer have made the decision that they are better off doing nothing politically through November.In essence they've calculated, let's do nothing, things will get really bad, people will be hurting. They'll blame Donald Trump and they'll vote against Republicans in November. That is the calculation they've made. And as long as that is the calculation they hold; I think they are going to object to doing anything. And they made that decision a while back.It's unfortunate. I think rank-and-file Democrats are ready to do a deal but they're not allowing them to negotiate or talk to us and as a result small businesses, individual Americans, schools are all going to be hurt -- are not going to get funds that are right there. We can vote on it and pass it because Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have decided that it is better off for them in November and for Joe Biden if we do nothing so things get bad and Donald Trump gets blamed for it.BARTIROMO: That is a sad state of affairs.Meanwhile as far as your role on the Senate Intel Committee, I just want to ask you about the Russia probe. We're waiting on John Durham's investigation. But we know that the FBI briefed the Senate Intel Committee back February of 2018 when it was clear that the dossier was garbage. Did the FBI lie or really -- not -- not have candor with the Senate Intel Committee when it records findings on the dossier in '18?RUBIO: Well, members of the --(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: Yes, yes -- members of the FBI staff met with members of the Intel Committee staff. They did not brief the members individually. But if you go through the final volume of the report, it basically shows you what we said. One of the things that the report basically points to and that I've pointed to was perhaps the single biggest piece of foreign interference in 2016 was the Steele dossier. It was prepared by a foreigner using foreign sources. They tried to inject it into the campaign back in October, that year they were shopping it around to the media. And the FBI gave it credibility when they should not.And they gave her credibility against the advice and the strenuous objection of the intelligence community. They told them don't use this stuff and the FBI moved forward on it anyway. And there needs to be consequences for that.BARTIROMO: Any of course, let's not forget, it was Hillary Clinton who actually paid for that dossier during an election year -- one political party, digging dirt on another.Senator Marco Rubio, it's great to see you this morning, sir. Thank you.RUBIO: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The state of the 2020 race. My next guest hoped for the Republican nomination back in 2016. This time around she is voting for Joe Biden.Joining me right now is former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, and former Republican presidential candidate herself, Carly Fiorina. Carly, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for being here.CARLY FIORINA, FORMER HEWLETT-PACKARD CEO: Great to be with you Maria. thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: you know, I think when you were running for president what you were saying resonated so much with so many people. About the power being concentrated at the top and the decision making there.So tell me why you were voting for Joe Biden, knowing what was so problematic to you back then really which resonated with people. Do you not see that with Joe Biden?FIORINA: I see it with Donald Trump. I think there is no question that power continues to be concentrated in Washington, D.C. Republicans and Democrats have been guilty of that as I said in 2015 and 2016.I mean just look at for example, how money was distributed during the pandemic. All of that money came out of Washington, D.C. with Donald Trump's name on the checks. What we should have done instead is block grant that money to states who would have been more able to target it not towards pension funds that have been mismanaged in too many states but towards small businesses and school districts and individuals.So I think power continues to be concentrated in Washington, D.C. And yes, it is a problem. But you know, Maria I come from the world of business, as do you. And in business, results count.And I think the results sadly of this president are clear whether it's pandemic, whether it is foreign policy whether it is the current state of the economy, where I think long-lasting damage is now being done,I think the results are clear, and I think sadly we need to fire him in November although I voted for him last time around.BARTIROMO: So Carly do you think now that you are seeing a situation where it is really Trump's failures that you are talking about that is causing you to vote for Joe Biden, or do you see policies that Biden has that you believe will resonate? Is this a vote against Trump?FIORINA: Well, I think it is a little bit of both honestly yes, I think it is a vote against Trump and his results but I also think it is a vote against his leadership style.You know, I have said for many, many years that leaders solve problems. They change the order of things for the better. Nd in order to solve problems, a leader collaborates always with others, including those that they don't always agree with.And what Joe Biden has demonstrated -- I don't agree with Joe Biden on everything -- but what he has demonstrated over a lifetime is that he has the humility and the empathy to collaborate with others. He's done it over a lifetime.And I think he will do it now. And I think honestly we need humility and empathy in public life because that is what draws people together. We got a lot of problems; we need to solve them. And it takes I think leadership to solve them. sadly I think Donald Trump has failed every test of leadership.BARTIROMO: Carly, real quick as we wrap up here. If you were to see the Biden-Harris ticket succeed is there any reason to believe that Joe Biden doesn't carry through on four years for a first term and that Kamala Harris becomes president. Would you be comfortable with that?FIORINA: Well that is a wild hypothetical Maria, and I learned in politics not to answer hypotheticals but I would say this.BARTIROMO: Well, it's not that wild. It's -- it's not that wild --(CROSSTALK)FIORINA: I think it is.BARTIROMO: -- given what we've heard from Joe Biden.FIORINA: I think it's -- I think it's pretty wild. I think Joe Biden --BARTIROMO: Ok.FIORINA: -- looks pretty vigorous on the campaign trail. I think Donald Trump is only a few years behind and remember, it wasn't that long ago that Michael Bloomberg was also running who's more senior yet. So I think 70 plus is different today than it was several decades ago.BARTIROMO: Oh, I totally agree with you 100 percent. We're living longer but I'm really talking about the gaffes that Joe Biden has made and the speculation around his wherewithal in terms of what we're hearing from him. It's not really the age, I agree with you.FIORINA: Yes. you know, I think Donald Trump has made a lot of gaffes but I'm more concerns about Donald Trump, for example, telling Bob Woodward on February 7th that the global pandemic is deadly stuff and then telling the American people that seasonal flu was worse.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Carly Fiorina, it's great to see you this morning. Thank you so much.Much more on MORNINGS WITH MARIA stay with us. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Indoor dining coming back to New York City. Restaurants can now resume seating customers inside provided it is at 25 capacity and that will happen on September 30. There will be temperature checks at the door, along with facial mask wearing and social distancing rules. But no bar seating at all.Dagen McDowell, let's talk about this. What do you think?MCDOWELL: Listening to Joe Germanotta talk about the rules being extremely vague, that is going to be one problem, and quite frankly, the vile and dangerous conditions that you see in every New York City neighborhood in our streets, are really I think forcing the governor and the mayor's hands on this. The ability and also the fact that you have that report that about two-thirds of New York restaurants will go out of business, start going out of business by the end of the year unless they can reopen indoors.There is the problem of which you have raised over and over again. That 25 percent capacity you will still have restaurants going under because they can't pay their rent without, you know, being able to fill up.But in terms of the idiocy that we've heard come out of say, Andy Cuomo just recently I think it was last week he recommended that the city council speaker Cory Johnson assemble a task force of 4,000 police officers to enforce social distancing in restaurants.So that is more important for the police than actually arresting criminals in New York City.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. Yes, unbelievable that that is what the task force is going to do, meanwhile, people are getting robbed, attacked, and the crime numbers are skyrocketing.You mentioned Lady Gaga's father and restaurant owner Joe Germanotta who was with us earlier in the last hour and he said 25 percent capacity is not enough to save the industry, I agree.I tweeted about that the other day. These companies are still going out of business and Mark, what about the comment that he made that he's also got to look behind his back to see what kind of spies are outside watching waiting for any break in the rules, or to come and give them a fine. I mean, New York needs the revenue.TEPPER: Yes, right. Right. So yes. The main concern is are they going to either shut you down or are they going to fine you to try and make a couple of bucks?Look. I don't understand where they came up with September 30 first and foremost. Why not do it now, in 25 percent, is totally not enough I don't understand why -- I don't understand why it's not at 50 percent, at 25 percent especially when you get to mid October, where the weather gets dicey, these restaurants are going to go out of business.So this is just completely devastating. I mean it's ruining people's lives. It's putting these restaurant owners out of business. And what I don't hear enough people talking about are the other unintended consequences of this economic shutdown.Overdoses overdose are up, depression is up, suicides are up. Divorce rates are up. So you know, all this stuff this is what happens when people are locked at home, when they're sheltered from other people, and when their businesses go belly-up outside of their control.MCDOWELL: I want to put out something --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: For seniors it's even worse. Go ahead, Dagen.MCDOWELL: Yes. I want to point out something positive though. In my neighborhood garages are full. The people have come back. Of the, you know I don't know where they are working because a lot of the businesses aren't there -- a lot of corporate offices have not reopened but people do seem to be coming back.The restaurants on the streets seem to just based on daily observations do seem to be more crowded, maybe that helps offset the crime. Maybe that help offset the kind of just general mayhem that you have in the streets because more people who are out, that you have -- you know, people -- criminals are less likely to attack somebody ferry fear that well people -- that you get tackled by a crowd of New Yorkers who have had enough of it.But I thought that was a really good sign to see. And we do root for New York I just don't root for the leaders who have turned this city into a hellhole, a living nightmare for most people just want to work and care about their safety.BARTIROMO: What is it going to take to break the city out of what is going on in terms of the crime, and in terms of the massive need for revenue? I mean is it an election? Is it A mayoral election or does it happen sooner?MCDOWELL: It will get a lot worst knowing people who grew up in New York in 1970s this can get much worse than it is right now.BARTIROMO: Well, that is sad to hear, and, you know, we will see if - he Mayor de Blasio is elected again, or if the public will actually say you know what we need change, given the crime numbers given and given the loss of business, and recessionary feel that you are seeing, it is good to hear that you feel more people are out and about, and certainly going back to work.I think the real estate industry is going to be very different and of course, we've got economic numbers coming right now. The initial jobless claims just hitting the tape let's get to Cheryl Casone with the numbers, Cheryl?CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so we are coming in a little bit higher on the initially claims than expected Maria. This is for week ending September 5th, they estimate 846,000 new initial claims we came in at 884,000 new initial claims.Now, the continuing claims numbers that actually ticked a little bit higher 12.925 was the estimate continuing claims came in at 13.358. We are also looking for data on PPI right now, we are looking at August PPI consumption up 0.3 percent that is a little bit better than expected, for consumption.If you look at core numbers this is all crossing right now, if you take out the core number final demand - I told you about that before the core is splitting food and energy year-over-year looks like it came in, at - right here 0.6 percent, 0.6 percent.So we're giving all of these numbers crossing right now but, again, looking at the - the rest PPI numbers really quick here Maria. Month over month for August gained a 0.3 percent I gave you that year-over-year we were looking for decline of 0.3 percent on regular streamlined PPI that came in at a loss 0.2.And then the month-over-month for August excluding food and energy a gain of 0.4 percent we were looking for 0.2, and then the core PPI year-over- year looking for 0.3 and again I already gave you that number 0.6 percent.Now real quick as I send it back to you in the panel we were at 59.29 million claims so far since the pandemic began. This now takes us over 60 million, initial claims, this is in line by the way, the initial claims number with fact that we're seeing job postings down about 20 percent year- over-year in employment picture and also these initial claims still include self-employed and gig workers. And that's something that the government have instituted when the pandemic began Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, thank you so much Cheryl. We are watching a market that has really not moved all that much on these numbers although we are off the lows, DOW Industrials down 92 NASDAQ is up 47 points.We got an exclusive interview on the other side of this break and the Founder of Anduril Industries Palmer Luckey will join me with an exclusive announcement on drones don't miss it. Hello Palmer, we will be right back with you don't miss it back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, the most intelligent drone yet breaking news coming from Anduril Industries this morning. Anduril Industries reporting and launching its Ghost 4 drone program.This is a fully autonomous military drone that can be flown from anywhere in the world. Joining me right now to talk more about this in Fox Business Exclusive is the Founder of Anduril Palmer Luckey. Palmer it is great to have you this morning thanks so much for joining us.PALMER LUCKEY, ANDURIL INDUSTRIES FOUNDER: --thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: We know that this is the latest in a series of ghost products tell me about the Ghost 4 and why this drones in particular so is unique Palmer?LUCKEY: Sure. So men and women who are serving on the frontlines fighting for freedom deserve the very best technology. Previous versions of Ghost have been used by U.S. forces and allied forces including the UK Royal Marines Future Commando Force for quite some time now.And as we worked with them we've asked what do you want to see in a drone? What do you want to see that right now is only available in Chinese drones? And Ghost 4 is kind of the result of that. We wanted to make something that was the best drone in the world that you can carry around anyway.It could be flown from anywhere in the world like a predator but that's where the similarities end. It is a fully autonomous drone that can be used - you lived to by anyone anywhere in the world that it can be carried in a very small backpack and actually packs into a carry case smaller than - which is pretty incredible.It's almost its nearly silent. It can fly for over 100 minutes on a scale with a standard battery pack at the - and most importantly you can treat it more like a real person in real aircraft because of onboard AI core unless like a remote controlled airplane.You can get tasks like going out and finding people, going out and tracking a vehicle, patrolling a perimeter autonomously. And they can actually do this in large swarms as well so they're designed from the start to be an AI teaming base aircraft where you can have dozens of airplanes controlled by a single operator and that's a capability game-changer for military operations.BARTIROMO: Palmer I know another capability is that it can operate underwater and I know that you worked with various government officials to find out what they need in terms of this technology? Ghost 4 drones can also communicate with each other; right?LUCKEY: That's right. So they can swarm together communicate with each other and collaborate on very complex tasks. As for being underwater Ghost is totally waterproof saltwater proof you can immerse it in water and then take it out and fly. If you want to take it swimming with you that is OK that's not going to be able to swim in the water with you. You're going to have to drag it along.I know it is part of an effort to make this thing, to - with survive rigors of military use, I mean it is making a shock proof, heat proof, cold weather proof - proof and making sure they can survive in any kind of wet or dry conditions.And that is something that most drones don't have even most military drones, something that we talked about before, in fact, that China for the last 10 years has really been dominating in the drone space.If you go to CS every the best drones are made by Chinese companies, and it is to the point where you have military units, throwing away drones that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars so that they can use Chinese drones that cost hundreds of dollars.Ghost 4 means that for the first time in a long time United States is back on top when it comes to portable drones.BARTIROMO: Palmer, this is really important because this story and your announcement today is not just an innovation announcement this is also a story, about China. And the fact that the U.S. has been so reliant on China even when it comes to drones and this is a military product, as the CCP the Chinese Communist Party is trying to overtake the United States and become the number one military power.LUCKEY: Yes, huge problem because even a lot of the U.S. drone companies end up going to China for all of their manufacturing, leaning heavily on Chinese supply chains, Chinese research and development, Chinese components.There is a point where you have to realize that most American products are really Chinese products. And we tried to do something very different with Ghost, where we designed in U.S. we've made in the U.S.We really relied on supply chain that is - where all the critical components are coming from close allies of the United States like Korea, like Japan, like Germany, like the United Kingdom, and that is the right way to build things, for customers where the security implications are huge.I think you and I have a lot of agreements on this also within networking and telecommunications space. The United States especially when it comes to the military needs to get off its reliance on Chinese technology.And Ghost 4 is just one step towards doing that, and the nice thing is that in the past getting off Chinese drones, meant using inferior technology now the best solution is the American solution. I am very proud of that.BARTIROMO: This is really important, and you should be proud of this when I came to visit you, at your headquarters during my special on artificial intelligence we talked about how China was very close to winning on AI.This is pictures of you showing me some of the drones in the drone zone, at Anduril Industries. Let me ask you about that because corporate America does not seem to get it. I mean Palmer, you are a patriot you want to come up with the most innovative and best things for the U.S. military, because you recognized, the threat, others do not.You and I had a conversation, about Google and how Google's employees just balked at the fact that Google was working with government. So what does Google management do? They Google cancelled Project Maven. They walkway from Department of Defense and then your company got that project.You worked with Department of Defense and at the time you said to me imagine if during World War II our American companies said oh well, I want a foothold in imperial Japan so I'm not going to work with U.S. government. Imagine what that would have meant? You think about these things in terms of working with the United States government aren't you?LUCKEY: Yes, that is why I started the company. I mean, I started this company because I saw a really disturbing trend for the first time in American history the most innovative American technology companies are refusing to do work with Department of Defense, whether it is for completive reasons for PR reasons, for employee protest reasons.So I wanted to - and at the same time the defense technology companies like - I didn't feel like they were the people who were going to be able to lead the way, in areas like autonomy in robotics. They are good at some things but they aren't good at everything.So I wanted to start a company where I can take people from high-tech companies and put them to work in a new type of defense Product Company where we used our own money to decide what to build? How to build it? When it is done?To build the things that the government wants but doesn't yet believe are possible that they are still in realm of science fiction. And that is why I started the company because I want the United States to have the best technology. I want us to be ready to rules around our - and war fare just like we got to write the rules around the use of nuclear technology in warfare.BARTIROMO: Well, it is just extraordinary, that corporations do not recognize the national security threat that is Chinese Communist Party another thing that didn't get any press when it happened was Google acquired Boston Dynamics.Now this is one of the most important robotic companies right Palmer? And what happened when they acquired Boston Dynamics they cancelled all the defense contracts they had with the U.S. government.LUCKEY: That's right. Well, really big problem with that is it creates a lot of problems for other technology companies too because you have to understand that inside of the Pentagon inside the Department of Defense there is a contingent that only wants the old traditional defense contractors to do all this work.And when Google was getting its contracts even when Boston Dynamics was getting this contact you had these detractors saying we should not give these contracts to these companies. They are going to abandon us. We have to get them to the companies that will stick with us.And unfortunately they were proven right and that actually makes it harder for companies like mine it makes it harder for other small innovative American businesses to do work continuity, because they are afraid that they are afraid these technology companies are basically going to abandon them in their time of need.And that is why I think it is important for business leaders and technology leaders to stand up, like you've seen with Jeff Bezos actually, and say you know what we're going to work at the military America is something special we are American company and they're always going to have access to our best technology.That's one of the reasons I have so much respect for Jeff is because he knows which side he is on? He has taken a side and he is not going to be cowed, because of that United States can rely on him. And I want to be in the same position.BARTIROMO: I like that and what you are going to keep going is innovating, and regardless of what is happening behind closed doors at the Pentagon, you are going to come out with the best product as what you have done again with Ghost 4. Congrats Palmer and thanks very much for announcing exclusively right here.LUCKEY: Right, we'll see what's coming next Maria?BARTIROMO: All right, good to see you Palmer Luckey, thank you so much. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back we have this Fox Business Alert right now CITI CEO Michael Corbat announcing this morning that he does plans to retire in February of 2021, after 37 years at the bank the last 8 as CEO, the Board of Directors has selected Jane Frazier as his successor.CITI's current President and CEO of Global Consumer Banking will succeed Michael Corbat again the CEO of CITI will retire in February of 2021. Well, football is back, the NFL kicking off its highly anticipated season tonight. Six games are airing on Fox this Sunday beginning at 1 pm eastern.Joining me right now is the CEO of Fox Sports, Eric Shanks, Eric; it is great to have you. I'm sure a wealth of news report that sports is coming back, what COVID-19 changes will we see tonight? And how will the NFL look different on Fox?ERIC SHANKS, FOX SPORTS CEO: Well, if I hear the word unprecedented one more time, I may kick it out of my dictionary completely not but the thing it is not unprecedented. We're going to kick the NFL off tonight on time safely in Kansas City.And as far as I know there are going to be some fans in the stadium there in the Kansas City so that's tonight. And then we're looking forward to kicking off Fox NFL Sunday with the biggest game of the weekend between Tom Brady and Drew Brees on Sunday afternoon.BARTIROMO: That is going to be the biggest game and there is going to be a lot of eyes on this big game Sunday. Eric what is going to be different how should we expect the game on Sunday to look different now that we've got these new protocols in place to ensure safety?SHANKS: Maria it is not going to look that different. The - the shots on the field are going to look exactly the same as if not better because we actually have more access on the sidelines and you can put cameras in, probably better places than as the stadiums were actually full.So honestly it is going to sound as good. It is going to look as good on the wide shots in certain stadiums you are just going to see some signage rather than fans. And we are actually in our Bears-Lions game we were testing a whole stadium of virtual fans on the wide shots, just to see if that makes it more exciting, and more normal.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, that sounds great that it is not going to look so much different. Eric I want to get your take on the impact of sports and this interruption in business how severe and significant it has been as we all look toward more normalization in the future?Stay with us we'll take a short break and then I'm going to get your take on business today and the impact on business of sports coming back. We will talk viewership right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, we are back with my exclusive with Fox Sports CEO Eric Shanks. Eric, I want to talk about viewership and what I always say is that sports, is the highest premium price intellectual property of all.There is a reason that it is priced at a premium because that is where the eyeballs are. So having sports go away during this pandemic is a big deal, characterize that deal for us? And also going into the pandemic, I know that there were lots of renewals and expiration of media partners with the NFL. What does that look like right now?Fox, of course, is the leading NFL partner given the Thursday and Sunday night games and then the game of the week. Are you expecting changes in terms of digital competitors because I know everybody wants it from Amazon to Facebook?SHANKS: Sure. So I think the first question for us Maria during the pandemic, in early March when everything shut down just like anybody else running a business it is pretty tough to run a business when your supply completely runs out. And so like all of our other peers we started scrambling and filling airways with things like, I-racing, using NASCAR drivers and just kind of getting by until actually NASCAR came back.I think the UFC came back first along with NASCAR and now you get from an under supply to what a lot of sports fans are seeing this past weekend with the Kentucky Derby and NBA playoffs and NHL playoffs. You go from being in the desert to your cup running over and having more sports than you can keep track of.But really all is kind of an appetizer up until this weekend when the NFL kicks off. And you know business, the marketers who we rely on for advertising, we know that demand is there from viewership but from the marketing standpoint, demand is good in the sense that there haven't been a lot of big places, for the big marketers reaching audiences.And then as far as the renewals go we're talking about reaching audiences. You know look, we love being the NFL's biggest partner. Fox was literally 26 years ago, Fox Sports at least was born to do football. We didn't exist until we got the NFL rights, in 1994 so we like to think that Fox is football and Fox is primarily a place for Americans to come watch football whether it is NFL or college.And, you know, the talks are ongoing. We would love to reach a resolution that keeps us in premier partnership spot with NFL and quite-honestly the new Neilson Universe came out, broadcast television reaches 96.5 percent of all Americans in the U.S. far exceeding any other technology, actually, other than radio so still old-fashioned radio reaches more people every week, than any other technology, in America.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a critical point and an important one. Let me bring in Dagen McDowell. Go ahead Dagen.MCDOWELL: Eric, you talked about the sports desert that we were all experiencing, in this spring but now you're faced with an embarrassment of riches. Talk about how you're juggling the production for all of these gigantic sports and sporting events coming in the fall?SHANKS: Well, you know on the operations level there has been some silver ling and I'm sure that at Fox News I know that you know we see the same thing, in that we are doing things now in ways that we never thought we would have to do them.We are learning, that there are some things that are actually better, so for example, we are producing 16 events, in the next 36 hours, some of them are produced on-site and some of them are produced not on-site just having the camera people there and the audio people there and producers and talent elsewhere.Maybe not even in same place around the country. And then there are some events where the majority of people are on-site but we have let's say 25 or 30 percent of the workforce back here in Los Angeles, doing things like replays and graphics.And so what happens then is one person can actually go do the pipe - the Packers-Vikings game replays and then later on in the afternoon, those folks can do the Bucks game against Saints. So connectivity and the cloud have really enabled us to do a lot of things that we are just going to keep doing going forward.BARTIROMO: And I don't think you have that kind of marketing muscle you don't have that kind of euphoria, when it comes to digital that you are providing on a broadcast level in terms of all of the hype, and - pomp and circumstance around the broadcast show. Real quick let me get Mark in here. Mark Tepper?MARK TEPPER, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS, PRESIDENT AND CEO: I'm pumped. I mean, September in my opinion is the best month of the year. You get great weather, you get the return of football, unfortunately, you are going to have limited fans.So when you have less opportunity to attend a game more people are going to watch on TV, and you look for excitement elsewhere. So my take is the big winner is going to be the sports betting industry and that is where the money is at.BARTIROMO: And you say Eric?SHANKS: Well, as you guys.Load-Date: September 10, 2020End of Document

Donald Trump's "blessing" to a last-minute deal would allow TikTok to remain in americaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 20, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 698 wordsBodyA blessing from U.S. President Donald Trump to a last-minute deal would allow TikTok to continue operating on American soil. Thus, within hours of the ultimatum that his administration had given the Chinese app to leave the country, the door opens so that the ByteDance company agrees with Oracle and Walmart can continue. The cold tech war that the Republican and his administration has been leading against the Chinese Communist Party for months, which he accuses of stealing personal data through TikTok, thus enters a kind of breaking point in which Trump, as he likes, acts as a kind of Roman Caesarturning his thumb up or down, as he pleases.At a campaign event this Saturday in Arkansas, Trump uttered the phrase that the app's 100 million users were waiting to hear."Ihave given my blessing to the agreement, if they succeed it would be great and if not, it would also be fine, but it is a great deal for the U.S.," said the president, who soon after added that he approves the agreement "as a whole."The Tik Tok app, a subsidiary of China's ByteDance, announced Saturday that it had prepared an agreement involving Oracle as a technology partner in the United States and Walmart as a business partner. All under threat of prohibition in the United States,"We are pleased that TikTok, Oracle, and Walmart's proposal addresses security concerns raised by the U.S. administration and questions about TikTok's future in the United States," a spokesman told AFP.Now, that possible arrangement has the go-ahead of Trump, the main detractor of the Chinese app being used on Americans' phones.Without going far, on Friday the US Department of Commerce will not be able to do so. The U.S. announced that it would block downloads from Tiktok and the WeChat messaging network (the Chinese Whatsapp) on U.S. app purchase sites starting Sunday, September 20.The plan, they explained, would include a second stage in which the country's authorities would veta their full use on U.S. territory as of November 12. Always citing concerns in national security.Trump did not clarify on Saturday whether the principle of agreement will paralyze the measures his government plans to take starting Sunday against TikTok and WeChat.Trump has repeatedly said that TikTok, one of the most growing social media in recent years, poses a "threat" to U.S. national security. That's why he forced his sale to an American company.The representative stressed this Saturday that Oracle and Walmart would partner with Tiktok, "security would be 100%, they will be using separate clouds and very powerful security, and will be making a $5 billion contribution in education.""We'll see if it happens or not, but conceptually I think it's a great deal for the U.S.," said the president, who noted that if a pact were reached, 25,000 jobs will be created, mostly in Texas and that it will be a new company, although it will keep TikTok's name.According to the U.S. Government, TikTok and WeChat "collect vast amounts of user data, including network activity, location, and search and browsing history."These companies, according to the Department of Commerce, are active participants in the combination of civilian and military activities in China and are subject to mandatory cooperation with the intelligence services of the Chinese Communist Party.China noted Friday that it will act against companies and individualsforeigners who "endanger" their sovereignty and security, and issued new rules related to their list of "unreliable entities," announced more than 15 months ago and not yet published, which could sanction U.S. firms and individuals in response to Trump Administration measures.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs opposes the forced sale of TikTok, an operation that it believes violates the principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO).The Chinese government sees its intention to sell TikTok as one more chapter of the Beijing-Washington trade war, which seeks to contain the growing technological power of the Asian giant, which has already seen telecoms firm Huawei face restrictions, as well as the popular social network WeChat, owned by digital conglomerate Tencent.PJBSource:?

ByteDance and Oracle differ in terms of pact by TikTokCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 22, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 842 wordsBodyTwo days after the White House gave its blessing to an agreement to keep TikTok alive in the United States, confusion over who will own it and will have control of the popular short video app threatened to derail an already complicated process.ByteDance, the owner of Beijing-based TikTok, and Oracle, which intends to operate and safeguard the application in the US, published conflicting statements about who will be in charge of TikTok Global, the new U.S.-based company that was created through the agreement.The two sides seemed to disagree on whether ByteDance will maintain the economic ownership of TikTok Global, which has been a point of friction in the negotiations of the agreement.President Donald Trump also spoke out and pledged to act if TikTok Global is not controlled by US firms. "If we find out they don't have full control, we're not going to approve the deal," he told Fox News.The two parties are interested in presenting the agreement in accordance with their national hearings, as the deal will need approval from Washington and Beijing.ByteDance reported yesterday that TikTok Global will be a "one hundred percent owned" subsidiary, adding that after raising funds before a possible initial public offering, it will have an 80 percent stake.However, later, Oracle Executive Vice President Ken Glueck said ByteDance "will not own TikTok Global" and that the shares of the new entity will "be distributed to its owners," and the Americans will become majority shareholders.Some people who participated in the negotiations claimed that ByteDance is considering a distribution of TikTok Global shares to its current investors, including Sequoia Capital, General Atlantic and Coatue Management, which eventually makes U.S. companies majority owners of the firm. One of the people said that the terms are still flowing and that the timing of the distribution of shares was unclear.Sooner or later, 53 percent of TikTok Global will be owned by US companies, after the proposed distribution of shares, according to a person who participated in the negotiations; however, other people who were also in the talks said ByteDance's Chinese sponsors are against distributing shares to current investors.The take and daca also raised doubts about the agreement in China. Late yesterday in Beijing, the editor of the State-affiliated Global Times of China said the Chinese government will not approve the current agreement "because it will jeopardize China's national security, interests, and dignity."In a statement, ByteDance indicated that the proposal does not include "source code or technology transfer". Oracle and Walmart said "all TikTok technology will be in TikTok Global's possession," but did not specify who will control it.ByteDance once again questioned the $5 billion figure Trump said the company will pay to fund an educational fund as part of the deal. It stated that this was an estimate of the future taxes that TikTok Global will be able to pay, but the actual amount will depend on the company's growth.ByteDance has to argue that there is no technology transfer to the US to appease the Chinese government, which banned unqualified exports of recommendation algorithms.But Luo Zhiyu, a lawyer at Beijing-based law firm Jingsh Law Firm, said a technology transfer from a Chinese company to a company "under the jurisdiction of US law" will be considered an export andyou will still have to go through technology export procedures.ByteDance also stated that Oracle has "the right to conduct security inspections in TikTok source code in the US."The Trump weekend granted preliminary approval of the TikTok agreement after threatening to ban the application for security reasons. The US Department of Commerce also said it will delay an order to Apple and Google to remove the app from their U.S. stores until September 27, which will give companies time to finalize their agreement.With information from: Miles Kruppa, James Fontanella-Khan and Richard WatersPropertyOracle and Walmart said they will have a combined 20 percent stake in TikTok Global, which "will be the majority property of U.S. investors."ParticipationFor its part, ByteDance claimed it was a "rumor" that TikTok Global's major shareholders are Americans and said it will own 80 percent of the new firm.TechnologyByteDance agreed that Oracle should audit TikTok's source code; this may involve access, but not a "transfer." It is unclear whether TikTok Global will own whether to license the technology.CouncilThe Chinese company noted that "among the directors of TikTok Global's board of directors will be ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming, ByteDance board members and Walmart's CHIEF executive."Public offeringByteDance also confirmed yesterday plans for an initial public offering from TikTok Global. Oracle has said this will be realized in less than 12 months on a U.S. stock exchange.SuppliersTikTok Global will provide video application services to users in the US and "most in the rest of the world," while Oracle will become the cloud provider.Load-Date: September 23, 2020End of Document

Nvidia's $40 billion Arm deal might hit a snag with ChinaCNN WireSeptember 17, 2020 Thursday 8:21 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 979 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  The battle between the United States and China for control of critical technology could doom a record-breaking deal for British chip designer Arm.The proposal from Nvidia to buy SoftBank-owned Arm for $40 billion requires regulatory approval from the United Kingdom, the European Union, the United States and China. But universal approval isn't guaranteed. And there's already an indication that China might not be happy about an American firm owning an important and strategic player in the semiconductor industry. An op-ed published this week in The Global Times, a state-run Chinese tabloid, characterized California-based Nvidia's deal for Arm as "disturbing" for the Chinese and European tech companies that rely on the company's advanced chip designs. "If Arm falls into US hands, Chinese technology companies would certainly be placed at a big disadvantage in the market," read the op-ed.Chinese regulators haven't spoken publicly about the deal, but state-run media is often viewed as a barometer of sentiment among senior officials. And China's influence is key: The last time a semiconductor deal of this size was attempted, it failed. In 2018, Beijing declined to approve American chip company Qualcomm's proposed $44 billion takeover Dutch counterpart NXP.Given the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China, "we believe that obtaining all necessary global regulatory approvals will be challenging," Citi analysts Atif Malik and Amanda Scarnati wrote in a note on Monday. Nvidia and Arm said they expect that the deal will take 18 months to close, "which we believe signals that they expect a protracted and detailed review by [the Ministry of Commerce] in China," the analysts added.Tightening US restrictionsSemiconductors power everything from smartphones to self-driving cars. The industry has consolidated over the years because designing and manufacturing cutting edge computer chips requires huge amounts of cash for research and development. Arm, which is based in Cambridge and is known as one of Britain's most successful tech companies, designs chips used by Samsung, Apple and other major smartphone makers. Many leading Chinese semiconductor design firms --- such as Huawei subsidiary HiSilicon --- use Arm intellectual property for their cutting edge designs, too. "Arm has been really useful for China because UK [export] rules are a bit more lax," said James Lewis, senior vice president and director of the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). Nvidia and Arm have offered reassurances that the British firm will remain neutral. As part of Nvidia, Arm will continue "maintaining the global customer neutrality that has been foundational to its success," the companies said in a statement announcing the deal on Sunday.But if Arm is acquired by an American company, it would likely be subject to US regulations --- and Washington has been increasingly using export controls to cut Chinese tech firms off from key technology."If they moved to Nvidia they would fall under American export rules which have significantly tightened over the last few years," Lewis said.Earlier this year the United States issued fresh sanctions against Huawei that restricted the Chinese tech company from buying chips from semiconductor manufacturers that use American machinery, software or technology. Analysts called the move a "lethal blow" and a "death sentence" for Huawei, which needs leading edge chips to power its smartphone and telecommunications gear. The US Department of Defense and other government agencies are also reportedly considering banning exports to SMIC, China's biggest chipmaker, which would significantly hamper Beijing's efforts to build an advanced domestic semiconductor industry. "Control over Arm by a US company could mean potentially more restrictions on use of Arm technology by Chinese firms that come under new export controls or other US regulatory action," said Paul Triolo, head of geo-technology at Eurasia Group. He added that Chinese regulatory officials will likely "be looking for some conditions to place on the deal" to preserve access to that intellectual property. Arm has a joint venture in China, which is developing its own capacity for semiconductor intellectual property design, and Chinese regulators could "require Arm China to be spun off" to ensure it doesn't come under US regulatory action, he said. Winning over ChinaAnalysts at brokerage firm Morningstar point out that Nvidia received the green light from Chinese regulators earlier this year for its $7 billion acquisition of US-firm Mellanox, which sells networking and storage equipment.But "the magnitude and significance of this potential deal [to acquire Arm] will undergo heightened scrutiny, in our view," Abhinav Davuluri, sector strategist with Morningstar, wrote in a note on Tuesday. The Global Times op-ed asked regulators to "extensively investigate and study the potential implications behind the deal," adding that the "stakes behind the deal are high."The "possibility that Arm could be politicized as a US technology weapon against China's technology companies must be taken seriously," the op-ed said.Being mentioned in such a manner by the Global Times "is not a good sign" for Nvidia, said Lewis, of CSIS. He called the paper an "excitable mouthpiece" for the Chinese government.And even if the Nvidia-Arm deal gets the go-ahead from China, it may not be entirely out of the clear. Some politicians in the United Kingdom have expressed concern about preserving jobs at Arm, which could come up as the deal is reviewed there. And Nvidia's rivals --- which purchase chip designs from Arm --- are likely to object.--- Michelle Toh contributed to this report. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

China-backed hackers hacked 100 companies and agencies around the worldCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 17, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 644 wordsBodyWASHINGTON - The Justice Department has just announced that a group of hackers associated with China's main intelligence service had infiltrated more than 100 companies and organizations around the worldto steal intelligence, hijack their networks and extort their victims.The U.S. government presented the charges in a set of three open opinions Wednesday that showed the scope and sophistication of China's attempts to illegally advance its economy and become the dominant global superpower through cyberattacks.The allegations also say that some of the hackers had worked with Malaysian nationals to steal and launder money through the video game industry. "The Chinese government has made a deliberate decision to allow its citizens to commit intrusions and computer attacks around the world because these actors will also help the People's Republic of China," Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosensaid, referring to the People's Republic of China at a press conference at which he announced the charges. The District of Columbia's acting prosecutor, Michael R. Sherwin,noted that some of the authors considered their association with China to provide "a free license to hack and steal worldwide." Hackers - Zhang Haoran, Tan Dailin, Jiang Lizhi, Qian Chuan and Fu Qiang - targeted social media and other technology companies, universities, government agencies and non-profit organizations, according to the allegations.They had such scope in part because they used a so-called supply chain attack that allowed them to break into software companies and embed malicious code in their products.Once those products were installed on other systems, hackers could use the code they had planted to break into them.The attack described by Justice Department officials on Wednesday was one of the first.Some of the Chinese hackers also worked with two Malay entrepreneurs to use video game platforms to rob businesses and wash away illegal profits.The businessmen, Wong Ong Hua and Ling Yang Ching, were arrested Monday in Malaysia, authorities said. Criminal computer activity and hackers under the group names Advanced Persistent Threat 41, Barium, Winnti, Wicked Panda and Panda Spider were tracked by cyber researchers, authorities said. "They engaged video game distributors to proliferate malware, which could then be used for subsequent operations,"said John Hultquist, senior director of threat intelligence at cybersecurity company Mandiant.The group initially known as Wicked Spider for researchers at CrowdStrike, California's cybersecurity company, seemed to be hacking for profit.But as of late 2015, there was a noticeable change. The group, which had focused predominantly on gambling companies, moved to a long list of companies in the United States, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan operating in agriculture, hospitality, chemicals, manufacturing and technology whose intellectual property would help China's official Five-Year Plan, the nation's high-level policy plan. His techniques changed, too. In the past, it was known that the group usedsimilar malware in their attacks, but that year their hackers began using a more sophisticated set of attacks on the supply chain.In late 2016, investigators concluded that hackers who had known as Wicked Spider were operating at the bee of the Chinese state and changed their nickname to Wicked Panda.Panda was CrowdStrike's nickname for hacker groups acting under the orders of the Chinese government. When the allegations were announced on Wednesday, investigators applauded the effort. "The U.S. government is beginning to turn the tide of Chinese intrusion operations into Western businesses and targets," said Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike's head of threat intelligence.Verizon, Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet,Google's parent company, helped the government in its research.Look too       Load-Date: September 18, 2020End of Document

Congressional Research Service Report: 'TikTok: Technology Overview & Issues'Targeted News ServiceOctober 24, 2020 Saturday 9:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2716 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Congressional Research Service issued the following report (No. R46543) entitled "TikTok: Technology Overview and Issues". Here are excerpts of the report issued on Oct. 21 and written by Patricia Moloney Figliola, specialist in internet and telecommunications policy:TikTok is a globally popular video-sharing smartphone application (app) owned by ByteDance Ltd., a privately held company headquartered in Beijing, China. It is under increasing scrutiny by the U.S. government as a potential privacy and security risk to U.S. citizens. This is because ByteDance, like all technology companies doing business in China, is subject to Chinese laws that require companies operating in the country to turn over user data when asked to by the government. Researchers differ over how TikTok's collection of user data compares with other social media apps and whether TikTok poses a unique threat to the privacy and security of its U.S. users.TikTok launched in the United States in August 2018. The app is available in over 155 countries in 39 languages and has approximately 800 million monthly active users. In the United States, the app has approximately 49 million monthly active users. TikTok's appeal lies heavily on what has been called its "addictive" video feed, For You. The app builds this feed through a "recommendation engine" algorithm built on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and data mining practices.According to the company, the recommendation engine relies on a complex set of weighted factors to recommend content, including hashtags and videos watched previously, as well as the kind of device a person is using. TikTok critics cite problems with how much data TikTok collects from and about its users and with how that data is stored--and could be shared.On August 6, 2020, President Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at stopping TikTok from doing business in the United States. Once in effect on September 27, 2020 (an extension from the original date of September 20), the order will prohibit any U.S. company or person from "transacting" with ByteDance. On August 14, 2020, the President issued a second Executive Order stating that ByteDance, its subsidiaries, and partners must divest from all assets that support TikTok's operations in the United States and destroy all previously collected U.S. user data. Divestiture may be accomplished by finding a U.S. buyer for TikTok. The requirements are designed to limit the Chinese government's access to current and future data from U.S. TikTok users. ByteDance does not want to divest from TikTok and has sued the Trump Administration.On September 14, 2020, Oracle announced that it had reached an agreement with ByteDance to "serve as [the company's] trusted technology provider" in the United States. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that he had received the proposal. From the terminology used, it appears that the deal may involve a partnership between the two companies rather than a sale. This arrangement would keep the source code of the For You recommendation engine in the hands of ByteDance.It is unclear if this deal satisfies the conditions in President Trump's Executive Orders. Secretary Mnuchin said that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States will review the proposal and present President Trump with its opinion.On September 19, 2020, Oracle announced that Walmart would be joining the TikTok acquisition. On September 27, 2020, Judge Carl J. Nichols of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration order. He stated that while President Trump has broad authority to prohibit business transactions with foreign entities that are deemed to pose a national security risk, TikTok appears to be exempt from such a prohibition because it is a personal communication service, which is protected by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The ruling does not affect the November 12, 2020, deadline that ByteDance divest from TikTok in the United States.Some believe TikTok and other Chinese-owned apps pose a serious security risk to the United States because Chinese companies are subject to China's laws that require compliance with government requests for data. Others believe that TikTok has fallen into "the crosshairs of a global technology battle" based on technology trade protectionism (this concept, also called "techno-nationalism," refers to a country's refusal or reluctance to import other countries' advanced technology, as well as to export, or to allow other nations to benefit from, its own advanced technology).Similar situations may arise in the future with other apps created by foreign companies. Options that Congress may consider include (1) developing an overarching legal and regulatory framework to protect the security and privacy of U.S. citizens' data and communications, and (2) developing a uniform, transparent process to assess and mediate risks posed by foreign apps.* * *Contents:Background ... 1What Is TikTok? ... 1* TikTok's Recommendation Engine ... 2* Data Collection, Storage, and Sharing by TikTok ... 3- Data Collection ... 3- Data Storage ... 4- Data Sharing ... 4White House TikTok Executive Orders ... 4* Prohibiting Transactions with ByteDance ... 5* Requiring Divestiture of ByteDance from TikTok ... 5- ByteDance Lawsuit Against Order to Divest ... 5China's Cybersecurity Law and Export Rules ... 6Status of Potential Oracle and Walmart Partnership with TikTok ... 6Discussion ... 8* Threat to Security ... 8* Technology Trade Protectionism ... 9Related Congressional Activity ... 10* Hearings ... 10* Legislation ... 11Conclusion ... 11Tables:Table 1.

The app is under intense scrutiny by the U.S. government as a potential privacy and security risk to U.S. users. A major concern is that ByteDance is subject to Chinese laws that require companies operating in China to turn over user data when asked to by the national government. On August 6 and August 14, 2020, President Trump signed Executive Orders aimed at stopping U.S. persons and entities from doing business with ByteDance/1 and requiring ByteDance to divest from any holding used to support the operation of TikTok in the United States./2Researchers differ over how TikTok's collection of user data compares with other social media apps and whether TikTok poses a unique threat to the privacy and security of its U.S. users, including many minors.WeChat, another Chinese-owned app, is often mentioned in conjunction with TikTok, but the two apps are quite different. TikTok has a single function--short video--while WeChat has multiple--voice and data messaging, social media, and digital payment. WeChat is used in the United States primarily by the Chinese language community, whereas TikTok is used more widely. On the same day as the TikTok order, President Trump also signed an Executive Order prohibiting any U.S. individual or entity from engaging in any transaction related to WeChat and its owner, Tencent Holdings Ltd./3While issues with the two apps are often conflated, their functions, technical capabilities, and the data collected from their users are different. Only TikTok is discussed in this report. Background information about WeChat is in Appendix.* * *What Is TikTok?On August 2, 2018, U.S. users of the Musical.ly app, a short video service headquartered in Shanghai, China, with a U.S. office in Santa Monica, CA, found that it had been merged into TikTok. Musical.ly had been acquired by ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, in November 2017 for $1 billion as a means to enter the U.S. market. The TikTok app is available in over 155 countries in 39 languages, and has approximately 800 million monthly active users./4In the United States, TikTok has approximately 49 million monthly active users/5 and the company maintains offices in Los Angeles and New York. When ByteDance first released the TikTok app in September 2016, videos could be no longer than 15 seconds, but now users are allowed to link together four 15-second segments./6Longer videos recorded outside the app can also be uploaded to the platform.ByteDance is currently estimated to be worth over $100 billion./7The company's core product in China is Toutiao, which means "Headlines." Toutiao began as a mobile news recommendation engine, but has evolved into a platform to deliver content and targeted advertising in other formats as well (e.g., text messages, images, question-and-answer posts, microblogs, videos).TikTok's Recommendation EngineTikTok's appeal relies on what has been called its "addictive" video feed, For You./8The app builds this feed through a "recommendation engine" using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and data mining practices. How each user's feed is constructed had been a tightly held secret until recently. On June 18, 2020, TikTok published a blog post, "How TikTok Recommends Videos #ForYou."/9The company says its algorithm relies on a complex set of weighted factors to recommend content based on user preferences, including hashtags and videos watched; videos "liked," shared, and commented on; as well as the kind of device a person is using. Each user's feed is unique.Table 1 lists the specific factors the company says it uses.Table 1. "For You" Feed Factors and ElementsTable omitted.According to TikTok, [a]ll these factors are processed by our recommendation system and weighted based on their value to a user. A strong indicator of interest, such as whether a user finishes watching a longer video from beginning to end, would receive greater weight than a weak indicator, such as whether the video's viewer and creator are both in the same country. Videos are then ranked to determine the likelihood of a user's interest in a piece of content, and delivered to each unique For You feed.The blog post was seen by most as an effort to provide more transparency to the public as the U.S. government was increasing its scrutiny of the company's practices./10Data Collection, Storage, and Sharing by TikTok Critics, as well as some members of Congress, cite as problematic the amount of data that TikTok collects from and about its users, how that data is stored, and how it could potentially be shared with the Chinese government and used in influence campaigns/11 or against U.S. citizens./12Based on these concerns, both the Democratic and Republican national committees, the Department of Defense, and some private firms, such as Wells Fargo Inc., have banned or discouraged the use of the TikTok app./13Data CollectionAccording to its privacy policy,/14 TikTok collects a range of user information, including location data and internet address, keystroke patterns, and the type of device being used to access the app.The app also collects and stores a user's browsing and search history within the app, as well as the content of any messages exchanged using the app. Additional information can be collected based on user permission: phone number, phone book, and social-network contacts; GPS data; user age; user-generated content (e.g., photos and videos); store payment information; and the videos "liked," shared, watched all the way through, and re-watched. TikTok states that the app collects less personal data than many other apps, such as Facebook and Google, both of which track user activity across devices (TikTok claims that it does not)./15The data that TikTok collects from users appears in many regards to be comparable to what other social media companies gather and use./16Some critics have described TikTok's approach to data mining as aggressive/17 and that its ability to track user behavior while using the app, as well as access to a user's photos, videos, and phone book and geolocation tracking (based on user permissions), means that it can build extremely detailed behavioral profiles of its users that could potentially be shared with the Chinese government./18On August 11, 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported that TikTok avoided privacy safeguards in Google's Android operating system to collect users' mobile device MAC addresses, unique identifiers that allow "the app to track users online," and concealed this activity with an additional layer of encryption before ending the practice after 15 months in November 2019./19Data StorageTikTok claims to store all content created by U.S. users--as well as data about those users--only on servers located within the United States and backed up in Singapore. Those servers are owned or controlled by TikTok, but the company denies that it shares or would share this data with the Chinese government,/20 stating that:The key personnel responsible for TikTok ... are all Americans based in the United States--and therefore are not subject to Chinese law. U.S. content moderation is likewise led by a U.S.-based team and operates independently from China, and, as noted above, the TikTok application stores U.S. user data on servers located in the United States and Singapore./21Data SharingDespite these assertions, TikTok's website says that information can be shared with its parent company in China or other affiliates (usually advertisers), which operate under Chinese law./22Further, a lawsuit filed in federal court in December 2019 asserted that user data was harvested and sent to servers in China./23* * *Content omitted.* * *Related Congressional ActivityCongress began taking an interest in TikTok as early as October 2019, when Senator Marco Rubio reportedly called for a formal investigation into whether TikTok posed a national security risk./58Later that month, Senators Charles Schumer and Tom Cotton sent a letter/59 to the Acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, expressing their concerns about TikTok and the national security risks they believe it poses. More formally, Congress has scrutinized TikTok in two hearings, and Members have introduced three related bills.HearingsThe Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism has held two hearings on, among other topics, the impact of Chinese smartphone apps on U.S. citizens' privacy:* "How Corporations and Big Tech Leave Our Data Exposed to Criminals, China, and Other Bad Actors" was held on November 5, 2019./60* "Dangerous Partners: Big Tech and Beijing" was held on March 4, 2020./61 TikTok was invited to testify at these hearings, but declined to appear./62LegislationThree bills have been introduced that would prohibit the use of TikTok and WeChat on U.S. government devices:* S. 4452/63 is a bill to prohibit federal employees from downloading or using WeChat on government devices. It was introduced on August 5, 2020, by Senator John Kennedy and referred to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs the same day.* S. 3455,/64 the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, was introduced on March 12, 2020, by Senator Josh Hawley. This bill was passed by the Senate on August 6, 2020, and received in the House the following day. (See S.Rept. 116-250./65)* H.R. 6896,/66 also called the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, is the House companion bill to S. 3455. It was introduced on May 15, 2020, by Representative Ken Buck and referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform and the House Committee on Administration the same day.ConclusionThe variety of apps available to U.S. users is enormous. Situations similar to the case of TikTok may arise in the future with other apps created by foreign companies. Congress may consider taking one or both of two parallel approaches to address such situations: (1) developing an overarching legal and regulatory framework to protect the security and privacy of U.S. citizens' data and communications, and (2) establishing a uniform, transparent process to assess the risks posed by foreign apps and establish mechanisms to mediate those risks.* * *REPORT, TABLE and FOOTNOTES: https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46543Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7276490 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 24, 2020End of Document

TRUMP MUST DO MORE TO COUNTER CHINA THREATSStates News ServiceOctober 12, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 795 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the National Center for Public Policy Research:by Horace CooperChina threatens America's economic and national security.Its Belt and Road Initiative, which provides development assistance to emerging nations, has given it economic leverage all over the world. To obtain access to its growing markets and modern, inexpensive manufacturing infrastructure, Western businesses must often turn over valuable intellectual property if the Chinese government doesn't simply steal it.China's economic aggression fuels its expansionism, as it seeks to extend its sphere of influence globally.The Trump administration has pushed back hard against China's economic bullying, especially in areas like information technology (IT) and space launch where China has been using government subsidies to expand global market share for critical platforms and services.The president has taken actions to level the playing field, but more must be done.After decades of concerted effort, China has become a primary source of American consumer goods, which are manufactured there or assembled from parts and shipped back to the United States. China is now our primary source for a wide variety of essential items like industrial supplies, pharmaceuticals, and cellular technology.If the COVID-19 crisis has taught us anything it's that we can't allow so much of what America needs to come from a country that views itself as an adversary.It's time to rethink our supply chains, and to end our reliance on China.One step the Trump administration can take to acknowledge this new reality immediately is to ban shipments to the United States of things manufactured in China endangering American lives, national security and economic stability.For example, there is the chemical sodium cyanide, essential to the mining of gold and silver, and now a product the Chinese make for export.Until now, the need for sodium cyanide in North American mining has been filled by U.S. companies. The Chinese wish to newly enter and dominate the market as competitors. In furtherance of that objective, as a successful Department of Justice investigation and conviction show, Mr. Jerry JingDon Xu likely stole key U.S. internet protocols (IP) for advanced sodium cyanide manufacturing from Chemours, a U.S. manufacturer, on behalf of China.If that isn't enough, the Chinese manufacturers cut costs by cutting corners on safety with one of the world's most hazardous chemicals. U.S. manufacturers adhere to the highest safety and security standards, including 10 ton metal containers, complete with loading/offloading rails for safe transport, to contain each ton of sodium cyanide.Chinese exports are transported in plastic bags inside of wooden boxes, and the producer ceases to be liable once the boxes arrive at port.In countries permitting bag-box cyanide transport, there have been numerous accidents and terrorist attempts to acquire sodium cyanide.In 2015, sodium cyanide stored in plastic bags in the Chinese port city of Tianjin exploded with the force of three tons of TNT, setting off a secondary explosion that had, according to the South China Post, the force of 21 tons.If only the threat stopped there: the flimsy packaging used by Chinese companies makes sodium cyanide a soft target for a potential terrorist who, if determined enough, could breach even a single box at any point, as it moved through the United States and turn it into a bomb or, with the application of other easily-obtainable chemicals, into a cloud of deadly hydrocyanic gas.A single container filled with multiple bag/box packages could contain more than 44,000 pounds of sodium cyanide more than 80 million lethal doses.Numerous reports, including from the U.S. Department of Defense, analyze the risk.In addition to the national security and safety issues, we face the elimination of this U.S. manufacturing capacity by Chinese underselling, rendering the U.S. dependent on Chinese exports of the chemical for gold mining in the U.S., further undercutting a critical supply chain for electronics.It ought to be a basic principle of U.S. law that no American firm should be forced to compete against a Chinese company trying to enter our markets using technologies and processes stolen from U.S. firms.It ought to be another that imports made cheaper by creating significant national security and safety risks should not be permitted.If China can get away with this kind of abuse in the niche market for mining chemicals, they will do so again and again in other places.The executive branch has the responsibility to protect American commerce from this kind of invasion which, as we've seen, is an essential part of China's long march towards becoming the world's dominant superpower.Load-Date: October 15, 2020End of Document

TikTok case judge schedules hearing on Sunday as Trump ban loomsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 26, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 812 wordsBodyA federal judge scheduled an unusual hearing Sunday morning to decide whether the US can go ahead with its ban on the popular TikTok video sharing app.ByteDance Ltd., the Chinese owner of TikTok, has asked the court to block the ban, which will begin sunday night, even as it seeks government approval for the sale of a stake in its U.S. operations to Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. under pressure from President Donald Trump. He argued in court documents friday that the ban would trampl on constitutional protections of freedom of expression.Trump cited national security risks in August, when he announced a ban on the widely used network in U.S. app stores. The president, who also banned WeChat, owned by Tencent Holdings Ltd. of China, told ByteDance that his only alternative is to sell his U.S. business. The U.S. Department of Justice argues that applications potentially give the Chinese government access to millions of American personal data.The government emphasized those concerns in a filing Friday, urging U.S. district judge Carl Nichols not to grant the temporary blockade. U.S. attorneys cited FBI Director Christopher Wray's assessment that China poses the "greatest long-term threat to our nation's information and intellectual property" as a reason for the ban.Communist Party ties"One of the tools the People's Republic of China uses to further its objectives is the collection of massive data," the US government said, referring to the People's Republic of China.ByteDance, founded in 2012 by Zhang Yiming, has close ties to the Communist Party of China and must comply with laws requiring it to cooperate with China's government, the US said."In April 2018, the PCCh forced ByteDance to close one of its other platforms, and Mr. Yiming issued a public apology pleding to cooperate and elevate the official PCCh media," he said. "After this public atonement, ByteDance underwent organizational restructuring with the SPC infrastructure now incorporated."The ban, announced in an August 6 executive order, is part of a broader effort by the administration to adopt a hard line against Beijing, which Trump bets will help him win re-election. Starting at 11:59 p.m. on September 27, TikTok would be removed from Google's Apple Inc. and Android-managed app stores, the most widely used markets for downloadable apps. People who don't already have the app won't be able to get it, and those who already have it won't have access to the necessary updates to ensure its safe and smooth operation. TikTok is regularly used by 19 million Americans."Security Risks"Before the coming deadline, ByteDance had advocated for an accelerated timetable in the case. The US recoiled at a hearing Thursday, saying ByteDance had filed a separate lawsuit more than a month ago and was delayed in applying for a court order at the court order. In defense of the ban, the government again cited security concerns."TikTok may continue to operate with respect to existing users, but it cannot add users, and the reason for this is that there are significant risks ofnational security," Deputy Federal Prosecutor Daniel Schwei told the judge.TikTok stated that the ban was already undermining its business model by scaring users and that it had sought relief as soon as the law allowed it. He said the government would have argued that his application was premature if it had been filed earlier."The urgency of this is created by Sunday night's ban," attorney John Hall said. "That part doesn't make any sense to us."User risksHall added that the ban would increase risks to existing users by preventing them from receiving regular security updates. The deadline was also affecting the company's reputation with users, who are considering moving to less attractive platforms, the lawyer said.In the social media industry, Hall said, "retained users is absolutely the vital element of their business."At Friday's presentation, TikTok's lawyers argued that Trump is exceeding his authority with the proposed ban and is acting in an "unreasonable and capricious manner" in trying to cut off all transactions in service.The law invoked "states that the president's authority does not extend to the direct or indirect regulation or prohibition of 'personal communication' and the international flow of 'information or information materials', such as films, photographs and works of art, regardless of the 'format or means of transmission', argued by lawyers of the Chinese company.Such a ban would also trampl on the freedom of expression rights of U.S. users of the Chinese company's platform, TikTok's lawyers added. Millions of Americans "participate in a centrally protected discourse in TikTok in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social and cultural purposes," according to the report. "Prohibitions illegally restrict this speech in violation of the First Amendment."Load-Date: September 27, 2020End of Document

CONCERNS GROW OVER BEIJING'S INFLUENCE, SMEAR CAMPAIGNS TARGETING ACADEMIAStates News ServiceOctober 23, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 942 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:As Washington detailed growing concerns this week over foreign funding and influence in U.S. educational institutions, international China scholars have described behind-the-scenes pressure and murky smear campaigns in support of the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)..In its latest report on foreign funding in education, the U.S. Education Department said Cornell University had failed to report promptly around U.S.$1 million in funding from Chinese telecoms giant Huawei.Several other universities had been slow to admit to foreign funding, adding to growing concerns over CCP influence on U.S. academic life, the department said.Officials are concerned that foreign money may come with strings attached, and provide foreign governments with improper access to sensitive research or limit academic freedom in some programs, the report said."For too long, [U.S.] institutions have provided an unprecedented level of access to foreign governments and their instrumentalities in an environment lacking transparency and oversight," the Education Department said in its report."Many large and well-resourced institutions of higher education have aggressively pursued and accepted foreign money," the report found, while failing to report the funding as required by law.The report also cited "concerns that China seeks to leverage its relationships with American universities to dominate a global market."Investigation criticizedThe report came as dozens of academics and experts on China hit out at a New Zealand university for its investigation of Anne-Marie Brady, a university professor who publicized links between the country's universities and Chinese state interests.The University of Canterbury has said it is investigating complaints against Brady from universities and individuals linked to a report she submitted to the New Zealand parliament in July.Brady, who is also a fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington DC, has been called before an internal disciplinary body after complaints were made about the research paper.The report, titled "Holding a Pen in One Hand, Gripping a Gun in the Other," was co-authored by Jichang Lulu and Sam Pheloung, and details links between New Zealand universities and tech companies, and the Chinese state, including the paramilitary bingtuan in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.The China scholars called for an apology to Professor Brady, adding that the normal method of recording a disagreement with an academic paper was to publish a critical response, not to subject the writer to an investigation."I support Anne-Marie [Brady] because I respect her as an academic, am concerned about her as a person, and because not doing so misses an opportunity to send a message that universities must not forget that in democratic societies they serve as critical bastions for the free production of ideas and objective research," Carla Freeman, director of the Foreign Policy Institute at Johns Hopkins-SAIS told RFA in a recent interview.'Clearly the wrong way'Andreas Fulda, associate professor of politics at the University of Nottingham, said covering up links between universities and foreign governments wasn't the way to go."You know anyone who actually files a freedom of information request and knows how to ask the right questions will be able to ... reveal all sorts of highly problematic partnership deals and agreements," Fulda told RFA. "That's the nature of living in an open society with the rule of law.""So for universities to think that they can just hush it up and ... prevent a public debate, I think is ... clearly the wrong way," he said.Meanwhile, there are personal consequences for anyone speaking out about China. Fulda said he has been subjected to a barrage of emails sent to colleagues that aim to discredit him."Six colleagues in total had told me, individually, that they received ... this malicious email which attempted to smear my professional reputation," he said."It always means you have to explain to people [about] this kind of character assassination [and] it works in some cases ... it may potentially damage an individual or a group," Fulda said.'Run like businesses'Fulda said the fact that universities in Western nations are now run like businesses makes it harder for them to defend against influence campaigns.He said universities needed to respond to the CCP's suppression of the Hong Kong protest movement, the threat of military strikes against the democratic island of Taiwan, and the genocide against Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang."To assume that they can just do business as usual is of course ... fanciful," he said.Ben Freeman, director of the Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative told RFA that tracking funding linked to the governments of China and Russia is "very challenging.""So much of it is covert and not disclosed," he said. "This announcement by the State Department will help to expose some of that funding, but more work is still needed.""Regarding higher education, investigations by the Department of Education have revealed significant amounts of previously undisclosed funding coming from the Chinese government into colleges and universities in the U.S. and there's probably even more money that we still don't know about," he said."It's critically important for policymakers to know who is funding the experts they're talking to or whose research they're reading," he said. "We know that funding can bias, or at the very least, influence the work think tanks are doing."Reported by Jane Tang for RFA's Mandarin Service.

THE REAL JOE: A BUSINESS BUILT ON THE FAMILY NAMEStates News ServiceOctober 20, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 8593 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Republican National Committee:The Facts:IN RECENT DAYS, BIDENS FAMILY HAS TAKEN CENTER STAGE AS CORRUPT DEALS BETWEEN BIDENS SON HUNTER AND SHADY FOREIGN BUSINESS PARTNERS HAVE BEEN EXPOSEDOn October 14, 2020, The New York Post reported new evidence of Hunter Biden leveraging his fathers name for personal gain.Emails show that Hunter sought to leverage a visit from his father to Ukraine for a contract with Burisma, writing that the contract should begin now- not after the upcoming visit of my guy.Before leaving the board of Burisma in 2019, Hunter Biden was reportedly paid as much as $50,000 a month.On October 15, 2020, The New York Post outlined Hunters pursuit of lucrative deals involving Chinas largest energy company.On October 17, 2020, Fox News found that one of the people on an explosive email thread allegedly involving Hunter Biden has corroborated the veracity of the messages, which appear to outline a payout for former Vice President Joe Biden as part of a deal with a Chinese energy firm.From 2014 to 2015, Hunter and his business partners were paid $3.4 million to represent Burisma holdings to have well-connected Democrats defend the company from U.S. and Ukrainian investigations.The New York Times reported that, in 2016, Vice President Biden had sought for and succeeded in ousting a Ukrainian prosecutor general that had been investigating Hunters client Burisma.On October 17, 2020, The New York Post expanded their reporting to show that Hunters operations extended further into Kazakhstan.Between 2012 and 2014 when his father Joe Biden served as Vice President Hunter Biden worked as a go-between to Kenes Rakishev, a Kazakh oligarch with close ties to the countrys longtime kleptocratic leader Nursultan Nazarbayev.On October 19, 2020, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe told reporters that the information contained on Hunters laptop is not a Russian disinformation campaign.HUNTER BIDEN IS NOT THE ONLY BIDEN FAMILY MEMBER WHO HAS SOUGHT TO PROFIT OFF OF THE BIDEN FAMILY NAMESince Biden announced his candidacy for President, ABC News has reported that Frank Biden, Joes youngest brother, leveraged his famous name for business gain by putting it to work on an imperiled charter school project in Florida that only graduated 35% of its students.In January, Politico further illustrated the pattern of Biden family members financially engaging with people close to the Former Vice President when they found that Joe Bidens younger brother, James Biden, had used Joes political connections to profit off of a land deal with a lobbyist in the U.S. Virgin Islands.In 2019, James was accused, in a lawsuit, of using his brothers name and connections to the Biden Cancer Initiative to promote his own business dealings during a pitch to medical investors.In sworn declarations filed in Tennessee, James is alleged to have promised to have his powerful brother help and incorporate a helpful healthcare model into his presidential campaign.From 2011 to 2013, multiple foreign business meetings drew public scrutiny from outsiders including one that took place just hours after Hunter Bidens father, the Vice President, met with Chinese President Hu in Washington.In 2010, James was brought on to Hill International, a firm tasked with building low cost housing in Iraq that said the Biden last name helped him get in the door.In 2007, Hunter and James were sued for their controversial hedge fund practices at Paradigm Global Advisors.Hunter Biden was made president with an annual salary of $1.2 million, despite his inexperience in the hedge fund industry, the lawsuit said.In 1996, shortly after a top executive at MBNA bank bought a house from Joe Biden, Hunter was hired by the company to a six-figure position.While Joe Biden was a Senator, Hunters partners secured $25 million in federal earmarks for the University of Delaware and received firm fees totaling $1.5 million for its work on behalf of the school.IN RECENT DAYS THE BIDEN FAMILY HAS TAKEN CENTER STAGE AS CORRUPT DEALS BETWEEN JOE BIDENS SON HUNTER AND SHADY FOREIGN BUSINESS PARTNERS HAVE BEEN EXPOSEDOn October 14, 2020, The New York Post Detailed New Evidence Of Hunter Biden Leveraging His Fathers Name For Personal GainOn October 14, 2020, The New York Post Revealed That Hunter Biden Discussed Leveraging His Connection To His Father In A Bid To Boost His Pay From A Ukrainian Natural Gas Company.

Biden and MBNA have indeed developed a pretty cozy relationship. John Cochran, the companys vice-chairman and chief marketing officer, did pay top dollar for Bidens house, and MBNA gave Cochran a lot of money$330,000to help with expenses related to the move. A few months after the sale, as Bidens re-election effort got under way, MBNAs top executives contributed generously to his campaign in a series of coordinated donations that sidestepped the limits on contributions by the companys political action committee. (National Review, 8/23/08)In 1996, MBNA Executive John Cochran Paid $1.2 Million For Bidens Home, A Good Deal For Biden. Biden bought the house in 1975 but had been thinking on-and-off about selling it for years; he almost sold it before his disastrous run for the presidency in 1988. But the deal didnt happen until MBNA came along. According to MBNA officials, the company asked [MBNA executive John] Cochran to move to Delaware. At the same time, Biden was looking for a buyer for his house. How the two got together is not clear. When asked, an MBNA spokesman declined to offer any details, saying only, Thats a very personal question. However it happened, in February 1996 Cochran bought Bidens house for $1.2 million. The price was not twice the homes value, as [Republican challenger] Raymond Clatworthys pollsters claimed, but there is evidence to suggest it was a pretty darned good deal for Biden. (National Review, 8/23/08)The Home Was Appraised At $1.2 Million. The appraisal that Biden gave the News-Journal during last years campaignshowing that the house was worth $1.2 millionwas done several years earlier, at the time Biden took out loans for his sons education. In January 1996, as the purchase deal was under way, another appraisal was made, also putting the houses value at $1.2 million. A spokesman for Cochran provided TAS with a copy of that appraisal. (National Review, 8/23/08)But Nearby Houses Had Been Selling Below Their Appraised Value, And Bidens House Needed Quite A Bit Of Work. It is customary for appraisers to evaluate homes in relation to similar properties in the area, or comparables. In the case of Bidens house, the appraiser compared the home to another large old house about a quarter of a mile away. That housewhich was in similar conditionwas judged to be worth $1,013,000. It sold in August 1995 for $800,000 (it should be noted that the house did not have a pool, which Bidens does; on the other hand the house had central air conditioning, which Bidens did not, and it was on a larger lot). The appraiser also looked at two other newer houses in the area. One was appraised at $1,230,000 and sold for $1,007,500. The other was appraised at $1,163,000 and sold for an even $1 million. In all three cases, the homes sold for a good deal less than their appraised value. In comparison, it appears Cochran simply paid Bidens full asking price. And, according to people familiar with the situation, the house needed quite a bit of work; contractors and their trucks descended on the house for months after the purchase.

Opinion | Trump's TikTok Policy Is Just a New Kind of 'Security Theater'Politico.comSeptember 15, 2020 Tuesday 4:59 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1422 wordsHighlight: Banning the popular app made headlines, but the hard work of data security lies elsewhere.BodyAfter weeks of uncertainty following President Donald Trump's executive order on TikTok-ordering its Chinese parent company to divest its American operations within 90 days-the video app that has stolen the hearts, if not the data, of millions of teens has found an American partner: Oracle. Not the most likely candidate, especially after it was widely expected that Microsoft would be the acquirer, Oracle nonetheless meets the criteria established by the Trump administration that TikTok's data not be owned and controlled by a Chinese company with links to the government. The demand that a foreign company sell an asset that the American government deems sensitive to national security isn't just a Trump move. In 2012, the Obama administration required a Chinese company to divest itself of an Oregon wind farm because the turbines were located near a Navy weapons base; in 2019, Washington pushed another Chinese company to sell its stake in Grindr, the American hookup app used primarily by gay men, reportedly because its access to citizens' data raised security concerns. Like Obama before him, Trump framed his executive order as crucial to national security: "There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that ByteDance ... might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States," said Trump in announcing the presumptive ban. But forcing the company to sell TikTok, or at least sell the data centers to Oracle, doesn't actually make American data safer. Instead, it's better to understand these actions as a form of security theater. Coercing TikTok is less a serious policy to protect American phones and data than it is a cousin of the elaborate Transportation Security Administration screening rituals that took root after 9/11: A way for Washington to look like it's doing something to protect Americans against a global threat, without bothering to do anything substantive to address challenges and mitigate harms. The order that TikTok be sold was predicated on the thin reed that it represented a threat to U.S. national security because of the possibility that the Chinese government could force TikTok to hand the Chinese government data on tens of millions of U.S. citizens. That is indeed a possibility, but not one of any particular import. The Chinese government could order the company to provide access, just as an American court can order an American tech company to turn over information on users, though in the China case the data could be broader and less limited by legal constraints.Those constraints, however, are largely beside the point. If the Chinese government has an interest in a U.S. citizen's data, it has its own ways to obtain it unencumbered by a legal process, just as the National Security Agency can and does globally. The invocation of U.S. national security as the pretext to ban TikTok is misleading to the point of absurdity. Social media apps do not present a rich target, and if the Chinese government wanted to access user data, it has ample cyberespionage tools to do so. So does any government that has invested heavily in cyberespionage, which would include the United States, Russia, Israel and a handful of other countries. The targeting of foreign social media companies by the Trump administration will do little to protect the data sanctity of American citizens.But perhaps that isn't the point. As a grand dramatic gesture, the presumptive banning of TikTok - along with the simultaneous injunction on American companies doing business with Chinese messaging app WeChat, which has less of a U.S. presence but is massive globally - allows the administration the simulacrum of toughness without necessitating the actual toughness of making hard decisions about real-world trade-offs. Neither service, however wildly popular, has much of an economic footprint in the United States. That's in contrast to the multiyear American campaign against the Chinese telecom equipment company Huawei, which has considerable business in the United States and Europe as a supplier of technology for 5G. Huawei was and is a bona fide supplier of vital telecommunications hardware, but the struggle against it long predates the Trump administration, and is part of a considered policy to deny state-allied Chinese companies a competitive advantage in the global telecom race. It may or may not be a smart or realistic strategy, especially in the absence of an American alternative to some of its 5G equipment, but it is, at least, an actual strategy.In terms of their ability to protect Americans, the social media bans are the equivalent of the two years of tariffs instituted by Trump as part of his trade war: pinpricks that do little to alter the structural interdependence between China and the United States, but do cause friction. There's no signal the Trump administration is truly willing to undertake a multipronged assault on the China-U.S. economic intertwinement, which would include allocating trillions of dollars to pay for reshoring and also compensate U.S. firms that would be imperiled if China chose to retaliate by shutting them out. (Who would manufacture a hundred million iPhones, for example, if China was willing to shut down production in Shenzhen?) That would be a real strategy, fraught with challenges and risks, requiring assiduous cultivation of alliances and massive domestic spending on top of the spending already demanded by the pandemics. It would be years of hard work, with no guarantee that the end result would be a more secure and prosperous United States and a more constrained, enfeebled China.It would, in short, be hard work with less fanfare and few photo ops. It would be real policy, and not security theater.To be fair to Trump, Americans-people and politicians-have a weakness for that theater. In the aftermath of 9/11, many of the measures taken by the TSA created the image of staunch measures to deter terrorism: the patting down, the scans, the random swabs to detect chemical explosives. As so many experts pointed out for years, those moves may have made flying a bit safer, but in actuality it was the far cheaper, less disruptive practice of reinforcing cockpit doors that prevented anyone from again turning an airplane into a guided missile. And then there was the very fact of the TSA itself: newly named, placed in a newly invented agency called the Department of Homeland Security, all designed to say to the citizenry, "You are safe."If the current extent of security theater was just the inconvenience for millions of teens needing a new app to watch highly creative and semi-addictive short videos, then perhaps we could shrug this off as silly but inconsequential. But of course it's not: The security theater around terrorism has been profoundly wasteful, and new theater arising around Covid-19 could well create its own expensive bureaucracy without any particular health benefit. The big one right now appears to be the temperature-check regime being implemented for office buildings, schools and international flights, which even the nation's top infectious disease doctor has called basically pointless. We know that many people carry Covid and are asymptomatic, and that many others are contagious before showing symptoms. These protocols create the impression of doing something, even as that something largely does nothing. Thankfully, the responses to Covid transcend these empty protocols, but the fact of them speaks to a continued reliance of American policy on things one can see and point to rather than the hard work of designing comprehensive approaches that demand a real consideration of costs, benefits and trade-offs. The Trump administration is particularly susceptible but hardly unique in its addiction to form over much substance. Obama's wind-farm ban might have had a security purpose, but it also had a political purpose, since his rival Mitt Romney had been attacking him for softness on China.The absence of a China-owned TikTok will not suddenly hobble the ability of the Chinese government to hoover the data of American citizens, any more than having no Facebook in China prevents the American NSA from spying on the Chinese. In substituting theater for substance, they all have a cost, not just in time but in precluding more concerted, more difficult and more comprehensive measures. It will be lovely when we can all go to an actual theater once again; it will be even better when we end our collective addiction to this kind of performance.Load-Date: September 16, 2020End of Document

China launches initiative for global data security issuesAssociated Press InternationalSeptember 8, 2020 Tuesday 9:08 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 546 wordsByline: ZEN SOO, Associated PressDateline: HONG KONG BodyHONG KONG (AP) — China has launched an initiative to address global data security issues, a countermove to the U.S. “clean network” program that is aimed at discouraging other countries from using Chinese technology.Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced the initiative in Beijing on Tuesday at a seminar on global digital governance.He said mounting risks for cyber security threaten national security, public interests and personal rights.The move comes amid a deterioration in U.S.-China relations encompassing trade tensions and competition in telecommunications and artificial intelligence technologies, with the U.S. accusing Chinese technology companies of threatening American national security.“Bent on unilateral acts, a certain country keeps making groundless accusations against others in the name of ‘clean' networks and used security as a pretext to prey on enterprises of other countries who have a competitive edge,” Wang said, according to a transcript of his speech released by the ministry. “Such blatant acts of bullying must be opposed and rejected.”Wang said that it was important to develop international rules on data security that will “reflect the will and respect the interests of all countries through broad-based participation.”U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last month unveiled the “Clean Network” program, saying it is aimed at protecting citizens’ privacy and sensitive information from “malign actors, such as the Chinese Communist Party.”More than 30 countries and territories such as Australia and Britain are participating in that initiative, which seeks to exclude Chinese telecommunications companies like Huawei and ZTE, as well as apps, cloud service providers and undersea cables from their internet networks.The U.S. has expressed concerns over national security threats from services provided by Chinese technology companies like Huawei, Bytedance and Tencent.Washington has dissuaded some U.S. allies from using Huawei's technology in 5G networks, saying data potentially could be accessed by the Chinese government. Huawei vehemently denies that.Washington also has imposed sanctions that restrict Huawei from procuring chips containing American technology. Recently, the U.S. also said it will ban Chinese company Bytedance’s popular TikTok video app in the country unless it finds an American buyer. It similarly labelled Tencent’s popular messaging app WeChat a national security threat.The Chinese initiative opposes impairing critical infrastructure and theft of important data. It also opposes abusing technology to “conduct mass surveillance against other states,” the transcript said.Companies should not “install backdoors in their products and services” to illegally obtain user data, should respect the sovereignty, jurisdiction and governance of data in other states," it says.“The Chinese government has acted in strict compliance with data security principles. We have not and will not ask Chinese companies to transfer data overseas to the government in breach of other countries’ laws,” said Wang.“Politicization of security issues, double standards and slandering others violate the basic norms governing international relations, and seriously disrupts and hampers global digital cooperation and development,” he said.Load-Date: September 8, 2020End of Document

Social media and foreign relationsThe Campus: Allegheny CollegeSeptember 3, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL; Pg. 1Length: 1318 wordsBodyPopular video creating and sharing app TikTok as well as multi-purpose media app WeChat have made global headlines in the past few weeks due to recent discoveries that installing the app may make private data stored on that device accessible to parent companies ByteDance and Tencent, respectively, and by proxy to the Chinese government due to laws previously in place.President Donald Trump threatened to ban TikTok if ByteDance will not either sell the American portion of the app to an American company by September 15. Sharon Wesoky, Professor of Political Science and China scholar, elaborated on the potential impacts it could have to American and Chinese consumers."TikTok is the first major tech company from China to really succeed in the U.S.," Wesoky said. "So there are questions of whether the U.S. is just freaking out because there's a real competitor from China now."While emphasizing it may be the biggest app, Wesoky said that TikTok was not the only social media app to come out of China in recent years."It's very important to note that the Trump executive order also is seeking to ban WeChat, which is not as important to most American users, but is incredibly important to the Chinese," Wesoky said. "Probably anybody in China with a mobile phone uses WeChat because it's literally Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, news, Venmo, Messenger, and more in one app. It's how I keep in touch with all my friends and contacts in China."While the loss of WeChat concerns China scholars like Wesoky, many see TikTok as a greater loss due to the fact that it is much more widely-used than WeChat. TikTok's primary audience is teens and young adults, with 60% of users aged 16-24, according to Wallaroo Media."The company claims that data for its American users is stored in the U.S. and Singapore, but there have definitely been cases in recent years where TikTok has been pressured by the Chinese government and it's had to give it on various matters," Wesoky said.Although data collection and storage is worrying, Wesoky explained that it is much more common among tech companies than many realize."The U.S. is one of the few Western countries that doesn't have good data privacy laws," Wesoky said.  "As you probably know, Facebook, Twitter, etc. are also vacuuming up a bunch of our data."The danger in data storage comes with the influence China can have on America due to the knowledge it gains from its apps users."These concerns for privacy on the part of the U.S. would seem more plausible if we had really good privacy laws, which we don't, but the difference actually involves electoral politics," Wesoky said. "There are concerns that the data TikTok is collecting as well as its amazing, effective algorithm can be used to subtly influence the US election. It could change what types of videos people see and could push the election, and it wouldn't have to be major, just tweaking by five or 10%. Some China scholars I've read have said they're really concerned."Wesoky explained that censorship and government influence in forms of entertainment is common in China, taking the form of government bans not unlike the one President Trump seeks to implement, though with much higher stakes."Bill Clinton famously said something along the lines of, 'Let China have the internet. Trying to control the internet is like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall,' " Wesoky said. "Then, when China got the internet, they essentially developed an intranet, where most if not all western sites are blocked."According to Wesoky, China's continuous choices to defy what the U.S. suggested or thought was possible began long before the internet was invented."The first issue at stake relates to the nature of the long-term U.S. and China relationship, which is obviously a complicated one," Wesoky said. "There are many people now that say we're heading into a cold war with China - and I would agree with that - which is alarming."Wesoky explained that, after the Soviet Communist party fell and China began economic reform, the U.S. hoped to have China as a democratic ally in the East."There's a pretty long-standing rule, almost a law, in political science that when countries get richer, they also get more democratic, and China is disproving that," Wesoky said.This rule alone had the two countries at odds, as many Americans saw the cold war as a battle against communism rather than against the Soviet Union, according to Wesoky. The U.S. need for allies in the East complicates the ties the two countries have, since many citizens despise the idea of communing with a communist nation."Making cohesive China policy is very hard because we need to have a good relationship on some level," Wesoky said. "We are the two big gorillas in the room and it's better that we have the ability to engage each other on some level even if we disagree on a lot of things. There are a lot of issues where we have common interests, like nuclear proliferation and climate change. Both countries would be better off if we could collaborate."On a global scale, China has gradually been "brought into the fold" through actions like its acceptance into the World Trade Organization  in 2001, but that has not stopped China from continuing old practices, according to Wesoky."President Trump's trade war with China is not unjustified," Wesoky said. "There are lots of ways that China violates intellectual property and subsidizes businesses in ways that are probably in violation of the WTO, in which all countries are supposed to trade under the same terms."Wesoky explained that, while China needs to be held accountable, banning apps is not a valid solution and even causes increased disdain for America in Chinese citizens."I had a really interesting conversation with one of my closest friends in China when I was there last fall," Wesoky said. "She is not a fan of the Chinese government at all, but she said she was really upset by the trade war because her perception is that a lot of Chinese workers work incredibly long, hard hours in factories for Americans to have cheaper things, and she's not wrong."Many Chinese workers have grueling schedules and are paid minimally, leading to events like the string of suicides that occurred at Apple subcontractor Foxconn's Shenzhen factory between 2007 and 2010."She's not a fan of the Chinese government, but of course she loves her country," Wesoky said. "We actually end up making Chinese people more supportive of their government when things like this happen. When Americans - or the American government - spend a lot of time attacking China, the response among Chinese people won't be, 'Oh, those Americans, they're right!' It'll be like, "Shut up, America! How dare you criticize us!"On the other side, Americans are not solely to blame for the conflicted relationship, due to the lack of unregulated news sources."Most of the time Chinese citizens are getting an incomplete picture of the issue because of media censorship, but it's still a natural response," Wesoky said. "I try to not lose sight of the human dimension of it. There are human beings on both sides of the equation, and people in China just want to have a good life for themselves, just like we do."While acknowledging that changes must be made, Wesoky explained there is no concrete method to follow."There are a lot of China Watchers who say that we need a strategy with respect to China, but just banning some apps is not a strategy," Wesoky said. "The fact is that China is already a great power. The question is, how is that significant to us? What do we do about that? We can't change that. Probably in the next few years China's economy will pass ours in overall size. It can't be avoided. So what is significant about that? Unless we have a real strategy for how to think about that, what we're going to do about that, and what issues are at stake, it's not adequate to deal with it."Load-Date: September 4, 2020End of Document

United States government sanctions Chinese chipmaker SMIC, FT reportsStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 27, 2020 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 440 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyNikkei earlier reported that SMIC is speeding up efforts to build a non-U.S. production line using less-advanced 40-nanometer chipmaking technologies, and is looking to build a more advanced 28-nanometer production line in three years.The US government has put sanctions on China's largest smartphone chipmaker, Shanghai Manufacturing International Corporation , dealing further blow to Chinese companies with business dealings in the United States.The Entity List, overseen by the Commerce Department, now includes more than 300 Chinese companies.The letter said the licensing regime will be in place "pending the US government's review of SMIC and its subsidiaries". SMIC relies heavily on US chip equipment for its daily operations, and losing access to American suppliers could set the company's technological capabilities back by 10 years. The company offers chips and services "solely for civilian and commercial end-users and end-uses", according to the representative.The Pentagon said earlier this month that it was considering blacklisting SMIC, which U.S. authorities have identified as a threat due to an alleged "fusion" of civilian and military technologies.Vin Diesel Drops New Dance Single 'Feel Like I Do' with KygoDiesel also turned heads when he broke out into a performance of "See You Again" at the 2015 MTV Movie Awards. So, clearly, we aren't the only ones who took up some new hobbies over quarantine.Among the issues under discussion was whether SMIC provides assistance to China's defense establishment, according to people familiar with the matter.The newspaper said the administration of US President Donald Trump has "grown more concerned about Beijing's practice of leaning on private companies to advance its military aims".The Trump administration has also vastly expanded restrictions on dozens of companies. Beyond Huawei and its affiliates, the USA government so far this year has put some 70 Chinese companies, organizations and universities on the so-called Entity List to restrict their use of American technologies, according to Nikkei's analysis.It is unclear which suppliers received the letter, but typically once the Commerce Department comes to the conclusion that there is a risk of military use or diversion, it sends that information to the companies. It said that suppliers "must submit an application for an individually-validated license prior to exporting, reexporting or transferring in-country" on certain sensitive technologies.In April, the administration announced a tightening of export rules aimed at preventing US companies from selling products that could strengthen China's military.Load-Date: September 27, 2020End of Document

Trump refused to extend deadline for Tik Tok's U.S. sale: "Either sell or close"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 11, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 699 wordsBodyUS President Donald Trump on Thursday refused to extend the deadline for the sale of Tik Tok's country operations -- the social network owned by Chinese company Bytedance -- by reaffirming that he has until September 15 to do so. Otherwise, you must cease them altogether."No, I'm not going to extend the deadline, no. It's September 15, there won't be any extension of TikTok's deadline," Trump said in brief contact with the press before boarding the presidential plane to travel to the state of Michigan, key to the November election and where he held a rally."TikTok is evolving, we'll see what happens. Either they close or they'll sell it. So either we'll close TikTok in this country for security reasons or it'll be sold," he said.The president has repeatedly assured that TikTok poses a "threat" to U.S. national security. His administration has expressed concern that information about users could be transmitted to the Chinese regime.In the same line, different US legislators have spoken out. On August 6, the Senate passed a bill prohibiting the application on the phones of government employees."TikTok poses a major security risk and has no place on government devices," tweeted Republican Senator Josh Hawley, co-author of the text. The other promoter of the initiative was Democrat Richard Blumenthal, illustrating the bipartisan support he enjoyed, something unusual in an extremely polarized country.Photo: DPA (Jens Kalaene/dpa-Zentralbild/dpa/)TikTok, which has more than 80 million users in the U.S., is one of the most growing social networks in recent years, where it has become the main entertainment for many teens and a marketing channel for major celebrities.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs opposes the forced sale of TikTok, an operation that it believes violates the principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO).The company has also expressed its disagreement. In fact, at the end of August he filed a legal appeal against the president's decree prohibiting operations if their sale were not realized. Tik Tok argued that the administration did not give them a fair chance to defend themselves against the allegations.It is also mentioned that the company took extraordinary steps to address concerns by the U.S. government, and in that regard stored U.S. user data outside China, in the United States and Singapore.However, the presentation does not protect it from having to perform the operation. And companies like Oracle, Microsoft, and Wallmart have already expressed interest in acquiring operations. However, on 31 August the sale added a new hurdle after China first announced since 2008 the need to obtain a license from the regime to export technology.The Bytedance logo. Photo: Reuters (Tingshu Wang/)Among the items listed are products that offer personalized recommendation based on data analysis, something that directly impacts Tik Tok, considering that its algorithm offers suggestions to the user based on the information it collects about its use and behavior.In this regard, the official news agencyXinhua of China cited a government trade adviser saying that ByteDance should study the new export list and consider "seriously and cautiously" whether or not it should stop its sales negotiations.A day later, the company said it had taken note of export regulations and in this regard clarified that "the company will strictly comply" with the laws, cnBC published.ByteDance is not the only company that the U.S. government has considered to pose a risk to the security of your country. WeChat, Tencent's messaging app, faces the same ban as the TikTok app, for national security reasons. With this same argument, the Trump administration limited the deployment of 5G by Chinese company Huawei. And it has also alerted other governments around the world to refrain from using this kind of technology on the view that it could lead to cyberespionage by the Chinese government.More on this topic: TikTok collected data from its users for advertising purposes without your consentTwitter joins TikTok bid: it's in preliminary talks to buy the app's business in the United StatesDonald Trump banned any business with Chinese owner of TikTokLoad-Date: September 12, 2020End of Document

HOW TRUMP'S EXPORT CURBS ON SEMICONDUCTORS AND EQUIPMENT HURT THE US TECHNOLOGY SECTORStates News ServiceSeptember 28, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 4328 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Peterson Institute for International Economics:President Donald Trump's much-touted "phase one" trade agreement with China is falling well short of its goal. Under the deal, Trump pledged that China would purchase an additional $200 billion of US exports over 2020 and 2021. With two-thirds of 2020 now in the books, China has imported less than one-third of the goods that Trump assured Americans it would buy this year. One rare exception are high-tech products like American semiconductors and chipmaking equipment, which have managed to maintain robust export sales despite the pandemic and anti-China rhetoric of a US election campaign.That bright spot has suddenly dimmed, however, and not because of China. The Trump administration is remaking the US export control regime in a way that could lead to sharp cuts in foreign sales of both of these American industries. Elements of the new regime may be well-motivated, seeking to mitigate legitimate national security risks. Other links to national security are, at best, more tenuous and will certainly come at considerable economic cost to American companies.The administration's newest restrictions do more than shut off technology exports to China. The policy limits some American sales to third countries, even when they are US military allies. American semiconductor toolmakers cannot sell their equipment to major semiconductor manufacturers in South Korea or Taiwan, for example, if companies there want to use American tools to make anything to sell to Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications company targeted by the administration as a national security threat.By restricting what foreign companies can do in their home countries, the administration is threatening allied governments' national sovereignty, setting a dangerous precedent of unilateralism. The policy also creates new risks for American workersboth semiconductor equipment makers and those in the semiconductor manufacturing and software design industries.On China, President Trump has said, "We lose billions of dollars and, if we didn't do business with them, we wouldn't lose billions of dollars. It's called decoupling." But Trump has it wrong. His decoupling policy here could mean losses of billions of dollars of American sales not only to China but to other countries as well. And the unilateral nature of his policy could open new areas of conflict with the very same allies that are essential to mitigating the national security threat.Semiconductors, software, and equipment 101Semiconductors are tiny chipsthe ubiquitous integrated circuits and microprocessorsthat drive everything from smartphones to telecommunications hardware, computers, automobiles, data centers, and weapons systems. From start to finish, chipmaking involves dozens of companies and interdependencies deeply woven into global supply chains. Three parts of that supply chain stand outsemiconductor design and manufacturing, software, and semiconductor manufacturing equipment (figure 1).[1]In the first half of 2020, six of the top ten firms in semiconductor design and manufacturing salesIntel, Micron, Broadcom, Qualcomm, Nvidia, and Texas Instrumentswere headquartered in the United States.[2] The other four were Samsung and SK Hynix (South Korea), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC, Taiwan), and HiSilicon (China).Semiconductors are often designed and manufactured in different locations. Broadcom, Qualcomm, Nvidia, and HiSilicon are "fabless"i.e., they design, market, and sell chips but contract out the fabrication to foundries, like TSMC, which are often located in other countries. (Hence the term "fabless.") The main business of TSMC, the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC, China), and GlobalFoundries (United States) is to produce chips for other firms.Some companies, such as Intel and Samsung, design and manufacture their own chips in house. They are called integrated device manufacturers (IDMs).A second important part of the semiconductor supply chain is software, or electronic design automation (EDA)i.e., the companies that craft the software tools used to create integrated circuits and semiconductors. US-based companies like Synopsys, Cadence Design Systems, and Mentor Graphics make up 85 percent of the EDA market and sell or license critical software services to many American and foreign chipmakers.[3]Third, to make semiconductors, manufacturers require access to sophisticated equipment and tools, which are also produced by only a handful of companies. Three based in CaliforniaApplied Materials, Lam Research, and KLA-Tencorheld more than 40 percent of global market share in this sector in 2018.[4] ASML (the Netherlands) and Tokyo Electron (Japan) combined held more than 30 percent.The semiconductor industry is important to Trump's phase one agreement with ChinaChina is the largest buyer of both semiconductors and equipment; combined, global trade reached over $1 trillion in 2019.[5] Through the first eight months of 2020, the two sectors constituted nearly 25 percent of China's total imports of goods covered by Trump's agreement. They were even on pace to help China meet the misplaced metric of Trump's estimated phase one purchase targets for the industry (figure 2).From soybeans to lobster to energy, other US exports to China in 2020 are lagging. Through August, their combined year-to-date sales are 58 percent lower than Trump's prorated targets. At the current pace, China would fall $89 billion short of its total purchase pledge for 2020.The US national security concerns affecting the semiconductor industryNational security concerns are a main driver of the Trump administration's new export control policy affecting American sales of semiconductors, software, and manufacturing equipment. The major worry involves Huawei, for reasons US officials have recently articulated.[6] Nevertheless, US government problems with Huawei are longstanding, dating back to at least the mid-2000s.[7]Huawei is a Chinese national champion with similar revenues as Microsoft, according to Fortune's Global 500 ranking for 2020. One of Huawei's most important product lines is mobile phones.[8] With 20 percent of the global market, Huawei was the top supplier of smartphones in the second quarter of 2020, ahead of Samsung, Apple, and three other Chinese handset makers, Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo.[9]Huawei's other main business is telecommunications infrastructure equipment, providing hardware for many countries' 5G (fifth generation wireless technology) networksthe critical infrastructure expected to further enable developments ranging from remote surgery and autonomous vehicles to the Internet of Things. Only four main suppliers dominate telecommunications hardware, with Huawei providing 27.5 percent of the global 5G base station market in 2019. The other major suppliersEricsson (30 percent, Sweden), Nokia (24.5 percent, Finland), and Samsung (6.5 percent, South Korea)are also not American.[10]The most clearly articulated government concerns over the threat Huawei poses to national security involve its supplying 5G infrastructure, like base stations.[11] There are worries that Huawei could install "backdoors" within its equipment's networks, and that China's national security law could compel the company to collect and turn over personal, corporate, government, or military information on foreigners to the Chinese government. (In one widely cited case, Huawei has been accused of facilitating spying on the African Union headquarters in Ethiopia.) Another concern is more technical and involves Huawei's performance and reliability. A 2019 report to the UK government evaluating the Huawei equipment in use throughout the British telecom network stated, "Huawei's development and support processes are not currently conducive to long-term security risk management and, at present, the Oversight Board has seen nothing to give confidence in Huawei's capacity to fix this" (HCSEC Oversight Board 2019).The US, UK, and Australian governments have decided against procuring Huawei equipment for their networks. Whether or not these concerns are overwrought, they involve tradeoffs that need to be clarified. There is also a question of whether the United States is using the most effective policy tools to address its concerns.US export controls toward Huawei in 2019 targeted American semiconductors and softwareThe US Department of Justice indicted Huawei in January 2019 for stealing US technology, money laundering, and helping Iran avoid sanctions involving the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Huawei has denied the allegations.[12] In May and August 2019, the Department of Commerce added Huawei and its affiliates to the "Entity List" of foreign companies for which it is illegal for Americans to provide a good or service without a license. The government theory was that cutting off American-made inputsof semiconductors to Huawei directly and of EDA tools to its subsidiary chip designer HiSilicon to shut off access indirectlywould cripple Huawei's ability to produce leading edge telecom equipment, leaving the 5G market to more reliable gear made by Ericsson, Nokia, and Samsung.But two problems arose with this approach. The initial US export controls in 2019 were both too narrow and too broad, overlooking some problems and creating others (figure 3).Export controls were too broad economically if they also restricted American sales to Huawei or HiSilicon of products that did not threaten US national security. If the concern derived only from the base stations for the telecom hardware sector, for example, cutting off American semiconductor industry exports for Huawei's smartphones could be unnecessary and excessively costly.At the same time, the initial US export controls were too narrow to protect national security. For example, fabless companies designing chips to be made at TSMC in Taiwan, or Samsung manufacturing semiconductors in South Korea, were outside the reach of the 2019 export controls. Indeed, a July 2020 report by the US-based Semiconductor Industry Association makes the counterintuitive argument that the Trump administration was actually giving the US semiconductor industry too much credit. Because most semiconductors needed for base stations are widely available from manufacturers outside of the United States, cutting off American sales was unlikely to prevent Huawei from procuring the technology elsewhere.[13] (See again figure 3.) The American industry essentially told the administration: "We're great, but not that great; and we can be replaced."The industry found itself caught in the crosshairs of Trump's policy. Nearly one quarter, or $49 billion, of the American semiconductor industry's total annual revenues derived from sales to Huawei and other Chinese companies.[14] Yet, despite the strong export performance of the industry in 2020, it supplied only 5 percent of China's imports of semiconductors (figure 4). Geographically, chips from Taiwan and South Korea made up China's largest sources of foreign supply.Export controls do little to protect national security if the foreign target can simply acquire the technology from third countries instead. As a US legal matter, the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 recognizes this situation by observing: "Export controls that are multilateral are most effective.... Export controls applied unilaterally to items widely available from foreign sources generally are less effective in preventing end-users from acquiring those items." [15] The 2019 controls were a potentially worrisome and costly case study.US export controls toward Huawei's semiconductor suppliers in 2020 target American semiconductor manufacturing equipmentLimiting US semiconductor exports in 2019 that turned out to be "widely available" from other countries presented the Trump administration with a dilemma. It could recognize that its unilateral restrictions were ineffective in protecting national security and remove them. Or it could make them more effective by working with other governments to also limit exports of chips from their plants.The Trump administration chose neither approach. Instead, it went with a previously untried option: directly coercing companies in foreign countries that manufacture semiconductors using US software or technology to stop selling them to Huawei. To do so, the Department of Commerce implemented additional rounds of export controls in May and August 2020. Under the foreign-produced direct product (FDP) rule, the Commerce Department effectively put new limits on sales by American companies of a new part of the semiconductor supply chainmanufacturing equipmentto chipmakers overseas (see figure 3).The idea was to present foreign manufactures like TSMC and Samsung with a choice. To access American-made tools used to fabricate semiconductors, those companies would need to agree not to sell to Huawei. If they wanted to keep Huawei as a customer, TSMC and Samsung would have to find other, non-US manufacturing equipment. The Trump administration was betting these foreign chipmakers would continue to buy the American equipment.American toolmakers like Applied Materials, Lam Research, and KLA-Tencor are at the frontier of this highly concentrated industry. But like American chipmakers, the semiconductor equipment makers also have a "We're great, but not that great" concern. Substitutes from the world's other major equipment providers are currently available from other countries that are not subject to controls (figure 5; see again figure 3), and others may be in the pipeline.Unable to head off the new policy, SEMI, the semiconductor design and manufacturing industry association, raised these concerns by noting that the May 2020 export controls had "already resulted in $17 million lost sales of U.S.-origin items to firms unrelated to Huawei" (emphasis added), further predicting that the new (August 2020) "restrictions will also fuel a perception that the supply of U.S. technology is unreliable and lead non-U.S. customers to call for the design-out of U.S. technology."[16]The August action is unlikely to be Trump's last set of export controls. On September 26, it was reported that the US Department of Commerce was adding SMIC, the Chinese foundry, to the Entity List, shutting off its access to American-made tools, semiconductor designs, and software.Six implications of the new US export control regimeThrough its broad and unilateral export controls, the Trump administration has issued sudden ultimatums on American companies as well as foreign firms in allied countries. This peremptory action is not only a substantial policy shift but also a big gamble. There will be considerable costs to American industry. And even if the approach successfully mitigates the national security risk related to Huawei's 5G infrastructure, using threats rather than cooperation with allied governments may backfire.First, companies now face pressure to avoid setting up semiconductor, software, or toolmaking facilities in the United States. Even firms currently manufacturing in the United States may explore moving production and activities offshore to escape US export controls.Second, foundries in foreign countries have new incentives to "design out" and avoid purchasing American semiconductor manufacturing equipment, lest such purchases get targeted and disrupted in the future. Japanese or Dutch suppliers of competing equipment suddenly look more attractive to these companies.Third, Huawei may do more than stop its future purchases of American-designed semiconductors. If it fails financially, or even if it sees no future relationship with American companies, Huawei may halt payment of billions of dollars in license fees it owes to American firms for use of earlier technologies.Fourth, major foreign consumers of US-made semiconductorsincluding other Chinese smartphone suppliers like Vivo, Oppo, and Xiaomimay look elsewhere in the future, concerned that their supplies will get cut off, even if they make products that do not pose a national security risk.Fifth, this type of export control regime requires a new US bureaucracy, creating concerns over cronyism, nontransparency, and discrimination. Because the prior US approach to export controls was so narrowly targeted, there was little need for a process to consider exceptions. The Trump administration has chosen a regime that is overly expansive by design, with the possibility that government officials could decide exceptions, arising from company petitions, on a case-by-case basis. In addition to American firms, foreign chipmakers like Samsung and TSMC are also likely to request exemptions.[17] Some may be accepted, others may be denied, but the secrecy demanded by national security raises the perception that US government decisions will be based on favoritism, and not risk, generating conflict with allied governments in South Korea and Taiwan worried about their high-tech firms.Sixth, foreign governments are likely to retaliate, imposing new costs on American companies. On September 19, China announced it was creating its own "unreliable entity list" of foreign firms that might be cut off from China's consumer market. There is already speculation that, at some point, Beijing could add American companies like Apple, Cisco, and Qualcomm to the list.But even allied governmentsdispleased with how the sudden and unilateral American policy has constrained their companies' sales to Chinamay respond with their own export controls. As a hypothetical example, take the bilateral dispute in which Japan threatened export controls on semiconductor materials that its companies ship to South Korea.[18] What is to prevent the Japanese government from extending its ban to American chipmakers, instructing them not to use semiconductor materials from Japan for any products they want to sell to customers in South Korea?One more reason why Trump's trade policy is not good US policyThe Trump administration has invoked national security as a rationale for its new export control regime, but its actions have opened another Pandora's box for US trade policy, with potentially dangerous damage to the US semiconductor industrya backbone of its high-tech economyand to US trading partners.Cutting off an important revenue source for American chipmakers, software designers, and toolmakers jeopardizes the research and development (RandD) that supports tens of thousands of American jobs. Less RandD also means less American innovation, including for weapons systems of the future. An overly -restrictive US export regime therefore creates a new national security risk. Lastly, in a time of scarce government resources owing to a pandemic and crippling recession, the new policy is also forcing the industry to demand tens of billions of dollars of new federal subsidies as compensation.More immediately, these export controls sharply identify one more fundamental inconsistency of the Trump administration's own trade policy. There are many reasons to criticize the president's phase one trade agreement with China. To Trump, however, the deal was "historic" because of his promise that China would suddenly purchase $200 billion more of US goods and services. But because of his own administration's export restrictions, he is now likely to break even this promise.ReferencesBown, Chad P. 2020. Export Controls: America's Other National Security Threat.

The secrets to being able to sell more in ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 13, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1063 wordsBodyBySergio SpadoneEntrepreneur. Director of the Argentine Chamber – China.I lived in China for many years and got used to many of its particularities, but looking at Pudong's progress from The Bund, Shanghai's rambla, never ceases to shock me. And in China there are transformations that surprise even more. With more than 1.4 billion inhabitants, it is the most dynamic market on the planet. In the last forty years China experienced the most extraordinary transformation process in history: 500 million people took the step from poverty to the middle class,accessing a better standard of living.The policies introduced by Deng Xiaoping from 1978 onwards were the key to awakening the country after more than a century of humiliation at the hands of foreign powers and a long march that included hunger, millions of dead, international isolation and profound cultural change. The "Asian giant," as China is often labeled, developed its economy - the second in the world today - from an export model based on industrial conversion with strong state support. But the situation in China has changed substantially over the past 10 years. In 2012, during a personal meeting, Hu Qili - prominent leader who joined the Politburo Standing Committee between 1987 and 1989 - explained to me what the path taken by the People's Republic was: Industries with extensive labour were encouraged to move their operations inland. In this way, millions of farmers, mostly poor, would join these factories, accessing fixed and stable wages, higher incomes and consumption capacity.The new urban middle class Today, middle-class growth is the engine of the economy. A McKinsey Global Institute study shows that the segment grew seven times in eight years (from 6.6% in 2010 to 45.7% in 2018). This impressive case of social advancement created 686 million consumers, more than twice the population of the United States. The study highlights the five new consumption trends associated with learning, maturation and experience. 1. Young consumers with high purchasing capacity in second and third tier cities are the current growth engine. 2. Most Chinese consumers are increasingly demanding, intelligent and frugal about their expenses. 3. A large majority of consumers say they are looking for a healthier lifestyle. 4. The Chinese are increasingly sophisticated travelers. They stop making predictable and inexpensive group trips and are inclined to put together their own adventures. 5. High-end Chinese brands are increasingly attractive to Chinese consumers, who want to connect with their cultural heritage.China's e-commerce revolution In its 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-2015), the Chinese government expressed the decision to lead China to global e-commerce leadership. Just two years later China became the world's largest e-commerce market,surpassing that of the United States. Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba, said that "in other countries, e-commerce is a way to buy; in China it's a lifestyle." The world's largest online shopping event is Singles Day. On November 11, 2019, in 24 hours, Alibaba recorded sales of US$38 billion. It is that the penetration of e-commerce in China is phenomenal: one in four purchases is digital. In the United States it is 11% and in Argentina only 3%.China's digital ecosystem Depending on theEvolution of the Chinese market, the Alibaba group created two local solutions: Taobao (C2C) and Tmall (B2C). The competition is Jindong (or JD.com, another B2C), with a turnover of US$82.8 billion in 2019. Chinese consumers are volcanoted to B2C, in C2C spawn, in demand for better product care and quality. Alibaba launched Tmall Global, an option for foreign products looking to reach the Chinese consumer directly. With suppliers from more than 80 countries, 5,500 product categories and some 20,000 brands, Tmall Global proposes a model in which it is not necessary to be physically in China. The sale and collection are made online on the platform and shipments of goods to the final consumer are dispatched from abroad. However, it is not a viable option for Argentine products. When the Chinese consumer wants to receive their purchase immediately, from Argentina, hopefully, air delivery can take 7 to 15 days. In addition to the very high cost, it is mandatory to offer online customer support in Chinese language and a solution for claims and returns.How to sell our products The first rule to succeed in that huge market is to place inventory in China and deliver in the shortest possible time. An on-premises partner or service provider will carry inventory, be in charge of the virtual store, and provide customer service.To do this you have to deposit US$30,000 in guarantee (not expense) and pay an annual fee of about US$6,500 dollars. The commission will be 0.50% to 5% - depending on the product category - plus a 1% commission from the payment module. The local partner will charge a fixed (expenses) plus an average of 5% on sales. For logistics - internal transport, depot and last mile - in China there are many options and real competition, which allows to achieve acceptable costs. The main challenge is to satisfy an increasingly demanding consumer with products with little added value, such as those offered by Argentines. The best opportunity for our country is definitely in the area of food. The Chinese middle class has greater purchasing power and aspires to eat better quality food. If we take meat as an example, we must focus on making, packaging and presenting it to the highest standards. It is necessary to understand, among other things, Chinese idiosyncrasies: what cuts they like and how they want to see them presented. The Argentine entrepreneur will have to take an interest in knowing what the Chinese want and adopt an advertising message that focuses - for example - on health benefits or how the cold chain is cared for. Food security is one of the new consumer's big concerns.Continuity will be another matter to consider. Think about the long term and have a permanent presence: open an office in China or hire whoever takes care of the business on a daily basis. Finally, do not forget that e-commerce has a fundamental prominence, which is associated with having the ability to make the delivery in 24 hours. The consumer buys from the office and at night wants to have the order at home. And that can't be ignored.OmLoad-Date: September 14, 2020End of Document

China threatens retaliation for Trump's WeChat, TikTok banUPISeptember 19, 2020 Saturday 1:02 PM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 390 wordsByline: SOMMER BROKAWDateline: Sept. 19 BodyThe Chinese government on Saturday threatened sanctions after the Trump administration's ban on WeChat and TikTok.China's Commerce Ministry said companies on its "unreliable entities" list, which it created last year after the United States placed tighter restrictions on China's Huawei Technologies, would be banned from investing in China or trading with the Chinese market.Though the Chinese government hasn't named entities on the list, state media has reported that Apple and Google could be sanctioned amid the souring of U.S.-China relations.China would probe and take "corresponding actions" against any firm that "harmed China's sovereignty, security and development interests, violate market rules, or halt contractual obligations with Chinese companies or take discriminatory measures that severely hurt Chinese companies' legitimate interests," the ministry said in its statement.The sanctions could also result in individual executives being investigated and having their visas canceled, the ministry said, adding that it would establish a new internal division for such probes.The U.S. Commerce Department announced the ban Friday against Chinese social apps TikTok and WeChat, and said that the ban will start Sunday, "to protect the national security of the United States."As of Sunday, existing users will not be able to make upgrades of the video-sharing app TikTok, which has more than 100 million users in the United States. New downloads of the app also will not be allowed.The ban also shuts down all transferring of funds and transactions on WeChat and bars companies from hosting, delivering content or permitting any Internet transit.WeChat had 3.3 million active users in the United States as of August, according to App Annie, an analytics company.The announcement comes as the Commerce Department weighs approval for an agreement by TikTok to sell a minority stake to U.S. tech company Oracle.Oracle said Monday that it agreed to partners with TikTok one day before it was initially slated to be banned from the United States. Microsoft, which had hoped to acquire TikTok, said in a blog post Sunday that TikTok's owner, ByteDance, won't be selling to them.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross added Friday that the app will "for all practical purposes be shut down" by Nov. 12 if no deal is reached with the White House.Load-Date: September 19, 2020End of Document

Trump threatens to block TikTok deal if Chinese group retains controlCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 21, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 592 wordsBodyUS President Donald Trump warned on Monday that he will not approve an agreement on TikTok if the Chinese group that owns the popular app retains control.These comments raised concerns about the fate of the agreement reached over the weekend to circumvent the U.S.-ordered anti-implementation blockade, which Trump sees as a risk to national security.The representative was questioned in an interview with Fox News about the possibility of Chinese company ByteDance retaining 80% of the shares and responded that if U.S. companies Oracle and Walmart do not have "full control," it will not approve an agreement.Trump noted that Oracle and Walmart "have a partnership" for TikTok and said they "are going to have full control.""They're going to have a game of control. Everything's going to go to the cloud," he said.However, the details of the participation are unclear and according to the different counts vary the percentages of shares that would remain in the hands of the United States and China and above all who would control the data and algorithms.The TikTok social network - which allows short, usually playful - videos to be under threat of a ban in the United States - where it has more than 100 million users - as Washington accuses the company, without giving evidence, of spying on the Beijing government.On Saturday the popular app, very focused on the young market, confirmed a project to create a partnership called TikTok Global with Oracle as a technology partner and with Walmart as a commercial contribution to the United States.- The battle for data and algorithm -ByteDance, which in turn is under pressure from the Chinese government not to give in to U.S. claims, said it would retain 80% control over TikTok Global after going public.The Chinese company indicated that the plan does not involve "transfer of e-algorithm or technology" and indicated that information in this regard is "rumors".The release from U.S. companies offers another version of the control majority."With the creation of TikTok Global, Oracle/Walmart will make its investments and TikTok Global's shares will be distributed to its owners, Americans are going to be majority," said Oracle Vice President Ken Glueck.The app is the latest crystallization of the Beijing-Washington clash that has already hurt the Huawei telephony giant and threatens the use of the Chinese WeChat app in the United States.Over the weekend, China's Ministry of Commerce condemned America's actions, calling them "matoneo," claimed to violate international trade rules, noting that there is no evidence that TikTok is a threat.Some analysts expressed skepticism that an agreement that was approved by the United States and China could be broken."It seems oracle and TikTok have made enough concessions for the U.S. government, and now we need to see if these concessions are too much for China," independent analyst Richard Windsor said in a blog post.The plan unveiled over the weekend would allow Oracle to buy 12.5% of TikTok and Walmart 7.5%, based on an offer that would value the platform at $60 billion.The percentage that would remain in Chinese hands is the subject of controversy given that ByteDance has a 40% US share.There is also a question of Trump's claim that the new entity is going to make a $5 billion contribution to a "patriotic education" initiative.Oracle and Walmart indicated that TikTok Global is going to pay "more than $5 billion" in U.S. taxes, as part of the plan, whichU.S. officials is going to create 25,000 new jobs in the country.bur-an/rsrLoad-Date: September 22, 2020End of Document

China will not accept an "unequal agreement" at TikTok Global, according to the official newspaperCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 22, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 588 wordsBodyBeijing, Sep 22 (EFE) - China "will not accept an unequal pact against Chinese companies," the official Chinese newspaper Global Times said today in a publishing house regarding the TikTok Global agreement, while deeming it "hard to believe" that the Chinese government can approve it.This publication, which depends on the People's Journal - the official body of the Chinese Communist Party (PCCh) - states that, because of the information provided by the US, the agreement is "unfair" and "satisfies Washington's irrational demands.""It's hard for us to believe that Beijing is going to approve an agreement like that," he says.The newspaper highlights that U.S. citizens will "have four of the five seats" of TikTok Global's board of directors - the new company to operate in the United States created by its Chinese parent company Bytedance and the American Oracle and Walmart - where only one can be Chinese.In addition, it states that the board will include a director of national security, which must be approved by the US.It also says Oracle will have "the authority to check the source code" of TikTok in the US and its updates."Because TikTok and Douyin - their original Chinese version - must have the same source code, this means that the US will be able to know Douyin's operations," he says.He also argues that the new company will control TikTok's business worldwide except in China, not just in the United States."It will block access to IPs from China. This means that Americans can take control of TikTok's global business and reject that the Chinese can enter it," the newspaper says, even though the app is no longer accessible from China due to Internet censorship in the Asian country.According to the Global Times, the terms of the agreement "damage the security, interests, and dignity of China" and the US "with all its might eliminates" Bytedance and "forces it to sign a coerced agreement.""China, also a major country, will not submit to US intimidation and will not accept an unequal agreement that goes against Chinese companies," he says.The publisher also states that "if TikTok's reorganization under US manipulation becomes a model," any Chinese company that expands its business there and becomes competitive "will be converted into a Washington-controlled one through tricks and coercions.""If China surrenders, which country in the world will be able to resist?" asks the official revolving and claims that "Washington will then enjoy technological hegemony forever."Moreover, it questions whether American tech giants that have expanded around the world would leave control of their company "in the hands of host country companies" or allow members of their board of directors to be approved by local governments.Bytedance and the two U.S. companies have offered very different versions of the agreement reached to form TikTok Global.According to oracle and Walmart versions - which will control 20% of the future firm - most of the new company will be U.S.-owned, but according to ByteDance, they will control the remaining 80% until their IBRO takes place with an initial public offering within about a year.U.S. President Donald Trump threatened monday not to approve the agreement reached if U.S. companies do not have "full control" over the resulting society."(ByteDance) will have no link (with the new company), and if they do, we will not approve the agreement," said Trump, who also said that if Oracle and Walmart "have no full control" over TikTok Global, he will also not consent.Load-Date: September 23, 2020End of Document

Trump says he has approved a deal for purchase of TikTokStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 23, 2020 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 483 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyOriginally, TikTok owner ByteDance said that it would retain an 80% stake in the new TikTok Global company. This differs significantly from previous reports that had said that ByteDance will still maintain a majority stake in the popular social media platform, which was previously a share of 80 percent to ByteDance and just 20 percent to Oracle and Walmart.Besides, the US President Donald Trump, who gave his blessings to TikTok's US operation a couple of days earlier, did not make any decisive comment on Monday, but was quoted saying that the deal had been "working its way through".As part of the deal, ByteDance will create a USA subsidiary, TikTok Global, which will include TikTok's operations in the United States and other countries, excluding China.The US administration has been continuously blaming TikTok for its data insecurity."It is clear that these articles [terms] extensively show Washington's bullying style and hooligan logic. They hurt China's national security, interests and dignity", the newspaper reportedly said in an editorial in its English edition published late on Monday.White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that the United States is working through the deal. Oracle will own a 12.5 per cent stake in the new company, while Walmart will take a 7.5 per cent stake.Chinese officials said that the TkTok deal can not be completed without their approval. Walmart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon would have a seat on TikTok Global's board of directors, and four out of five members will be from the US, according to a statement from Walmart.Emoji 13.1 will come with 7 new smiley facesMany men and women around the world have long hair and beards and the new emojis promote inclusivity of more races. The face with spiral eyes will now be the one singular emoji on all platforms.The original deal emphasized the co-operative nature between Oracle and TikTok.The editorial says the Chinese government is expected to object to the requirement that only one of the five board seats will be reserved for a Chinese national, while the rest will go to Americans.TikTok has never been available in China.The company said that the 5 billion USA -dollars is based on estimated income tax and other taxes that TikTok will need to pay in the next few years. A recent rule imposed by the Chinese government prohibits any Chinese tech company from selling its technology and algorithm to foreign buyers.At similar efficiency levels, TikTok's new total of 26,000 USA workers would be expected to make between $14 billion to $19 billion annually.That vow, repeated by the president on Saturday at a campaign rally in North Carolina, was part of a concession that dealmakers offered to convince President Trump to green-light a transaction in which a new board comprised of USA citizens would oversee a new US -based company and co-owned by Oracle Corp and Walmart.Load-Date: September 23, 2020End of Document

U.S. imposes restrictions on six other Chinese mediaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 21, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 329 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- The United States rated six more Chinese publications as "foreign missions," adding them to the list of media it describes as controlled by Beijing, which must meet requirements similar to embassy and consulate taxes in the United States.Media includes Economic Daily, which provides an important window into Beijing's economic views, and Jiefang Daily, the official publication of the powerful Shanghai Communist Party Committee. The others, Yicai Global, Xinmin Evening News, Social Sciences in China Press and Beijing Review, are less well known."They are all substantially owned or effectively controlled by a foreign government," Secretary of State Miguel Pompeo said Wednesday at a briefing. "We are not imposing restrictions on what these media may publish in the United States. We simply want to make sure that Americans, consumers of information, can differentiate between news written by a free press and propaganda distributed by the Chinese Communist Party."It is the last action of reciprocal hostility in the U.S.-China dispute over press freedom. In February, the U.S. designated five Chinese media outlets as "foreign missions," including Xinhua News Agency and China Daily. Beijing responded by expelling more than a dozen journalists from three U.S. newspapers. The parties are also involved in a dispute over journalists' visas, so they have been mutually delaying the renewal of the press credentials of both countries.Media freedom has long been a point of friction between the United States and China. While U.S. media companies are largely private and protected by the First Amendment, China's news organizations are state-run or strictly censored. All are supervised by the party's Central Advertising Department. Chinese government spokesmen have repeatedly condemned the "unreasonable crackdown" on the Chinese media in the United States.Original Note:U.S. Escalates China Tensions With Further Media Restrictions©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: October 22, 2020End of Document

Thanks for being with us. We will see you here tomorrow. Good night from Sussex.MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR: Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Welcome, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, October 20. Your top stories right now, it is 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Countdown to 2020. The November election now just two short weeks away. President Trump headed to Arizona today. Joe Biden calling a lid on things until after Thursday's big debate.And mute buttons for each candidate making an appearance this debate, all this as new documents appear to show Hunter Biden's signature on paperwork from a Delaware repair shop, where he allegedly dropped off that laptop detailing overseas business deals while his father was vice president.Former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon is here this morning in the next hour to talk the very latest on these newest findings.Markets this morning are rallying. Take a look at futures indicating a gain in the triple digits once again as we are awaiting earnings this morning from Travelers, Philip Morris, Lockheed Martin and Procter & Gamble. Dow Industrials right now up 151; the NASDAQ up 76; and the S&P 500 higher by 21.A rough start to the week yesterday, meanwhile technology dragged down the markets and really turn in sentiment over stimulus. The Dow Industrials down 410 points at the end of the day; the NASDAQ down 192; and the S&P down 56 points yesterday at 4 o' clock on Wall Street.Stimulus at the forefront. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin holding talks as Pelosi's 48-hour deadline for a deal ends today. That's really what turned the market yesterday, uncertainty and upset over no deal.Big energy in 2020, while one expert thinks we will see gasoline at $6 a gallon should Joe Biden win the presidency. And President Trump's latest endorsement, why rapper 50 Cent thinks the president will keep him close to his money."Mornings with Maria" is live right now.European markets this morning look like this on the heels of pretty good moves this morning in futures. FTSE 100 is up 11; CAC quarante is up 22; but the DAX Index is lower by 43. Fractional moves this morning across Europe.Overnight in Asia, take a look, markets were mostly higher overnight as you will see the best performer was the Shanghai Composite up about 0.5 percent. The others fractionally moved.Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning. Fox News has obtained new documents appearing to show Hunter Biden's signature approving repair work on his laptop, also showing his name in the "bill to" section.There is also FBI paperwork containing serial numbers and hard drives taken into possession from that Delaware repair shop owner. We have been telling you what's on that laptop all week.Hunter's laptop said to have emails about his business dealings oversees, while working for a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president. Those emails, some of them have been verified by Fox News.Over a dozen Republicans are urging Attorney General William Barr to appoint a special counsel, probing former Vice President Joe Biden.President Trump is headed to Pennsylvania today with First Lady Melania Trump, her first rally in more than a year, her first appearance since recovering from coronavirus. Joe Biden, however, staying off the campaign trail this week to prepare for Thursday's presidential debate.And the commission on presidential debates has announced a major format change for the final debate. Candidates' microphones will be muted, while the rival delivers their opening 2-min answer for each of the debate topics.Federal prosecutors unseal charges against six Russian intelligence operators, accused of some of the biggest cyberattacks in recent years. They include the 2016 hacking of the DNC and a set of ransomware attacks costing the global community billions of dollars. Five of the six were added to the FBI's most wanted list.The group known as the Sandworms are considered to be among the most capable and dangerous hacking groups in the world.Markets this morning are higher. Take a look at futures edging higher ahead of a deadline for a new stimulus deal from Washington. Dow Industrials up 150 points; the NASDAQ up 73; and the S&P 500 higher by 21. Still not too close on an agreement here just yet.The major averages closing near the lows of the day yesterday, meanwhile the biggest names in technology led the declines amid investor worries over stimulus as well. The NASDAQ in the red for the fifth trading day in a row marking its longest losing streak in more than a year.Joining me right now is Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Chief Investment Strategist Brent Schutte; also joining the conversation this morning all morning is Fox Business' Dagen McDowell; and the King's College in Manhattan, professor of business and economics and Fox News contributor, Brian Brenberg.Great to see everybody this morning. Thank you so much for being here.Brent, let me kick it off with you. Is the market now hostage to anything that comes out on a stimulus?BRENT SCHUTTE, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, NORTHWESTERN MUTUAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Absolutely, at least in the near term. And so if there is no deal today, you will have another negative market reaction. More stimulus will reduce the uncertainty about whether or not we have enough gas to get to the other side of this COVID-19.But look, while there is some downside, there is no deal. It's still likely that you are going to get stimulus in the next couple of months. We have pulled a lot of Americans across the COVID valley, so the unemployment has gone down quite a bit.And really importantly, you have vaccine news that should be coming in the next few weeks that could be a positive. And so while I think there's some near-term downside if we get no deal, I don't think it's a market economic breaker.BARTIROMO: Well, the Senate is going to vote on a standalone payroll protection bill today. How important do you think markets will view that in a backdrop where the economy is showing signs of recovery, right?SCHUTTE: Absolutely, the economic data actually looks (inaudible) and so if you contemplate that the Atlanta fed GDP now estimates that we are going to have 35 percent at an annualized pace third quarter growth, if that would actually occur, that would leave the economy only 3 percent smaller than what it was at the beginning of the year, which I think any one of us would have taken that given where we were back in February and March.And so the economy is recovering, the economy has adapted, that's one thing that I think people miss, is that an economy does adapt. And you are seeing that on the spending side where now people are just substituting, they are spending more on goods then groceries then stay at home versus services.And so, the economy has gas left in it. I just think the stimulus would release the uncertainty that is out there.BARTIROMO: So what's your take on third quarter earnings so far? We've had a pretty robust season. Two Dow components are reporting this morning ahead of the opening bell that's Procter & Gamble and Travelers. We will be waiting for these numbers this morning, see if they impact markets at all. Your take on what we have seen so far from corporate America for the third quarter?SCHUTTE: Sure. I mentioned economic growth broadening, I mentioned the economy adapting and you're seeing that in earnings. Earnings are surprising the upside by quite a bit. We expect they will continue to. And I do think that broadening out is really important.So back in the day, you only had tech stocks that were only producing positive earnings, now it's actually starting to broaden out to more sectors of the economy as the economy has adapted, as more parts have come back online. And we think that continues into next year, which kind of is the backdrop for a better year and things that are more economically sensitive and cyclical asset classes.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a good point, because it's been pretty narrow. Let me bring Brian Brenberg in. Go ahead, Brian.BRIAN BRENBERG, PROFESSOR OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS, THE KING'S COLLEGE: Hey, Brent.Yes, so I'm looking at how the market is reacting to the stimulus talks. And I'm sitting here thinking what does Nancy Pelosi have to gain by getting anything done before the election? Investors are smart, they can see the politics here.Isn't it the case that investors are saying, probably nothing before the election, but probably something next year once the election hoopla has died down, Brent? Isn't that kind of the story? And why would the market react so strongly to what seems like a political nonstarter, at least from Nancy Pelosi's perspective?SCHUTTE: Yes, I mean the market always likes to react, especially today. It's more short-term focused than I have ever seen in my career. But I agree with you 100 percent. That's where I think the rubber meets the road is that eventually you will get some sort of stimulus, whether it be today, in December or in January.It is coming, and the market senses that. And the market can look past these near-term discussions because interest rates are low; the Federal Reserve is still holding them where they are at. They are promising to do more the need be. And so that's why I don't think it's more of an economic breaker. I just think it's something that will cause some near-term downside, but not so much that one should do anything to the portfolio.BARTIROMO: All right. Well, we will keep watching that. It seems to be certainly holding this market hostage over the near-term.Brent, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.SCHUTTE: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Brent Schutte joining us there, Northwestern.Check out your morning mover. And that's Moderna, the stock is surging this morning in the premarket after the CEO said, "He expects results from its COVID-19 vaccine trial in November and that the U.S. government could authorize the emergency use of the vaccine in December". Stock is up 3.60 percent on that news this morning.We are just getting started this morning. Coming up, threatening Americans abroad. Fox News senior strategic analyst General Jack Keane will talk about Beijing's recent comments and threats that it will detain U.S. citizens traveling in China.Next hour, we are taking a look at the market moves. Top investors are watching this morning with the word on Wall Street coming up.And then Former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon is here on the Hunter Biden corruption report and what to expect with two weeks to go before the November decision.In the 8 a.m. hour this morning, don't miss North Carolina congressional candidate, Madison Cawthorn back with us on the future of the Republican Party in the 2020 races.Plus, Trump Energy Advisor Harold Hamm joining us on the 2020 race, why he says a Biden victory would jack up the price of gasoline at the pump to 6 bucks a gallon.Don't miss a moment of it. You are watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.New Hunter Biden documents released. Fox News obtained paperwork appearing to include Hunter Biden's signature from the Mac repair store in Delaware, where the former vice president's son left his laptop. This as emails have surfaced from that laptop over the past week showing business ties between the Bidens, Ukraine and China payouts to Hunter Biden joint ventures.President Trump spoke last night during a campaign rally in Arizona on the issue.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Joe Biden is a corrupt politician, and you know what, you knew that and a lot of people know it for a long time, but now you have the laptop. It's over. And as far as I'm concerned, the Biden family is a criminal enterprise. And that's what it is.Now these are bad people, these are sick people. You notice, they never said it was made by China, because they're all on the take.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We can report, the Fox News has verified some of those emails. Joining me right now is the editor-at-large at Reason, Matt Welch. Matt, good to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.Your reaction to what we have learned based on the contents of that laptop.MATT WELCH, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, REASON: The one thing that is striking about this presidential election in general and we have two weeks from right now is that nothing seems to matter. So, for those who are looking at this, thinking that something is going to happen, we had George Floyd protests, we had riots, we had looting, we had the Democratic convention, the Republican convention.So there's two ways to look at the story. Politically, I don't think it's going to matter much at all. The question is does it matter to us as individual voters and citizens, what Hunter Biden was doing in 2015 and how Joe Biden was responding.I would pause it that with the coronavirus and the pandemic and the very many millions of us out there who are just trying to struggle to keep our heads afloat, it's going to be hard to make this election in the last 2 weeks about nepotism and corruption.BARTIROMO: But it's another example of corruption. We just came off of a four-year period where we learned it was Hillary Clinton's idea to tie Donald Trump to the Russia collusion narrative that the country was up in arms about. Now we know that was a lie and the intelligence agencies were weaponized.I agree the mainstream media won't touch it and they won't report it. So probably a portion of the people still don't understand what took place, and now you have evidence that Hunter Biden was getting paid for introductions to his father, setting up joint ventures in China.Do you think people will think that that will dictate Joe Biden's foreign policy? What did he do in terms of foreign policy with China, with Ukraine, given that he had deals with governments and he was pocketing money with his son?WELCH: I mean, just compared to Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation stuff from 5 years ago, the Clinton family set up an entire elaborate scheme for people to kind of trade in on their influence and launder their good names by giving money to organizations that the Clintons want, while she was the secretary of state for big portions of it. That was a big needy, weird smelling thing to wrap your head around.I think, when you compare Joe Biden to that, just like when you compare Joe Biden's personality and track record to Hillary Clinton's, it's just different, it's a category difference. And I don't think looking at that right now and saying, it's using the same language as the president did. The Clinton crime family language has now become the Biden crime family language.They are not the same people and this is not the same election. The president, I think, needs to run on a 2020 election and not trot out the 2016 playbook.BARTIROMO: Yes. Let me bring in Dagen McDowell. Go ahead, Dagen.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: And Matt, this goes to the point of and I don't mean to jump on what we were going to talk about later in the segment, but it goes to the point of why do people give President Trump great grades on managing the economy. But he's still trailing Joe Biden in the overall polls, the national polls, but even in the swing state polls. Although those are more narrow.Then you have, according to recent Gallup survey, 56 percent of Americans say that they are better now than they were 4 years ago, that they are in better shape. But that's not translating into good numbers for President Trump. And it's because, frankly, my opinion, his message is highly undisciplined. Then it's all over the place.You need to talk about two things, coming out of the coronavirus pandemic, the vaccines, all the things that are ahead to fight this virus, and then the economic recovery. And he proved based on deregulation and cutting taxes and cutting corporate taxes, that you can have a tide that lifts all boats in this nation.WELCH: Yes, Dagen, as usual you are always right.MCDOWELL: No, I'm not.WELCH: But also, yes, I mean, you think about it. He is spending the two weeks before the election right now lobbying insults at Dr. Anthony Fauci. And you don't have to like Fauci to ask yourself what's the point of that right now.There's a really good story you could have told as a president about the coronavirus if this is indeed what you have done and said from the beginning, which is we need to test everything. We need to move all bureaucrats out of the way, so that we can test, test, test all over the place. And once we do that, we can know how things are; and once we know how things are, we can start reopening stuff like schools and everything else.He is not telling the story. In fact, the White House has been slowing down testing, which I think is a really bad move. So to the extent that which everyone is suffering under this one big thing, and also kind of want the nonsense to go away and stop the insult comedy a little bit. When you want to stop that, what is your action at the voting booth? It is not to vote for Donald Trump. He's running like an insurgent, but he's the president.BARTIROMO: Yes. All right, Matt, great to have you on the program. Thank you so much. Matt Welch joining us there.Be sure to tune in this Friday. We will be starting an hour earlier at 5:00 a.m. Eastern, we will be breaking down the second presidential debate. It's going to be big, you don't want to miss it. Stay with us on Friday as we start an hour earlier.Coming up, exposing corruption. New documents confirm wrongdoing by Hunter Biden as the former vice president's campaign is still not denying it. The political impact next. Why haven't we heard anybody address this from the campaign?Then men taking the cues from the ladies. The new feminine trend hitting male fashion making a buzz this morning.You're watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.New bombshell Hunter Biden documents released. Fox News obtained paperwork appearing to show Hunter Biden's signature on a document from the Delaware Mac repair store, where he allegedly left that laptop. This follows what we have been reporting all week. The laptop contains emails, which detail Hunter Biden's lucrative overseas business deals, while his father was vice president.We understand that he was getting money from Chinese companies, Ukrainian companies, perhaps even others. We are waiting on more documents to come from this laptop as Rudy Giuliani told us yesterday.Brian Brenberg, your reaction to all of this.BRENBERG: Yes, it would be nice if journalists engaged in a little bit of journalism on this one and helped us figure out what's going on. It's interesting to me that Biden campaign's only response to this has been, "there's no wrongdoing". What they're not talking about is whether these documents are legitimate. And that's what people want to know.People want to know are these legitimate documents? We will draw our own conclusions about whether it's wrong. Don't tell us that, but give us the facts on this one. It's curious and telling that they will not do that, but what's worse is it seems like the media by in large wants to bury this one and ignore it. That's malpractice this close to an election.BARTIROMO: Yes, that is malpractice. And that's what you're seeing out of social media. They were very clear. We are not going to disseminate this information. And we were just showing one of the emails on screen.And it said, "My understanding is that the original agreement with the Director was for consulting fees based on introductions alone at a rate of $10 million a year for a 3-year guarantee total of $30 million. The chairman changed the deal after we met in Miami to a much more lasting and lucrative arrangement to create a holding company, 50 percent owned by me and 50 percent owned by him. Consulting fees is one piece of our income stream, but the reason this proposal by the chairman was so much more interesting to me and my family is that we would have also been partners in the equity and profits of the joint venture's investments".This is an e-mail from Hunter Biden to a gentleman in China about a joint venture for Chinese company just as Joe Biden was negotiating policy between the U.S. and China.The "Wall Street Journal" assistant editorial page editor and the co-author of "The Cost" with me, James Freeman, writes this this morning about the media coverage of the Hunter Biden's story.In his new piece, "Have the Bidens denied the story yet?" He writes this, "Some media outlets have chosen to focus their reporting on whether some journalists were afraid to touch the Biden email story before the Post published it, unless and until former Vice President Joe Biden or a member of his family wants to argue that the emails are fakes, isn't there a responsibility for all journalists to acknowledge the Post reporting and demand answers?"So they're not denying it, Dagen, and like you said earlier, lot of journalists are just not focusing on it. They don't want to touch it and certainly social media doesn't want to come out with negative stories about their guy, Joe Biden.MCDOWELL: Indeed. Rich Lowry of the National Review writes about this very thing. "Today the media cover Joe Biden the way a protection racket does." Rich Lowry writes this, "Never before have the media been so openly fearful of asking or reporting something that might hurt a presidential candidate. What are supposed to be the animating values of our adversarial press, informing the public, getting answers, and holding the powerful to account, have all been subordinated to the protection racket that is coverage of Joe Biden."He goes through this, he said, "The media is acting like a bomb disposal unit trying to eradicate anything that might hurt their preferred presidential candidate".Joe Biden wasn't even asked about this story during his ABC News town hall, where he was coddled by George Stephanopoulos like the rest of the press. And when a CBS reporter, Bo Erickson, finally steps up and just asks about the Post story, Biden gets angry. "I have no response. It's another smear campaign right up your alley. Those are the questions you always ask." But again, no denial from Joe Biden.And then the media turns on Bo Erickson when they should be applauding him for at least asking the question.BARTIROMO: Yes. And this is a massive potential cover-up by the media as well as by the FBI and some members of congress. Adam Schiff was running around on the Sunday shows, saying that this was Russian disinformation, an out-and-out lie, according to the sitting Director of National Intelligence.John Ratcliffe joined us yesterday in an exclusive interview that went viral. Here he is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: This email is legitimate.JOHN RATCLIFFE, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: So, Maria, the fact that I know so little about those emails and what is apparently on Hunter Biden's laptop, underscores the point that I just made. This is not part of some Russian disinformation campaign.The intelligence community has not been involved with Hunter Biden's laptop. Hunter Biden is U.S. person, and he would be subject to any investigation regarding fraud or corruption would be rightfully the jurisdiction of the FBI. So the FBI has had possession of this.What I can say without commenting on any investigation that they may have into corruption or fraud, is to say that their investigation does not center around Russian disinformation and the intelligence community is playing no role with respect to that.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: No surprise that Adam Schiff is telling falsehoods. He has been for four years saying that there was collusion in plain sight. It's important to get John Ratcliffe on the record there, which we did yesterday.Quick break and then Beijing is threatening Americans. What a story!General Jack Keane is here helping to break down the risk for travel to China. Don't do it if you are American.Plus, diet coke lovers rejoicing this morning, how you can get a year's supply of the fan favorite and a mini fridge. The morning buzz coming up.You're watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.MARIA BARTIROMO, ANCHOR, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Welcome back, good Tuesday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, October 20th. Let's take a look at markets this morning, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast, you've got a rally underway. Check out futures indicating a gain of 185 points this morning, that's two-thirds of 1 percent. The Nasdaq is up 94 and the S&P higher by 26 as we are awaiting more earnings this morning for the third quarter. Travelers, Philip Morris, Lockheed Martin and Proctor & Gamble all on tap this morning.It was a rough start to the week yesterday with uncertainty over stimulus and a big technology stocks selling off, dragging down markets. Take a look at where we closed, Dow Industrials were down 410 points at 4 O'clock on Wall Street. The Nasdaq gave up 192 and the S&P was lower by 56. European indices this morning are mixed, quiet session there with really fractional moves, the FTSE 100 is up 15, the CAC Quarante is up 21, the Dax Index is lower by 42. Similar story overnight in Asia, mostly higher by fractional moves pretty much across the board.Back in the U.S., wildfires are still raging across Colorado this morning. Cheryl Casone with the details now. Cheryl, good morning to you.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: That is right, Maria, and good morning. Crews are trying to get a hand on that Cameron Peak Fire, it's been called the largest in the state's history with more than 204,000 acres destroyed. Right now, it's 51 percent contained. Another blaze is raging in Colorado, the Cameron Fire forcing nearly 3,000 people from their homes, at least 26 homes have actually been destroyed. Well, Moderna CEO says he expects interim results from its COVID-19 vaccine trial next month. And the U.S. government could grant emergency use by December. Stephane Bancel speaking at the Wall Street Journal's" annual Tech Life Conference yesterday said that ramping up production is a challenge, but Moderna is on track to produce 20 million doses of the vaccine by the end of the year.Let's take a look at the stock in the pre-market, there you go, it's up more than 4 percent right now. Well, Intel getting out of the flash memory business. The company has agreed to $9 billion deal with South Korea's SK Hynix, which would make them one of the largest flash memory manufacturers in the world, with more than 20 percent of the market share out there. Intel has been looking to shed its flash memory business due to sagging prices in that market in general. Taking a look at Intel in the pre-market. Stock up about three-quarters of a percent. And finally, bank on it, UBS seeing its best third-quarter in a decade.The Swiss bank reported a net income of $2.1 billion, that's a 99 percent jump from the same period last year. That definitely beat analyst's expectations where were sitting at 1.5 billion going into the earnings report. The rebound coming, following an 11 percent drop in the second quarter and, of course, that was related, Maria, to the coronavirus pandemic which has affected companies all over the world. And those are your headlines, back over to you.BARTIROMO: Absolutely, Cheryl, thank you so much. Meanwhile this scary story. The Chinese government is threatening to detain innocent U.S. nationals if you are an American in China. They're saying that's in retaliation to the Justice Department's prosecution of Chinese military affiliated scholars. They caught them cheating and sending data back to the CCP. The "Wall Street Journal" broke this story this weekend. According to the journal, Chinese officials have issued retaliatory warnings to U.S. government representatives through the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. Joining me right now is retired four-star general, Fox News senior strategic analyst, General Jack Keane. General, it's good to see you this morning.I've been waiting for this actually to happen where Chinese Communist Party was going to push back on the string of indictments we've had this year. It's not safe to travel to China, is it?JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Well, I wouldn't go that far, Maria. I'd pay attention to what the State Department warnings are. I mean, what is really happening here, we have arrested 5 Chinese nationalists for what we termed as visa fraud and what is that? They did not declare that they were working for the Chinese military as research scientists, and what they truly are, are spies trying to gather intelligence, steal intellectual property, and we sort of caught them at that.So, we have them under arrest and as a result of that, this is retaliation by the Chinese in terms of their threat to hold people, American citizens in China. Now, this is something that went on during the cold war. We captured Russian spies, the Russians captured American spies, but the difference was they were spies. In other words, the Americans that were captured were, indeed, spies, they were working for the United States government.They just weren't in Russia as normal citizens, and then we exchanged those spies. That's what this is taking place here. The Chinese have already done this with Canada, with Australia and with Switzerland in retaliation for their taking action against Chinese people operating there in their country. One very notoriety was the Huawei executive in Canada who was arrested for doing much the same thing.So, I think where we're at --BARTIROMO: Yes, but --KEANE: Will China follow through --BARTIROMO: Yes --KEANE: On this? I think they will, yes, absolutely, they will. And we'll wind up exchanging who they take and who we have under arrest. And you're using the right term. They will take them as hostages because they are innocent Americans, they're not working for the United States government and they are not spying for the United States government, whoever they do pick up. I think they'll try to find some kind of connection to some alleged activity which will probably absolutely be, you know, false reporting.BARTIROMO: Right, so it sounds to me that it's not safe to travel to China right now. I mean, you've got indictments that have happened with substantial stories around them. These people have been tied to the Chinese military. The Chinese military is the priority in China. So, you've got these students saying that they are on student visas, meanwhile, they're just spying for the Chinese military, and they're just going to detain Americans so that they could change the results of these indictments. Would that be something that the U.S. government would do, drop the indictments so that they release innocent Americans?KEANE: Well, certainly, that's what -- that's what the Chinese Communist Party wants to have happened. I don't know what the government's --BARTIROMO: Right --KEANE: Position would be on that. And we also have other pressure points. Listen, what's really happening here is that the world is relooking at relationship with China, and they're back on their heels somewhat because of it. I frankly think that President Xi overreached, certainly was spreading the world pandemic, was clamping down on Hong Kong and what he's doing with the Uyghurs and 380 concentration camps. There isn't total criticism against him in ways that we haven't seen in a number of years against the Chinese president. I'm not suggesting for a minute --BARTIROMO: Right --KEANE: That President Xi is going to change his policy, and all of a sudden, he's going to start exercising soft power and stop being aggressive.BARTIROMO: Right --KEANE: I'm not saying that. But what I am saying, he has -- he has pushed back, he has not seen in the seven years that he has been in office, internally in his own country --BARTIROMO: Understood.KEANE: And we have got to keep the pressure --BARTIROMO: At the same time --KEANE: Ourselves --BARTIROMO: Yes -- pardon me, general. At the same time during this coronavirus pandemic, the Chinese Communist Party has upped its aggressiveness, militarizing the South China Sea, moving into Hong Kong with new laws and regulations. Now, the "South China Morning Post" is reporting that China is beefing up its coastal forces in preparation for a possible invasion of Taiwan. Military observers say that China has upgraded their military bases, moved their most advanced hypersonic missile to the area. General, we know that China recently invaded India and as a result 20 soldiers are dead because of a fight at the border of the Himalayas. Now, they are increasing their forces near Taiwan. Your take on this.KEANE: Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call that invasion of India. It was more of a border scrimmage that the Chinese crossed what they believe is their international boundary favorable to them, yes. And -- but did they -- did they start it? You bet, yes, they did. And I think that's the aggression. What has been going on with President Xi since he took power, Maria. He wanted to unite China, and that is take control of Tibet, mission accomplished. Take control of Hong Kong, he blew away the treaty 25 years before it expired and now he's got control of Hong Kong.And there's a third piece that's remaining, and that's Taiwan. He's tried to do two things, one is make sure Taiwan does not declare independence. Taiwan is not going to declare independence. Number 2, is they wanted Taiwan to submit and voluntarily become part of mainland China in the sense of under control of the CCP. And they have not done that. As a matter of fact, their resolve because of China's aggression has strengthen so much so that the majority of the people who live in Taiwan do not see themselves as Chinese. They see themselves as Taiwanese.And they do not want any part of the Chinese Communist Party. So, President Xi has a choice to be made. He knows full well now, that despite all the intimidation and coercion, Taiwan is not going to buckle. So, is he going to force this by a blockade or by a limited attack to try to take down the national leaders and the legislature and force a surrender or an all out invasion? He has a number of options. His other options have not succeeded. And this remains to be seen. I think the United States should do something and do something very significant here geopolitically, and with our allies, make a statement that we will defend Taiwan.Right now, that's ambiguous, and why is it ambiguous? The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, when Jimmy Carter was president and recognized Chinese Communist Party as a country, we broke with Taiwan and we said we can arm Taiwan and we left its defense ambiguous. We should remove that ambiguity. We are arming them and we should tell the world that we would defend them if there's an invasion as well. That is the best way --BARTIROMO: All right, really --KEANE: To prevent the invasion.BARTIROMO: Just extraordinary, dangerous situations across the world. General, it's good to see you this morning, thank you so much. We of course will keep watching China and be sure to pre-order my new book, I talk all about this conflict in "The Cost: Trump, China and the American Revival", it's out October 27th, next week, you can pre-order it right now, thecostbook.com. We'll be right back, stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A coronavirus warning for the final quarter of 2020. Top infectious disease expert, Dr. Michael Osterholm predicting that the next 6 to 12 weeks will be the darkest of the entire pandemic. He's claiming we'll see numbers higher than the current range of 75,000 daily cases between now and the holidays. Joining me right now is family medicine doctor, Mikhail Varshavski, aka Dr. Mike. Dr. Mike, thanks very much for joining us to talk about this important prediction. What do you think about that?MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, FAMILY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN: Good morning, Maria, thank you so much for having me. I think when it comes to predicting numbers with COVID -- with regards to COVID-19, we in the scientific community have been largely inaccurate. All of our models from the beginning have been wrong, and that's not to say that scientists don't know what we're talking about. It's simply because this is a novel virus, we're learning more and more about it. And there's a huge variable at play here which is us the people. And where I see the darkest days ahead of us coming from is from the amount of political polarization surrounding this virus. The fact that we in the scientific community, when we say something, where we put out information, it's met with hesitancy, with distrust.For example, Maria, we have a vaccine, a potential vaccine that's going to be coming out in the coming months, but the amount of people who are actually interested in getting this vaccine is falling with each day. And I think that largely comes from the rhetoric where we're saying scientists don't know what we're talking about. And that's just not true. So, I would love to see the administration really step up, and instead of creating a battle with their scientific advisers, step up, trust us, work together because we in the scientific community cannot do it alone. We need politicians' help and the politicians need scientific advisors in a moment like this. So I really hope we can collaborate --BARTIROMO: Yes --VARSHAVSKI: Better than we have thus far and restore some faith into science.BARTIROMO: I want to get your advice in terms of what people should be doing going into these next 6 to 12 weeks. Is there anything different that we should be aware of that perhaps this other spike is on the way?VARSHAVSKI: Yes, I think because we've developed this cautious fatigue, the fatigue with the pandemic, which is really understandable. We're all tired of it. Because of this fatigue, because now we're going to be spending more times indoors because of the weather. We need to play it safer than we have over the last 2-3 months. Play it more conservatively --BARTIROMO: OK --VARSHAVSKI: Take less chances, be around less people, at least for the next 6 to 8 weeks, and then guide yourself based on the numbers that we see coming out. But for now, play it conservatively as possible.BARTIROMO: Yes, let's be cautious going into this colder month. Dagen, jump in here.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: I just want to -- and this -- Dr. Mike doesn't need to answer this, but the anti-vaccine, fear-mongering is coming from Democrats. It's been coming from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and front and center yesterday was Governor Andy Cuomo on "Good Morning America", saying Americans, quote, "should be skeptical of any COVID vaccine. The CDC and FDA clear for use. Now, he's going to have his own team of doctors and scientists, California is going to have their own team of doctors and scientists to get in the way essentially of delivering this vaccine once it is approved by the FDA to the American people.When you already have more than one quarter of people in the "Wall Street Journal" poll last week saying that they are not going to take the vaccine, that kind of rhetoric from Democrats is appalling. It is beyond the pale that they are essentially frightening the American people for taking a vaccine which ultimately rescues us in terms of our health and our economy. That's got to stop, but it won't because it's election season.VARSHAVSKI: Absolutely, Dagen, I think we should not be --BARTIROMO: And it won't -- yes, go ahead, Dr. Mike.VARSHAVSKI: We should not be -- yes, I just don't think we should be villainizing the FDA or the CDC. These are organizations that we need to put our trust in, and at the same time, you know, President Trump had a call not too long ago where he mentioned scientists as people who are getting in the way of his plans. You know, we in the scientific community focus on one thing, and that's science. We don't always get it right, we need to approach it with a level of humility, but attacking science altogether is not a solution either.BARTIROMO: All right, Dr. Mike, good to see you, thank you so much. Have a great day, we'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, time for the Morning Business. First up, the latest trend in fashion is for everybody. Men's nail polish gaining popularity influenced by super stars like Harry Styles and Bad Bunny. Beauty companies are meeting the demand by adding more muted male shades to their lines. Brian, will you treat yourself to a manicure with color?BRIAN BRENBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Maria, I'm truly trying to give this story an honest effort, but I just don't think this is my story. I will say this, the thing I'm trying to teach my son is how to get dirt under his fingernails, not paint on his finger nails. So, I think I'm probably in just a different camp on this one.BARTIROMO: Oh, you're so honest, I love it, thank you, Brian. Next, a pick-me-up for your soda fan in your life. Diet Coke is giving out a year supply of the popular drink, plus, it's also giving out a mini fridge in a new promotion to celebrate National Boss' Day, but because everyone is the boss in 2020, anybody can be nominated online. Dagen, what do you think? You're going to nominate somebody?MCDOWELL: No, I'm a Red Bull and sugar free Red Bull drinker, not Diet Coke. I want to say something about the nail polish though, men in cities have always gotten manicures and gotten their nails buffed to a high shine. Treat nail polish as like jewelry, if you will, like wearing a ring. A lot of my friends wear it, dark shades like black nail polish, it's super cool, come on. I can't wear -- I can't even wear nail polish. I look like I dug a grave in the backyard with my bare hands. So, any man whose nails are nice enough to polish, do it.BARTIROMO: Still ahead, exposing corruption. Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon will join us to talk about the Hunter Biden corruption reports, what to expect with 2 weeks to go before the November decision. It's all next hour right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.Load-Date: October 20, 2020End of Document

This IPO is a measure of China's growing strengthCNN WireOctober 25, 2020 Sunday 12:40 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 863 wordsDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  When Ant Group prices its IPO in Shanghai and Hong Kong this week, it could set a new world record for a stock market listing. But it will also ram home a much bigger point.What's happening: In finance and tech, China's clout is growing just as its economy recovers from the pandemic in better shape than other big players. Ant is the crown jewel of Jack Ma's tech empire, best known for its Alipay app that has more than 730 million monthly active users. On Tuesday, it's expected to announce that it will surpass the $29.4 billion Saudi Aramco's float raised last December by selling shares both in Hong Kong and on Shanghai's Star Market, China's answer to the Nasdaq.For Beijing, which wants to encourage more seasoned investors to park their money in Chinese stocks and more Chinese tech companies to list their shares at home, it's poised to be a huge win."The Chinese government is more than happy to host a national champion on one of its major capital markets domestically at a time when many Chinese companies are facing greater political headwinds overseas," Xiaomeng Lu, senior geotechnology analyst at Eurasia Group, told me.Lu said Beijing has been trying to send a message to China's top tech companies: "This is a difficult time, and we have your back."A growing number of firms are listening as US-China tensions ramp up. There's little clarity on whether the presidential election in November will reset the relationship.US threats and restrictions against Chinese tech companies like TikTok and WeChat send a warning. On Wall Street, Chinese firms also face additional scrutiny. Luckin Coffee was kicked off the Nasdaq following the disclosure of major accounting irregularities. US lawmakers, government agencies and stock exchanges have since taken steps aimed at limiting Beijing's access to America's vast capital markets."Chinese companies consider repatriation both to please [Beijing] and to insulate themselves from potential US action," Brock Silvers, chief investment officer at Kaiyuan Capital and former chief investment officer at Adamas Asset Management, told me.In such an environment, a company like Ant has good reason to pursue a listing at home. Over the long term, that should be to China's benefit.Ant's decision to opt for the Star Market, a pet project of Chinese President Xi Jinping, will give it a huge boost in legitimacy and value, Lu said, noting that the massive IPO will push the market capitalization of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which includes the Star board, close to that of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Silvers points out that the listing also gives China "greater control over an important company in a cutting edge sector."Watch this space: China's markets are still "fairly immature" and "highly volatile," per Lu. But a listing like Ant's will certainly help raise their profile.Can Big Tech keep up its winning streak?Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet now account for 23% of the market value of the S&P 500 --- so you can bet that when all five companies report earnings this week, investors will be paying close attention.In the second quarter, Big Tech served up a solid rebuttal to those who fear shares in these firms are overvalued.See here: Amazon, which has benefited from surging demand for deliveries, posted quarterly revenue of $88.9 billion, a 40% increase from the prior year and a staggering $8 billion more than Wall Street expected.Companies like Amazon and Microsoft likely maintained their momentum between July and September as work from home boosted demand for products like cloud services. The consensus on the Street is that Amazon's revenue will rise 32% compared to the same period in 2019.But as pressure to regulate tech companies grows in Washington, strong results cut both ways.Last week, the Trump administration sued Google in the largest antitrust case against a tech company in more than two decades. The Justice Department made sweeping allegations that Google has stifled competition to maintain its powerful position in the marketplace for online search and advertising.For now, Wall Street views the risk that Washington could break up Big Tech companies as fairly limited. Growing financial clout, however, could put a larger target on these companies' backs.Up nextMonday: New US home sales; Germany business climate; Hasbro earningsTuesday: Ant Group prices IPO; US consumer confidence; Microsoft, 3M, BP, Caterpillar, Eli Lilly, Merck, Pfizer and Xerox earningsWednesday: Bank of Canada meeting; Boeing, Dine Brands, GE, Mastercard, UPS, Beyond Meat, Etsy, Ford, Gilead Sciences, Pinterest and Visa earningsThursday: US third quarter GDP; Japan consumer confidence; Initial US jobless claims; European Central Bank meeting; Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Comcast, Dunkin, Kellogg, Kraft Heinz, Moderna, Molson Coors, Spotify, Yum!

CONDOLEEZZA RICE OPENS HOOVER VIRTUAL CONFERENCE ON THE RISE OF DIGITAL AUTHORITARIANISMStates News ServiceOctober 5, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 742 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: HOOVER INSTITUTION (STANFORD, CA) BodyThe following information was released by the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace:The Hoover Institution's new director, Condoleezza Rice, provided opening remarks on Tuesday, September 29, to a Hoover-partnered virtual conference about the Chinese government's application of artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge technologies, arguing that they pose a unique and far greater challenge than Soviet military ambitions during the Cold War.The four-day conference, The Rise of Digital Authoritarianism: China, AI, and Human Rights, which runs on select dates through October 9, is copresented by Hoover's project on China's Global Sharp Power, chaired by Senior Fellow Larry Diamond and managed by Research Fellow Glenn Tiffert; Stanford's Global Digital Policy Incubator; the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence; and the Human Rights Foundation. Programs include keynote conversations with Eric Schmidt, former Google chairman and CEO; Michael Brown, director of the Defense Innovation Unit at the US Department of Defense; and Audrey Tang, Taiwan's digital minister. Panels cover how AI is powering China's domestic surveillance state, the ethics of doing business with China and Chinese companies, competing in the superpower marathon with China, and how democracies should respond to China's emergence as an AI superpower.An expert on the history of the Soviet Union and Russia, Rice explained that Moscow was a less formidable adversary than Beijing, because the Soviet economy could not sustain support for its global military ambitions. The Soviet Union was largely isolated from world trade and made up a paltry 1 percent of international GDP in the 1980s."We thought of it as a military giant, but it was in fact a technological midget," Rice said. "We were able to defeat the Soviet Union on our values, of course, but also because its technological deficit eventually caught up with it."Rice explained that since Premier Deng Xiaoping's market reforms in the 1980s, the United States has hoped that China's economic integration with the free world and the growth of its middle class would lead to more rights for its citizens and perhaps political liberalization. She added that in 2005 her then deputy secretary of state, Robert Zoellick, underlined these hopes by asserting that China should become a "responsible stakeholder" in the liberal economic order from which it was deriving enormous economic benefits.Instead of assuming the obligations of a "responsible stakeholder," China has used its rapidly accumulated wealth and exploited its engagement with American technological innovation to invest in high-tech surveillance capabilities against its citizens and ethnic minorities, such as the Uighur Muslims. Beijing has also become increasingly capable militarily, as evident in its assertiveness in the South China Sea and the Strait of Taiwan."[China has] pushed its own technological frontiers by a very determined desire to be the leader," Rice said.Rice believes that in Silicon Valley there is an attitude that technological innovation always provides good for society. She asserts, however, that technology should be seen as neutral, neither good nor bad. Its advancement should be informed by America's democratic values and institutional constraints that account for ethics, individual liberty, and concerns over personal privacy."Human beings have generally been a lot better at the knowledge part of technology than at the wisdom part," Rice held.She maintains that for authoritarian regimes like the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), an unrestrained application of such technology allows them to "dream big." Beijing has not only created an Orwellian state apparatus that oppresses its people and leaves them no place to hide but also aims to export this mode of governance and interfere in the political affairs of democracies across the world.A lack of institutional constraints, Rice concludes, provides the CCP and other authoritarians strategic advantages over the free world. However, she cautions that Americans should avoid imitating China and surrendering its democratic values to meet this challenge."We need to have a concerted effort on behalf of free peoples to make sure that the digital authoritarians don't win," Rice said. "They can't win the race for this technology, because whoever wins this race is going to have a leg up on shaping the international system."Load-Date: October 6, 2020End of Document

It is also why we are opening up the forum via live stream for the first time ever, to make these conversations accessible to a widespread global audience at a critically important time."Following the success of the 2019 forum in Beijing, co-hosted with CCIEE, the 2020 forum also welcomes IISS and MINDS to this year's virtual event. These organizations will lend their unique perspectives and insight to drive a constructive dialogue on how best to emerge from the Covid-19 crisis, ease the global transition that is underway, and foster critical development drivers in the new economic era."The Covid-19 pandemic has brought massive new challenges and uncertainties to global economic and social development. At this critical historic moment, CCIEE as a think tank feels a deep responsibility to continue working closely with Bloomberg and other organizations to host the New Economy Forum virtually, bringing together influential global government, business and thought leaders to discuss the new issues and challenges facing humanity, and to contribute to global economic recovery and social innovations for future development," saidZhang Xiaoqiang,Executive Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges. "The IISS is a global institution keenly interested in providing facts and analysis on how geo-economic trends affect international security and stability," saidJohn Chipman,Director-General and Chief Executive of The International Institute for Strategic Studies."Working closely with those in the private sector bringing their innovations to market and navigating the inevitable uncertainties is important to us. We are therefore hugely delighted to be part of the discussions at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum this year and to be joining others to advance thinking on the changing shape of international economic relations.""It's a critical time for global business, government, and non-profit leaders to come together and build consensus on how best to lead the world through recovery and reconstruction post-Covid-19," saidGraça Machel,Executive Chair of the Mandela Institute for Development Studies. "African leaders, many of whom will join in this dialogue at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum, must play a central role in guiding this agenda and implementing policies that will ensure that interests of all citizens are included."Michael R. Bloomberg, Founder of Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg Philanthropies, and Three-Term Mayor of New York City, will open the 2020 forum, which features thought-provoking plenaries, presentations, breakouts and bilateral meetings to advance a practical agenda for recovery. Over the course of four days and spanning multiple time zones, the agenda will focus on five core topic areas: finance, trade, climate, health and cities. A daily "Global Voices" segment will elevate a diverse range of contributors from around the world, giving them a platform to speak directly to the NEF community about the challenges they are facing and what they need to recover in a post-Covid economy.The preliminary list of speakers for the 2020 Bloomberg New Economy Forum features prominent business executives, government leaders and experts from across all sectors and geographies, including:H.E.

Ashford Trust Files Investor Presentation Explaining Why It Recommends Voting In Favor Of The Two Proposals At The October 6th Special Meeting; The Company also Challenges Cygnus Capital's Uninformed and Misleading ClaimsPR NewswireSeptember 25, 2020 Friday 8:00 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1800 wordsDateline: DALLAS, Sept. 25, 2020 BodyPR Newswire Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc. (NYSE: AHT) ("Ashford Trust" or the "Company") today announced that it has filed a presentation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission detailing why its Board of Directors has recommended that its common shareholders vote in favor of the two proposals at the Company's upcoming Special Meeting.  The presentation is available online at the Company's website,http://www.ahtreit.comon the "Investor" page. The Company's presentation also challenges the uninformed and misleading claims made by Cygnus Capital. As the Company has discussed, the approval of both proposals is necessary to complete the Company's proposed offers to exchange any and all shares of its preferred stock (the "Exchange Offers"). These strategic steps are crucial to the long-term viability of its business due to the severe impact of COVID-19 on the entire travel industry. As disclosed in the Company's SEC filings, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and the Company's proposed Exchange Offers are an important part of the efforts to address that.As detailed in the investor presentation, COVID-19 has decimated the hotel industry as demand evaporated following government shutdowns with unprecedented declines in hotel revenue as a result. Further, a recovery remains uncertain, with leading experts forecasting that hotel fundamentals will not return to 2019 levels until at least 2024. History also suggests a recovery will take at least four years, consistent with the U.S. hotel RevPAR recovery from the Financial Crisis over a decade ago and following the tragedy of 9/11.Ashford Trust believes its common shares currently trade at option value, inhibiting the Company's ability to grow and access capital. A successful completion of the Exchange Offers should increase the Company's common equity market cap.  A larger common equity base should help Ashford Trust efficiently access capital.  A failure to complete the Exchange Offers could imperil the value of the Company's common shares and could potentially result in a bankruptcy filing.Cygnus Capital continues to make misguided and misleading comments about the Company and the hotel industry, including:Cygnus Capital believes that the U.S. hotel recovery will be consistent with China.  The Chinese government had a very different response to the COVID-19 pandemic than the United States government.  As a result, the Company believes hotel occupancy rates in China have no relevance to the trajectory of the recovery in hotel occupancy rates in the United States.Cygnus Capital states that the Company should engage an advisor to explore financing alternatives.   While the Company quickly engaged Lismore Capital, a subsidiary of Ashford Inc., to pursue forbearance agreements on all of its debt as it became clear that COVID-19 would have a significant impact on its cash flows, the Company subsequently began working with Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP and RBC Capital Markets, LLC in May 2020 to evaluate various restructuring, recapitalization and liquidity alternatives and those engagements are ongoing. Cygnus Capital demanded the Company should hire independent third party advisors.  The Company agrees, which is why it did so four months ago.  If Cygnus Capital has sourced potential capital partners for Ashford Trust, the Company would encourage Cygnus to reach out to RBC Capital Markets so they may follow up.Continued lack of understanding regardingthe Company's financials and cash flows.Contrary to what Cygnus Capital asserts, Ashford Trust needs to address liquidity. Waiting around for a quick rebound in the industry to save the Company is not a viable option. Ashford Trust would like to remind investors that it has approximately $17 million in monthly debt service and corporate expenses. Additionally, while the Company is still negotiating forbearance agreements with lenders, it does not have full access to the restricted cash on the Company's balance sheet.As previously discussed, the Company is not convinced that Cygnus Capital has the long-term interests of shareholders in mind.  Given the timing and the sizing of their recent common and preferred stock purchases and their lack of interest in engaging in dialogue with Company, it appears their interests may be focused on the short-term performance of the stock and not on the long-term health and viability of the Company, which is why they continue to make these misguided and misleading statements.  ASHFORD TRUST'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS URGE YOU TO VOTE "FOR" THE TWO PROPOSALS AT THE OCTOBER 6th SPECIAL MEETING TO PROTECT YOUR INVESTMENT.YOUR VOTE IS CRITICAL NO MATTER HOW MANY OR HOW FEW SHARES YOU OWN. If you do not vote, it will have the same effect as rejecting the proposed amendment to our corporate charter, which is necessary in order to complete the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitation.  We urge you to vote "FOR" the two proposals on the proxy card.  If you have questions or need assistance in voting your shares, please contact our proxy solicitation firm, at 1-877-787-9239 or by email atAshord@investor.morrowsodali.comWhere You Can Find Additional InformationCompletion of the Exchange Offers and the Consent Solicitation are subject to certain conditions, which are set forth in more detail in the Company's registration statement on Form S-4 (as amended, the "Registration Statement") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for the purpose of registering the Common Stock issued pursuant to the Exchange Offers under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Registration Statement was declared effective on September 9, 2020 at 4:00 p.m. ET. The Company has also filed with the SEC a Schedule TO for the Exchange Offers and a definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A to solicit proxies from the holders of its Common Stock to approve the relevant items upon which the holders of the Common Stock will be entitled to vote (the "Proxy Statement"). The Proxy Statement was first mailed to stockholders on or about September 10, 2020. The Company may extend or terminate the Exchange Offers under certain circumstances as described in the Registration Statement. Additional information regarding these transactions can be found in the Company's investor presentation available athttps://dealroadshow.finsight.com/retail-roadshows.Common stockholders who have questions about the Exchange Offers should contact our proxy solicitation firm at 1-877-787-9239 or by email atAshord@investor.morrowsodali.comor contact:RBC Capital Markets, LLC, as Dealer ManagerTel: (212) 618-7843Toll-free: (877) 381-2099Email:liability.management@rbccm.comCertain Information Regarding ParticipantsThe Company, its directors and certain of its executive officers are participants in the solicitation of proxies from the Company's shareholders in connection with the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation. Information about the Company's executive officers and directors and their ownership of the Company's stock is set forth in the definitive proxy statement that was filed with the SEC on September 10, 2020.This does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale.

US announces charges against Malaysian, Chinese hackersStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 18, 2020 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 695 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyOne of the five defendants told a colleague that he was very close to the Chinese Ministry of State Security and would be protected "unless something very big happens", said Deputy Atty.The Justice Department has been particularly active this year in prosecutions related to alleged Chinese espionage and hacking.It is part of a broader Trump administration campaign to call out Beijing for its long-running efforts to spy on the West to advance its economy. Said Mr Rosen: "Some of these criminal actors believed their association with the PRC provided them free licence to hack and steal across the globe".The Chinese hackers also targeted government computers and networks of Vietnam and United Kingdom.In addition to charging the seven men, USA authorities said they seized hundreds of accounts, servers, domain names, and command-and-control (C2) "dead drop" web pages used by the defendants to conduct their computer intrusion offenses.It's one of the largest hacking campaigns to be prosecuted in the United States to date, and the defendants' alleged methods laid out in the complaint reveal the prominence of so-called supply chain attacks that target software providers in order to hack their customers.Five Chinese nationals working as part of a well-resourced hacking group and two Malaysian nationals have been charged in connection with a global hacking campaign that hit hundreds of targets in the USA and around the world in multiple industries, the Department of Justice announced Wednesday. For some games, it is simpler to buy a new player profile using such currency already in the account."In addition to arresting warrants for all of the charged defendants, in September 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued seizure warrants that resulted in the recent seizure of hundreds of accounts, servers, domain names, and command-and-control (C2) "dead drop" web pages used by the defendants to conduct their computer intrusion offenses", the DoJ said. These intrusions also facilitated the defendants' other criminal schemes, including ransomware and crypto-jacking schemes, the latter refers to the group's unauthorised use of victim computers to mine cryptocurrency.In a report a year ago, the cybersecurity firm FireEye said APT41 targeted call record information at telecommunications companies, and once hacked a hotel's reservation system before Chinese officials stayed there, "suggesting the group was tasked to reconnoitre the facility for security reasons".Disgaea 6 is a Nintendo Switch exclusiveThis is not the first time a Japanese company excludes the PS4 from a multiplatform release in the west. Preorders are available at the NISA Online Store, as well as other participating retailers.China has long rejected the US accusations. Neither firm was identified.The Department said that, in some cases, the defendants' intrusions were conducted "at the behest of Iran", including cases in which they obtained information about unnamed dissidents, human rights activists, or opposition leaders.In one case, they hacked a university in IN, targeting the departments of computer science, veterinary science and pharmacy, prosecutors said.The charges against the defendants came down in three separate indictments.APT41 is the earliest known MSS contractor group, industry analysts say.Its criminal operations appear to predate work for the state, and it may have been co-opted by MSS, which would have significant leverage over it, said John Hultquist, director of intelligence analysis at FireEye, a cybersecurity firm."In situations such as this, a bargain can be reached between the security service and the operators wherein the operators enjoy protection in return for offering high-end talent to the service" while allowing the government to deny involvement, he said.Pointing to the Chinese government's lack of action in previous United States hacking cases, Mr Rosen said that Beijing showed a pattern of tolerating criminal activity by hackers who were willing to work on behalf of the Chinese intelligence services. Those objectives focus on making China a leader in 10 high-tech industries by 2025, he said.Load-Date: September 18, 2020End of Document

China Shows Off What Happens 'If War Breaks Out Today' Amid Taiwan Tensions with U.S.Newsweek.comSeptember 21, 2020 Monday 7:12 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 846 wordsByline: Tom O'ConnorHighlight: "If they play around, if they want to play the game, they've got some big problems," President Donald Trump warned.BodyA frontline regional command of the Chinese armed forces has released a video advertising what its military response would be if war broke out in the Taiwan Strait, where tensions are running high with the United States.The People's Liberation Army Eastern Theater Command released a cinematic clip on social media site Sina Weibo, bearing the tagline "If war breaks out today, this is our answer," a reference to the patriotic lyrics of the military score playing in the background. As the song's words tell of an absolute preparedness for battle, Chinese troops can be seen rushing imagined battlefields and firing missiles.The PLA has regularly shown off its military might online, but the latest message comes at a particularly fraught time as both the Eastern and Southern Theater Commands step up exercises in the contested waters separating the mainland from self-ruling Taiwan.The Chinese government claims Taiwan as its own, but the U.S. has sold military equipment to and expanded unofficial relations with the autonomous administration there in moves that have angered China. Indications of tightening ties between Washington and Taipei have led to strong reactions from Beijing.Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment Keith Krach's visit to Taiwan on Thursday was met with the commencement of PLA air and sea exercises that Chinese military officials have tied to the deteriorating security situation.Pentagon spokesperson John Supple told Newsweek at the time that "the PLA's aggressive and destabilizing reactions reflect a continued attempt to alter the status quo and rewrite history.""This is another example of the PRC increasingly using its military as a tool of coercion with Taiwan and other neighbors," he said. "Taiwan's security—and its people's ability to determine their future, free from coercion—remains a vital interest to the United States and is integral to regional security."But China has stepped up its warnings to Taiwan, with the former's warplanes reportedly crossing the de facto divide running through the Taiwan Strait some 40 times. Taiwanese forces scrambled its own jets in response, and Defense Minister Yen Ming asserted the country's right to "self-defense and to counter-attack" in the event of perceived territorial incursions.The view from Beijing sees no borders in the water."Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory, and there is no so-called "center line" in the strait," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters at a press conference in Beijing.He accused the U.S. of violating the four-decade One China Policy that declared Beijing to be the one true representative of China. U.S. Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs Assistant Secretary David R. Stilwell affirmed Washington's commitment to this understanding in his testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Friday, but also reiterated that the U.S. was responsible for Taiwan's security.Wang, for his part, promised a "forceful response" for those who encouraged "separatist forces" in Taiwan during the briefing.The contested waters of the Asia-Pacfic have grown particularly heated as Washington and Beijing's rivalry deepened. The two countries have traded accusations ranging from dishonest trade practices to human rights abuses, but China has grown especially defensive of its territorial claims to the region, including its eastern border with India and over Hong Kong, the East and South China Seas and Taiwan.The latest annual Pentagon report on China's military power released earlier this month found that "China continues to view the Taiwan issue as the most important and sensitive issue between the United States and China."It listed a series of steps the PLA has taken to block foreign interference on the subject and potentially even gearing up to retake the island by force. Chinese President Xi Jinping has offered peaceful reunification, but he has has not ruled out a military campaign to assert control over Taiwan.In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Trump too talked tough on the flashpoint, but declined to specify how he planned to respond to the recent Chinese military activity in the Taiwan Strait."They know they've got some big problems, OK?" the president said. "If they play around, if they want to play the game, they've got some big problems."Trump was a no-show, however, at the United Nations on Monday, where acting U.S. Deputy Permanent Representative Ambassador Cherith Norman Chalet spoke for the 75th anniversary of the international body in place of the president. Xi spoke remotely to commemorate the event, adopting a softer tone than his U.S. counterpart.He addressed his country's worsening feud with the U.S. without mentioning the country by name."Cold War mentality, ideological lines or zero-sum game are no solution to a country's own problem, still less an answer to mankind's common challenges," Xi said. "What we need to do is to replace conflict with dialogue, coercion with consultation and zero-sum with win-win."Link to ImageGraphic china, eastern, theater, command, missile, videoEastern Theater Command/Chinese People's Liberation ArmyThe Chinese People's Liberation Army Eastern Theater Command fires missiles in a promotional video shared September 21.

Disney hit by backlash after thanking Xinjiang authorities in 'Mulan' creditsCNN WireSeptember 8, 2020 Tuesday 6:14 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1398 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Disney has publicly thanked a Chinese government agency accused of human rights abuses in Xinjiang for its help in making "Mulan" --- a revelation that has provoked a storm of criticism online. Disney acknowledges several Chinese government bodies in the credits for the live-action remake of the 1998 animated picture of the same name, but a few in particular have raised red flags: The Xinjiang government's publicity department and the Public Security and Tourism bureaus for Turpan, a city of about 633,400 people just outside Xinjiang's capital Urumqi.Disney did not respond to a request for comment from CNN Business to its media inquiry line, and to US press officers about the film and the credits. It's not clear how much of "Mulan" may have been shot in Xinjiang, though people who worked on the movie have said on social media and in interviews that they scouted and filmed locations there.  The US State Department estimates that since 2015 as many as two million of the Muslim-majority Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities have been imprisoned in enormous re-education camps in Xinjiang. The Turpan Public Security Bureau has been listed by the US government as an organization involved in "human rights violations and abuses" in the region.Beijing has long defended the crackdown in Xinjiang as necessary to tackle extremism and terrorism, and said it is in line with Chinese law and international practice, calling accusations of mass detentions a "groundless lie" and "sensational rumor." A spokesperson for the country's foreign ministry on Tuesday reiterated its defense of what it calls its Xinjiang "vocational skills education and training centers." CNN Business has reached out to the Xinjiang government and Turpan's tourism bureau, but Turpan's Public Security bureau could not be reached for comment."There are no so-called concentration camps in Xinjiang," said China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian. "The establishment of vocational skills education and training centers in Xinjiang in accordance with the law is a useful attempt and active exploration for preventive counter-terrorism and de-radicalization."But the connections between Xinjiang and "Mulan" have ignited widespread criticism on social media since its release Friday on Disney+, the company's streaming service. Human rights advocates are now calling on Disney to make public any agreements with the Chinese government over filming in the region."[It's] deeply disturbing that Disney thought it was okay to partner with, and also thank, government departments, specifically propaganda departments, and a public security bureau from a region in China that is complicit with genocide," said Isaac Stone Fish, senior fellow at the Asia Society, a New York based non-profit organization focused on raising awareness of Asia.A film plagued by setbacksDisney hoped that "Mulan" would be a major success at the lucrative Chinese box office, now the second-largest in the world. The company spoke last year about its dedication to making the film culturally accurate --- remarks that were reported in Chinese state media. "We spent a lot of time in the beginning with scholars, experts and people from the region. And we spent a great deal of time in China," said Sean Bailey, president of Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Production, at a Disney expo event last year, reported the state-run news agency Xinhua. Bailey added that the studio "not only has a Chinese cast but also brought in a Chinese producer to make the movie with them," the outlet noted.Eschewing the musicality of Disney's earlier animated feature of the same name, one box office analyst told CNN Business earlier this year that the live-action epic was "tailor-made for success."But the film --- which is based on a traditional Chinese legend about a female warrior who disguised herself as a man and took her father's place in the army --- has already faced controversy and setbacks. In August 2019, pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong called for a boycott of "Mulan" after the lead actor expressed support for Hong Kong police on her social media account."I support the Hong Kong police. You can all attack me now. What a shame for Hong Kong," Liu Yifei, a Chinese-born US citizen who plays the titular Hua Mulan, posted to her official Weibo account. At the time, Hong Kong police faced allegations of excessive violence against protesters. (Hong Kong police defended their actions in September 2019, saying they had been "so restrained.")Then in March, Disney was forced to delay the film's release as the coronavirus pandemic shuttered movie theaters.Even now, its rollout has been stilted. The film was released as a $30 video-on-demand last Friday on Disney+, which is only available in certain markets, including the United States. It makes its debut in Chinese theaters this weekend. (Disney+ is not available in China.)The release of the film has renewed the controversy surrounding it, however. Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, Thailand and Taiwan have once again called on people to boycott the film because of Yifei's remarks last year. And it's not even clear that the film will win over Chinese audiences, who were already chilly toward the original animated version because of its westernized flair and unfaithful retelling of the original legend.After the release of the trailer in 2019, Chinese state-run media Global Times criticized the film for using Japanese "ninja gestures" and Chinese stereotypes.Calls for transparencyAllegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang stretch back years. In recent years, the Xinjiang government has allegedly undertaken a large campaign to imprison and re-educate Muslim minorities in the region, especially the large Uyghur population. Evidence of widespread human rights abuse has trickled out from inside the region, including lengthy detentions, abuse, indoctrination and mass birth control --- which experts have described as evidence of "genocide."In 2017, Mulan director Niki Caro posted a photo from Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang and said she was scouting out locations for the film. And in an interview in September with Conde Nast traveler, Mulan production designer Grant Major discussed filming in Xinjiang's Taklamakan Desert, in the region's far southwest.Adrian Zenz, a leading academic at the Victims of Communism Foundation who has helped break major stories from Xinjiang, said that the earliest documented case of a re-education center in the region was in Turpan in 2013.Zenz said that while it was possible Disney didn't know about the growing number of detention centers set up across Xinjiang, the widespread oppression in the region was impossible to miss."There were police stations and checkpoints all over Xinjiang by late 2016, not to be missed," he said.Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao dismissed Zenz's claims and accused him of making a living "through making Xinjiang-related rumors and slandering China." He also claimed there had been no cases of violence or terrorism in Xinjiang for "more than three consecutive years."Turpan was also the setting for one of the worst outbreaks of ethnic violence in Xinjiang in recent years, when 35 people died during an attack on a police station in Lukqun township, in 2013, according to state media.Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher for Human Rights Watch, called for Disney to disclose what assistance it had received from Xinjiang authorities and what agreements it had made with the regional government.And Asia Society fellow Stone Fish said that many companies were accustomed to making small concessions to the ruling Communist Party to access the Chinese market."Studios feel like they need to make these compromises to be in Beijing, but you can slightly censor your movies to get into the Chinese market, you can bring Chinese movies that shouldn't be in the States because of poor quality or because of propaganda elements into the States. And you can do that and maintain your integrity, mostly intact," he said."You don't need to take these extra steps that Disney is taking, and they're rightly getting excoriated for it."Correction: An earlier version of this story misquoted Asia Society's Isaac Stone Fish on who was partnering with Xinjiang authorities.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

'Targets The Chinese American Community': Judge Blocks Trump's WeChat BanThe Daily CallerSeptember 20, 2020 Sunday 05:08 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; politicsLength: 486 wordsByline: Thomas Catenacci, Reporter, tcatenacci@dailycallernewsfoundation.orgBodyLink to ImageA judge blocked the Department of Commerce's ban on Chinese social messaging app WeChat over First Amendment concerns early Sunday morning before it could go into effect.Judge Laurel Beeler of San Francisco issued the decision more than a month after President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning both WeChat and social media app TikTok over national security concerns, The Associated Press reported. The executive order signed on Aug. 6 was set to go into effect Sunday.“The court grants the motion on the ground that the plaintiffs have shown serious questions going to the merits of the First Amendment claim,” Beeler wrote in the order. “The balance of hardships tips in the plaintiffs' favor.”The government argued that the ban was necessary given WeChat's close affiliation with the Chinese government, according to the decision. (RELATED: Trump Says He Isn't Prepared To Sign Oracle-TikTok Deal Because He Hasn't Reviewed It)The messaging app has averaged 19 million active users daily in the U.S. alone, according to Apptopia, NBC News reported. The executive order banning the app, which is primarily used by Chinese students, Chinese Americans and Americans living in China, would discriminate against Chinese Americans, plaintiffs argued.Link to ImageThe headquarters of Tencent, the parent company of Chinese social media company WeChat, are seen in Beijing on August 7, 2020. (Greg Baker/AFP via Getty Images)“The United States has never shut down a major platform for communications, not even during war times,” said Michael Bien, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, the U.S. WeChat Users Alliance, according to NBC News. “There are serious First Amendment problems with the WeChat ban, which targets the Chinese American community.”Following Trump's August executive order, Eurasia Group analyst Paul Triolo called the move “an unprecedented use of presidential authority,” according to the AP.Sunday's decision also blocks the Trump administration's attempt to ban all transactions made through the app, according to the ruling. The Commerce Department announced Friday that it was prohibiting all transactions made through both TikTok and WeChat.“At the President's direction, we have taken significant action to combat China's malicious collection of American citizens' personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations,” Department of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.Beeler's order is a temporary injunction meaning it will last up until the case is decided.

U.S. government bannes the distribution of TikTok and WeChat since SundayCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 18, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 537 wordsBodyU.S. President Donald Trump's government will ban TikTok and WeChat, Chinese-owned services used by more than 100 million people in the U.S. country, in the country's computer applications market, the Department of Commerce reported this Friday. .Restrictions issued will prohibit the transfer of funds or the processing of payments via WeChat within the United States from Sunday, and similar restrictions affecting TikTok will take effect on November 12.Trump has repeatedly assured that TikTok, one of the most growing social media in recent years, poses a "threat" to U.S. national security and seeks to force its sale to an American company."These measures prove, once again, that President Trump will do everything he can to ensure our national security and protect Americans from the threats of the Chinese Communist Party," Trade Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement."By instructions from the president we have taken significant steps to combat the malicious Chinese collection of personal data of U.S. citizens, while promoting our national values, democratic rules based on rules, and the resolute application of U.S. laws and regulations," he added.According to the U.S. Government, TikTok and WeChat "collect vast amounts of user data, including network activity, location, and search and browsing history."These companies, according to the Department of Commerce, are active participants in the combination of civilian and military activities in China and are subject to mandatory cooperation with the intelligence services of the Chinese Communist Party.On Thursday a federal judge heard the arguments of WeChat users who have filed a complaint against the ban, but there was no immediate ruling.In their case argument on Wednesday, Justice Department attorneys said the government will not take legal action against individuals using WeChat "to communicate personal or business information between users," and plaintiffs said that this does not clarify what activities will be specifically prohibited.U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced Monday that his government would review in the Foreign Investment Committee the agreement reached between Oracle and China's ByteDance, owner of TikTok, to ensure the data protection of Americans and their phones.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs opposes the forced sale of TikTok, an operation that it believes violates the principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO).The Chinese government sees its intention to sell TikTok as one more chapter of the Beijing-Washington trade war, which seeks to contain the growing technological power of the Asian giant, which has already seen telecoms firm Huawei face restrictions, as well as the popular social network WeChat, owned by digital conglomerate Tencent.Related News                             Trump's pressure takes effect and TikTok chooses Oracle for its business in US                               Related News                                                        Trump and Tik Tok: social media and its impact on digital politics         Related News                                                        China says US veto to TikTok and WeChat is a 'shameless act of hegemony'         Load-Date: September 19, 2020End of Document

How Trump's Shot at WeChat Could Hit Americans InsteadPolitico.comSeptember 22, 2020 Tuesday 2:29 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1759 wordsHighlight: The president frames his ban on the app as a national-security issue. Maybe. But it also curtails Americans' free rein to use the network they invented.BodyWhen you arrive in the People's Republic of China as a visitor, you know you're being surveilled. The evidence is so bald and ubiquitous that it quickly melts into the background. During my last visit to China in late 2019, I entered through an airport festooned with closed-circuit cameras; in my hotel, after shaking off the winter's bitter cold, I passed a prominent hallway placard from the municipal ministry of security mandating that all guests register with the police. I fell asleep looking at a similar notice on the hotel nightstand. I couldn't see cameras in the bedroom walls or the ceiling, but I assumed they were there.It's not a stretch to say that millions of American citizens and residents undergo a similar experience when they log on to WeChat, the globally popular app that keeps them connected to friends and family in China. Their data is collected and monitored by Shenzhen-based Tencent Holdings, a technology firm that ultimately must answer to Beijing, and nearly everyone on the app knows it.On Friday, these users, who number about 3.5 million, learned their WeChat access was about to be essentially revoked by the Trump administration. If the ban passes judicial review-it's currently on hold as a California federal judge considers constitutional challenges-it will make WeChat unavailable for download on Google and Apple's app stores. There would be virtually no new users in the U.S. after that, while for existing ones, the app would quickly start to "degrade" and would get more hobbled over time, like a car that can't be taken in for repairs.The administration has framed its latest WeChat order as "guarantee[ing] our national security and protect[ing] Americans from the threats of the Chinese Communist Party." That's because the company not only hoovers up user data-much as U.S. platforms do-it is also subject to Chinese authorities. The country's 2017 cybersecurity law, reviled in the West, mandates that data generated in China be stored there, and requires internet companies to keep this data for at least six months. Under additional 2018 regulations, public security organs have broad legal authority to inspect it. (Tencent says WeChat data is stored in Hong Kong and Ontario, Canada, while data from Weixin, its Chinese equivalent, gets stored in the People's Republic.) Trump's move does not come out of the blue; it's driven by serious concerns about the uses and abuses of data by an authoritarian government. But it has nonetheless caused deep consternation among technologists, China watchers and the Chinese diaspora because it not only bans WeChat from America; it also effectively bans Americans from WeChat. In the process, it begins to revoke the digital passport that the internet has implicitly conferred on U.S. citizens for decades-effacing the freedom baked into the moral and technical architecture of their country's grandest modern invention.To enter WeChat is to step into a faint digital simulacrum of China. A user can find most, if not all, of his or her Chinese friends, communicate with them directly, share articles, recipes, or videos, and stay apprised of their lives via a feature called "moments." Like a visitor to China, U.S. users are constricted in what they can do and say. Messages to a Chinese friend about the 1989 Tiananmen student massacre or the internment of Muslim Uighurs, for example, will be censored. Also like a visitor to China, U.S. users are watched while inside WeChat's confines; not just what they do, but what they attempt to do, like that message about Xinjiang camps that gets sent but never received. The upshot of Beijing's cyber rules is that all this activity is stored somewhere that the Chinese government can probably reach if it really wants to, at least for several months and quite possibly much longer.The rest is unknown: Will WeChat keep the data beyond the legally mandated six months? How much will Tencent resist future government requests for data, if at all? Will Beijing ever try to weaponize this vast trove of information against foreigners, much as it already does against its own people? Can it find a way to combine what WeChat data tells it with the terabytes of personal and corporate secrets its intelligence services have already pilfered from U.S. government and U.S. enterprises-in a yearslong series of massive breaches and heists eclipsing anything that's ever happened on WeChat-to yield new insights and new leverage over U.S. citizens?These concerns are hypothetical, but not trivial. Right now, a 25-year-old intern at RAND is far more likely to be using WeChat than the next secretary of State. But by the middle of this century that former intern may be under consideration for the top job. Beijing could choose that moment to remind that person-or the world-of something embarrassing she wrote or shared as a young adult. Or Beijing could do nothing, confident the knowledge of a compromising digital trail might be enough to affect that Cabinet secretary's judgment or resolve when dealing with China, even if only subtly.Beijing can also use WeChat archives to target a member of the Chinese diaspora in the U.S. for speech crimes, and detain them when they return, or persecute family members in China now for leverage. These are immediate concerns, backed by real evidence of Chinese users fined, jailed, or disappeared for what they have written. But many Chinese users in America nonetheless oppose the U.S. ban, believing it will estrange them from China and further distress their anxious families. In an alternate reality, these families would have other ways to connect; they could have chosen Facebook, Twitter, or any of the other major U.S. communication platforms, all of which support Chinese characters and sport enthusiastic user bases elsewhere in Asia. But Beijing long ago decided that its citizens were unfit for the risks and benefits of a truly global internet-that the government alone could tell them what was dangerous or unclean. So users work within WeChat's confines as creatively and bravely as they can, just as they do within China's larger censored information environment, "dancing in chains." The would-be WeChat ban has disturbed many U.S.-based China watchers for a different reason: not because it brings China further from America, but because it brings Chinese-style governance closer to U.S. shores. Everything about the administration's latest order-its selectivity, its suddenness, its inherent politicization, and in particular its vague invocation of largely hypothetical national security concerns-is redolent of Beijing's style of regulation, one that deploys a bundle of fuzzy red lines to scare and confuse citizens into overcompliance. For example, in early 2014, shortly after taking power, Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping oversaw the launch of a jingwang, or "clean the internet" movement. It was one of a ceaseless procession of Chinese government "strike hard" campaigns that sometimes target bona fide criminal behaviors, other times industries or individuals the authorities don't like. Part of the initiative Xi oversaw in an effort to protect internet users from themselves involved a purported anti-pornography campaign that somehow ensnared Sweet Potato Net, a fan-fiction site, and Sina Reader, a portal for book lovers. When the U.S. State Department announced a "Clean Network" initiative in early August centered on "five new lines of effort" across the internet technology stack to keep out "malign actors" such as China, the verbiage immediately struck China watchers as eerily similar to something Beijing would say. This does not mean Donald Trump or Mike Pompeo seeks to become the next Xi; only that they are either unaware of, or more likely indifferent to, the echoes.Faced with a balancing act between security and freedom, U.S. authorities have historically defaulted to disclosure and choice. It is the bargain explicitly conferred by a physical U.S. passport-once a guarantee of passage into 185 countries. The pages within it are stuffed with warnings that make plain the risks a bearer freely assumes. U.S. citizens should purchase health care that covers them while abroad. They must follow local laws (even if those laws are unjust or offend American sensibilities). They should call home if a "catastrophic event" occurs. They should register with a U.S. Embassy when traveling and demand to see a U.S. consul if they are arrested. The risks are clear. And Americans have chosen to keep traveling anyway, including millions to China. Now that Covid-19 has America on its knees, the U.S. passport no longer ranks among the world's most powerful. Americans are turned away at most borders, or more accurately, they do not even try to cross them. A series of moves away from global institutions like the World Health Organization signal an inward retreat, keeping foreign elements out while also trapping Americans further within their homeland. Yet the digital realm has so far retained its character-a network born in America, driven by ideals of openness, and which Americans have enjoyed near-total latitude to navigate. With its WeChat move, the White House is trying to lower a curtain on at least one part of that realm, with no sign it plans to stop there.A trip into WeChat provides a chance for some to communicate with their loved ones, and gives others a way to stay connected with, and learn more about, a culture that's not their own. It carries genuine risks, too, most acutely for those with family in China. There are other possible approaches to its risks more in keeping with American traditions: A new U.S. approach to WeChat and other Chinese-controlled apps, for instance, might require app stores to warn users repeatedly and explicitly of these dangers. A bona fide data regulatory framework could require all companies worldwide to do the right thing to protect U.S. users. Washington could also help protect users from an overbearing Beijing via a firm commitment to human rights and free expression.But the U.S. government does not wear the role of controlling parent well. Neither national nor personal security has ever been "guaranteed," to paraphrase Trump's latest order. U.S. citizens have long bestrode the global commons, confident their government had their back, both burdened and immensely privileged by their choices. Grounded now, Americans must turn to the digital sphere-a place still borderless to us, one whose values we invented, and whose promise we once cherished. Load-Date: September 23, 2020End of Document

Trump Admin Halting TikTok Downloads in App Stores, With Full Ban to FollowBillboardSeptember 18, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Prometheus Global Media, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; TAGLength: 447 wordsByline: Associated PressHighlight: The Commerce Department will roll out a ban of transactions in the U.S. using TikTok and WeChat starting Sunday.BodyThe U.S. will ban the use of the Chinese app WeChat on Sunday citing national security concerns. Downloads of the the app TikTok, owned by the same company, will be banned at the same time, and use of that platform will be banned in the U.S. by Nov. 12.But Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said early Friday on Fox Business News that access to that app may be possible if certain safeguards are in place.“At the President's direction, we have taken significant action to combat China's malicious collection of American citizens' personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations,” Ross said in a prepared statement.The government said its order, previously announced by President Donald Trump in August, will “combat China’s malicious collection of American citizens’ personal data.”Some security experts have raised concerns that ByteDance Ltd., the Chinese company that owns TikTok, would maintain access to information on the 100 million TikTok users in the United States, creating a security risk.Like most social networks, TikTok collects user data and moderates users’ posts. It grabs users’ locations and messages and tracks what they watch to figure out how best to target ads to them.Similar concerns apply to U.S.-based social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, but Chinese ownership adds an extra wrinkle because the Chinese government could order companies to help it gather intelligence.TikTok says it does not store U.S. user data in China and that it would not give user data to the government. But experts say the Chinese government can get any information it wants from companies there.The action is the Trump administration’s latest attempt to weaken influence from China, a rising economic superpower. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment. China-backed hackers, meanwhile, have been blamed for data breaches of U.S. federal databases and the credit agency Equifax, and the Chinese government strictly limits what U.S. tech companies can do in China.Republican and Democratic lawmaker concerns about TikTok include its vulnerability to censorship and misinformation campaigns, and the safety of user data and children’s privacy. But the administration has provided no specific evidence that TikTok has made U.S. users’ data available to the Chinese government.Officials point to the hypothetical threat that lies in the Chinese government’s ability to demand cooperation from Chinese companies.Link to ImageLoad-Date: September 20, 2020End of Document

Trump has given his "blessing" to a preliminary deal on TikTokCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 19, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 488 wordsBodyU.S. President Donald Trump said saturday that he has "blessed" an agreement with TikTok, where the Chinese social network would partner with U.S. companies Oracle and Walmart to operate in the US, though he noted that negotiations continue. "I have given my blessing to the agreement, if they succeed it would be great and if not, it would also be fine, but it's a great deal for America," said the president, who soon after added that he approves the agreement "as a whole." On Friday, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced that it would block downloads of Tiktok and the WeChat messaging network (chinese Whatsapp) on U.S. app purchase sites starting Sunday, September 20, and that U.S. authorities would veta their full use on U.S. territory starting November 12, citing national security concerns.The representative did not clarify on Saturday whether the principle of agreement will paralyze the measures that his Government plans to take from Sunday against TikTok and WeChat. Trump has repeatedly assured that TikTok, one of the most growing social media in recent years, poses a "threat" to U.S. national security and seeks to force its sale to a U.S. company. Trump stressed this Saturday that Oracle and Walmart would partner with Tiktok, "security would be 100%, they will be using separate clouds and very powerful security, and they will be making a $5 billion contribution in education." "We'll see if it happens or not, but conceptually I think it's a great deal for the U.S.," said the president, who noted that if a pact were reached, 25,000 jobs will be created, mostly in Texas and that it will be a new company, although it will keep TikTok's name. According to the U.S. Government, TikTok and WeChat "collect vast amounts of user data, including network activity, location, and search and browsing history." These companies, according to the Department of Commerce, are active participants in the combination of civilian and military activities in China and are subject to mandatory cooperation with the intelligence services of the Chinese Communist Party. China noted Friday that it will act against foreign companies and individuals that "endanger" their sovereignty and security, and issued new rules related to its list of "unreliable entities," announced more than 15 months ago and not yet published, which could sanction U.S. firms and individuals in response to Trump Administration measures. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs opposes the forced sale of TikTok, an operation that it believes violates the principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The Chinese government sees its intention to sell TikTok as one more chapter of the Beijing-Washington trade war, which seeks to contain the growing technological power of the Asian giant, which has already seen telecoms firm Huawei face restrictions, as well as the popular social network WeChat, owned by digital conglomerate Tencent.Load-Date: September 20, 2020End of Document

The trading day started with gains in longer tenors after overnight action saw a bit more weakness in European equity markets. The selling was attributed to continued growth concerns but the overall impact on Treasuries remained limited. The opening bid briefly pressured the 10-yr yield to within a basis point of its 50-day moving average (0.643%) but the entire complex backed off session highs in midday trade as equities rallied off their lows. The overall tone remained subdued, keeping the 10-yr yield inside a 1.3 bps range today and 4.4 bps for the week. The 10-yr note and shorter tenors finished the day with slim gains while the long bond underperformed, ending slightly lower. The 2s10s spread tightened by three basis points to 53 bps over the course of the week while the 2s30s spread tightened by four basis points since last Friday to 128 bps. The U.S. Dollar Index continued this week's rally, rising 0.3% to 94.62. The Index climbed 1.8% for the week, reaching its best level in two months. Yield Check: 2-yr: UNCH at 0.13% (UNCH for the week) 3-yr: UNCH at 0.15% (-1 bp for the week) 5-yr: -1 bp to 0.27% (-1 bp for the week) 10-yr: -1 bp to 0.66% (-3 bps for the week) 30-yr: UNCH at 1.41% (-4 bps for the week)News: Japan's government is reportedly considering tax cuts for small and medium enterprises to encourage M&A.

Excluding transportation, orders were also up 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.0%) following an upwardly revised 3.2% increase (from 2.4%) in July.

The major indices were mixed and leadership was sparse. There isn't any mystery now.The major indices have found their stride and are rising in unison, paced by some familiar mega-cap leaders whose relative strength has provided a lift for the broader market and the information technology sector (+2.0%) in particular.Their leadership status, however, isn't an isolated event. The industrials (+1.3%), health care (+1.3%), real estate (+1.3%), consumer discretionary (+1.3%), and utilities (+1.1%) sectors are all up more than 1.0%. In fact, there is only one sector in negative territory. That would be the energy sector (-0.5%), which is off its lows but still down 9.0% for the week, 14.4% for the month, and 50.0% for the year.Apple (AAPL 111.47, +3.25, +3.0%), Microsoft (MSFT 207.19, +4.00, +2.0%), Amazon.com (AMZN 3077.55, +57.56, +1.9%), Alphabet (GOOG 1440.60, +12.31, +0.9%), Facebook (FB 253.44, +3.91, +1.6%), and NVIDIA (NVDA 510.61, +16.69, +3.4%) are among the mega-cap mainstays doing today's heavyweight lifting.There isn't any specific piece of news accounting for their gains. Rather, it's their own price trend that is the news and the difference for overcoming the mixed and choppy trading seen at the start of today's session.The Nasdaq Composite is up 1.9%; the Russell 2000 is up 1.3%; the S&P 500 is up 1.2%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 1.0%.14:40COMDX Energy Settlement PricesNov Crude Oil futures fell $0.05 (-0.12%) to $40.26/barrel Nov Natural Gas settled $0.08 lower (-2.69%) at $2.821/MMBtu Nov RBOB Gasoline settled $0.01 higher (1.24%) at $1.1877/gallon Nov Heating oil futures settled $0.01 higher (0.51%) at $1.1322/gallon14:26AWK American Water Works subsidiary Illinois American Water acquires Granite City Wastewater Collection System (143.53 +2.87)This purchase adds approx. 12,150 customer connections to the company's customer base in southern Illinois.

FTX-6058, a small molecule designed to increase expression of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), demonstrated target engagement and good tolerability in multiple preclinical rodent models with once-a-day oral dosing.In vivo preclinical studies showed elevation of HbF at the mRNA and protein levels at plasma concentrations predicted by Fulcrum to be achievable in patients. FTX-6058 treatment led to elevation of the human HBG1 mRNA and HbF protein in the Townes SCD mouse model. In a head-to-head in-vivo preclinical study, FTX-6058 demonstrated superior HbF induction over hydroxyurea in the Townes SCD mouse model. The company presented these data today at the 14th Annual Sickle Cell Disease Research & Educational Symposium and 43rd National Sickle Cell Disease Scientific Meeting being held virtually.The company remains on track to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial by year-end.13:50COMDX Metals Settlement PricesDec gold settled today's session down $11.00 (0.59%) at $1865.9/oz Dec silver settled today's session $0.11 lower (0.46%) at $23.09/oz Dec copper settled $0.00 higher (0.07%) at $2.967/lb13:39MDT Medtronic announces that The Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office rejected in its entirety Axonics' attempt to invalidate a key Medtronic patent (102.99 +1.72)Over the last week, the PTAB has also decided to institute full IPR proceedings related to the six additional patents at issue.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%, and the Russell 2000 is up 0.7%.The trading range has been tighter than yesterday's range, suggesting a general lack of conviction amid ongoing uncertainties that include politics and the economy. Understandably, some investors are distrustful of today's advance given the downwards momentum, and volatility, this month and any tactical activity caused by month-end/quarter-end rebalancing.At this juncture, the S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.3%) is at the leadership position, followed by industrials (+0.8%) and real estate (+0.7%). The energy (-1.1%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) sectors underperform in negative territory.The mega-caps are stepping up today, with Apple (AAPL 110.27, +2.05, +1.9%) and Microsoft (MSFT 206.29, +3.14, +1.6%) trading comfortably higher. Smaller cyclical stocks are also seeing gains following some positive-minded analyst recommendations.Barclays upgraded cruise lines Norwegian (NCLH 16.08, +1.45, +9.9%), Royal Caribbean (RCL 63.80, +3.84, +6.4%), and Carnival (CCL 14.83, +1.09, +7.9%) to Overweight from Equal Weight. The Benchmark Company upgraded Norfolk Southern (NSC 217.62, +3.19, +1.5%) and CSX (CSX 77.54, +0.96, +1.3%) to Buy from Hold.Costco (COST 339.94, -7.06, -2.0%) is bucking the positive trend despite beating EPS estimates and reporting in-line revenue and comparable sales results. Telsey Advisory Group liked what it saw, raising its price target on the stock to $390 from $385 after the report.Reviewing today's economic data:Durable goods orders increased 0.4% m/m in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.9%) following an upwardly revised 11.7% increase (from 11.2%) in July. Excluding transportation, orders were also up 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.0%) following an upwardly revised 3.2% increase (from 2.4%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that order increases were seen across most categories, as manufacturing needs continued to recover from their pandemic depression, yet total orders are still down 11.3% yr/yr (down 3.0%, ex-transportation).12:57SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- MobileIron (MOBL) gains on word of acquisition talks -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersLAC (8.92 +24.23%): Rebounds on higher than average volume from recent sell-off; the stock pulled back by approx. 30% earlier this week amid general volatility in the lithium industry and in the EV space.MOBL (6.53 +17.78%): Spiked as headlines circulated that co is in advanced discussions regarding an acquisition.

There is some modest strength in the Nasdaq, helped by some modest gains in technology stocks, but the broader market is relatively flat as there hasn't been much conviction on the part of investors.Early trading ranges are narrower than they were yesterday, but there has still been a fair bit of chop within the narrow ranges.The lack of conviction can easily be attributed to feelings of uncertainty over some key issues (e.g. politics, growth prospects), but the volatile trading activity implies that no particular move can be taken for granted. Trends can shift in a hurry, particularly with month-end and quarter-end rebalancing efforts as part of the equation.To wit, the S&P 500 hit a session low of 3228.44 close to 10:15 a.m. ET, but traded back up to a session high of 3253.44 only 15 minutes later on no news at all. Such is the nature of the stock market beast at the moment.Five sectors are trading higher and six sectors are trading lower. The only sector with a move of at least 1.0% is the energy sector (-1.1%), which has been brutalized this week. Including today's loss, the sector is down 9.5% for the week.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.6%; the Russell 2000 is up 0.5%; the S&P 500 is up 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is flat.10:31SOXX Industry Briefing: Chipmakers (290.54 -0.71)The PHLX Semiconductor Index (-0.3%) started today's session behind the broader market but it is rallying of its opening low. The high-beta group remains down 0.9% for the week, widening its September loss to 5.2%.Today's underperformance is owed to losses in all but ten components of the SOX index. Another ten group components show losses of 1.0% or more while the remaining listings trade closer to their flat lines.Notable movers:Micron (MU 48.44, -1.03, -2.0%): weakest performer in the group, falling back below its 200-day moving average (49.45) toward its 50-day moving average (48.00).

On September 11, the company learned that subsidiaries of Signature that lease facilities from the company will be issued an audit report containing a qualified opinion due to substantial doubt about their ability to continue as a going concern in relation to the uncertainty around future cashflows caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.To date, Sabra has received no rent relief requests from either Genesis or Signature, and both tenants remain current on their rental obligations. As of June 30, Sabra's exposure to Signature was 7.2% of Sabra's annualized cash NOI, and its exposure to Genesis was 2.5% of Sabra's annualized cash NOI exclusive of residual rents from previously completed sales representing 2.0% of Sabra's annualized cash NOI. Sabra and its auditors are evaluating the circumstances giving rise to the going concern issues for these tenants.In the event it transitions the leases with these tenants to cash-basis accounting, it would write-off approx. $14.4 mln of straight-line rental receivables and lease-related intangible assets, which would be recorded as a reduction to rental revenues but would have no impact on Normalized FFO, AFFO, Normalized AFFO, and distributable cash flow.09:05HA Hawaiian Holdings to offer guests drive-through pre-travel COVID-19 tests (12.40 )08:54QURE uniQure CORRECTION: Co reported "no significant safety concerns were noted to prevent further dosing of Phase I/II clinical trial of AMT-130" (37.16 )Our prior comment incorrectly said there were safety concerns.

Among patients who experienced an SSO or SSI at 30 days, none required surgical intervention or implant removal. The study consisted of 85 subjects, of which 75% met the criteria for Ventral Hernia Working Group (VHWG) grade 2 or grade 3. Over 50% of the patients were obese, over one-third had undergone a previous ventral hernia repair, and 16% had a history of surgical infections. No patient experienced a hernia recurrence within the first 30-days.The second poster, "Final outcomes of the initial 20 subjects reaching two year follow up in the BRAVO Ventral Hernia Study," is the first look at long-term outcomes data for the initial 20 patients who had ventral hernia repair using OviTex. Among these patients, no patient experienced a hernia recurrence. Five patients experienced an SSO during the two years and none required surgical intervention or implant removal. The make-up of the 20 patients in this long-term data was similar to the previous data set, with over 85% meeting the criteria for VHWG grade 2 or grade 3.07:01MSCI MSCI announces the appointment of Andrew Wiechmann as CFO, effective immediately (346.12 )Linda S.

The Nasdaq Composite increased 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 finished flat.The S&P 500 started the day lower by 0.9%, extending the month's pullback and briefly turning negative for the year, before the dip buyers stepped in. By the afternoon, the benchmark index was up 1.3% but sellers regained control on no specific news. The inability to sustain another rebound was disappointing for the bulls but not necessarily bearish.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in positive territory, even as declining issues edged out advancing issues at both the NYSE and Nasdaq. The utilities (+1.2%), consumer staples (+0.8%), and information technology (+0.6%) sectors outperformed in a defensive-minded trade that excluded the health care sector (-0.5%).Generally, investors remained nervous about election volatility, the prospects for another fiscal relief bill, the trajectory of the coronavirus, and U.S.-China relations. On stimulus, House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) will reportedly introduce a $2.4 trillion relief bill, but it's unlikely to have the support of Republicans.Regarding the economy, the labor market remained in poor standing as weekly jobless claims increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000). New home sales, however, rose 4.8% m/m in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) -- its highest rate since November 2006.Interestingly, a pair of analysts turned bullish on some battered financial stocks. Goldman Sachs (GS 195.11, +8.99, +4.8%) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at UBS, and Wells Fargo (WFC 23.32, +0.49, +2.2%) was added to the Fresh Pick List at Robert W. Baird.U.S. Treasuries traded within another narrow range and closed little changed. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 94.33. WTI crude futures gained 0.9%, or $0.37, to $40.31/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Jobless claims for the week ending September 19 increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000) while continuing claims for the week ending September 12 decreased by 167,000 to 12.580 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial jobless claims remain at stunningly high levels that point to the ongoing challenges U.S. businesses face getting back on a pre-pandemic track. In the same period a year ago, initial jobless claims were 215,000.New home sales in August did something they haven't done since November 2006 -- exceed a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.0 million. Specifically, they rose 4.8% m/m to 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) and were up 43.2% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects strong demand for new homes at more affordable price points, as the South region, which is the largest homebuilding region and features lower average prices, saw sales increase 13.4% m/m.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for August on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +18.9% YTDS&P 500 +0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -6.0% YTDRussell 2000 -13.0% YTD16:21BMY Bristol-Myers: Phase 3 CheckMate -274 trial met primary endpoints of improving disease-free survival vs placebo (58.25 -0.74)Bristol Myers Squibb today announced that CheckMate -274, a pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating Opdivo (nivolumab) after surgery in patients with high-risk, muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma, met its primary endpoints of improving disease-free survival (DFS) versus placebo in both all randomized patients and in patients whose tumor cells express PD-L1 > or =1% (programmed death-ligand 1).

The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3%, and the Russell 2000 rose 1.6%.The session started mixed, little changed, choppy, and without leadership amid a host of ongoing uncertainties in the market. Those uncertainties, some of which pertain to politics and the economy, weren't cleared up today due to few macro developments, but it appeared the market wasn't going to get dismayed by the unknown.On no specific news, Apple (AAPL 112.29, +4.07, +3.8%), Microsoft (MSFT 207.82, +4.63, +2.3%), and NVIDIA (NVDA 514.95, +21.03, +4.3%) -- to name few technology mega-caps -- assumed their old leadership roles. The gains broadened out to ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors by the close.The top-weighted information technology sector (+2.4%) finished atop the standings with a 2.4% gain, followed by real estate (+2.0%), health care (+1.7%), and consumer discretionary (+1.6%). The energy sector (-0.1%) briefly turned positive late in the day but was unable to close higher, reflecting a lack of investor confidence in the space.The cruise line industry, meanwhile, could be on the verge of an inflection point, according to Barclays. The firm upgraded Royal Caribbean (RCL 64.59, +4.62, +7.7%), Carnival (CCL 15.07, +1.33, +9.7%), and Norwegian (NCLH 16.63, +2.00, +13.7%) to Overweight from Equal Weight on a favorable risk/reward profile.Costco (COST 342.58, -4.42, -1.3%) was a notable exception today despite the company beating earnings estimates and reporting in-line revenue and comparable sales results. On a related note, Telsey Advisory Group raised its price target on the stock to $390 from $385.The U.S. Treasury market remained uneventful. The 2-yr yield finished flat at 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.66%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.3% to 94.59. WTI crude futures shed 0.2%, or $0.09, to settle at $40.22/bbl.Reviewing Friday's economic data:Durable goods orders increased 0.4% m/m in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.9%) following an upwardly revised 11.7% increase (from 11.2%) in July.

The trading day started with gains in longer tenors after overnight action saw a bit more weakness in European equity markets.

The overall tone remained subdued, keeping the 10-yr yield inside a 1.3 bps range today and 4.4 bps for the week. The 10-yr note and shorter tenors finished the day with slim gains while the long bond underperformed, ending slightly lower.

The major indices were mixed and leadership was sparse. There isn't any mystery now.The major indices have found their stride and are rising in unison, paced by some familiar mega-cap leaders whose relative strength has provided a lift for the broader market and the information technology sector (+2.0%) in particular.Their leadership status, however, isn't an isolated event. The industrials (+1.3%), health care (+1.3%), real estate (+1.3%), consumer discretionary (+1.3%), and utilities (+1.1%) sectors are all up more than 1.0%. In fact, there is only one sector in negative territory. That would be the energy sector (-0.5%), which is off its lows but still down 9.0% for the week, 14.4% for the month, and 50.0% for the year.Apple (AAPL 111.47, +3.25, +3.0%), Microsoft (MSFT 207.19, +4.00, +2.0%), Amazon.com (AMZN 3077.55, +57.56, +1.9%), Alphabet (GOOG 1440.60, +12.31, +0.9%), Facebook (FB 253.44, +3.91, +1.6%), and NVIDIA (NVDA 510.61, +16.69, +3.4%) are among the mega-cap mainstays doing today's heavyweight lifting.There isn't any specific piece of news accounting for their gains. Rather, it's their own price trend that is the news and the difference for overcoming the mixed and choppy trading seen at the start of today's session.The Nasdaq Composite is up 1.9%; the Russell 2000 is up 1.3%; the S&P 500 is up 1.2%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 1.0%.14:40COMDX Energy Settlement PricesNov Crude Oil futures fell $0.05 (-0.12%) to $40.26/barrel Nov Natural Gas settled $0.08 lower (-2.69%) at $2.821/MMBtu Nov RBOB Gasoline settled $0.01 higher (1.24%) at $1.1877/gallon Nov Heating oil futures settled $0.01 higher (0.51%) at $1.1322/gallon14:26AWK American Water Works subsidiary Illinois American Water acquires Granite City Wastewater Collection System (143.53 +2.87)This purchase adds approx. 12,150 customer connections to the company's customer base in southern Illinois.

In a head-to-head in-vivo preclinical study, FTX-6058 demonstrated superior HbF induction over hydroxyurea in the Townes SCD mouse model.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%, and the Russell 2000 is up 0.7%.The trading range has been tighter than yesterday's range, suggesting a general lack of conviction amid ongoing uncertainties that include politics and the economy. Understandably, some investors are distrustful of today's advance given the downwards momentum, and volatility, this month and any tactical activity caused by month-end/quarter-end rebalancing.At this juncture, the S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.3%) is at the leadership position, followed by industrials (+0.8%) and real estate (+0.7%). The energy (-1.1%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) sectors underperform in negative territory.The mega-caps are stepping up today, with Apple (AAPL 110.27, +2.05, +1.9%) and Microsoft (MSFT 206.29, +3.14, +1.6%) trading comfortably higher. Smaller cyclical stocks are also seeing gains following some positive-minded analyst recommendations.Barclays upgraded cruise lines Norwegian (NCLH 16.08, +1.45, +9.9%), Royal Caribbean (RCL 63.80, +3.84, +6.4%), and Carnival (CCL 14.83, +1.09, +7.9%) to Overweight from Equal Weight.

There is some modest strength in the Nasdaq, helped by some modest gains in technology stocks, but the broader market is relatively flat as there hasn't been much conviction on the part of investors.Early trading ranges are narrower than they were yesterday, but there has still been a fair bit of chop within the narrow ranges.The lack of conviction can easily be attributed to feelings of uncertainty over some key issues (e.g. politics, growth prospects), but the volatile trading activity implies that no particular move can be taken for granted. Trends can shift in a hurry, particularly with month-end and quarter-end rebalancing efforts as part of the equation.To wit, the S&P 500 hit a session low of 3228.44 close to 10:15 a.m. ET, but traded back up to a session high of 3253.44 only 15 minutes later on no news at all. Such is the nature of the stock market beast at the moment.Five sectors are trading higher and six sectors are trading lower.

Another ten group components show losses of 1.0% or more while the remaining listings trade closer to their flat lines.Notable movers:Micron (MU 48.44, -1.03, -2.0%): weakest performer in the group, falling back below its 200-day moving average (49.45) toward its 50-day moving average (48.00).

The company believes that industry prescription tracking databases are not accurately reflecting the consistent underlying demand for ANNOVERA seen in orders to wholesalers, retail pharmacies and online distributors. The company is working with industry prescription tracking databases to identify why this demand is not identified in their published numbers. The company believes it is well positioned to meet or exceed Q3 total net revenue consensus, putting the company on a strong trajectory for Q4.09:05SBRA Sabra Health Care REIT provides update on recognition of rental revenues under leases with Genesis Healthcare and Signature Healthcare (13.80 )In the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 that Genesis filed with the SEC on August 10, Genesis stated that the impact of COVID-19 on its future results of operations, its current financial condition and liquidity sources, and uncertainty regarding future governmental funding support raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. On September 11, the company learned that subsidiaries of Signature that lease facilities from the company will be issued an audit report containing a qualified opinion due to substantial doubt about their ability to continue as a going concern in relation to the uncertainty around future cashflows caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.To date, Sabra has received no rent relief requests from either Genesis or Signature, and both tenants remain current on their rental obligations. As of June 30, Sabra's exposure to Signature was 7.2% of Sabra's annualized cash NOI, and its exposure to Genesis was 2.5% of Sabra's annualized cash NOI exclusive of residual rents from previously completed sales representing 2.0% of Sabra's annualized cash NOI. Sabra and its auditors are evaluating the circumstances giving rise to the going concern issues for these tenants.In the event it transitions the leases with these tenants to cash-basis accounting, it would write-off approx. $14.4 mln of straight-line rental receivables and lease-related intangible assets, which would be recorded as a reduction to rental revenues but would have no impact on Normalized FFO, AFFO, Normalized AFFO, and distributable cash flow.09:05HA Hawaiian Holdings to offer guests drive-through pre-travel COVID-19 tests (12.40 )08:54QURE uniQure CORRECTION: Co reported "no significant safety concerns were noted to prevent further dosing of Phase I/II clinical trial of AMT-130" (37.16 )Our prior comment incorrectly said there were safety concerns.

The Nasdaq Composite increased 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 finished flat.The S&P 500 started the day lower by 0.9%, extending the month's pullback and briefly turning negative for the year, before the dip buyers stepped in. By the afternoon, the benchmark index was up 1.3% but sellers regained control on no specific news. The inability to sustain another rebound was disappointing for the bulls but not necessarily bearish.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in positive territory, even as declining issues edged out advancing issues at both the NYSE and Nasdaq. The utilities (+1.2%), consumer staples (+0.8%), and information technology (+0.6%) sectors outperformed in a defensive-minded trade that excluded the health care sector (-0.5%).Generally, investors remained nervous about election volatility, the prospects for another fiscal relief bill, the trajectory of the coronavirus, and U.S.-China relations. On stimulus, House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) will reportedly introduce a $2.4 trillion relief bill, but it's unlikely to have the support of Republicans.Regarding the economy, the labor market remained in poor standing as weekly jobless claims increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000). New home sales, however, rose 4.8% m/m in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) -- its highest rate since November 2006.Interestingly, a pair of analysts turned bullish on some battered financial stocks. Goldman Sachs (GS 195.11, +8.99, +4.8%) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at UBS, and Wells Fargo (WFC 23.32, +0.49, +2.2%) was added to the Fresh Pick List at Robert W. Baird.U.S. Treasuries traded within another narrow range and closed little changed. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 94.33. WTI crude futures gained 0.9%, or $0.37, to $40.31/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Jobless claims for the week ending September 19 increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000) while continuing claims for the week ending September 12 decreased by 167,000 to 12.580 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial jobless claims remain at stunningly high levels that point to the ongoing challenges U.S. businesses face getting back on a pre-pandemic track. In the same period a year ago, initial jobless claims were 215,000.New home sales in August did something they haven't done since November 2006 -- exceed a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.0 million. Specifically, they rose 4.8% m/m to 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) and were up 43.2% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects strong demand for new homes at more affordable price points, as the South region, which is the largest homebuilding region and features lower average prices, saw sales increase 13.4% m/m.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for August on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +18.9% YTDS&P 500 +0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -6.0% YTDRussell 2000 -13.0% YTD16:21BMY Bristol-Myers: Phase 3 CheckMate -274 trial met primary endpoints of improving disease-free survival vs placebo (58.25 -0.74)Bristol Myers Squibb today announced that CheckMate -274, a pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating Opdivo (nivolumab) after surgery in patients with high-risk, muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma, met its primary endpoints of improving disease-free survival (DFS) versus placebo in both all randomized patients and in patients whose tumor cells express PD-L1 > or =1% (programmed death-ligand 1).

The FDA issues a CRL to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete but the application cannot be approved in its current form. In the CRL, the FDA cited that, in a study submitted by the Company with the NDA, certain weight groups showed a lower drug exposure level than desired. Co intends to provide to the FDA additional information on PK modeling to demonstrate that dose adjustments will obtain the desired exposure levels. There were no other safety, clinical pharmacology/biopharmaceutics or CMC issues identified in the CRL. The FDA did cite a small number of protocol deviations in blood draws in one of the studies in the NDA. Co believes, based on discussions with the FDA, that it will not need to conduct any further clinical studies in order to cure the items cited in the CRL, and will confirm that view in its upcoming follow-up meeting with the FDA. Based on interactions with the Agency, co believes that this CRL will not be a barrier to ultimate approval, as the CRL was limited to providing additional information on PK modeling for an adjusted dosing regimen for a limited subset of patient weight categories. Co plans to request a Type A meeting with the FDA in the coming weeks and to resubmit the NDA prior to the end of 2020 with the adjusted dosage regimen for the identified weight groups at issue.

The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3%, and the Russell 2000 rose 1.6%.The session started mixed, little changed, choppy, and without leadership amid a host of ongoing uncertainties in the market. Those uncertainties, some of which pertain to politics and the economy, weren't cleared up today due to few macro developments, but it appeared the market wasn't going to get dismayed by the unknown.On no specific news, Apple (AAPL 112.29, +4.07, +3.8%), Microsoft (MSFT 207.82, +4.63, +2.3%), and NVIDIA (NVDA 514.95, +21.03, +4.3%) -- to name few technology mega-caps -- assumed their old leadership roles.

The energy sector (-0.1%) briefly turned positive late in the day but was unable to close higher, reflecting a lack of investor confidence in the space.The cruise line industry, meanwhile, could be on the verge of an inflection point, according to Barclays. The firm upgraded Royal Caribbean (RCL 64.59, +4.62, +7.7%), Carnival (CCL 15.07, +1.33, +9.7%), and Norwegian (NCLH 16.63, +2.00, +13.7%) to Overweight from Equal Weight on a favorable risk/reward profile.Costco (COST 342.58, -4.42, -1.3%) was a notable exception today despite the company beating earnings estimates and reporting in-line revenue and comparable sales results.

The trading day started with gains in longer tenors after overnight action saw a bit more weakness in European equity markets.

The overall tone remained subdued, keeping the 10-yr yield inside a 1.3 bps range today and 4.4 bps for the week. The 10-yr note and shorter tenors finished the day with slim gains while the long bond underperformed, ending slightly lower.

The major indices were mixed and leadership was sparse. There isn't any mystery now.The major indices have found their stride and are rising in unison, paced by some familiar mega-cap leaders whose relative strength has provided a lift for the broader market and the information technology sector (+2.0%) in particular.Their leadership status, however, isn't an isolated event. The industrials (+1.3%), health care (+1.3%), real estate (+1.3%), consumer discretionary (+1.3%), and utilities (+1.1%) sectors are all up more than 1.0%. In fact, there is only one sector in negative territory. That would be the energy sector (-0.5%), which is off its lows but still down 9.0% for the week, 14.4% for the month, and 50.0% for the year.Apple (AAPL 111.47, +3.25, +3.0%), Microsoft (MSFT 207.19, +4.00, +2.0%), Amazon.com (AMZN 3077.55, +57.56, +1.9%), Alphabet (GOOG 1440.60, +12.31, +0.9%), Facebook (FB 253.44, +3.91, +1.6%), and NVIDIA (NVDA 510.61, +16.69, +3.4%) are among the mega-cap mainstays doing today's heavyweight lifting.There isn't any specific piece of news accounting for their gains. Rather, it's their own price trend that is the news and the difference for overcoming the mixed and choppy trading seen at the start of today's session.The Nasdaq Composite is up 1.9%; the Russell 2000 is up 1.3%; the S&P 500 is up 1.2%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 1.0%.14:40COMDX Energy Settlement PricesNov Crude Oil futures fell $0.05 (-0.12%) to $40.26/barrel Nov Natural Gas settled $0.08 lower (-2.69%) at $2.821/MMBtu Nov RBOB Gasoline settled $0.01 higher (1.24%) at $1.1877/gallon Nov Heating oil futures settled $0.01 higher (0.51%) at $1.1322/gallon14:26AWK American Water Works subsidiary Illinois American Water acquires Granite City Wastewater Collection System (143.53 +2.87)This purchase adds approx. 12,150 customer connections to the company's customer base in southern Illinois.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%, and the Russell 2000 is up 0.7%.The trading range has been tighter than yesterday's range, suggesting a general lack of conviction amid ongoing uncertainties that include politics and the economy. Understandably, some investors are distrustful of today's advance given the downwards momentum, and volatility, this month and any tactical activity caused by month-end/quarter-end rebalancing.At this juncture, the S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.3%) is at the leadership position, followed by industrials (+0.8%) and real estate (+0.7%). The energy (-1.1%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) sectors underperform in negative territory.The mega-caps are stepping up today, with Apple (AAPL 110.27, +2.05, +1.9%) and Microsoft (MSFT 206.29, +3.14, +1.6%) trading comfortably higher.

There is some modest strength in the Nasdaq, helped by some modest gains in technology stocks, but the broader market is relatively flat as there hasn't been much conviction on the part of investors.Early trading ranges are narrower than they were yesterday, but there has still been a fair bit of chop within the narrow ranges.The lack of conviction can easily be attributed to feelings of uncertainty over some key issues (e.g. politics, growth prospects), but the volatile trading activity implies that no particular move can be taken for granted. Trends can shift in a hurry, particularly with month-end and quarter-end rebalancing efforts as part of the equation.To wit, the S&P 500 hit a session low of 3228.44 close to 10:15 a.m. ET, but traded back up to a session high of 3253.44 only 15 minutes later on no news at all. Such is the nature of the stock market beast at the moment.Five sectors are trading higher and six sectors are trading lower. The only sector with a move of at least 1.0% is the energy sector (-1.1%), which has been brutalized this week. Including today's loss, the sector is down 9.5% for the week.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.6%; the Russell 2000 is up 0.5%; the S&P 500 is up 0.1%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is flat.10:31SOXX Industry Briefing: Chipmakers (290.54 -0.71)The PHLX Semiconductor Index (-0.3%) started today's session behind the broader market but it is rallying of its opening low. The high-beta group remains down 0.9% for the week, widening its September loss to 5.2%.Today's underperformance is owed to losses in all but ten components of the SOX index. Another ten group components show losses of 1.0% or more while the remaining listings trade closer to their flat lines.Notable movers:Micron (MU 48.44, -1.03, -2.0%): weakest performer in the group, falling back below its 200-day moving average (49.45) toward its 50-day moving average (48.00).

In addition, weekly inventory on hand reported by wholesalers remains consistent over the quarter. The company believes that industry prescription tracking databases are not accurately reflecting the consistent underlying demand for ANNOVERA seen in orders to wholesalers, retail pharmacies and online distributors. The company is working with industry prescription tracking databases to identify why this demand is not identified in their published numbers. The company believes it is well positioned to meet or exceed Q3 total net revenue consensus, putting the company on a strong trajectory for Q4.09:05SBRA Sabra Health Care REIT provides update on recognition of rental revenues under leases with Genesis Healthcare and Signature Healthcare (13.80 )In the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 that Genesis filed with the SEC on August 10, Genesis stated that the impact of COVID-19 on its future results of operations, its current financial condition and liquidity sources, and uncertainty regarding future governmental funding support raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. On September 11, the company learned that subsidiaries of Signature that lease facilities from the company will be issued an audit report containing a qualified opinion due to substantial doubt about their ability to continue as a going concern in relation to the uncertainty around future cashflows caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.To date, Sabra has received no rent relief requests from either Genesis or Signature, and both tenants remain current on their rental obligations. As of June 30, Sabra's exposure to Signature was 7.2% of Sabra's annualized cash NOI, and its exposure to Genesis was 2.5% of Sabra's annualized cash NOI exclusive of residual rents from previously completed sales representing 2.0% of Sabra's annualized cash NOI. Sabra and its auditors are evaluating the circumstances giving rise to the going concern issues for these tenants.In the event it transitions the leases with these tenants to cash-basis accounting, it would write-off approx. $14.4 mln of straight-line rental receivables and lease-related intangible assets, which would be recorded as a reduction to rental revenues but would have no impact on Normalized FFO, AFFO, Normalized AFFO, and distributable cash flow.09:05HA Hawaiian Holdings to offer guests drive-through pre-travel COVID-19 tests (12.40 )08:54QURE uniQure CORRECTION: Co reported "no significant safety concerns were noted to prevent further dosing of Phase I/II clinical trial of AMT-130" (37.16 )Our prior comment incorrectly said there were safety concerns.

The Nasdaq Composite increased 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 finished flat.The S&P 500 started the day lower by 0.9%, extending the month's pullback and briefly turning negative for the year, before the dip buyers stepped in. By the afternoon, the benchmark index was up 1.3% but sellers regained control on no specific news. The inability to sustain another rebound was disappointing for the bulls but not necessarily bearish.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in positive territory, even as declining issues edged out advancing issues at both the NYSE and Nasdaq. The utilities (+1.2%), consumer staples (+0.8%), and information technology (+0.6%) sectors outperformed in a defensive-minded trade that excluded the health care sector (-0.5%).Generally, investors remained nervous about election volatility, the prospects for another fiscal relief bill, the trajectory of the coronavirus, and U.S.-China relations. On stimulus, House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) will reportedly introduce a $2.4 trillion relief bill, but it's unlikely to have the support of Republicans.Regarding the economy, the labor market remained in poor standing as weekly jobless claims increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000). New home sales, however, rose 4.8% m/m in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) -- its highest rate since November 2006.Interestingly, a pair of analysts turned bullish on some battered financial stocks. Goldman Sachs (GS 195.11, +8.99, +4.8%) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at UBS, and Wells Fargo (WFC 23.32, +0.49, +2.2%) was added to the Fresh Pick List at Robert W. Baird.U.S. Treasuries traded within another narrow range and closed little changed. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 94.33. WTI crude futures gained 0.9%, or $0.37, to $40.31/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Jobless claims for the week ending September 19 increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000) while continuing claims for the week ending September 12 decreased by 167,000 to 12.580 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial jobless claims remain at stunningly high levels that point to the ongoing challenges U.S. businesses face getting back on a pre-pandemic track. In the same period a year ago, initial jobless claims were 215,000.New home sales in August did something they haven't done since November 2006 -- exceed a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.0 million. Specifically, they rose 4.8% m/m to 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) and were up 43.2% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects strong demand for new homes at more affordable price points, as the South region, which is the largest homebuilding region and features lower average prices, saw sales increase 13.4% m/m.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for August on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +18.9% YTDS&P 500 +0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -6.0% YTDRussell 2000 -13.0% YTD16:21BMY Bristol-Myers: Phase 3 CheckMate -274 trial met primary endpoints of improving disease-free survival vs placebo (58.25 -0.74)Bristol Myers Squibb today announced that CheckMate -274, a pivotal Phase 3 trial evaluating Opdivo (nivolumab) after surgery in patients with high-risk, muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma, met its primary endpoints of improving disease-free survival (DFS) versus placebo in both all randomized patients and in patients whose tumor cells express PD-L1 > or =1% (programmed death-ligand 1).

"This report alleged that the College Board partnered with China to develop the Advanced Placement (AP) Chinese Language and Culture Exam. The report further alleged that College Board helped place Chinese nationals in U.S. schools through the Chinese Guest Teacher Program, a collaboration between College Board and Hanban. We are concerned that the PRC exploits its partnership with College Board to stifle conversation that might undermine the reputation of the CCP."Rubio is Cochair of the bipartisan and bicameral Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations' Subcommittee that oversees human rights, and is a member of the Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy.The full text of the letter is below.Dear Mr. Coleman:We write to bring your attention to concerns regarding College Board's relationship with the Confucius Institute Headquarters (Hanban).On August 13, 2020, the U.S. Department of State designated the Confucius Institute U.S. Center (CIUS) as a foreign mission of the People's Republic of China (PRC), thereby recognizing Confucius programming as part of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) propaganda apparatus to influence schools in the U.S.The designation of CIUS as a foreign mission followed Congress's efforts to curtail the presence of Confucius programming in American schools. In 2019, a bipartisan Senate investigation found that the PRC prioritized the expansion of Confucius programming in K12 schools. Moreover, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (P.L.115-232) specifically prohibits the use of Department of Defense (DoD) funds for Chinese language instruction provided by a Confucius Institute on U.S. college campuses.On August 31, 2020, the National Association of Scholars (NAS) issued a report identifying College Board as a target for the Chinese influence campaign. This report alleged that the College Board partnered with China to develop the Advanced Placement (AP) Chinese Language and Culture Exam. The report further alleged that College Board helped place Chinese nationals in U.S. schools through the Chinese Guest Teacher Program, a collaboration between College Board and Hanban. We are concerned that the PRC exploits its partnership with College Board to stifle conversation that might undermine the reputation of the CCP.As College Board's relationship with Hanban creates security concerns, please provide a written response to the below inquiries by November 13, 2020;What is Hanban's role in the Chinese Guest Teacher Program?What is the Chinese government's involvement in the AP Chinese Language and Culture test? Does the Chinese government have to approve of the test?How much money did the College Board receive from the Hanban or from the Chinese government more broadly?What oversight practices does College Board implement to mitigate the risks of undue foreign influence associated with Hanban?How does College Board screen funding from foreign sources?What contracts, memoranda of understanding, or other agreements did the College Board sign with the Hanban or other Chinese government-backed entities?Did the College Board receive or use any federal funding in the creation or promotion of Hanban-affiliated programs?Thank you for your immediate attention. We look forward to your reply.Load-Date: October 27, 2020End of Document

After being restored, in part of the day the roles of the technology firm rose 5%.Microsoft was interested in buying TikTok's U.S. operations. Supermarket group Walmart, another giant, had partnered with Microsoft in this acquisition attempt that was rejected Sunday by ByteDance.The Chinese move"We thought Microsoft wanted to buy TikTok only with its main algorithm, a condition in which the Chinese government and ByteDance did not want to give in," Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securites, said in a note.In late August, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce amended its list of technologies with export limitations or prohibitions, which now includes artificial intelligence technologies such as those that have made TikTok successful, a platform on which videos are shown to users more according to their tastes than their contacts.ByteDance made it known that it will "strictly respect" Beijing's new rules, i.e. obtaining an export licence from the Chinese authorities.In August, the app surpassed2 billion downloads worldwide and claims to be present in more than 200 countries. In the United States, the social network claims to have 100 million monthly users.The war over TikTok comes as part of a broader deterioration in relations between the two major world economies for months, with the United States and China launching harsh recriminations in the commercial, human rights or coronavirus pandemic.Load-Date: September 15, 2020End of Document

US bans WeChat, TikTok from app stores, threatens shutdownsAssociated Press InternationalSeptember 19, 2020 Saturday 2:00 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 996 wordsByline: TALI ARBEL, MATT O'BRIEN and MATT OTT, AP Technology WritersBodyThe U.S. Commerce Department said Friday it will ban Chinese-owned TikTok and WeChat from U.S. app stores on Sunday and will bar the apps from accessing essential internet services in the U.S. — a move that could effectively wreck the operation of both Chinese services for U.S. users.TikTok won't face the most drastic sanctions until after the Nov. 3 election, but WeChat users could feel the effects as early as Sunday.The order, which cited national security and data privacy concerns, follows weeks of dealmaking over the video-sharing service TikTok. President Donald Trump has pressured the app's Chinese owner to sell TikTok's U.S. operations to a domestic company to satisfy U.S. concerns over TikTok’s data collection and related issues.California tech giant Oracle recently struck a deal with TikTok along those lines, although details remain foggy and the administration is still reviewing it. Trump said Friday said he was open to a deal, noting that “we have some great options and maybe we can keep a lot of people happy,” suggesting that even Microsoft, which said its TikTok bid had been rejected, might continue to be involved, as well as Oracle and Walmart.Trump noted that TikTok was “very, very popular," said “we have to have the total security from China," and added that “we can do a combination of both.”The new order puts pressure on TikTok's owner, ByteDance, to make further concessions, said James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Trump had said this week that he does not like the idea of ByteDance keeping majority control of TikTok.TikTok expressed “disappointment” over the move and said it would continue to challenge President Donald Trump's “unjust executive order.” The Commerce Department is enacting an order announced by President Donald Trump in August. TikTok sued to stop that ban.WeChat owner Tencent said in an emailed statement that it will continue to discuss ways to address concerns with the government and look for long-term solutions.Google and Apple, the owners of the major mobile app stores, did not immediately reply to questions. Oracle also did not reply.“At the President’s direction, we have taken significant action to combat China’s malicious collection of American citizens’ personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations," Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a prepared statement.China's ministry of commerce condemned the ban, and urged the U.S. to stop what it called bullying behavior and wrongdoing. It said China would “take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.”The action is the Trump administration’s latest attempt to counter the influence of China, a rising economic superpower. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.China-backed hackers, meanwhile, have been blamed for data breaches of U.S. federal databases and the credit agency Equifax, and the Chinese government strictly limits what U.S. tech companies can do in China.The order requires WeChat, which has millions of U.S. users who rely on the app to stay in touch and conduct business with people and companies in China, to end payments for business transactions through its service as of Sunday and prohibits it from obtaining vital technical services from vendors. The Justice Department said in a filing that it would not target users with criminal or civil penalties for messaging on the app.WeChat users have sued to stop the ban, and a federal judge in California on Friday set an emergency hearing for Saturday at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time.Similar technical limitations for TikTok don't go into effect until Nov. 12, shortly after the U.S. election. Ross said early Friday on Fox Business Network that access to that app may be possible if certain safeguards are put into place. TikTok says it has 100 million U.S. users and 700 million globally.Nicholas Weaver, a computer science lecturer at UC Berkeley, said the actions taking effect Sunday are short-sighted and suggest that “the U.S. is not to be trusted and not a friendly place for business.” Users, meanwhile, face a security “nightmare” because they won't be able to get app updates that fix bugs and security vulnerabilities, he said.The technical measures are “enforceable, the question is whether they are legal,” said the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Lewis, likening them to a U.S. version of China's “Great Firewall," which censors its domestic internet. He said there could be a First Amendment challenge.Like most social networks, TikTok collects user data and moderates users’ posts. It grabs users’ locations and messages and tracks what they watch to figure out how best to target ads to them.Similar concerns apply to U.S.-based social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, but Chinese ownership adds an extra wrinkle because the Chinese government could demand cooperation from Chinese companies. The administration, however, has provided no specific evidence that TikTok has made U.S. users’ data available to the Chinese government. Some cybersecurity experts question whether the administration's efforts are more political than rooted in legitimate concerns about Chinese threats to data security.“If there are direct national security threats, that information should be shared with the U.S. population,” said David Kennedy, CEO of cybersecurity firm TrustedSec, before the Commerce Department's regulations were announced. “We're not taking about what needs to happen policy-wise, we're trying to hack this together to hurt China.”TikTok says it does not store U.S. user data in China and that it would not give user data to the government, and does not censor videos per dictates from China.Load-Date: September 18, 2020End of Document

WeChat and TikTok bring Chinese censorship to everyoneCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 8, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 656 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- The most popular Chinese-owned social networks, such as WeChat or TikTok, are increasingly censoring content in the U.S. and elsewhere, shifting practices perfected for years behind the Great Chinese Firewall to an international audience.TikTok, of ByteDance Ltd., often burys or hides words that reflect political movements, gender and sexual orientation or religion in most of the countries where it operates, the Australian Institute of Strategic Policy said in a report published Tuesday. Most of the censored content on WeChat supported pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, as well as messages from U.S. and UK embassies regarding a new national security law enacted by Beijing in late June that has sparked protests across the city.TikTok, which began as a platform where teens synchronised their lips with music, has become a forum for political protest, including the Black Lives Matter movement, said Fergus Ryan, one of the authors. LGBTQ+ tags were also deleted in several languages, according to the report. Other issues censored in the past included criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin.The findings could provide ammunition to the Trump Administration, which banned TikTok and WeChat, from Tencent Holdings Ltd., after accusing applications of yielding to Beijing's will by censoring content, which could influence the November election. While social media services like Facebook remove content like hate speech, Washington accuses services like TikTok of blocking content deemed sensitive to the Communist Party. WeChat has long complied with controls at the national level, while TikTok, which operates only outside China, has rejected claims that it is influenced by the Chinese government."TikTok is a more edited experience where the platform has enormous power to decide what content to offer users," Ryan said. "Most of these tags are categorized in TikTok code in the same way as terrorist groups, illicit substances and swear words."A Tencent representative refused to comment, while a ByteDance spokesperson made no comment immediately when contacted. The Australian institute said TikTok claimed that some terms "were partially restricted due to relevant local laws." He also noted quotes from the service that "strongly supports our LGBTQ creators around the world, and prides itself on LGBTQ content being among the most popular category on the platform with billions of views."Washington's measures against TikTok and WeChat underscore how the concept of internet decoupling is becoming a reality. The TikTok and WeChat Administration ban comes into effect in mid-September, when both apps are likely to be removed from app stores, but may still be accessible to many U.S. users. WeChat can be a powerful vector in countries like the US, where the Chinese diaspora is considerable, because it is often an important source of information for that population.But principles such as freedom of expression are not part of the core values of these applications, but are more likely to over-censure to align with the wishes of local government, according to the report.ByteDance now participates in sensitive conversations about an acquisition of TikTok in the U.S. Stakeholders include Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. and the deal is estimated to reach more than $20,000Million. But uncertainty surrounding the agreement intensified dramatically last week after China asserted its right to approve or block the sale of technology abroad, complicating an already complex process under white house scrutiny. The law highlighted how Beijing wants to retain some control over content moderation and considers ByteDance's algorithms to be a matter of state security," Ryan said."The really important thing is the algorithm," he said. "TikTok's algorithms are extremely sophisticated and powerful."Original Note:WeChat and TikTok Taking Chinese Censorship Global, Study Says©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: September 9, 2020End of Document

CHINA: QUASH VERDICT AGAINST OUTSPOKEN TYCOONStates News ServiceSeptember 23, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 577 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Chinese authorities should immediately quash the 18-year sentence against a property tycoon and outspoken critic of President Xi Jinping, Human Rights Watch said today.On September 22, 2020, a Beijing court announced on its website that Ren Zhiqiang had been convicted of taking bribes and embezzling public funds. He was also fined 4.2 million yuan (US$620,000)."The corruption charges against Ren Zhiqiang are a thin cover for President Xi Jinping's intolerance of dissent," said Yaqiu Wang, China researcher. "The 18-year sentence handed down to a Communist Party member and member of the economic elite shows the grim environment for speech in China."Ren, 67, is the former chairman of Huayuan, a state-owned real estate group. He was born into a political family his father was a deputy commerce minister. He rose to public prominence after garnering 38 million followers on the Chinese social media site Weibo. Known as "The Cannon," Ren often used the platform to express views critical of authorities, and to urge the Communist Party to improve its governance of the country.In March, the Beijing police detained Ren after he criticized the Chinese government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. In an online essay, Ren wrote that "People's lives are harmed by both the virus and the serious ills of the system." While he did not mention Xi by name, he suggested Xi was a "clown stripped naked who insisted on continuing being emperor."In July, the Beijing Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Chinese Communist Party's abusive internal investigation agency, announced that Ren had been expelled from the Party and would be prosecuted on corruption charges. The commission did not make public where Ren was being held, and it is unclear what, if any, access he had to family members or lawyers of his choice.The case highlights serious due process concerns and the absence of credible, publicly available information to substantiate the charges against Ren. The trial, held on September 9 at the Beijing No. 2 Intermediate Court, was secret. Neither the court nor Chinese state media released any information regarding the proceedings. Ren's friends said that he was represented by a government-appointed lawyer, but it is unclear whether he had requested his own lawyer. The court said Ren had confessed to all charges and would not appeal.The authorities' treatment of Ren in detention is unknown, but as Human Rights Watch documented in a 2016 report, abuses against detainees in corruption cases are common. They include prolonged sleep deprivation, being forced into stress positions for extended periods, deprivation of water and food, and severe beatings. Detainees are also subject to solitary and incommunicado detention in unofficial detention facilities. After "confessing" to corruption, suspects are typically brought into the criminal justice system, convicted, and sentenced to often lengthy prison terms.In February 2016, Ren was banished from social media in China after he criticized Xi for calling on the Chinese media to "serve the Party" in a speech. The authorities publicly censured Ren and put him on a one-year probation from the Party."Ren's sham trial may put him in prison for the rest of his life," Wang said. "A failure to immediately release Ren would show the world that China's legal system is a tool for settling political scores, not delivering justice."Load-Date: September 22, 2020End of Document

122 Chinese American Organizations Asking White House to Rescind its Executive Order on WeChat BanPR NewswireSeptember 16, 2020 Wednesday 8:01 PM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 428 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16, 2020 BodyPR Newswire Today, one day before a Federal district court in San Francisco is going to hold a hearing on Executive Order on Addressing the Threat Posed by WeChat, 122 Chinese American organizations from over 35 states have endorsed UCA's Open Letter to the White House Regarding WeChat Ban, asking the White House to reverse or rescind this Executive Order.The Executive Order on WeChat is problematic on many levels. Whether it is the technology difficulty in implementing such a ban or its shaky legal groundwork, this ban just makes no sense, as we have pointed out in our letter https://ucausa.org/organizations-react-on-wechat-ban/  . It is potentially violating First Amendment rights and disrupting the way of life for millions of Americans. Banning WeChat isn't just causing an inconvenience to millions of Chinese Americans, it is part of the far larger effort by this administration to implement the dubious Clean Network, a hawkish initiative to decouple China technically from US and the rest of the world. This goes against the consensus and sustained policy of all previous administrations to maintain a universally open and free Internet. Furthermore, the President is creating barriers that will hurt Americans and American businesses.  Almost all business communication in China is conducted through WeChat, to prevent Americans from having access to this essential business tool puts American businesses and American workers at an extreme disadvantage. As an organization of Chinese Americans, our members stay connected to family and friends in China through WeChat, as well as family and friends in America. Indeed, much of the political, civic and charitable activities in Chinese American communities is done through WeChat these days. UCA, for example, has just recently organized 2020 Census events, voter registration and education discussions, and the pandemic relief efforts through WeChat."Although we very much loath the restriction on freedom of speech imposed on WeChat by the Chinese government, the overwhelming majority of our community is strongly against such an outright ban. But more importantly, we at UCA think this executive order is just wrong. All I can say is Mr. President, it is unAmerican to restrict the freedom of American people. Just rescind your executive order, please," says UCA President Haipei Shue. View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/122-chinese-american-organizations-asking-white-house-to-rescind-its-executive-order-on-wechat-ban-301132764.htmlSOURCE United Chinese Americans (UCA)CONTACT: Haipei Shue, (202)-672-5060; haipei.shue@ucausa.orgLoad-Date: September 16, 2020End of Document

China tightens conflict with Taiwan again: announced military exercises during visit by US diplomatCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 18, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 681 wordsBodyChina once again stars in a menacing provocative gesture against Taiwan and the United States, in a new sign that tensions between the powers are on the rise. The Chinese army began military maneuvers near Taiwan this Friday, in response to a visit by a senior U.S. manager to the island, considered by Beijing to be its own territory.The conflict in Beijing-Washington relations has continued to grow in these months due to issues such as the state of public freedoms in Hong Kong, the Chinese government's treatment of the Uighur minority, COVID-19, trade relations or the TikTok application.Mainland China (led by the Communist Party) and the island of Taiwan (a haven of the Chinese nationalist army after the civil war in 1949) have been administered by two different regimes for more than 70 years. But Beijing considers island territory as part of China. And so it opposes any visit by foreign leaders to Taipei, which may give legitimacy to the Taiwanese authorities.Taiwanese officials receive Krach (Central News Agency/Pool via REUTERS) (POOL/)Keith Krach, U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and Environment, arrived in Taiwan on Thursday, and is scheduled to take part in a ceremony Saturday in tribute to the late President Lee Teng-hui. In a message posted on her Twitter social media profile, the Taiwanese chancellery expressed her "warmest welcome" to Krach and hoped that the visit would "deepen friendship and strengthen relationships between partners who think the same way."But China had officially protested to the United States for the visit. "America's insistence" on planning this trip "is going to embolden Taiwan's independence supporters in their arrogance and insolence," said Wang Wenbin, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry. "We will provide a necessary response based on developments," Beijing had warned.In fact, prior to the officer's arrival, two Y-8 model aircraft entered the Air Defense Identification Zone through the southwest sector and were repelled by the Taiwan Air Force, forcing them to change course. As detailed by the Ministry of Defense, these are anti-submarine Shaanxi Y-8 aircraft, to which verbal radio warnings were sent to leave the area.Footage of combat jets aboard the Liaoning aircraft carrier of the People's Liberation Army (EPL) (Photographer: Justin Chin/Bloomberg) (Justin Chin/)This Friday, finally, military maneuvers were announced to complete the response. "The army today began military combat exercises near the Taiwan Strait," which separates the island from the mainland, Ren Guoqiang, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Defense, said at a press conference."This is a legitimate and necessary operation to ensure China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and carried out in response to the current situation in the Taiwan Strait," he said.The Army often conducts military maneuvers, but often points out that they are not directed against any country. The fact that this time you mentioned the territory shows the firmness of the message.Taiwanese Indigenous Defense Fighters (IDFs) participate in the Han Kuang military exercise against landing, simulating an enemy invasion, in Taichung, Taiwan, on July 16, 2020 (REUTERS/Ann Wang/Photo File/Photo File/Photo File) (Ann Wang/)"Those who play with fire will end up burning," warned Ren Guoqiang, who denounced Washington's intention to "play Taiwan's card to contain China" and criticized Taiwan for wanting to "have the help of foreigners.""We will not tolerate any foreign interference," he insisted.Keith Krach's trip comes just a month after US Secretary of Health Secretary Alex Azar's visit to the island to underscore Taiwanese management of the internationally praised covid-19 pandemic.With information from AFP and EFEMORE ON THIS TOPIC:Two Chinese army aircraft violated the island's airspace at the visit of a U.S. diplomatA senior US official will visit Taiwan to extend the "strong ties" between the two nationsH&M; severed ties with a Chinese supplier accused of using forced labour by Muslim minority UighurLoad-Date: September 19, 2020End of Document

Xi Jinping regime blocks more protests in Hong Kong: arrested 60 pro-democracy protesters on China's National DayCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 1, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 526 wordsBodyAt least 60 people were arrested Thursday in a commercial area of Hong Kong for violating a ban on demonstrating in the city on the occasion of the Chinese national holiday, police announced."After repeated warnings that were ignored, police arrested at least 60 people (...) suspicions of participating in an unauthorized demonstration and other crimes related to public order," police said in a statement posted on the Social Network Facebook.Sources cited by Hong Kong radio television RTHK indicated that police had deployed up to 6,000 troops prepared to "quickly defuse any glimpse of problems" in the semi-autonomous city.According to the medium, the police were on early patrol of the city centre, conducting records and requesting identification especially among young people, a leading collective in the pro-democracy protests that took the city in the second half of last year.Young people arrested as suspected of participating in an unauthorized protest (Reuters) (TYRONE SIU/)Police also dispersed small groups of people and even asked a man waving an American flag to leave.Last Tuesday, the Chinese Government Liaison Office in Hong Kong warned that it would not tolerate "illegal demonstrations" on October 1, the seventy-first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic and public holidays across the country.The Civil Front for Civil Human Rights (FCDH) was intended to celebrate on Thursday the first march to be held with police clearance in months to demonstrate against Beijing's controversial national security law imposed by Beijing in the special administrative region on 30 June, after the former colony recorded mass protests since June last year , only interrupted by restrictions arising from the coronavirus pandemic.The controversial law provides until life imprisonment for cases such as secession or collusion with foreign forces, but also punishes more mildly, for example, the dissemination of messages, oral or written, that support the independence of the territory.Despite the alleged health reasons for not authorizing the demonstration proposed by the FCDH, small celebrations of pro-Chinese groups for National Day were recorded in Hong Kong.Police deploy a flag to warn that meetings and demonstrations are not authorized (Reuters) (TYRONE SIU/) LAM CELEBRATES END OF PROTESTSDuring a national day commemoration speech, Hong Kong Executive Chief Carrie Lam praised the effect the law has had on the city, and stated that it has served to "restore stability" after months of demonstrations."Even if some double-level governments unfairly accuse local agencies of enforcing the law, or even belligerently impose so-called sanctions against Hong Kong officials who ensure national security, my colleagues and I will continue to resolutely and legitimately do our duty," she said.Lam, who to reach his current post must be pleased toBeijing also praised the Chinese government's achievements in controlling the coronavirus pandemic on its territory.(With AFP and EFE information)MORE ON THIS TOPIC:The Confucius Institutes under the World Magnifier: From Chinese Cultural Propaganda to Accusations of EspionageLoad-Date: October 2, 2020End of Document

Backlash over filming 'Mulan' in Xinjiang 'generated a lot of issues,' admits DisneyCNN WireSeptember 11, 2020 Friday 10:46 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1085 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  A top Disney executive has acknowledged that the uproar over its movie "Mulan" has caused "issues" for the company. The remarks --- given by Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy at a Bank of America conference on Thursday --- come after days of online criticism directed toward Disney and just before the film's theater premiere in China on Friday. In the credits of the movie, the company thanked a Chinese government agency accused of human rights abuses in Xinjiang for its help in making the film. Disney had not previously spoken publicly about the issue."Mulan was primarily shot in, almost the entirety, in New Zealand. And in an effort to accurately depict some of the unique landscape and geography of the country of China for this historically period piece drama, we filmed scenery in 20 different locations in China," McCarthy told analysts at the conference, which was held virtually. McCarthy said it was "common knowledge" that filming in China requires the permission of government publicity departments, and noted that it is standard practice to "acknowledge in the film's credits, the national and local governments that allowed you to film there.""So in our credits, that was recognized, both China as well as locations in New Zealand. And I would just leave it at that," she said. "But that's generated a lot of issues for us."McCarthy did not elaborate on what those "issues" were, and Disney did not immediately respond to a request for further comment outside of US business hours.Disney began releasing its live-action remake of "Mulan," the iconic 1998 animated picture, in some international theaters and as a $30 video-on-demand on its streaming service, Disney+, last weekend.In the credits, the company acknowledged several Chinese government bodies. A few in particular raised red flags: The Xinjiang government's publicity department and the Public Security and Tourism bureaus for Turpan, a city of about 633,400 people just outside Xinjiang's capital Urumqi.The Turpan Public Security Bureau has been listed by the US government as an organization involved in "human rights violations and abuses" in the region.Beijing has long defended the crackdown in Xinjiang as necessary to tackle extremism and terrorism, and said it is in line with Chinese law and international practice, calling accusations of mass detentions a "groundless lie" and "sensational rumor."On Friday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the film's note of thanks to the Xinjiang government for "providing convenience" was "normal practice.""Xinjiang affairs and Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs," spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters at a regular press briefing. "No foreign government, organization or individual has the right to interfere."The move by Disney to credit Chinese agencies was immediately met with a fierce backlash. Critics demanded that Disney clarify its dealings with authorities in Xinjiang, while some social media users called for people to boycott the movie.Asked by an analyst on Thursday whether she thought the controversy would affect the film's performance, McCarthy demurred. "I'm not a box office predictor [or] prognosticator," she said. "But I will say that it has generated a lot of publicity." Earlier this week, McCarthy told investors at a separate conference that the studio was "very pleased" with the initial response to the film's release over the Labor Day holiday weekend.Opening in ChinaThe movie was mired in controversy even before its release.Last year, Liu Yifei, a Chinese-born US citizen who stars as the movie's titular character, expressed her support for Hong Kong police as they faced allegations of excessive violence against protesters. That led pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong to call on people to boycott the film. The movie is expected to debut in Hong Kong next week.Zhao, China's foreign ministry spokesperson, on Friday praised Liu and called her "the modern-day Mulan." "I want to give her a thumbs-up. She did a good job," Zhao said.But arguably the most important test for "Mulan" is its theatrical debut in mainland China this weekend.China is home to the world's second biggest box office and is a critical market for Disney. Analysts have said that "Mulan" appears to be tailor-made for audiences there, given that the film's storyline is set in the country and that the new remake boasts an international cast, with an ethnic Chinese star. But it's not even clear that Mulan will succeed in mainland China, where many people grow up learning about the traditional legend of Hua Mulan, a female warrior who disguised herself as a man and took her father's place in the army. On Douban, China's most popular film rating website, "Mulan" is only rated 4.7 out of 10 --- lower than other Disney live-action titles such as "Cinderella" and "Maleficent."Harold Li, a 29-year-old software engineer in Shanghai, said he watched the film on Friday and came away feeling disappointed."The Disney interpretation is filled with stereotypical tropes," he told CNN Business. "I don't think the Chinese audience will buy [it]."That sentiment was echoed by many users on Douban, who took issue with the accuracy of the plot.However, some Chinese viewers expressed their approval on social media, saying that the movie was "not as bad as some critics say."The debate isn't deterring some people from checking out the movie. By 5 p.m. on Friday, ticket sales for the title had reached about 36.8 million yuan ($5.4 million), according to Maoyan, China's biggest online movie ticketing platform. "Tenet," a Hollywood spy thriller, raked in about 51.4 million yuan ($7.5 million) on its opening day last week in China. ("Tenet" is produced by Warner Bros, which, like CNN, is owned by WarnerMedia.)From the beginning, this was going to be tough to pull off, according to Chris Fenton, former president of DMG Entertainment, a Beijing-based global media company."It's adopting a mythology near and dear to China, and then taking an iconic American company like Disney to try and Hollywood-ize it," he said. "In the most likely scenario, you create a feathered fish where it doesn't succeed in either market. It's 'too Chinese' for Americans or 'too American' for Chinese. It's very tough to make it work in both countries."--- Selina Wang, Ben Westcott, Serenitie Wang and Laura He contributed to this report.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Why Trump's TikTok Ban Could Be 'Fort Sumter Moment' In Cold Tech War Between US, ChinaBenzinga.comSeptember 18, 2020 Friday 3:03 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Accretive Capital LLC d/b/a Benzinga All Rights ReservedLength: 625 wordsByline: Wayne DugganBodyThe drama over the fate of popular Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok is ongoing Friday, with the U.S. Commerce Department announcing that it will ban U.S. business transactions on TikTok starting Sunday.What Happened? Chinese-owned TikTok and WeChat will seemingly no longer be able to do business in the U.S. starting on Sunday, presumably unless the two companies announce deals with U.S. companies that gain the approval of President Donald Trump.Why It s Important: TikTok has taken the U.S. by storm in 2020, and the app now has more than 100 million users.Trump has pushed for TikTok s parent company ByteDance to sell the platform to an American company due to national security concerns.ByteDance was reportedly seeking a $30-billion valuation for TikTok in buyout negotiations, but the company recently rejected a bid fromMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and partner Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT).On Monday, TikTok announced a deal proposal to add U.S. company Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) as a  trusted technology partner,  pending Trump s approval.The word from the Commerce Department on Friday suggests the Oracle deal failed to satisfy Trump.Sunday reflects a deadline Trump set via executive order back on Aug. 6 that gave ByteDance and WeChat parent company Tencent Holdings ADR(OTC: TCEHY) 45 days to sell their U.S. businesses to American companies or face bans.Trump has said he is concerned about the degree to which the apps give the Chinese government access to American users  data.What It Means: The Commerce Department s directive on Friday would ban Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) from listing the TikTok and WeChat apps in their app stores.The statement also bans U.S. companies from providing internet hosting and services to TikTok starting on Nov. 12   language that might specifically address at the potential Oracle deal.TikTok's interim CEO even called on Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB) Instagram to join the fight.We agree that this type of ban would be bad for the industry. We invite Facebook and Instagram to publicly join our challenge and support our litigation. This is a moment to put aside our competition and focus on core principles like freedom of expression and due process of law.  Vanessa Pappas (@v_ness) September 18, 2020On Friday, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said he still believes a deal can be reached in the next 48 hours to prevent bans of TikTok and WeChat.Both the U.S. and China potentially have a lot riding on this game of high-stakes poker, the analyst said. The broader worry is that if a deal is not reached over the next 48 hours with approval by the Chinese government around source code access and majority ownership, this shutdown move could be a Fort Sumter moment in the US/China cold tech war tensions with retaliation on the horizon,  he said.Benzinga s Take: Trump seems to be willing to anger American TikTok users in his efforts to crack down on China and preserve national security.Fox Business reports that 15% of TikTok users will be first-time voters in November, but a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll suggests voters under the age of 40 are overwhelmingly already supporting Trump s opponent Joe Biden in the polls by a more than 20% margin.Related Links:'Partnership Better Than Acquisition': Analysts React To Oracle-TikTok DealHow TikTok's Value Per User Compares To Facebook And Other Social Media PlatformsLatest Ratings for ORCLDateFirmActionFromToSep 2020B of A SecuritiesMaintainsNeutralSep 2020Credit SuisseMaintainsOutperformSep 2020StifelMaintainsHoldView More Analyst Ratings for ORCLView the Latest Analyst Ratings© 2020 Benzinga.com.

China launches global cybersecurity initiativeCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 8, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 394 wordsBodyHONG KONG (AP) — China launched an initiative on Tuesday to address global data security issues, in response to the US "clean network" program, which aims to deter other countries from using Chinese technology.Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced the initiative in Beijing at a seminar on global digital governance.Growing cybersecurity risks threaten national security, the public interest and people's rights, he said.U.S.-China relations have deteriorated due to trade tensions and competition in telecommunications and artificial intelligence technologies. The United States accuses Chinese tech firms of threatening U.S. national security."Clinging to unilateral movements, a certain country continues to make baseless accusations against others on behalf of 'clean' networks and used security as a pretext to attack companies in other countries that have a competing advantage," Wang said, according to a transcript of his speech provided by the Ministry. "These brazen acts of harassment must find opposition and rejection."Wang noted that it is important to develop international data security standards that "reflect the will and respect the interests of all countries through broad participation."U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last month introduced the Clean Network program, claiming it sought to protect citizens' privacy and sensitive information from "malicious actors like the Chinese Communist Party."More than 30 countries and territories, such as Australia and Britain, participate in the initiative, which seeks to exclude Chinese telecommunications firms such as Huawei and ZTE, as well as apps, cloud computing services and underwater cables from their internet networks.For its part, the Chinese initiative opposes interference with critical infrastructure and the theft of important data. He also opposes abusing technology to "conduct mass surveillance against other states," according to the transcript.Companies should not "install backdoors on their products and services" to obtain user data illegally, they must respect the sovereignty, jurisdiction and governance of data in other states," he said."The Chinese government has acted in strict compliance with the principles of data security. We do not ask or ask Chinese companies to transfer data from abroad to the government in violation of the laws of other countries," Wang said.Load-Date: September 9, 2020End of Document

ETHNIC MONGOLIANS IN CHINA FACE CRACKDOWN AS PROTESTS CONTINUEStates News ServiceSeptember 1, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1102 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Chinese authorities in the northern region of Inner Mongolia have imposed a curfew in Lubei city in the region's Zaruud Banner, according to a video clip posted online by a New York-based rights group."Look at this, now. The capital city of Zaruud Banner is under curfew," an eyewitness said in a video clip posted to YouTube by the Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center (SMHRIC)."No cars are allowed to leave the city, no cars are allowed in either. The whole city is closed down," the eyewitness said.Curfews were imposed in Lubei city, the county seat of Zaruud Banner, starting Monday evening, following days of mass protests, civil disobedience campaigns, petitions, and class boycotts over plans by the ruling Chinese Communist Party to end Mongolian-medium education in the region's schools, SMHRIC said.School boycotts have continued across the region, with widespread support from ethnic Mongolians, including taxi and delivery drivers, teachers, police officers and education bureau officials, and People's Representatives from across the region, it said.Taxi drivers from the Shiliin-gol League stood outside their taxis and sang the song "My Mongolia Steppe Mongolia" after a widely circulated prerecorded poem reading "Borders cannot separate us as long as we have our language, hearth, and livestock" was played, it said.Food delivery workers in Tongliao and Ulaanhad printed "Save Our Mother Tongue" on the delivery boxes on their bicycles and scooters, showing their support of the region-wide language movement.Assimilation drive stepped upGermany-based Mongolian activist Xi Haiming said the Chinese government appears to be stepping up an assimilation program in the region targeting ethnic Mongolian language and culture."This shows clearly that the Chinese Communist Party just can't wait to assimilate us," Xi told RFA. "[General secretary] Xi Jinping wants all the ethnic minorities under his control."Xi said some schools had deployed armed police to force ethnic Mongolian children to remain in schools, despite their parents' and teachers' efforts to free them.He said the language policy, which will phase out Mongolian-medium teaching even in ethnic minority schools, has lit the touch-fuse on a keg of popular resistance across the region, however."The Chinese Communist Party is making enemies of children, by forcing them to join the other side," Xi said. "Everyone feels this hurt deeply, and resistance will only become more entrenched.""This conflict has proven a major awakening for ethnic Mongolians [living in China], and they have risen up to resist as a unified people," he said.Factional strife suggestedBoronruh Tsinrh, Paris-based convener of the Southern Mongolian Great Hural Assembly, said Beijing already has a track record of assimilation of its major ethnic groups in recent years.But he said the relatively sudden nature of the new language policy suggested a regime that is being torn apart by factional strife behind closed doors."Xi Jinping may be reaching the end of his authorities ... so he has chosen an appropriate foreign enemy," Boronruh said. "The best targets are Tibetans, Uyghurs, and Mongolians.""These so-called enemies, if beaten with the rod of Han Chinese nationalism, trigger the instinct to maintain the regime," he said.He said the language policy is the latest in long line of rights abuses suffered by Mongolians in China, including the appropriation of traditional grazing lands for development, environmental destruction, the silencing of peaceful critics, and the exploitation of natural resources by government-backed companies."I know just how demoralizing it is if you can't speak your mother tongue," he said. "When a nation is resisting colonial oppression from another nation, it needs to figure out its identity, first and foremost.""As a carrier of culture, language will tell you very clearly where the soul of a nation lies," he said. "Language is the key to an oppressed nation's journey to freedom."Officials who answered the phone at the education department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and at the Tongliao municipal education department declined to comment, saying they weren't authorized to take external enquiries.Elbegdorj Tsakhia, a former president of the independent country of Mongolia which borders Inner Mongolia, called on Beijing to respect the right of Mongolians to use their native language."I strongly support the [ethnic] Mongolians' movement to save the Mongolian language," he said in a video statement cited by SMHRIC. "No matter where you live, as long as you are a Mongolian, you should join this movement.""Without Mongolian language, there is no Mongolian nation to speak of. Losing your language means losing your head," he said. "Without your language, what is the use of your head? Without your writing, what is the use of your hands?"Thousands take to the streetsThousands of students have taken to the streets of the region in recent days as the impact of the previously secret language policy has hit home.Students have gathered outside schools demanding classes in Mongolian in Tongliao and other cities."Let us Mongolians strive to defend our Mongolian culture!" came the chanted from several hundred students in school uniforms outside the Naiman Mongolian Middle School in Tongoliao, while hundreds of students broke out of Tongliao's Horchin Mongolian Middle School and the Chavag Mongolian High School in Ar-Horchin Banner, defying police cordons and boycotting school in protest at the new curriculum.Around 3.00 a.m. local time on Aug. 31, several hundred high school students who were locked into school dormitories in eastern Ongniuud Banner broke into lockers to seize back their confiscated phones, contacted their parents, and managed to escape, leaving the school empty within a couple of hours, SMHRIC reported.A directive from the Inner Mongolia education department recently ordered an end to Mongolian-language classes for first-year primary students and an end to Mongolian-medium teaching and materials in favor of the Chinese language, teachers in the region have told RFA.Teachers were summoned to secret meetings to discuss the changes, and the start of the new semester was brought forward, with some parents unaware of the new curriculum until their children were locked into campuses.Others had been made aware of the plan and organized protests and class boycotts ahead of time.Reported by Ng Yik-tung and Sing Man for RFA's Cantonese Service.

Sanctions lead Huawei to increase its investment in Chinese technologyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 29, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 706 wordsBodyBy Josh HorwitzSHANGHI, 29 Sep (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies has amassed stakes in Chinese semiconductor companies and other technology businesses while strengthening its supply chain against U.S. pressure.Habo Investments, created by Huawei in April 2019, has closed 17 agreements to buy stakes in Chinese technology companies since August last year, according to public records.The firm's investment arm was established in response to what Huawei Rotary President Guo Ping described last week as a "suppression" by the United States following the escalation of restrictions, which have deprived the firm of supplying many chips from abroad and prevented it from making their own."Since Huawei is just a company, we use investment and technology to help our supply chain partners mature," Guo said.The company has become one of the main reasons for the deteriorating relations between Washington and Beijing, as Donald Trump's administration alleges that the world's largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer could spy on China, something the company has repeatedly denied.The firm's investment momentum also coincides with the Chinese government's efforts to boost the semiconductor sector, which is still behind producers such as the United States, South Korea and Taiwan.CHASING CHIPSWhile investments could help Huawei in the future, analysts say that so far they have not contributed much to alleviating supply chain deficiencies, that they are undermining their burgeoning other smartphone business, and could threaten their core network equipment businesses."It will take a long time," explains a Chinese chip investor. "But they don't have too many options, so they have to resort to investment abroad."Huawei declined to comment on the company's investment operations.Most of Habo Investment's agreements have been with Chinese chip manufacturers, some of which have become part of Huawei's supply chain.Vertilite, which was founded in 2015 and received an investment from Huawei this year, manufactures VCSEL sensors that host facial recognition technology in cameras.The company did not respond to a request for comment, but one of its investors noted that the sensors are used on several Huawei mobile phones.In any case, many of the businesses Huawei has backed up are still at an early stage of development."Most of these companies are small, niche, very good at what they do, but not necessarily globally competitive," says Ivan Platonov, an industry specialist in the analysis company EqualOcean.Shoulder Electronics, for example, manufactures radio frequency filters that allow wireless communications, but have not yet achieved compatibility with 5G phones.3Peak, which also received an investment from Habo this year, manufactures analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) used in wireless network base stations.However, the United States dominates this market sector and 3Peak generated only 300 million yuan ($43.99 million) in revenue last year, according to a document it published before trading on Shanghai's STAR market.3Peak did not immediately respond to a request for feedback from Reuters.Habo's portfolio also includes companies outside Huawei's telecommunications operations core.Late last month the company closed an investment in Open Source China, a Shenzhen-based business after whichfind Gitee, Chinese rival of the US coding platform GitHub.Gitee also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Habo usually acquires shares of 5-10%, according to public records, although valuations have not been disclosed.CHANGE OF PACERecent investments mark a change in pace and tactics for Huawei, increasing the frequency of such transactions and focusing on domestic rather than foreign companies.In 2013, for example, Huawei acquired the Ghent-based photonics company Calopia. The following year he bought Neul, a British chip manufacturer for the Internet of Things (IdC) sector."Huawei likes to do its own research and development. Therefore, the investment or acquisition is carried out only as a last resort. That's why it tends to target U.S. or European technology companies," sums up an ex-mplete from Huawei that helped look for acquisition goals.(Edited in Spanish by Jorge Martínez)Load-Date: September 30, 2020End of Document

China's new tech export rules complicate TikTok sale to USA firmStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 4, 2020 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 375 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyThe fourth option is close to the third, only it implies the licensing of the algorithm by the American buyer directly from the Chinese company ByteDance, which developed the TikTok application."I told them they have until September 15 to make a deal - after that we close it up in this country", Trump told reporters before boarding Air Force One for a trip to Kenosha, Wisconsin.There has been growing pressure on the popular short video app, TikTok, in the U.S. President Donald Trump has already announced his plans to ban the app unless ByteDance sells its TikTok U.S. operations.Baseball Legend Tom Seaver Dead at 75Seaver was a part of the legendary "Miracle Mets" of 1969. which went on to win the World Series over the Baltimore Orioles. More than three decades after he last pitched, Seaver still ranks 11th in career wins and sixth in strikeouts (3,640).Other options being considered include asking for Chinese approval to pass TikTok's algorithm on to the acquirer of the short video app's USA assets, licensing the algorithm from ByteDance, or seeking a transition period from a US national security panel overseeing the deal, three sources said. The Chinese government on Friday added several artificial intelligence features to a list of export-restricted technologies, effectively gaining the right to block a deal by targeting features such as the recommendation algorithms essential to the viral video service. "I said the United States has to be compensated, well compensated".A third option is seeking approval from China to pass on TikTok's algorithm to the buyer of its USA assets, the sources said. The question is whether its algorithms would need Chinese government approval for transfer, and if so, whether Beijing would sign off. Microsoft is working on its bid with Walmart Inc., while Oracle has won support from venture backers such as Sequoia Capital.The fourth scenario involves ByteDance's licensing the algorithm to the buyer of the TikTok assets, the sources said. He lies every day on issues of national security. "Pompeo has been playing up his 'China threat" theory around the world, urging others to guard against China 'stealing user data.' But what about the track record of the UnitedStates in this regard?"Load-Date: September 5, 2020End of Document

Trump to attack China over pandemic in UN speechCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 22, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 496 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump will attack China for the coronavirus pandemic in a speech Tuesday to the United Nations General Assembly addressed directly to American voters, calling on the international body to punish Beijing."In the early days of the virus, China blocked domestic travel while allowing flights to leave China and infect the world. The Chinese government and the World Health Organization, which is practically controlled by China, falsely stated that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission," Trump said in the speech, according to excerpts."The United Nations must hold China accountable for its actions," he will say.Trump has escalated U.S. tensions with Beijing in recent months in an attempt to be tougher on the country's leaders than his opponent in the race to the presidency, former Vice President Joe Biden, and to deflect blame for the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., the world's largest.Biden has accused Trump of ignoring the spread of the virus from China while trying to close his so-called "phase one" trade deal with Beijing in January.More than 200,000 Americans have died of covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. Most voters mis-qualify Trump for his administration's response to the pandemic, jeopardizing his candidacy for re-election.The Trump administration has implemented a series of antagonistic measures toward China in recent months, including sanctions on Chinese officials for their treatment of Muslim minorities, the elimination of Hong Kong's special trade benefits, the closure of a Chinese diplomatic complex in Houston, and its announcement of plans to restrict visas for Chinese journalists and students.Trump is also involved in the fight over US operations of TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned short video app.Before the excerpts were published, Chinese President Xi Jinping took a disguised blow to the U.S. In a strongly worded speech, Xi said that no country should "be allowed to do whatever it wants and be the bully or the head of the world."Pushing for developing countries to play a greater role in world affairs, Xi said the UN could be "more balanced" and called for the "international order backed by international law," the official Xinhua news agency reported, citing comments on a meeting commemorating the world's 75th anniversary.Xi will address the United Nations General Assembly via a video link Tuesday night.Trump's criticism of China will expand in his speech and include the country's climate history. The president has received international criticism for withdrawing the U.S. from paris climate agreements negotiated by his predecessor."Those who attack America's exceptional climate history while ignoring China's rampant pollution are not interested in the environment," he says, according to the excerpts. "They just want to punish America, and I won't stand for it."Original Note:Trump to Assail China Over Virus in UN Speech Aimed at Voters©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: September 23, 2020End of Document

Microsoft announced that TikTok rejected its purchase offerCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 14, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 578 wordsBodyByteDance, owner of TikTok, will not sell the popular app to Microsoft, as announced on Sunday by the American tech giant."ByteDance let us know today that they will not sell TikTok's U.S. operations to Microsoft. We are confident that our proposal would have been good for TikTok users, while protecting national security interests. To do this, we would have made significant changes to ensure that the service met the highest standards of security, privacy, online security and anti-misinformation, and made these principles clear in our August statement. We look forward to seeing how the service evolves in these important areas," Microsoft said in a short statement.In recent months, amid escalating tensions between China and the United States, U.S. President Donald Trump gave Tiktok an ultimatum to abandon his activity in the country amid accusations that implementation is a threat to U.S. national security.This Microsoft ad leaves Oracle, one of the few Silicon Valley companies that publicly allied with Trump, as the only publicly known option to acquire TikTok.Sources involved in the negotiations told The New York Times that ByteDance stated that Oracle would be its "technology partner," but it is unclear whether that means it would also take a majority stake in application ownership.Microsoft was one of those interested in acquiring TikTok (EFE/EPA/RITCHIE B. TONGO) (EFEI0342/)In August Microsoft announced that it would insist on a number of protections that would give it essential control of the computer code that TikTok uses for the American version and many other English-speaking versions of the application. However, weeks later, China issued new regulations prohibiting TikTok from transferring its technology to a foreign buyer, without the permission of the Chinese government.This Sunday the Chinese newspaper South China Morning Post reported, citing a source with knowledge of the negotiations, that ByteDance will not sell TikTok's algorithm to the United States. "You can sell the car, but not the engine, " said that source."The company will not deliver the source code to any U.S. buyer, but TikTok's technology team in the United States can develop a new algorithm," he added.On August 6, Trump signed an executive order banning any transaction or business with ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese developer, from 45 days from that date, forcing several potential buyers, including Walmart and Microsoft, to speed up their negotiations.TikTok, downloaded 175 million times in the United States, and more than 1 billion worldwide, argued in the lawsuit that Trump's order was an incorrect application of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act because the platform, on which users share short videos, is not "an unusual or extraordinary threat."The United States is not the first country to act on its concerns of this nature. At the end of June, and after recording a series of clashes with China at a diffusely delimited border, India banned the implementation - as well as 59 other Chinese applications - on the grounds that they are involved in activities "harmful toIndia's sovereignty and integrity, India's defense, state security and public order."Most applications were pointed out by Indian intelligence agencies to concern that they were collecting user data and possibly also sending it outside the country's borders.MORE ON THIS TOPIC:Trump refused to extend deadline for Tik Tok's U.S. sale: "Either sell or close"Load-Date: September 15, 2020End of Document

The first entry was made on January 25 and the last on March 25, shortly after authorities of the Asian giant announced that quarantine would end on April 8 of this year.However, following the announcement that these chronicles would be translated and published by HarperCollins in the United States, the Chinese government and people unleashed a wave of criticism against the author.According to the BBC portal, both the social networks of the population and the official media of that country were used to label Fang Fang a "traitor", for allowing his account to "serve as a tool for the country's critics"."In the eyes of many Chinese users, a translation of Fang Fang's critical testimony of what happened in Wuhan during the epidemic will only serve to give more ammunition to China's opponents," said the specialized portal What's on Weibo.Fang Fang's case is in addition to that of many journalists in China who, according to the Courrier International portal, are censored or arrested after sharing information on the development of the pandemic in China, whose government, AFP reports, is working hard to positively change the global image of the city of Wuhan.The 65-year-old author said her book is "simply a diary of an ordinary citizen in an infected area."(11/09/2020)Load-Date: September 13, 2020End of Document

FORMER CHINESE CENSOR CALLS ON SOCIAL MEDIA USERS TO STAND UP FOR FREE SPEECHStates News ServiceSeptember 2, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1419 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:In 2011, Liu Lipeng landed a job straight out of college as a "content reviewer" at the popular microblogging platform Sina Weibo, where he learned how to issue warnings, delete posts, and shut down the accounts of users who ran afoul of an ever-increasing list of banned topics and keywords issued by the ruling Chinese Communist Party."I thought the job would be something like a forum moderator, and that I'd be looking for things like hate speech, pornography, or other offensive content," Liu told RFA in a recent interview."I didn't expect that I would be a part of such a huge machine, interlinked with the Chinese Communist Party's propaganda operations and domestic security system."Liu's job was to help maintain the complex system of blocks, filters, and human censorship that maintains the Great Firewall, which limits what Chinese internet users can do or see online in the absence of circumvention tools like virtual private networks (VPNs).Once in the job, he was disturbed to find that it entailed acting on daily instructions to delete "sensitive" content as well as shutting down accounts that posted such content.Liu also became aware of a department of China's internet police embedded at Sina Weibo's censorship center in Tianjin."Everyone knew that they were the ones who intimidated service users and detained people," he said. "We were all scared of them."From the start, Liu interpreted his job description with a liberal approach, sometimes quietly unblocking users after shutting them down.Among those he shut down, then unblocked, were Weibo users based in Hong Kong who had had content deleted and accounts shut down for talking about the candlelight vigil for the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in Beijing.He also wrote to author Murong Xuecun after a post of his was flagged on his work queue."Later, I stopped deleting stuff altogether," Liu said. "I had realized that it was all linked to a background operation involving keywords or sensitive accounts -- this was the dark side of social media.""I would be dealing with angry users, who would curse me out, calling me a jobsworth and saying they hoped my whole family would drop dead, stuff like that," Liu said. "It had a really big impact on me by the end of a working day."By the time he left Weibo in 2013, Liu was approving all of the content that passed across his desk."Chinese social media is so tainted by censorship and propaganda," he said. "The government cracks the whip to force private companies to crack down on dissent."Turning whistle-blowerBy 2016, Liu had turned whistle-blower, handing over internal work logs from Weibo to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).He left China for the United States earlier this year, after realizing that widespread monitoring measures brought in by the government, ostensibly to control the spread of coronavirus, would render him vulnerable to political retaliation.After arriving in the U.S., Liu made the work logs fully public and started giving media interviews."If I am not brave enough to speak out, how can I tell others not to self-censor or not to be afraid?" he said.Xiao Qiang, founder of China Digital Times (CDT) and a teacher at the University of California Berkeley School of Journalism, said Liu's leak has been groundbreaking in advancing understanding of China's censorship and propaganda machine."The logs both confirm and build on the work we have done on this in the past," Xiao said. CDT has been publishing insider information on China's propaganda directives under its Ministry of Truth column for several years."This isn't just historical evidence of the censorship process; I also hope that Chinese people will gain a deeper understanding of the current regime, and of their own situation," he said.RFA contacted several Weibo employees to confirm the authenticity of Liu's published logs, and at least three said they could verify that they were genuine. Some were worried about talking to the foreign media, and all asked to remain anonymous.Murong Xuecun confirmed he received an anonymous email from Weibo informing him of a ban in 2012, and thanked Liu via his Twitter account for the valuable insight it provided.Sina Weibo, which now has garnered more than 500 million users since its launch as a Twitter-like service in 2009, hadn't replied to a request for comment by the time of writing.Liu confirmed what many have long believed about private enterprises in China: that they do as they are told by the government and toe the ruling party line.He said they even vie with each other to show how well they implement government censorship and propaganda orders.He said that while the censorship workflow and lists of keywords were initially developed by Sina, they are now being adopted as an industry standard by other social media platforms operating in China."The core lists of sensitive words and the censorship process can easily be copied from Sina," he said.Companies run risksAnd there are nasty pitfalls for companies that don't do a good job of controlling user-generated content.Wang Xin, the founder of Kuaibo Technology, was handed a three-and-a-half-year prison sentence in 2016 by the Beijing Haidian District People's Court, which found him guilty of "distributing obscene materials for personal gain" as his online business was accused of providing easy access to pornography and pirated content."A bad track record on content review isn't just about losing money," Liu said.At Weibo, content is initially screened by software, which scans for sensitive words.For example, words linked to the Tiananmen massacre, or the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement often appear on lists of banned keywords. The system then deletes any posts containing these words automatically.Content mentioning the government or the Chinese Communist Party, or other keywords programmed into the software, will be forwarded to human reviewers before a decision is made about whether the post can be published.Content reviewers can choose to pass content, or hide it, ensuring it won't show up in searches, or prevent individual posts from being reposted.Most banned posts are simply made private, so that only the poster can view them, while a minority are deleted outright."The third option, making it private, is the most common, because it doesn't inform the user that their post has been deleted, but only they can see it," Liu said."Delete is rarely used, because it is tantamount to informing the user that they broke the rules."Rules remain vagueService providers are reluctant to alert users to content bans because the authorities need the rules to remain vague, so that users also censor themselves, he said.Some accounts are added to a political whitelist, including the ruling party's paid army on online commentators, dubbed the 50-centers for the alleged amount they are paid per comment, Global Times editor Hu Xijin, and Xi Wuyi, professor of Marxism at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and Peking University Chinese department professor Kong Qingdong.But their posts are still reviewed -- just at a higher level -- and mostly for the comments left by other platform users."The comments on their posts are all screened," Liu said. "For example, if [an account on the whitelist] talks about a sensitive topic ... people will flock to discuss it.""So the post is reviewed so as to monitor the comments it attracts ... which has a very strong effect on public opinion because it looks as if everyone agrees, or has been persuaded," he said.But Liu said that the censorship system couldn't succeed without self-censorship on the part of platform users."That fear is actually irrational, because if users refused to self-censor, then the censors wouldn't be able to keep up with it all," he said.He said recent media reporting has suggested that China's emerging artificial intelligence capabilities will soon enable it to keep tabs on online speech everywhere, but much of the work still has to be done by people."If the AI was so good, why is it that content review farms in first-tier cities are unable to recruit students?" Liu said. "They can only manage to hire them in smaller cities; places like Xian, Chongqing,and Zhejiang.""The sheer numbers of people they need to hire show that this is a huge [operation]."Reported by Jane Tang for RFA's Mandarin Service.

Nokia to build mobile network on moonHow else could the astronauts Instagram their moon walks?! But bringing cell service to new heights has been no small undertaking."We can't let China bully its way into doing whatever it wants".China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has ramped up pressure on Taipei to accept Chinese sovereignty, including sending fighter jets near the democratically run island.Beijing has become increasingly hostile towards Taiwan under President Xi Jinping.But Taiwan rejects the allegation and says it has lodged a "solemn protest" over the matter with Fiji's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.While governments around the world are becoming increasingly concerned about China's more strident approach to diplomacy, Taiwan has always been on the receiving end of it.Most are small countries in Latin America and the Pacific.China has also kept Taiwan locked out of major worldwide bodies such as the World Health Organization, while pressuring companies and airlines to list the island as part of the mainland.Chinese diplomats have in recent years become more aggressive in pursuing Beijing's interests overseas, a tactic that has been dubbed "wolf warrior diplomacy".China and Taiwan traded accusations Monday over a violent altercation that broke out between Chinese diplomats and Taiwan government employees at a recent Taiwan National Day reception in Fiji.Load-Date: October 19, 2020End of Document

FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON HUA CHUNYING ON US SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO'S ERRONEOUS REMARKS ABOUT CHINAStates News ServiceOctober 2, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 427 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:Q: On October 1, while the High-level Meeting on the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women was being held at the UNGA, US Secretary of State Pompeo released a press statement alleging that as part of China's campaign against Uyghurs, "women are reportedly subjected to forced abortion, forced sterilization", and that China continues the "crackdown on the freedoms of expression and association". Do you have a comment?A: This is another lie fabricated by Pompeo.The Chinese government attaches high importance to protecting women's rights and faithfully implement the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. There has been a notable improvement in women's political status, education level, and health conditions. Women's rights including freedoms of expression and association are safeguarded in accordance with law.The so-called "forced sterilization" on Uyghurs is completely unfounded. The Chinese government protects the rights and interests of all ethnic minorities in equal measure, with preferential population policies toward minorities groups including Uyghurs. From 2010 to 2018, the Uyghur population in Xinjiang grew from 10.1715 million to 12.7184 million, an increase of 2.5469 million or 25.04%, higher than the region's overall growth of 13.99% and much higher than the 2% of the ethnic Han population. These facts and data fully expose Pompeo's lie.In direct contrast, the US has yet to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Women in the US still face systemic, prevalent and institutional discrimination and threat. In the US, women are 21 times more likely to die by firearm homicide than women in other high-income countries; up to 70% of women have experienced physical and or sexual violence from an intimate partner; and nearly a quarter of undergraduate women said they have been the victim of sexual assault or misconduct since entering college. Has Pompeo already forgotten the "Me Too" movement initiated by women in the US three years ago? With regard to genocide, due to the US government's massive expulsion, assimilation and killing policies, the population of native Americans nosedived from five million to 250,000. That is the very definition of genocide. On racism, has Pompeo already forgotten about "Black Lives Matter"?Facts are facts. The international community will not be fooled by the lies of Pompeo.Load-Date: October 2, 2020End of Document

China prefers to disappear "TikTok" in the US than sell it to itCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 12, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 171 wordsBodyPEKON, China.- China prefers the company that runs the "TikTok" platform to shut down service in the United States than sell it to that country because of pressures and threats made by President Donald Trump.According to Reuters, Beijing officials on Friday reported to three people that China does not agree with the company "ByteDance" forcibly selling the application to the United States.President Trump threatened to ban service, starting in the second fortnight of September, if they don't sell it to employed U.S. state.The Chinese company has entered into talks with Americans interested in "TikTok", including Microsoft and Oracle.For China, this forced sale would make them look like a weak country before the United States, so they oppose it being realized.However, the same company "ByteDance", by a statement, clarified that the Chinese government has not given them any suggestions in this regard.For its part, the Chinese government has not commented on these statements from sources close to officials in Beijing.  Load-Date: September 13, 2020End of Document

Faced with the Chinese riseCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 19, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 310 wordsBodyMuch is at stake in the Covid vaccine race. Not just on a health and economic level. As with the conquest of space, many governments want to take the lead and settle their geopolitical hegemony. There is nothing strange about cyberespionage and even abduction by Chinese and Russian hackers of information from various Western, Spanish and other laboratories.Although the Chinese government has denies this, its existence is square with electoral interference and the possibility of a repeat in the US presidential election, this time also by China and Iran. Poisoning through social media and hacking computer systems, an intrinsic part of the bloodless wars that make up the new international disorder, cannot be understood without the promotion of such activities from the White House itself,China is taking advantage of Trumpist chaos to advance relief in global leadership. Trump abandoned the Trans-Pacific Trade Treaty and demonstrated his poor confidence in his allies, especially South Korea. Its exclusive interest in trade negotiation opened the free track for China to continue advancing its specific globalization project around the New Silk Road. And his condescending attitude to dictators has sent erquivocal signals regarding Xing Jiang, Tibet, Hong Kong and even the maritime boundaries of the South China Sea and Taiwan.Meanwhile, the Chinese leap in 5G and artificial intelligence has been prodigious, partly due to the use of other people's technologies. Beijing acts as Moscow in the face of the geopolitical vacuum, but unlike Moscow it has the muscle to aspire to world leadership. The danger has already sparked an unusual consensus in the United States between Democrats and Republicans. The European Union must not be left out or renounce its prominence. Unless you conform to the passive playing field function of the new bipolar combat.Load-Date: September 21, 2020End of Document

Washington to review Oracle and TikTok deal this weekCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 15, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 824 wordsBodyThe Trump administration will review the "technical partnership" agreement ByteDance reached with Oracle for TikTok's U.S. operations before making any recommendations to the president about whether it should be approved.The agreement between ByteDance and Oracle, which does not become a total sale of the video app, comes when TikTok's popularity skyrocketed among American teenagers and became an important battleground in the increasingly intense technology war between the United States and China. It also follows Trump's threat to ban the app unless ByteDance sold U.S. operations to a U.S. company by September 20.US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the Foreign Investment Committee (Cfius) — a U.S. inter-agency panel that can block agreements based on national security — will review the agreement this week and decide whether to protect the private data of the Americans using the app."We're going to review that on cfius' committee this week, and then we'll make a recommendation to the president," Mnuchin, who chairs the Cfius process, told CNBC yesterday.Mnuchin said the oracle agreement will involve establishing a U.S. headquarters that will create 20,000 new jobs nationally.Oracle confirmed yesterday that it is "part of a proposal that ByteDance submitted to the Treasury Department over the weekend when Oracle will serve as a trusted technology provider. Oracle has a 40-year history of providing secure, high-performance technology solutions."To satisfy the Cfius, ByteDance plans to structure the agreement in a similar way to Oceanside's acquisition of US insurer Genworth from China, according to two people who participated in the talks. Oceanside agreed to use U.S.-owned and US-based third parties to process sensitive data of Genworth policy makers.In the case of TikTok, Oracle will be responsible for safeguarding the private data of U.S. users by building a clear ByteDance firewall, two people who participated in the talks said.Several people claimed that such a plan may satisfy Cfius' career officials, but some warned that the situation is not analogous to any previous case."We have a president conducting a campaign against China and any signs that it yields to China about (the issue of) TikTok will be considered a weakness," said one person who participated in the negotiation, in the interest of the Trump administration approving the deal.During his first three years of rule, Trump showed little interest in China-related national security issues as he focused on trade negotiations with Beijing; however, in recent months it drastically intensified the pressure on China, as it blames the Asian nation for the global spread of covid-19, taking an increasingly harsh stance on everything from human rights abuses to cyber espionage concerns.An experienced cfius lawyer said any agreement with ByteDance that allows the Chinese company to retain majority ownership of the app in the US will be difficult for the Trump administration to accept.Larry Ellison, President of Oracle, is one of the few cases in Silicon Valley to be Trump's supporter and fundraiser, while the chief executive of the technology group was a member of Trump's transition team in 2016.Microsofthe also sought to acquire TikTok, but his effort was sought by China's introduction of technology export rules that made it almost impossible for the U.S. group to gain control of the app's algorithm, which is critical to its success, one person with knowledge of the matter said.Oracle is likely to have a minority stake in the U.S. operation if the agreement is approved. Current ByteDance investors are also expected to participate in the final pact, one of those close to the negotiations said.Any agreement will require the support of both the U.S. government and China.Data leakageThe US has expressed concern that user data and information may be transferred to the Chinese government; however, TikTok has assured that it would never share that information.ExportsChina complicated the sale of TikTok by updating (for the first time since 2008) the rules restricting exports of technologies, including content recommendation algorithms.Microsoft, outThe agreement with Oracle was unveiled hours after Microsoft (its biggest rival in the software business) made public that ByteDance rejected its offer to buy TikTok's business in the US.Powerful signaturesTikTok has more than 80 million users in the US and is one of the most growing social networks in recent years, while Oracle is one of Silicon Valley's pioneers and its software is used by millions of global firms.Shorts, from YouTubeYouTube, from technology conglomerate Alphabet, is deploying a new short video service called Shorts, which will enable within its platform, and that will compete with TikTok.Short videosThe tool will allow users to record short vertical videos for mobile and then add special effects and soundtracks extracted from a music library.Load-Date: September 16, 2020End of Document
