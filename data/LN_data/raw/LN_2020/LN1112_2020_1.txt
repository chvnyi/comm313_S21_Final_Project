China Home Appliances Markets, 2020-2026: Subsidy by the Chinese Government, Initiatives of Chinese Companies, COVID-19 ImpactPR NewswireNovember 13, 2020 Friday 2:15 PM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 905 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, Nov. 13, 2020 BodyPR NewswireThe"China Home Appliances Market by Products (Refrigerators, Freezers, Dishwashing & Washing Machine, Cookers & Ovens, Vacuum Cleaners, ect.) by Distribution Channels, and Companies"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.China Home Appliance Market is forecasted to be more than US$ 130 Billion by the end of year 2026.The China home appliances market is growing at the highest growth rate around the world. With more advances in technology and easy availability of raw material at affordable prices, the nation is propelling in the home appliance market. Rapid urbanization, rise in disposable income and high demand for home appliance in rural areas of China are the other factors for this growth.The use of advanced technologies such as WI-FI and Bluetooth in the Chinese home appliance that can be accessed through smartphones and tablets are attracting tech-savvy consumers. Home appliances in China are becoming environmentally friendly and energy-efficient with new designs and advance features, the market of products like washing machines and refrigerators are growing due to premiumization trends in the country.The contribution of ecommerce websites for the growth of home appliances in China is an added advantage with the comparison of products, competitive pricing, lucrative discount, and offers doorstep delivery. Moreover, Chinese manufacturing companies are producing quality products to fulfill local demand as they are ahead in technological innovation, have extensive distribution networks, and sell home appliance products in affordable pricing.Subsidy by the Chinese GovernmentTo boost the home appliances market, the Chinese government is providing subvention up to 13 percent of product price with a limit up to RMB 800 per product. This initiative was started in April 2019, for home appliances which meet the criterion for environmental and energy consumption. Some provincial government started this intuitive in January 2019, such as the Beijing municipal government provides subsidy from 8 percent to 20 percent for 15 different products.Initiatives of Chinese CompaniesOver that period, several local companies have risen, delivering accessible products to price-sensitive Chinese consumers, while also infusing the latest epoch of home appliances with intelligent connectivity to construct Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems within the home. With the growing household market in China, Midea generated more than $ 40 billion revenue in the year 2019 with leading products, including residential and commercial air conditioners, along with dishwashers, washing machines, and refrigerators.Midea's smart home division focuses on linking entire sections of the home, with an intelligent health procedure to monitor air temperature and humidity, formaldehyde concentration, and other environmental factors. Another home appliance company Haier launched U+ App in June 2019. Through this mobile app, users can get information on water temperature and quality in a locality. The washing machine can provide customized washing solution by recognizing the brand and material of garments as well as brand and density of the washing liquid.COVID-19 affecting China Home Appliances MarketHome appliances market in China has been affected due to the outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic; it has brought unprecedented defiance to China's in lying demand and export orders.

Justice Department: China Initiative - Year-in-Review for 2019-2020Targeted News ServiceNovember 17, 2020 Tuesday 8:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2937 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of Justice issued the following news release:On the two-year anniversary of the Attorney General's China Initiative, the Department continues its significant focus on the Initiative's goals and announced substantial progress during the past year in disrupting and deterring the wide range of national security threats posed by the policies and practices of the People's Republic of China (PRC) government."In the last year, the Department has made incredible strides in countering the systemic efforts by the PRC to enhance its economic and military strength at America's expense," said Attorney General William P. Barr. "While much work remains to be done, the Department is committed to holding to account those who would steal, or otherwise illicitly obtain, the U.S. intellectual capital that will propel the future.""The Chinese Communist Party's theft of sensitive information and technology isn't a rumor or a baseless accusation. It's very real, and it's part of a coordinated campaign by the Chinese government, which the China Initiative is helping to disrupt," said FBI Director Christopher Wray. "The FBI opens a new China-related counterintelligence case nearly every 10 hours and we'll continue our aggressive efforts to counter China's criminal activity."Established in November 2018, the Initiative identified a number of goals for the Department, ranging from increased focus on the investigation and prosecution of trade secret theft and economic espionage, to better countering threats posed by Chinese foreign investment and supply chain vulnerabilities.Prioritize investigations of economic espionage and trade secret theftThe Initiative prioritizes use of the Department's core tool, criminal investigation and prosecution, to counter economic espionage and other forms of trade secret theft. In the past year, the Department charged three economic espionage cases (in which the trade secret theft was intended to benefit the Chinese government), bringing the total to five since the China Initiative was first announced. Overall, since the Initiative was announced, we have charged more than 10 cases in which the trade secret theft had some alleged nexus to China, and we obtained guilty pleas of three defendants in those cases over the past year.To take one example, the Department announced the China Initiative on the same day that it unsealed criminal charges against United Microelectronics (UMC), the Chinese state-owned enterprise Fujian Jinhua, and several individual defendants, for economic espionage that victimized Micron Technology, Inc., a leading U.S. semiconductor company."The United Microelectronics case is a glaring example of the PRC's 'rob, replicate, and replace' strategy, in which it robs a U.S. institution of its intellectual capital, replicates the stolen technology, and then endeavors to replace the U.S. institution on the Chinese and then the global market," said John Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security. "Thanks to the dedication and diligence of prosecutors and FBI agents, UMC pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret theft and agreed to pay a fine of $60 million, the second largest fine in a trade secret case, and to cooperate in the pending prosecution of its co-defendants."The National Counterintelligence Task Force, co-led by the FBI, launched its first major campaign in 2020, devoted to protecting U.S. technology and research from the Chinese government and its proxies. This is a further step in the FBI's and Department's efforts to enlist all appropriate partners in ensuring integrity in government-funded programs and defeating economic espionage and theft of trade secrets.Develop an enforcement strategy for non-traditional collectorsAt the outset, the Department identified academia as one of our most vulnerable sectors, because its traditions of openness, and the importance of international exchanges to the free flow of ideas, leave it vulnerable to PRC exploitation. The Department has pursued a two-pronged strategy of raising awareness on campuses of the threats posed by China (and the importance of implementing a security program to detect them) and prosecuting researchers who have deliberately deceived authorities about their ties to China, which deprives institutions of the ability to screen for conflicts of interest and commitment, or otherwise exploited their access.For example, the PRC has used talent programs to encourage the transfer of technical expertise from the United States, and elsewhere in the world, to benefit the PRC's economic and military development. Talent recruits generally sign contracts with the PRC sponsor-entity that obligate them to produce scientific outputs; to publish the results of their work in the name of the PRC beneficiary; to allow the PRC beneficiary to assert intellectual property rights over their outputs; and to recruit other researchers into the programs, among other obligations.In exchange, the talent recruits may receive lucrative compensation packages, prestigious titles, and custom-built laboratories."While membership in these talent programs is not per se illegal, and the research itself may not always be protected as a trade secret, we know the PRC uses these plans, such as the well-known Thousand Talents Program, as a vehicle to recruit individuals with access to U.S. government-funded research to work in the interest of the Chinese Communist Party," said Adam S. Hickey, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, National Security Division.The Initiative brings together resources from across the Department, including the National Security, Criminal, Tax, and the Civil Divisions to address this unique challenge fairly and effectively. In the past year, Department prosecutors have brought fraud, false statements, tax, smuggling and other charges against ten academics affiliated with research institutions across the country. To date, prosecutors have obtained convictions in three of those cases.This year, the FBI and Department prosecutors also exposed six individuals, studying in the United States, found to be connected to People's Liberation Army military institutes, who concealed their affiliations from the State Department when applying for research visas to study at U.S. universities. In one of those cases, the Department alleged that a PLA officer was being tasked by superiors in the PRC to obtain information that would benefit PLA operations. In another case, a PLA medical researcher stands accused of following orders to observe lab operations at a U.S. university, which received funding from the U.S. government, in order to replicate those operations in the PRC.In each of the cases, the defendants are accused of concealing their PLA affiliations in order to obtain visas that allowed them to travel to the United States. After the FBI conducted interviews this summer that led to charges in those cases and the State Department closed the PRC's Houston Consulate, a large number of undeclared, PLA-affiliated Chinese researchers fled the United States.Those six examples are just part of the interagency effort to protect academia and taxpayer-funded research. The FBI and Department have been collaborating with federal grant-making agencies, the Joint Committee on the Research Environment, the major academic associations, the Academic Security and Counter Exploitation working group, and other appropriate entities, as well as hundreds of individual universities nationwide.Counter malicious cyber activityThe Department continues to expose and disrupt efforts by the PRC government to steal our intellectual property and our personally identifiable information (PII) through computer intrusions. During the past year, we charged hackers working for the People's Liberation Army with the 2017 Equifax intrusion and others associated with the Ministry of State Security (MSS) in relation to global computer intrusion campaigns targeting biomedical companies conducting COVID-19-related research, engineering firms, and software makers. One such MSS case resulted in the arrest of two conspirators in Malaysia. Two of these cases highlighted China's development into a safe harbor for criminal hackers who also work for the PRC. The Department disrupted these cyber threats in coordination with the private sector, using legal process to seize control of hacking infrastructure while the private sector removed other infrastructure from their platforms.In May, the FBI, in conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, also issued a public announcement to raise awareness of the threat to COVID-19 research by PRC-affiliated cyber actors and offer advice on better protecting that research from thefts.Counter malign foreign influenceThe Department has used the Foreign Agents Registration Act ("FARA"), which requires those acting to influence public policy and opinion on behalf of a foreign individual or entity, to improve transparency and expose China's foreign influence efforts. Over the past year, the Department opened a record number of FARA investigations overall and doubled the number of new registrants and new foreign principals registering annually as of 2016. That includes obtaining a record number of registrations from Chinese media companies. The Department also notified a registered Chinese media company that its filings were deficient because they failed to fully disclose its activity in the United States and failed to properly label its informational materials. The media entity remedied those deficiencies shortly thereafter.Through its outreach efforts to universities, the Department has highlighted the need to protect foreign students studying in the United States from coercive efforts by the Communist Party to censor the freedom of thought and expression that all students here should enjoy.In late 2019, the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force formally established a new unit devoted specifically to understanding and defeating the malign foreign influence threat from the Chinese government and its proxies.Counter foreign intelligence activitiesThe Department has achieved a number of successes in the last year in countering China's foreign intelligence activities. China has been targeting former members of the U.S. intelligence community for recruitment, and the Department has been holding accountable individuals who succumb to their efforts. In November 2019, a former CIA case officer was sentenced to 19 years in prison for conspiring to deliver national defense information to the PRC. In August 2020, another former CIA officer who had been tasked by the PRC was arrested on the same charge -- the fourth former intelligence officer charged in the last three years for similar conduct.The Department is particularly focused on disrupting the PRC government from using career networking and social media sites to target Americans, as well as holding those accountable who hide behind fake profiles to co-opt individuals on behalf of the PRC. As one part of this effort, the FBI, in partnership with the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, created an educational film, "The Nevernight Connection," which was released online in September 2020 to educate the public about the Chinese intelligence services' use of social media to spot and recruit persons of interest, especially current or former security clearance holders.In March 2020, Xuehua (Edward) Peng was sentenced to 48 months in prison, and ordered to pay a $30,000 fine, for acting as an agent of the PRC's Ministry of State Security (MSS) in connection with a scheme to conduct pickups known as "dead drops" and transport Secure Digital cards containing classified information from a source in the United States to the MSS operatives in China.In October 2020, Jun Wei Yeo was sentenced to 14 months in prison for acting within the United States as an agent of the MSS recruiting Americans, including U.S. military and government employees with high-level clearances. Yeo concealed his MSS affiliation from his American targets and used career networking sites and a false consulting firm to lure them to write papers which he ultimately passed to his MSS handlers.In October 2020, eight defendants were charged with conspiring to act in the United States as illegal agents of the PRC, six of whom also face related charges of conspiring to commit interstate and international stalking. According to the complaint, the defendants participated in an international campaign to threaten, harass, surveil and intimidate a resident of New Jersey and his family in order to force them to return to the PRC as part of an international effort by the PRC government known as "Operation Fox Hunt" and "Operation Skynet."In furtherance of the operation, the PRC government targets Chinese individuals living in foreign countries that the PRC government alleges have committed crimes under PRC law and seeks to repatriate them to the PRC to face charges, rather than rely upon proper forms of international law enforcement cooperation.Foreign investment reviews and telecommunications securityBeyond criminal enforcement, the Department worked to protect our national assets from national security risks posed by entities, subject to PRC influence, that seek to invest in U.S. companies or integrate into our supply chains.In April, the Department assumed the permanent chair of the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector, established by the President through Executive Order (EO), in 2020. This organization, also known as "Team Telecom," is an interagency group that reviews telecommunications, submarine cable landing, wireless, broadcast license, and other applications referred by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), to identify and address risks to national security and law enforcement. In the first 90 days after the Executive Order, the Department led Team Telecom to resolve more than half of the cases then pending review.Team Telecom recommended that the FCC revoke and terminate the international telecommunications licenses held by the U.S. subsidiary of a PRC state-owned telecommunications company, China Telecom, the first revocation ever recommended by Team Telecom on national security grounds. Team Telecom also recommended that the FCC partially deny a submarine cable application, to the extent it sought a direct connection between the United States and Hong Kong.Following the President's 2019 Executive Order on Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain, the Department has worked with the Commerce Department to develop regulations implementing the EO and has identified vulnerable areas of critical infrastructure that are ripe for investigation under the EO.The Department also worked to implement the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA), which improved the authorities of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). During the previous year, the Department co-led a record number of significant CFIUS matters, on an annualized basis, including the investigation of the acquisition of a U.S. hotel management software company by a Chinese company, which the President prohibited, for just the sixth time in CFIUS history. Under FIRRMA, the FBI continued to provide analytical assistance to support CFIUS's decision-making and identify high-risk non-notified transactions.With its increased resources, NSD has played a significant role in CFIUS enforcement, leading the Committee to assess just the second penalty in its history, for failing to secure sensitive personal data in violation of a 2018 interim CFIUS order. NSD also dedicated personnel to identify transactions of concern that were not voluntarily filed with CFIUS and developed a program to identify bankruptcy cases that could implicate national security concerns. The bankruptcy program helps to protect U.S. assets from predatory acquisitions, including PRC acquisitions that could impact our national security, which is particularly important in light of the economic impact of COVID-19.Education and outreachThe success of the China Initiative is not measured by criminal cases and administrative actions alone, however. Outreach to businesses and academia is critical to helping America's national assets better protect themselves. For that reason, the Department disseminated outreach presentations for use by U.S. Attorneys in their Districts, which have been deployed at various events. The FBI sustained its engagement with the private sector through various programs, and it developed and disseminated an innovative Academia Field Guide to support focused outreach by its academic outreach coordinators in all 56 field offices. In the coming year, the Department, through the FBI and U.S. Attorneys' Offices, will continue to expand our partnerships outside the federal government, because the support of the American people is critical to our success. All of our efforts are on their behalf.The Attorney General commends the professionals throughout the Department, including those who work at Main Justice, the FBI, and U.S. Attorney's Offices around the country, who are committed to meeting the goals of the China Initiative and encourage them to redouble their efforts in the upcoming year.All defendants, in the cases mentioned herein, are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7297534 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 17, 2020End of Document

US prosecutors accused Zoom executive of working for Chinese governmentCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 19, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1835 wordsBodyA security executive from video technology giant Zoom worked with the Chinese government to block Americans' accounts and disrupt video calls about the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy activists in Tiananmen Square, Justice Department prosecutors said Friday. The case is an impressive blow to Zoom, one of the most popular new titans of American technology, which during the pandemic became one of the main ways to work, socialize and share ideas around the world. The California-based company is now worth more than $100 billion.But the executive's work with the Chinese government, as FBI agents alleged in a criminal complaint opened Friday in a Brooklyn federal court, highlights the threats of censorship often hidden in a forum promoted as a platform for freedom of expression. It also raises questions about how Zoom is protecting data from government users seeking to monitor and repress people within their borders and abroad.Prosecutors claimed that China's executive, Xinjiang Jin, was working as Zoom's main liaison to Chinese police and intelligence services, sharing user information and ending video calls at the request of the Chinese government.Jin oversaw Zoom's video system for discussions of political and religious issues deemed unacceptable by China's ruling Communist Party, asserts the complaint, and gave government officials names, email addresses, and other sensitive user information, including those outside China.Jin also worked to end at least four video meetings in May and June, including commemorative video calls with U.S.-based dissidents who had survived the crackdown on Chinese military forces that killed thousands of students and protesters. The Chinese government works to censor any recognition of the massacre, even on social media outside China.A Zoom spokesman said in a statement Friday that the company has cooperated with the case and initiated its own internal investigation. Jin, the company said, shared "a limited amount of individual user data with Chinese authorities," as well as data from no more than 10 users based outside China. Jin was fired for violating the company's policies, the statement said, and other employees have been placed on administrative leave until the investigation is complete.In an updated statement on Zoom's website, the company said it has re-established the victims' accounts and will no longer allow Chinese government requests to affect users outside mainland China."As the U.S. Department of Justice makes clear, every U.S. company, including Zoom and our industry partners, faces challenges when doing business in China," the company said in its statement. "We will continue to act aggressively to anticipate and combat ever-changing data security challenges."Jin could not be contacted for comment. Although Jin lives in China and is not in U.S. custody, officials said he could be transferred to the United States to face trial if he travels to a country that has an extradition treaty.The spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.This summer, human rights activists said their Zoom accounts had been abruptly blocked shortly before or after they had made video conferences to commemorate the 31st anniversary of theTiananmen Square protests, a bloody crackdown captured in the iconic photo of a man standing in front of a Chinese tank.Zoom then said in a statement that the company "must comply with the laws of the countries where we operate." Although the company said it regretted "that some recent meetings with participants both inside and outside China had a negative impact," the statement said it was not in the company's possession to "change the laws of governments that oppose freedom of expression."Zhou Fengsuo, a student leader during the Tiananmen Square protests, who was canceled his paid Zoom account this summer, told The Washington Post on Friday that he had worked with the FBI on the case and saw the charges as "great news.""It is very revealing to me to know how this American company reported directly to the Chinese Communist Party and interrupted our meetings regularly on behalf of the PCCh," he said. "This executive worked for the government and the police as a chase agent, and Zoom paid this guy to do that job."Prosecutors accused Jin, also known as Julien Jin, of conspiracy to commit interstate harassment. Jin, 39, had worked at the company since 2016, most recently as "Technical Security Leader," the complaint said.Citing electronic messages between Jin and other Zoom employees, FBI agents outlined a months-long high-pressure campaign by China's "Internet Police" to watch users' video calls and suppress unwanted conversations. In an April message, Jin said he had been called up to a meeting with Chinese government officials demanding that Zoom develop the ability to end any "illegal gathering" within a minute. In others, Jin sent the meeting passwords and other sensitive internal data directly to the Chinese authorities.In the complaint, FBI agents said Zoom employees in the United States had accepted a Chinese government "rectification" plan involving the migration of data from approximately 1 million users from the United States to China, subjecting them to Chinese law. Zoom also agreed, according to the complaint, to provide "special access" to Chinese law enforcement authorities and national security authorities. In a message cited in the complaint, Jin wrote that the authorities had asked him to share detailed lists of the company's "daily surveillance" on "demonstrations in Hong Kong, illegal religions" and other topics.To end Tiananmen Square communications, Jin's accomplices reportedly fabricated evidence that his intention was to talk about child abuse, racism, terrorism and violence. Jin's conspirators also introduced some calls with false accounts that used images of pornographic or terrorism-related profiles, and Jin pointed to those images as evidence to end meetings and suspend host accounts.John Demers, the assistant attorney general for national security, said the firm, like many others doing business in China, has put themselves in a difficult position by operating in an authoritarian country whose laws and practices often "go against our values.""The company focused on Chinese law enforcement and the expectations of the Chinese authorities," Demers said. "But what happened over time is that those expectations increased. So it goes from, 'Well, respond to our legal requests', to 'You must take action in a minute to close any action on your platforms' - noonly in China, but outside - on issues of sensitivity to the Chinese government."That pressure, he noted, extends to many industries: he cited last year's controversy involving the National Basketball Association, in which houston Rockets general manager tweeted in support of Hong Kong protesters, leading to a backlash in China."The case illustrates the decisions companies are forced to make when doing business in China. [and] how the Chinese government will take advantage of the influence they have to push their agenda forward," he said. "You have a consistent pattern that the Chinese government uses economic influence - the opportunity to access markets, foreign investment - in order to promote political objectives."John Scott-Railton, a researcher at The Citizen Lab in Toronto, said the record showed how authoritarian governments have increasingly regarded large technology companies as top-priority intelligence targets, mature for infiltration and recruitment. And he pointed to another case last year against two former Twitter employees accused of spying on behalf of Saudi Arabia, including sending the personal information of thousands of people, including Saudi critics and prominent dissidents.The charges were announced on the same day the Trump administration added four Chinese companies to commerce's list of entities for allowing human rights abuses within China by providing DNA testing materials or high-tech surveillance equipment to the Chinese government. They were among the 59 Chinese companies that the government added to its list of export control entities, including companies that have been accused of stealing trade secrets and using U.S. exports to support the Chinese military.Zoom has previously faced questions about how it protects against the possible misuse of video data by the Chinese government, which censors major news and social media websites under what is known as "Great Firewall".This spring, Scott-Railton and another researcher discovered that the company had routed U.S. user data through Chinese servers, potentially opening it to chinese government data requests. The company later said it had "mistakenly" sent American video calls to Chinese data centers amid an avalanche of calls.Zoom employs more than 2,500 people worldwide, including, until last year, more than 500 in China who develop software installed on computers around the world.The company's billionaire CEO Eric Yuan was born in China but moved to Silicon Valley in the late 1990s, where he worked for the video company WebEx before founding Zoom in 2011.The Federal Trade Commission last month reached an agreement with Zoom, in which the company settled accusations that it had misled users about its privacy and data encryption measures by accepting new security rules.Questions about business in China have become more common as a new wave of Chinese technology companies has become more popular and internationally acclaimed. TikTok, the popular short video app owned by Beijing-based technology company ByteDance, sparked suspicions of censorship by users last year because on-site searches related to topics suppressed by the Chinese government, such as the Tiananmen Square massacre or Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests, showed little or no video.The site's internal guidelines also mimicked the government's censorship policiesChinese, and former employees of the company told The Post last year that key content moderation decisions for international users were made in China. TikTok has said it has worked in recent months to distance its U.S. operations from the company's headquarters in China.Wang Dan, a Chinese dissident whose zoom call in Tiananmen Square was also interrupted this spring, said the case showed how China could threaten people's freedom of expression in the West. "Interfering with the freedom of expression of those who have settled and lived in the United States in exile is ... a serious attack on American sovereignty," he told The Post. "The American people should also pay more attention to the threat of the Chinese Communist Party of American democracy."MORE ON THIS TOPIC:China's suspicious epidemiological and economic statistics that contrast with those of the rest of the worldU.S. blacklisted Chinese microchip manufacturer SMICChinese regime arrested a former New York Times photographer who was about to release a book with criticism of communismLoad-Date: December 20, 2020End of Document

CSIS: 'Assessing the Impact of U.S.-China Technology Competition and Decoupling - Focusing on 5G'Targeted News ServiceDecember 19, 2020 Saturday 8:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1908 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Center for Strategic and International Studies issued the following commentary by Akinori Kahata entitled "Assessing the Impact of U.S.-China Technology Competition and Decoupling: Focusing on 5G":Akinori Kahata is a researcher with the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, DC.This blog post is the second in a series on U.S.-China technological competition. Click here to read the first post in this series, Managing U.S.-China Technology Competition and Decoupling.* * *A degree of technological decoupling between the United States and China is inevitable. The United States has already taken to begin this process, like implementing export controls on Chinese semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing inputs, as well as placing restrictions on the deployment of Chinese telecommunication equipment in the U.S. These actions were important and necessary initial steps towards improving U.S. economic and national security, but it is important for policymakers to understand the ways that the Chinese government may be able to overcome these obstacles, and how they may end up inadvertently damaging U.S. industries.To avoid traveling down a path that may damage the United States' economic security, a preliminary evaluation of the impact of these actions is necessary. Enough time has passed since these policies came into place to judge the impact they have had on businesses, and understand how various stakeholders have responded. However, it is important to note that due to the speed of innovation in these sectors and the difficulties of predicting how stakeholders may respond to new developments, these policies must be continuously evaluated to ensure that they remain the best possible response to the current situation. To this end, the following sections discuss the current impact of U.S. actions against China, with particular focus on the restrictions placed on Chinese 5G equipment providers.Impact of restrictions on the use of Huawei and ZTE equipment for 5G telecommunication equipment(1) Policy ObjectivesThe primary objective of the restrictions on Huawei and ZTE in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 2019 is to protect U.S. information from being accessed or manipulated by the Chinese Communist Party. This risk has also been described by the FCC. In a cyber-physical integrated society, trust is essential for protecting our systems, and these actions by the United States help ensure that critical information infrastructure is only handled by trusted providers. This action also has the effect of promoting decoupling by reducing U.S. reliance on Chinese technology.(2) Policy ImpactsThe most obvious impact of the restrictions is that Huawei and ZTE lost the opportunity to participate in the U.S. 5G market. But it is important to also consider how the restrictions affect other actors, such as telecommunication companies, equipment vendors and other countries.Other than Huawei and ZTE, the stakeholders most affected by vendor restrictions are telecommunication companies. In January 2020, BT, a UK telecom operator, released a statement saying that the government should consider potential costs and impacts before excluding Huawei, as the UK government was then considering. By BT's estimation, 500 million pounds ($657 million) would be needed to replace Huawei equipment and use other vendors' equipment. U.S. telecommunications companies are less reliant on Chinese vendors than their UK equivalents, but nonetheless many have been forced to bear extra costs in order to remove Chinese equipment from their networks. According to the FCC, $1.618 billion could be needed to fully remove and replace Huawei and ZTE's equipment. To help those telecommunication operators, in March 2020, the U.S. government decided to provide them with 1 billion in funding. Although it has not yet been allocated, nonetheless it must be calculated as part of the overall cost of replacing companies like Huawei.Other telecommunications equipment vendors are also impacted by restrictions on Chinese firms. In the 4G era, telecommunications companies tended to become locked into their vendors. A lack of interoperability between equipment meant that telecom firms would typically pick a single company to build out their network in a region, and then not be able to switch or easily add equipment from other firms. The market for radio access network (RAN) equipment in particular became a kind of oligopoly.The network architectures enabled by the switch to 5G, however, creates opportunities for vendors to compete across the supply chain. The move to Open RAN, for example, is helping to promote standardized interfaces in 5G radio access networks that will let operators source radio components and software from a wider array of smaller vendors. The restrictions on Huawei and ZTE provides an opportunity for other vendors to take advantage of this to expand their presence in markets that in the past may have been dominated by Chinese technologies. Although there are still some challenges like ensuring service reliability for large-scale networks, the ORAN concept has already been successfully deployed by companies like NTT Docomo and RAKUTEN mobile in Japan.Finally, these policies also have effects on other nations. One major impact is on national security. Secure and trusted communications networks are needed for nations to feel comfortable transmitting sensitive intelligence information to one another. When certain countries take steps to keep untrusted vendors out of their networks, they are improving security outcomes for their military and intelligence partners. Another impact on nations is the way that restrictions on Chinese companies' expansion can help reduce Chinese influence in nations around the world. This is one reason the U.S. Department of State began its clean network program to encourage other nations to invest in building trusted networks.For these reasons, some countries such as Australia, Japan, and New Zealand have taken actions similar to the United States' from the beginning. On the other hand, European nations have been more skeptical of hardline policies against China. Many European countries initially stated that there was a lack of clear evidence that Chinese companies posed security risks, and resisted calls to replace Chinese equipment due to how expensive it would be to replace the Huawei and ZTE gear already in use by European carriers. However, the situation has gradually changed as more information about the security risks of Chinese equipment has been shared, and as concerns have mounted over the Chinese response to Covid-19. In July 2020, the UK government announced that Huawei must be removed from UK 5G networks by 2027. Moreover, they recently introduced a new telecom security law to strengthen regulation for excluding Huawei. On October 20, Sweden announced that only carriers who use Huawei and ZTE's equipment would be excluded from 5G spectrum auctions, though this has been paused pending an appeal from Huawei. Also in October, the Italian government vetoed a 5G deal between Italy's telecommunication company, Fastweb, and Huawei.Another major cause for this shift in the European approach to Huawei and ZTE has been the impact of other U.S. policies restricting Chinese companies' access to high-end semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Due to these controls, companies like Huawei and ZTE can no longer guarantee that they will be able to continue producing high-end networking gear, making any long-term deals with those companies highly risky. When the UK announced that they would work to remove Huawei from their networks, they explicitly mentioned that one reason for their decision was the U.S. export controls targeting Huawei, which could cause a reconfiguration of Huawei's 5G base stations, which highly depend on US technology. These concerns have been echoed by other experts in Europe, such as Janka Oertel of the European Council on Foreign Relations, who stated that Huawei could only continue their 5G business for a few months with stockpiles they had. However, there are still a large number of countries, such as Brazil, who are still undecided over whether to exclude Chinese companies. For developing countries, this is a particularly difficult decision because of how much they rely on inexpensive Chinese gear and significant financial support from the Chinese government and Chinese financial institutions.(3) China's ReactionChinese companies and the government have been unified in denouncing these policies and arguing that the concerns motivating them are baseless. The Chinese argue that there is no evidence of security flaws, or of Chinese intelligence accessing any information from a company like Huawei. The government has been vocal in challenging many of these decisions around the world. For example, after Sweden's announcement that they would exclude carriers using Chinese equipment from spectrum auctions, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Sweden was violating the principle of a free, open, fair market economy, as well as international economic and trade law.China has also responded to restrictions against its companies by doubling down on its policy of "dual circulation." This policy works to ensure that China acts as a protected market for domestic companies, giving them stability even in the face of restrictions against who they can sell to abroad. For example, Ericson's report indicated that 80% of total number of 5G subscription in the world at the end of 2020 are located in China. The Chinese claim that their own economy is robust enough to ensure a healthy domestic market for its firms. Even in the pandemic, their GDP has continued to steadily expand. In the 3rd quarter of 2020, Chinese GDP expanded 4.9 percent year-on-year.Evaluating future possibilitiesAs China becomes more aggressive in leveraging its economic power to achieve its political and security goals, the United States must ensure that it is able to maintain its technological advantage to protect its economic and national security.In some ways, U.S. restrictions on Chinese telecommunications vendors have been successful at protecting the nation's national security. However, there are clear costs to this approach. For the policy to be sustainable, the U.S. and its allies must ensure that alternatives to Chinese vendors continue to exist, and are available at a competitive price. If developing nations are unable to afford the costs of sourcing their equipment exclusively from trusted suppliers, then the U.S.' strategy will not be internationally sustainable.Going forward, the United States and its allies will have to achieve strong consensus on the importance of trusted vendors in telecom networks, ensure that the international vendor landscape remains robust, and consider ways to support developing countries financially. Ultimately, these restrictions on their own are unlikely to create an existential threat for firms like Huawei and ZTE due to the size of the Chinese domestic market and the continued existence of other opportunities for international expansion.The next blog in this series will evaluate the U.S.' export control policies on semiconductors.[Category: Political][Category: ThinkTank1]Copyright Targeted News Services'T40-MgEditor'-7332800 'T40-MgEditor'Load-Date: December 19, 2020End of Document

Chinese authorities detain Bloomberg news assistantAssociated Press InternationalDecember 12, 2020 Saturday 2:18 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 414 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) — Chinese authorities have detained a Beijing-based Chinese news assistant for Bloomberg on what they said was suspicion of endangering national security, the American financial news service said.Bloomberg reported Friday that Haze Fan was seen being taken from her apartment building by plainclothes security officers at about noon Monday, shortly after her last contact with her editors.The Chinese Foreign Ministry confirmed that the Beijing State Security Bureau had taken steps against Fan, who it said is suspected of engaging in criminal activities that endanger national security. The ministry said in a brief statement that her rights have been fully guaranteed.The charge of endangering national security is a vaguely defined one that can lead to lengthy detention with little recourse to legal assistance.China permits Chinese citizens to work only as translators, researchers and assistants for foreign news organizations, not as registered journalists able to report independently. China's own media are almost entirely state owned and tightly controlled, and the country has long been one of the leading jailers of journalists.Bloomberg said it had been seeking information about Fan's whereabouts from the Chinese government and China's embassy in Washington, D.C. It said its parent company, Bloomberg LP, was informed Thursday that she was being held.“We are very concerned for her, and have been actively speaking to Chinese authorities to better understand the situation. We are continuing to do everything we can to support her while we seek more information,” an unnamed Bloomberg spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.Fan began working for Bloomberg in 2017 after stints with a number of other foreign news organizations in China, the company said.China has detained news assistants in the past over reports that angered the ruling Communist Party, and authorities have also sought to punish foreign media more generally by limiting their operations, expelling journalists or issuing them only short-term visas.China expelled journalists from The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times earlier this year amid complaints over content and moves by the U.S. to send home dozens of Chinese journalists working for state media.Bloomberg saw its business in financial information suffer in China several years ago in apparent retaliation for its reporting on the personal financial dealings of leading Chinese officials.Load-Date: December 11, 2020End of Document

China looms as Biden's biggest foreign policy challenge. Here's where he standsCNN WireNovember 16, 2020 Monday 2:45 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 2132 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN) BodyHONG KONG (CNN) --  As United States President-elect Joe Biden faces an ugly, potentially contested transition, foreign policy may be the last thing on his mind. But in capitals around the world, foreign leaders are already clamoring for his attention, hoping to reset relationships and restore norms that shifted under President Donald Trump. Nowhere will there be greater opportunity for a shift than in the US-China relationship, which has deteriorated to historic lows during Trump's term in office. Over the past four years, both sides have slapped the other with trade tariffs, restricted access for tech companies, journalists and diplomats, shuttered consulates, and squared off militarily in the South China Sea. Analysts in both countries are still debating whether Biden will embrace Trump's more punitive policies towards China or move to reset relations between Washington and Beijing. Even in Chinese state-run media, there are signs the ruling Communist Party is holding its breath, unsure of which direction the new administration will take. "China should not harbor any illusions that Biden's election will ease or bring a reversal to China-US relations, nor should it weaken its belief in improving bilateral ties. US competition with China and its guard against China will only intensify," state-run tabloid Global Times said in an editorial Sunday.As yet, no official policy statements on China have been released by the Biden transition team. Biden, though, is no foreign policy novice. During his almost five decades in national politics, Biden has repeatedly brushed up against China. As a senator, he played a role in China becoming a member of the World Trade Organization in 2001. Analysts are now looking back over past statements and more recent comments made on the campaign trail for insight into how Biden will approach what might be his most pressing foreign policy challenge. Relations with BeijingDuring the Obama administration, in which Biden served as vice-president from 2009 to 2017, relations with Beijing were assigned a high degree of importance, stemming in part from China's new status as the world's second-largest economy. Though China was gaining strength both economically and militarily, diplomacy during this period was guided for the most part by attempts at cooperation, rather than confrontation. Major disputes were mostly contained, and centered on security issues, such as China's military buildup in the South China Sea and cyber espionage. According to Obama, the relationship between two countries would shape the 21st century, and therefore stable relations were critical not only for the US, but for the world at large. Biden traveled to Beijing on numerous occasions during efforts to gain Chinese support for a number of key Obama policies, including attempts to contain North Korea's nuclear ambitions. During one such trip in 2013, Biden met with President Xi Jinping, who referred to the then Vice President as an "old friend of China." A scheduled 45-minute private talk between the two leaders ran for two hours. In public remarks, Biden described relations in optimistic terms. "If we get this relationship right with a genuine new model, the possibilities are limitless." But despite accusations from the Trump campaign that Biden was too close to China, there is evidence that his views have shifted in recent years in line with the changing mood in Washington, where Beijing is increasingly viewed not as America's potential partner, but as its primary rival. During the Democratic primaries in February, Biden referred to Chinese President Xi Jinping as a "thug," and said that Beijing had to "play by the rules." A Biden campaign ad in June accused Trump of getting "played" by China. The renewed focus on China is evident in the Democratic Party platform document, which was released in August 2020. During the last presidential campaign in 2016 the document made only seven references to China. This year's version had more than 22."Democrats will be clear, strong, and consistent in pushing back where we have profound economic, security, and human rights concerns about the actions of China's government," the 2020 platform said.TradeOne of the main planks of President Trump's foreign policy platform has been his trade war with China. Since mid-2018, the Trump administration has placed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese imports, in an attempt to drive down the US trade deficit with China and force Beijing to further open its economy.Beijing and Washington struck a "phase one" trade deal in January 2020, but many areas of disagreement still remain unaddressed, including China's subsidies for state-owned companies that are competing on the global market.Recent remarks from Biden suggest he would continue to take action against Beijing over its economic policies. But in an interview with NPR in August, he made it clear he believed that tariffs were as bad for the US as they were for China."Manufacturing's gone in recession. Agriculture lost billions of dollars that taxpayers had to pay. We're going after China in the wrong way," he said.Instead Biden appears to favor building a global coalition to force China into liberalizing its economy. "What I'd make China do is play by the international rules, not like he has done," Biden said during his second debate with Trump in October. "We need to be having the rest of our friends with us saying to China, 'These are the rules. You play by them, or you're going to pay the price for not paying by them economically'."There are also signs that Biden may embrace aspects of Trump's tech war against China. Under Trump, the US has tried to push diplomatic partners to reject 5G technology made in China, cut off Beijing from vital US components and targeted popular apps run by Chinese companies.Biden said in September that he was concerned about the widely-used Chinese-owned app TikTok, which has been a prominent target of the Trump administration. "I think that it's a matter of genuine concern that TikTok, a Chinese operation, has access to over 100 million young people particularly in the United States of America," he said.In the 2020 Democratic Platform, there is another hint that a Biden administration will continue Trump's push to stop allies from using 5G technology produced by Chinese tech giant Huawei. "We will work with our allies and partners to develop secure 5G networks and address threats in cyberspace," the platform said.South China SeaBoth the Obama and the Trump administrations have pursued policies that pushed back against the Chinese government's broad, unproven claims in the South China Sea.It was during the Obama-Biden administration that the Chinese government began to construct and militarize artificial islands in the vast waterway. The US then started freedom of navigation operations in the region, sailing US naval vessels in close proximity to the artificial islands and reefs built by Beijing in a show that Washington would not acknowledge China's claims.Under Trump, the US has stepped up these operations and publicly declared that "most" of China's claims to the sea are illegal.Biden has made no major public statements on the South China Sea but there is no indication at this stage that he will reverse Trump's tough policies in the region -- he might even strengthen them.In 2016 the Democratic platform referred simply to protecting "freedom of the seas in the South China Sea." Four years later, it now explicitly warns of "the Chinese military's intimidation" in the region.More than once during his campaign, Biden has told the story of how he bluntly informed President Xi in 2013 that the US would continue to fly planes through the region, despite the Chinese government setting up an unrecognized Air Defense Identification Zone."(He said) you can't fly through them. I said we're going to fly through them ... We're not going to pay attention," Biden said during his second debate with Trump in October.Biden has reinforced his position on staring down China's expansionist claims in Asia Pacific since becoming President-elect. In a phone call with Japanese Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide on Thursday, Biden committed to defending the contested Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, which are claimed by both Japan and China.TaiwanUnder President Trump, the US has moved to strengthen official ties with Taiwan, especially during the past 12 months. The Trump administration has authorized billions of dollars of arms sales to the self-governed island and, in August, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar became most senior US official to visit Taiwan in decades.Biden has long been in favor of US support for Taiwan and its democratically elected government. In fact, during his time as a senator, the President-elect voted for the original Taiwan Relations Act in 1979, which allowed the US to maintain unofficial relations with Taipei while also formally recognizing the Beijing government.China maintains that Taiwan is part of its territory, even though the two sides have been governed separately since the end of a civil war in 1949. Chinese President Xi has pledged to "reunite" Taiwan with mainland China, by force if necessary. In an opinion piece written in 2001, the then-senator said that the US had a "vital interest in helping Taiwan sustain its vibrant democracy." But he made it clear that the US didn't have an "obligation" to defend the island from attack. "The president should not cede to Taiwan, much less to China, the ability automatically to draw us into a war across the Taiwan Strait," he said.Biden hasn't spoken extensively about Taiwan on the campaign trail or since beginning his transition. But there is no indication he is planning to back down on Trump's policies.Biden tweeted his congratulations to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen when she was re-elected in January 2020 and she reciprocated when he won in November.In a telling sign, the Democratic Party removed all mention of a "One China" policy from its platform in 2020, the agreement by which the US acknowledged that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it. The policy, which had featured in 2016, was replaced by new seemingly updated language. Instead, the Democrats are now committed to continuing "a peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people of Taiwan."Xinjiang and Hong KongSince the Trump administration took power in 2017, there has been a growing stream of reports of widespread human rights abuses in China's western region of Xinjiang.The US State Department estimates up to two million citizens from Muslim minorities, including a large number of Uyghur people, have been held in detention centers, where former detainees allege they were indoctrinated, abused and even sterilized.In the past 12 months, the Trump administration has taken a series of punitive actions against China over its Xinjiang policies, including sanctions targeting Communist Party officials and bans on goods made possibly with Uyghur forced labor.Ahead of the election on November 3, a number of Uyghur exiles told CNN that they were concerned that Biden wasn't tough enough to take on Beijing and produce real results for their friends and families in Xinjiang.But all statements by Biden, his campaign and the Democratic Party point show little tolerance for Beijing's alleged targeting of the Uyghurs and hints that a Biden administration will take further action.Speaking about Chinese President Xi at a Democratic Primary debate in February, Biden said, "This is a guy who is a thug, who in fact has a million Uyghurs in 'reconstruction camps,' meaning concentration camps."The Biden campaign has labeled China's actions in Xinjiang "genocide," a label which the Trump administration was still debating earlier this year. If a Biden administration adopted the same language, it would put the US far ahead of most other nations in its condemnation of Beijing.Exiled Uyghurs aren't alone in their concerns that Trump leaving the White House would lead to the US backing down on its tough approach to China.Pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong who have been struggling against a Chinese government crackdown on civil liberties in the international financial hub had hoped for a second Trump term, worried that Biden won't be tough enough on Beijing.But in a statement in May, Biden's campaign blamed Trump for China's crackdown in Hong Kong and promised that going forward there would be "clear, strong, and consistent on values when it comes to China."CNN's James Griffiths, Steven Jiang and Jill Disis contributed to this story.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Video chat service's employee accused of censoring Tiananmen Square events for Chinese governmentCNN WireDecember 18, 2020 Friday 10:08 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 412 wordsDateline: NEW YORK (CNN) BodyNEW YORK (CNN) --  A videoconferencing company's employee is wanted by the FBI for his alleged participation in a scheme to censor meetings on behalf of the Chinese government. Xinjiang "Julien" Jin and co-conspirators allegedly terminated at least four video meetings commemorating the thirty-first anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre in June. Most of of the meetings were organized and attended by US participants, some of whom were dissidents who had participated in and survived the 1989 protests, court documents show. Zoom is not named in the complaint but sources familiar with the investigation identified the company as Zoom.A spokesperson for Zoom said the company is reviewing the filing.Jin, 39, is charged with conspiracy to commit interstate harassment and unlawful conspiracy to transfer a means of identification, according to a complaint filed in United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.Jin, who sources said worked for Zoom, proactively monitored videoconferences covering political and religious subjects unacceptable to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Chinese government since January 2019, the complaint says. He also used fake identification and lodged false complaints against the users of the platform to justify terminating meetings and user accounts, according to the complaint. Jin allegedly fabricated reports to company superiors that the users speaking against the Chinese government were supporting terrorist organizations, inciting violence and distributing child pornography, the complaint says.The Chinese government used information from Jin to retaliate and intimidate the users and their family members who lived in the country, the complaint alleges. "Jin willingly committed crimes, and sought to mislead others at the company, to help PRC authorities censor and punish U.S. users' core political speech merely for exercising their rights to free expression. The charges announced today make clear that employees working in the PRC for U.S. technology companies make those companies---and their users---vulnerable to the malign influence of the PRC government," Acting United States Attorney Seth DuCharme said in a press release. Jin is known to be in China's Zhejiang Province and is not in US custody according to the US Attorney's office.A federal arrest warrant was issued for Jin on November 19, 2020.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Congressional Research Service Report: 'TikTok: Technology Overview & Issues'Targeted News ServiceNovember 18, 2020 Wednesday 8:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 7209 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Congressional Research Service issued the following report (No. R46543) entitled "TikTok: Technology Overview and Issues" by Patricia Moloney Figliola, specialist in internet and telecommunications policy, on Nov. 17:TikTok is a globally popular video-sharing smartphone application (app) owned by ByteDance Ltd., a privately held company headquartered in Beijing, China. It is under increasing scrutiny by the U.S. government as a potential privacy and security risk to U.S. citizens. This is because ByteDance, like all technology companies doing business in China, is subject to Chinese laws that require companies operating in the country to turn over user data when asked by the government. Researchers differ over how TikTok data collection compares with other social media apps and whether TikTok poses a threat to the privacy and security of its U.S. users.TikTok launched in the United States in August 2018. The app is available in over 155 countries in 39 languages and has approximately 800 million monthly active users. In the United States, the app has approximately 49 million monthly active users. TikTok's appeal lies heavily on what has been called its "addictive" video feed, For You. The app builds this feed through a "recommendation engine" algorithm built on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and data mining practices. According to the company, the recommendation engine relies on a complex set of weighted factors to recommend content, including hashtags and videos watched previously, as well as the kind of device a person is using.TikTok critics cite problems with how much data TikTok collects from and about its users and with how that data is stored- and could be shared.On August 6, 2020, President Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at stopping TikTok from doing business in the United States. If the order had gone into effect on September 27, 2020, as scheduled, it would have prohibited any U.S. company or person from "transacting" with ByteDance. On August 14, 2020, the President issued a second Executive Order stating that ByteDance must divest from all assets that support TikTok's operations in the United States and destroy all previously collected U.S. user data. Divestiture may be accomplished by finding a U.S. buyer for TikTok. The requirements are designed to limit the Chinese government's access to current and future data from U.S. TikTok users. ByteDance does not want to divest from TikTok and sued the Trump Administration.On September 14, 2020, Oracle announced that it had reached an agreement with ByteDance to "serve as [the company's] trusted technology provider" in the United States. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that he had received the proposal. From the terminology used, it appears that the deal may involve a partnership between the two companies rather than a sale. This arrangement would keep the source code of the For You recommendation engine in the hands of ByteDance.It is unclear if this deal satisfies the conditions in President Trump's Executive Orders. Secretary Mnuchin said that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States will review the proposal and present President Trump with its opinion.On September 19, 2020, Oracle announced that Walmart would be joining the TikTok acquisition. TikTok has until November 27, 2020, to persuade the U.S. government to approve this sale.On September 27, 2020, Judge Carl J. Nichols of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration order. He stated that while President Trump has broad authority to prohibit business transactions with foreign entities that are deemed to pose a national security risk, TikTok appears to be exempt from such a prohibition because it is a personal communication service, which is protected by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.On October 30, 2020, a federal judge in Pennsylvania granted a preliminary injunction against a series of bans by the U.S. Department of Commerce (DoC) that had been set to go into effect on November 12, 2020. Although TikTok is suing to block its app from being banned, this ruling is from a lawsuit brought by three TikTok creators who worried the ban would prevent them from earning a living. The judge agreed that the videos constitute "informational materials," which are protected by law. On November 12, 2020, the DoC stated that it would comply with the injunction.Some believe TikTok and other Chinese-owned apps pose a serious security risk to the United States because Chinese companies are subject to China's laws that require compliance with government requests for data. Others believe that TikTok has fallen into "the crosshairs of a global technology battle" based on technology trade protectionism. Similar situations may arise in the future with other apps created by foreign companies. Options that Congress may consider include (1) developing an overarching legal and regulatory framework to protect the security and privacy of U.S. citizens' data and communications, and (2) developing a uniform, transparent process to assess and mediate risks from foreign apps.* * *Contents:Background ... 1What Is TikTok? ... 1* TikTok's Recommendation Engine ... 2* Data Collection, Storage, and Sharing by TikTok ... 3- Data Collection ... 3- Data Storage ... 4- Data Sharing ... 4White House TikTok Executive Orders ... 4* Prohibiting Transactions with ByteDance ... 5- TikTok Creators Lawsuit ... 5* Requiring Divestiture of ByteDance from TikTok ... 5- ByteDance Lawsuit Against Order to Divest ... 5China's Cybersecurity Law and Export Rules ... 6Status of Potential Oracle and Walmart Partnership with TikTok ... 7Discussion ... 8* Threat to Security ... 8* Technology Trade Protectionism ... 9Related Congressional Activity ... 10* Hearings ... 10* Legislation ... 11Conclusion ... 11Tables:Table 1.

The app is under intense scrutiny by the U.S. government as a potential privacy and security risk to U.S. users. A major concern is that ByteDance is subject to Chinese laws that require companies operating in China to turn over user data when asked to by the national government. On August 6 and August 14, 2020, President Trump signed Executive Orders aimed at stopping U.S. persons and entities from doing business with ByteDance/1 and requiring ByteDance to divest from any holding used to support the operation of TikTok in the United States./2Researchers differ over how TikTok's collection of user data compares with other social media apps and whether TikTok poses a unique threat to the privacy and security of its U.S. users, including many minors.WeChat, another Chinese-owned app, is often mentioned in conjunction with TikTok, but the two apps are quite different. TikTok has a single function-short video-while WeChat has multiple-voice and data messaging, social media, and digital payment. WeChat is used in the United States primarily by the Chinese language community, whereas TikTok is used more widely. On the same day as the TikTok order, President Trump also signed an Executive Order prohibiting any U.S. individual or entity from engaging in any transaction related to WeChat and its owner, Tencent Holdings Ltd./3While issues with the two apps are often conflated, their functions, technical capabilities, and the data collected from their users are different. Only TikTok is discussed in this report. Background information about WeChat is in the Appendix.* * *What Is TikTok?On August 2, 2018, U.S. users of the Musical.ly app, a short video service headquartered in Shanghai, China, with a U.S. office in Santa Monica, CA, found that it had been merged into TikTok. Musical.ly had been acquired by ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, in November 2017 for $1 billion as a means to enter the U.S. market. The TikTok app is available in over 155 countries in 39 languages, and has approximately 800 million monthly active users./4In the United States, TikTok has approximately 49 million monthly active users/5 and the company maintains offices in Los Angeles and New York. When ByteDance first released the TikTok app in September 2016, videos could be no longer than 15 seconds, but now users are allowed to link together four 15 second segments./6Longer videos recorded outside the app can also be uploaded to the platform. ByteDance is currently estimated to be worth over $100 billion./7The company's core product in China is Toutiao, which means "Headlines." Toutiao began as a mobile news recommendation engine, but has evolved into a platform to deliver content and targeted advertising in other formats as well (e.g., text messages, images, question-and-answer posts, microblogs, videos).TikTok's Recommendation EngineTikTok's appeal relies on what has been called its "addictive" video feed, For You./8The app builds this feed through a "recommendation engine" using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and data mining practices. How each user's feed is constructed had been a tightly held secret until recently. On June 18, 2020, TikTok published a blog post, "How TikTok Recommends Videos #ForYou."/9The company says its algorithm relies on a complex set of weighted factors to recommend content based on user preferences, including hashtags and videos watched; videos "liked," shared, and commented on; as well as the kind of device a person is using. Each user's feed is unique.Table 1 lists the specific factors the company says it uses.Table 1. "For You" Feed Factors and ElementsTable omitted.According to TikTok, [a]ll these factors are processed by our recommendation system and weighted based on their value to a user. A strong indicator of interest, such as whether a user finishes watching a longer video from beginning to end, would receive greater weight than a weak indicator, such as whether the video's viewer and creator are both in the same country. Videos are then ranked to determine the likelihood of a user's interest in a piece of content, and delivered to each unique For You feed.The blog post was seen by most as an effort to provide more transparency to the public as the U.S. government was increasing its scrutiny of the company's practices./10Data Collection, Storage, and Sharing by TikTokCritics, as well as some members of Congress, cite as problematic the amount of data that TikTok collects from and about its users, how that data is stored, and how it could potentially be shared with the Chinese government and used in influence campaigns/11 or against U.S. citizens./12Based on these concerns, both the Democratic and Republican national committees, the Department of Defense, and some private firms, such as Wells Fargo Inc., have banned or discouraged the use of the TikTok app./13Data CollectionAccording to its privacy policy,/14 TikTok collects a range of user information, including location data and internet address, keystroke patterns, and the type of device being used to access the app.The app also collects and stores a user's browsing and search history within the app, as well as the content of any messages exchanged using the app. Additional information can be collected based on user permission: phone number, phone book, and social-network contacts; GPS data; user age; user-generated content (e.g., photos and videos); store payment information; and the videos "liked," shared, watched all the way through, and re-watched. TikTok states that the app collects less personal data than many other apps, such as Facebook and Google, both of which track user activity across devices (TikTok claims that it does not)./15The data that TikTok collects from users appears in many regards to be comparable to what other social media companies gather and use./16Some critics have described TikTok's approach to data mining as aggressive/17 and that its ability to track user behavior while using the app, as well as access to a user's photos, videos, and phone book and geolocation tracking (based on user permissions), means that it can build extremely detailed behavioral profiles of its users that could potentially be shared with the Chinese government./18On August 11, 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported that TikTok avoided privacy safeguards in Google's Android operating system to collect users' mobile device MAC addresses, unique identifiers that allow "the app to track users online," and concealed this activity with an additional layer of encryption before ending the practice after 15 months in November 2019./19Data StorageTikTok claims to store all content created by U.S. users-as well as data about those users-only on servers located within the United States and backed up in Singapore. Those servers are owned or controlled by TikTok, but the company denies that it shares or would share this data with the Chinese government,/20 stating that:The key personnel responsible for TikTok ... are all Americans based in the United States-and therefore are not subject to Chinese law. U.S. content moderation is likewise led by a U.S.-based team and operates independently from China, and, as noted above, the TikTok application stores U.S. user data on servers located in the United States and Singapore./21Data SharingDespite these assertions, TikTok's website says that information can be shared with its parent company in China or other affiliates (usually advertisers), which operate under Chinese law./22Further, a lawsuit filed in federal court in December 2019 asserted that user data was harvested and sent to servers in China./23* * *White House TikTok Executive OrdersPresident Trump has issued two Executive Orders affecting the future of TikTok in the United States, one on August 6, 2020 (E.O. 13942), and another on August 14, 2020 (No number assigned).Prohibiting Transactions with ByteDanceThe August 6, 2020, E.O. 13942 had been set to take effect on September 20, 2020, but that date was extended. The order does not state which specific transactions would be prohibited, but it would likely result in the removal of the TikTok app from Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store in the United States. It could also make it illegal for U.S. companies to purchase advertising on TikTok. Some U.S. TikTok employees have speculated that they would no longer be able to be paid.TikTok Creators LawsuitOn September 18, 2020, TikTok creators Douglas Marland, Cosette Rinab, and Alec Chambers ("plaintiffs") filed a motion to prevent implementation of E.O. 13942. TikTok is suing separately to block its app from being banned, but this lawsuit is based on plaintiffs' assertion that the ban would prevent them from earning a living. The motion was amended by plaintiffs on October 1, 2020. On October 30, 2020, a federal judge in Pennsylvania granted a preliminary injunction in favor of the plaintiffs, stopping the ban that was set to go into effect on November 12, 2020. The judge agreed that the videos constitute "informational materials," which are protected by law. On November 12, 2020, the DoC stated that it would comply with the injunction.Requiring Divestiture of ByteDance from TikTokOn August 14, 2020, President Trump issued an additional Executive Order, "Regarding the Acquisition of Musical.ly by ByteDance Ltd.,"/24 that imposed additional conditions on the ability of ByteDance to operate TikTok in the United States. The order requires ByteDance and its "subsidiaries, affiliates, and Chinese shareholders" to divest from "any tangible or intangible assets or property, wherever located, used to enable or support ByteDance's operation of the TikTok application in the United States" as determined by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)./25The order also requires ByteDance to destroy all data obtained or derived from either the TikTok or Music.ly apps from U.S. users upon divestiture and certify in writing to CFIUS that it has done so. The order requires these actions within 90 days (November 12, 2020), rather than the 45 days included in the first order, giving ByteDance additional time to find a buyer./26A transfer of ownership and operation of TikTok to a U.S. entity not subject to Chinese laws, including management of collected user data, appears designed to limit the ability of the Chinese government to acquire access to future U.S. user data.ByteDance Lawsuit Against Order to DivestByteDance opposed divestiture from TikTok and, on August 24, 2020, sued the Trump Administration./27In a blog post, TikTok stated that it was "shocked by the recent Executive Order, which was issued without any due process."/28On September 27, 2020, Judge Carl J. Nichols of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration order. He stated that while President Trump has broad authority to prohibit business transactions with foreign entities that are deemed to pose a national security risk, TikTok appears to be exempt from such a prohibition because it is a personal communication service, which is protected by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.* * *China's Cybersecurity Law and Export RulesThe Cybersecurity Law of the People's Republic of China was passed in November 2016 and went into effect in June 2017. It was updated in November 2018 by the Regulations on Internet Security Supervision and Inspection by Public Security Organs. These laws-* strictly control online activities;* mandate the local storage of user data and the registration of certain network assets; and* allow the government to conduct onsite and remote inspection of computer networks./29The law requires Chinese companies to cooperate with government intelligence operations if so requested/30 and may allow the Chinese government access to user data collected by any company doing business in China. One analyst notes that "by demanding access to any data collected and stored in China, the updated regulations force [domestic and] foreign companies based in China to comply with its investigative measures, leaving intellectual property and private information vulnerable to government abuse."/31On August 31, 2020, China took specific action that could prohibit the sale of TikTok's underlying technology and processes. The new export regulations cover such technologies as "text analysis, content recommendation, speech modeling, and voice recognition."/32Since the For You feed and algorithmic recommendation engine is considered the key element of TikTok's success, a ban on transferring the technology and processes used to create it could make it more difficult to sell the app or prevent a sale altogether./33* * *Status of Potential Oracle and Walmart Partnership with TikTokIn response to the TikTok Executive Order, two leading bidders emerged as potential buyers of the app: Oracle and a partnership between Microsoft and Walmart. Bids were reported to be in the range of $20 billion to $30 billion./34Twitter and Google were also rumored to be interested in acquiring the app./35On September 13, 2020, Microsoft announced that its bid had been rejected by ByteDance. In its announcement, the company stated, "We would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combating disinformation." One expert, Alex Stamos, Director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, commented that this statement is "an attempt to poison the well against an Oracle deal where they only take over hosting. And [Microsoft] is right to do so."/36On September 14, 2020, Oracle announced that it had reached an agreement with ByteDance to "serve as [the company's] trusted technology provider" in the United States. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that he had received the proposal./37From the terminology used, it appears that the deal may involve a partnership rather than a sale, with TikTok using Oracle's cloud hosting services./38This arrangement would keep the source code of the For You feed and algorithmic recommendation engine in the hands of ByteDance. Secretary Mnuchin said that CFIUS will review the proposal and present President Trump with its opinion.On September 19, 2020, Oracle announced that Walmart would join its bid for TikTok, with the two companies acquiring 20% of a newly formed company, TikTok Global,/39 with the remaining 80% owned by ByteDance. According to announcements made by the companies, 40% of ByteDance is owned by U.S. investors, which is meant to indicate that the new company would be under majority U.S. ownership./40However, this arrangement, along with TikTok keeping the For You recommendation engine algorithm,/41 would not appear to satisfy conditions in PresidentTrump's Executive Orders. In addition to U.S. approval of the proposal being uncertain given its provisions, Chinese approval of the proposal is also uncertain. China's new export regulations appear to forbid transfer of the For You algorithm, but the United States appears to require such a transfer. So, the legal requirements of each country are at odds with each other.On September 23, 2020, TikTok filed for, and was granted, an injunction in federal court to stop the ban on the app that was set to take effect on September 27, 2020. TikTok has now been granted an extension until November 27, 2020, to persuade the U.S. government to approve the deal with Oracle and Walmart.* * *DiscussionSome believe TikTok and other apps developed and owned by Chinese companies pose a serious security risk to the United States because Chinese companies are governed by China's Cybersecurity Law. Others believe that TikTok is caught up in increasing trade tensions between China and the United States./42Threat to SecurityAlthough TikTok forcefully states that it does not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government, many security and privacy advocates are skeptical. For example, in addition to the lawsuit cited above (see "Data Sharing"), the American Civil Liberties Union argues that "Chinese apps in particular have a reputation for grabbing more data than required to provide their services, often sending information to advertising networks ... [they] are frequently far more abusive than others...."/43The Chinese government obtains data about and created by its own citizens, for purposes that range from censorship to mass surveillance./44Other countries have also taken action against TikTok on the grounds of security. India banned TikTok and 50 other Chinese apps in June 2020, calling them a "threat to sovereignty and integrity."/45Also in June 2020, the European Union opened an investigation into TikTok to examine possible violations of its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)./46Australia had threatened to ban the app, but on August 4, 2020, the country's Prime Minister indicated that TikTok would not be banned; however, he warned Australians against the app, saying it "connects right back to China."/47Japan, Turkey, and Pakistan/48 have also taken various measures to protect their countries' users from possibly security risks./49Technology Trade ProtectionismOther observers argue that TikTok is caught in "the crosshairs of a global technology battle,"/50 and that a unilateral U.S. ban on any app may be comparable to China's "Great Firewall."/51One way to potentially understand U.S. and Chinese government actions in this dispute may be through the concept of techno-nationalism,/52 which refers to a country's refusal or reluctance to import other countries' advanced technology, as well as to export, or to allow other nations to benefit from, its own advanced technology. Within this framework, technology is considered a central pillar of a country's wellbeing:Techno-nationalism ... links technological innovation and capabilities directly to a nation's national security, economic prosperity, and social stability.... [It] seeks to attain competitive advantage for its stakeholders, both locally and globally, and leverage these advantages for geopolitical gain./53One policy mechanism that nations use to protect what they view as important or sensitive technologies are export controls, rules which limit to which foreign entities and under what circumstances or conditions specific technologies may be sold or licensed./54For example, in August 2020, the Bureau of Industry and Security at the Department of Commerce announced sanctions that restrict foreign semiconductor companies from selling chips developed or produced using U.S. software or technology to Huawei, another Chinese company, without first obtaining a license to do so./55This restriction has been called a "lethal blow"/56 to the company.Another mechanism is the use of protectionist practices that privilege domestic entities' access to domestic markets. For example, China requires U.S. telecommunications companies to enter into a partnership with a Chinese company to provide services in that country. In June 2020, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations issued a report, "Threats to US Networks: Oversight of Chinese Government Owned Carriers." The report notes that while China has access to the U.S. telecommunications market, U.S. companies do not have that same level of access in China.China does not provide US telecommunications companies reciprocal access to the Chinese market and requires foreign carriers seeking to operate in China to enter into joint ventures with Chinese companies. These joint ventures often require U.S. companies to give their technology, proprietary know-how, and intellectual property to their Chinese partners.Since China was allowed to join the World Trade Organization in 2001, the report notes that "not a single foreign firm has succeeded in establishing a new joint venture" to provide basic telecommunications services in China."Related Congressional ActivityCongress began taking an interest in TikTok as early as October 2019, when Senator Marco Rubio reportedly called for a formal investigation into whether TikTok posed a national security risk./57Later that month, Senators Charles Schumer and Tom Cotton sent a letter/58 to the Acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, expressing their concerns about TikTok and the national security risks they believe it poses. More formally, Congress has scrutinized TikTok in two hearings, and Members have introduced three related bills.HearingsThe Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism has held two hearings on, among other topics, the impact of Chinese smartphone apps on U.S. citizens' privacy:* "How Corporations and Big Tech Leave Our Data Exposed to Criminals, China, and Other Bad Actors" was held on November 5, 2019./59* "Dangerous Partners: Big Tech and Beijing" was held on March 4, 2020./60 TikTok was invited to testify at these hearings, but declined to appear./61LegislationThree bills have been introduced that would prohibit the use of TikTok and WeChat on U.S. government devices:* S. 4452/62 is a bill to prohibit federal employees from downloading or using WeChat on government devices. It was introduced on August 5, 2020, by Senator John Kennedy and referred to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs the same day.* S. 3455,/63 the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, was introduced on March 12, 2020, by Senator Josh Hawley. This bill was passed by the Senate on August 6, 2020, and received in the House the following day. (See S.Rept. 116-250./64)* H.R. 6896,/65 also called the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, is the House companion bill to S. 3455. It was introduced on May 15, 2020, by Representative Ken Buck and referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform and the House Committee on Administration the same day.* * *ConclusionThe variety of apps available to U.S. users is enormous. Situations similar to the case of TikTok may arise in the future with other apps created by foreign companies. Congress may consider taking one or both of two parallel approaches to address such situations: (1) developing an overarching legal and regulatory framework to protect the security and privacy of U.S. citizens' data and communications, and (2) establishing a uniform, transparent process to assess the risks posed by foreign apps and establish mechanisms to mediate those risks.* * *Footnotes:1 President Donald J.

Understand why China's government turned against Alibaba founderCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 28, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1502 wordsBodyIn China, Jack Ma is synonymous with success. The English teacher who became an internet entrepreneur is the richest person in the country. He founded Alibaba, something close to an Amazon rival. After Donald Trump was elected president of the United States in 2016, Ma was the first prominent Chinese he met with.This success translated into a pop star life for "Papa Ma", as some people call it online. He played an invincible kung-fu master in a 2017 short film full of Chinese movie stars. He sang with Faye Wong, the pop diva from China. A painting he made with Zeng Fanzhi, the country's leading artist, was sold at a Sotheby's auction for $5.4 million. For ambitious young Chinese, Papa Ma's story is something to copy for.                                               Alibaba CEO Jack Ma at startup event in Paris in May 2019 - Philippe Lopez/AFP                    But lately public sentiment has soured and Papa Ma has become the man the Chinese love to hate. He was called "villain", "evil capitalist" and "blood-sucking ghost". A writer listed Ma's "10 deadly sins." Instead of "Daddy," some people started calling him "son" or "grandson." In the reports about him, an increasing number of readers leave comments quoting Marx: "Workers of the world, unite!"This loss of stature occurs as Ma faces growing problems with the Chinese government. Authorities said on Thursday (24) they have opened an antitrust investigation into Alibaba, a powerful e-commerce company that he helped found and where they still have considerable influence.At the same time, authorities continue to prowling the Ant Group, the financial-technology giant that Ma created from Alibaba.Last month authorities canceled Ant's planned initial public offering, less than two weeks after Ma criticized financial regulators as obsessed with minimizing risks and accused Chinese banks ofbehave like "pawnshops", lending only to those who can offer collateral.On Thursday morning, when Alibaba's antitrust investigation was announced, four regulators said authorities would meet with Ant to discuss new oversight measures.On the surface, ma's changing public image stems largely from the Chinese government's growing criticism of its trade empire. A look below the surface shows a deeper and disturbing trend by the Chinese government and businessowners who have pulled the country out of economic backwardness over the past four decades.A growing number of people in China seem to feel that the opportunities that individuals like Ma have taken advantage of are disappearing, even in the midst of the post-coronavirus outbreak. Although the country has more billionaires than the United States and India combined, about 600 million of its citizens earn $150 or less per month. While consumption in the first 11 months of this year has fallen by about 5% nationally, luxury consumption in China is expected to grow by almost 50% this year compared to 2019.                                               Shop for Italian brand Gucci in Beijing in September this year - Tingshu Wang/Reuters                     Young college graduates, even those with U.S. degrees, face limited prospects for white-collar jobs and low wages. Housing in the best cities has become too expensive for first buyers. Young people who have borrowed from a new generation of online lenders, such as Ma's Ant Group, have increasingly difficult debts to pay off.Despite all of China's economic success, an ancient resentment of the rich, sometimes called a complex of hatred of the rich, bubbles beneath the surface. With Ma, he came out as revenge."A prominent billionaire like Jack Ma will no doubt be hanging from a street pole," wrote one online commenter in a widely circulated post, referring to the famous lynching slogan in the RevolutionFrench, "À la lanterne!" The article has been liked 122,000 times on the Weibo platform, similar to Twitter, and read more than 100,000 times on the messaging app and social network WeChat.The Communist Party seems more than willing to take advantage of that resentment. That could mean problems ahead for businessmen and private companies under Xi Jinping, China's greatest leader, who values servitude and loyalty above anything else.At an annual leaders' meeting last week that set the tone for the country's economic policies for next year, the party promised to strengthen antitrust measures and prevent "disorderly expansion of capital."Some business owners say that hostility towards Ant and Ma makes them think about the fundamental direction of the country."You can have absolute control or have a dynamic and innovative economy," said Fred Hu, founder of investment firm Primavera Capital Group in Hong Kong. "But it's doubtful to get both." His firm is an investor in Ant Group and he is on the group's board of directors.Xi has made no secret of what his ideal capitalist should be like. Ten days after the failure of Ant's IPO, he visited an exhibition dedicated to Zhang Jian, an industrialist who has worked for more than a century.Zhang helped build his hometown of Nantong and opened hundreds of schools. Business figures from Xi's era should also put their country ahead of business, was the message.At a meeting in July with members of the business community, Xi appointed Zhang as a model and asked them to put patriotism on top of their qualities (Xi would not have mentioned that Zhang died bankrupt).Ma has her own philanthropic projects, such as various rural education initiatives and an award to help develop entrepreneurial talent in Africa. But in many other ways the famous tech entrepreneur differs greatly from Zhang'.He has long enjoyed a better reputation than his peers in the manufacturing industry, in real estate and other sectors whose advantage can be a consequence of cultivating close ties with the government, ignoring environmental regulations and exploiting employees.He is equally famous for making bold statements and challenging the authorities. In 2003, he created Alipay, which later became part of the Ant Group, putting his business empire at the heart of the state-controlled world of finance."If anyone has to be arrested because of Alipay, it's me," he told colleagues at the time.Sometimes he subtly challenged the government to punish him for his boldness. On Ant's business, he said several times, "If the government needs it, I can give it to the government." His right arms repeated the phrase.At the time, few people took these comments seriously. People who know him well considered them a "very Jack" thing to say. "Give Alipay to the country? Jack Ma only speaks," read the title of a 2010 opinion piece in the China Business News newspaper.Today the chances that these bold statements will come true have increased. "Given what has happened, ant will have to be controlled or even majority owned by the state in the future," said Zhiwu Chen, an economist at the School of Economics at the University of Hong Kong.The pressure on Ma indicates a change in the way the Chinese government regulates the internet. He has long censored the content, but in other ways adopted a laissez-faire approach. Regulations were rare. No state-owned company was involved. And at first the internet industry in China was small.Today Alibaba and its archrival, Tencent, control more personal data and are more closely involved in china's everyday life than Google, Facebook and other American tech titans in the United States. Andjust like their American counterparts, Chinese giants sometimes intimidate smaller competitors and kill innovation. You don't need to be a member of the Communist Party to see reasons to contain them.Instead of disrupting the state system, the companies have become in it. Sometimes they even help the authorities track down people. But the government increasingly sees its size and influence as threats.Technology companies in China are not the country's largest monopolies, however. These are owned by the state, which dominates banks and finance, telecommunications, electricity and other key sectors."China Mobile is a monopoly. The Commercial and Industrial Bank of China is a monopoly," wrote Zhang Weiying, a beijing university economist, in 2017, "because without government permission you can't get into these sectors."The article was republished on various accounts and social networks last week, but was quickly censored.It's too early to say how far the regulations will be able to contain Ma and the big techs. But some pro-market people in China fear that the country is moving to the hardline of the 1950s, when the party eliminated the capital class, using language that compared capitalist tendencies to impurities, defects and weaknesses.For these people, part of the language recently used by Eric Jing, President of Ant, recalled this era. At a conference on December 15, he said the company is "looking in the mirror, discovering our flaws and performing a physical check-up."Translation by Luiz Roberto Mendes GonçalvesLoad-Date: December 29, 2020End of Document

REPORT: AMID GLOBAL DECLINE, CHINA REMAINS WORLD'S WORST ABUSER OF INTERNET FREEDOM IN 2020States News ServiceDecember 15, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1495 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Freedom House:For the sixth consecutive year, China confirmed its position as the worst abuser of internet freedom in Freedom on the Net 2020, published in October. This page provides an update on global and China-linked findings.Governments around the world have used the COVID-19 pandemic as cover to expand online surveillance and data collection, censor critical speech, and build new technological systems of social control, according to Freedom on the Net 2020, the latest edition of the annual country-by-country assessment of internet freedom, released in October by Freedom House.The rapid and unchecked rollout of artificial intelligence (AI) and biometric surveillance to address the public health crisis has created new risks for human rights. Smartphone apps for contact tracing or quarantine compliance have been introduced in 54 of the 65 countries assessed in this report. Few countries possess effective mechanisms for protecting personal data against abusive practices by the state or the private sector.Political leaders are also using the pandemic as a pretext to censor unfavorable news, arrest critics, and scapegoat ethnic and religious groups. In at least 45 countries, activists, journalists, and other members of the public were arrested or charged with criminal offenses for online speech related to the pandemic. Governments in at least 28 countries censored websites and social media posts to suppress unfavorable health statistics, corruption allegations, and other COVID-19-related content.No government has taken a more aggressive approach to controlling information than China's, which was found to be the world's worst abuser of internet freedom for a sixth consecutive year. Censorship and surveillance were pushed to unprecedented extremes as the government enhanced its information controls over hundreds of millions of internet users, including in response to persistent antigovernment protests in Hong Kong and the coronavirus pandemic that began in the city of Wuhan.At the center of the official cover-up that enabled COVID-19 to spread globally were the regime's restrictions on internet freedom, particularly police interrogations of and forced retractions by medical professionals who shared early reports on social media of a SARS-like illness in the city. Chinese authorities have combined low- and high-tech tools not only to manage the outbreak of the coronavirus, but also to deter internet users from sharing information from independent sources and challenging the official narrative. The pandemic is normalizing the sort of digital authoritarianism that the Chinese Communist Party has long sought to mainstream.Despite the tighter constraints and risk of criminal penalties, investigative journalists, video bloggers, and ordinary internet users took courageous action to trace the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, report from within the locked-down city of Wuhan, share information on other sensitive topics, and archive deleted news reports.In addition to COVID-19-related content, the Hong Kong prodemocracy protests, the 30th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, critical reporting on Chinese Communist Party leaders, and the mass detention of Uighur and other Muslims in Xinjiang were among the most heavily censored topics in 2019 and 2020. People discussing these topics online faced legal and extralegal reprisals, including arbitrary detention, torture, and draconian prison terms.Freedom on the Net 2020 assesses internet freedom in 65 countries, accounting for 87 percent of internet users worldwide. The report focuses on developments that occurred between June 2019 and May 2020.Key Global Findings:Internet freedom declined for the 10th consecutive year. Of the 65 countries covered by Freedom on the Net, 26 worsened and 22 registered gains. Myanmar, Kyrgyzstan, India, Ecuador, and Nigeria suffered the largest declines during the coverage period.Governments are using the pandemic as a pretext to crack down on free expression and access to information. Authorities censored independent reporting on the virus in 28 countries and arrested online critics in 45 countries. In at least 20 countries, the pandemic was cited as a justification to impose vague or overly broad restrictions on speech. Residents of at least 13 countries experienced internet shutdowns, with governments denying certain population groups access to life-saving information in a cruel form of collective punishment.The public health crisis is laying a foundation for the future surveillance state. In at least 30 countries, governments are invoking the pandemic to engage in mass surveillance in direct partnership with telecommunications providers and other companies. Smartphone apps for contact tracing or quarantine compliance have been introduced in at least 54 countries, with few or no protections against abuse. Authorities are rolling out facial recognition technology and automated decision-making with minimal safeguards to protect privacy or prevent police abuse."Cyber sovereignty" is on the rise. Russian authorities passed legislation to isolate the country from the global internet during national emergencies, and Iran's government severed international connections in order to hide a violent police response to mass protests. Legislators in Brazil, Pakistan, and Turkey passed or considered regulations requiring companies to keep user data from leaving the country, effectively granting law enforcement agencies easier access to sensitive information. More recently, the governments of the United States and India ordered bans on popular Chinese-owned apps; while these actions came in response to genuine security and human rights concerns, they were arbitrary and disproportionate, and served to legitimize calls by Chinese officials for each state to oversee its own "national internet."Key China Findings:Scores: China was rated as Not Free, receiving a total score of 10 out of 100 (with 0 representing the lease free and 100 the most free). The report does not assess events in Hong Kong or Tibet. Freedom on the Net assess countries across three categories, for which China's scores were:Obstacles to Access: 8 out of 25Limits on Content: 2 out of 35Violations of User Rights: 0 out of 40.More people could access high-speed internet. According to government figures, China added 49 million new internet users since June 2019, including 50 million subscribers to fifth-generation (5G) technology for mobile networksthe most in the worldThe government ramped up digital repression during the COVID-19 pandemic. The full spectrum of internet controls were put into effect to police information about the coronavirus outbreak and the government's response to it, including restrictions on the use of virtual private networks, the removal of online content, the closing of social media accounts, and the arresting and charging of internet users for their online speech.People across Chinese society faced harsh reprisals for their online expression. A wide array of individuals were targeted with legal and extralegal reprisalsincluding arbitrary detention, torture, and draconian prison termsfor their online activity. In addition to users who shared information about COVID-19 or criticized the government's response to the pandemic, people sentenced to prison termssome of over 10 yearsincluded online journalists, critics of Xi Jinping, supporters of Hong Kong prodemocracy protests, operators of human rights websites, and members of ethnic and religious minority groups like Uighurs, Tibetans, and Falun Gong practitioners.Nationalist voices gained prominence at the expense of rights advocates. As a result of intensifying controls, the online presence of independent civil society, human rights documentation, and prodemocracy viewpoints declined. Encouraged by authorities, the volume and aggressiveness of nationalistic voices increased, contributing to more self-censorship.Private companies helped facilitate government surveillance. New evidence emerged of Chinese technology companies systematically aiding government surveillance, including through the development of mandatory or semimandatory propaganda and public health mobile phone applications that were found to collect data and transfer it to authorities. Chinese technology firms are also creating "key individual" databases through which security forces in different parts of the country can target certain people for particular scrutiny.Authorities enhanced internet controls within mainland China about the Hong Kong protest movement. The Chinese government and private companies increasingly blocked or removed online content related to the Hong Kong protests and subsequent government restrictions in the territory for China-based internet users. Activists, businesspeople, and members of the public supporting the protests online also faced legal and extralegal reprisal.Load-Date: December 15, 2020End of Document

Congressional Research Service Report: 'TikTok - Technology Overview & Issues'Targeted News ServiceDecember 8, 2020 Tuesday 7:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4772 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Congressional Research Service issued the following report (No. R46543) entitled "TikTok: Technology Overview and Issues" by Patricia Moloney Figliola, specialist in Internet and telecommunications policy on Dec. 4:SUMMARYTikTok is a globally popular video-sharing smartphone application (app) owned by ByteDance Ltd., a privately held company headquartered in Beijing, China. It is under increasing scrutiny by the U.S. government as a potential privacy and security risk to U.S. citizens. This is because ByteDance, like all technology companies doing business in China, is subject to Chinese laws that require companies operating in the country to turn over user data when asked by the government. Researchers differ over how TikTok data collection compares with other social media apps and whether TikTok poses a threat to the privacy and security of its U.S. users.TikTok launched in the United States in August 2018. The app is available in over 155 countries in 39 languages and has approximately 800 million monthly active users. In the United States, the app has approximately 49 million monthly active users. TikTok's appeal lies heavily on what has been called its "addictive" video feed, For You. The app builds this feed through a "recommendation engine" algorithm built on artificial intelligence technologies and data mining practices. According to the company, the recommendation engine relies on a complex set of weighted factors to recommend content, including hashtags and videos watched previously, as well as the kind of device a person is using. TikTok critics cite problems with how much data TikTok collects from and about its users and with how that data is stored-- and could be shared.On August 6, 2020, President Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at stopping TikTok from doing business in the United States. If the order had gone into effect on September 27, 2020, as scheduled, it would have prohibited any U.S. company or person from "transacting" with ByteDance. On August 14, 2020, the President issued a second Executive Order stating that ByteDance must divest from all assets that support TikTok's U.S. operations and destroy all previously collected U.S. user data. Divestiture may be accomplished by finding a U.S. buyer for TikTok. The requirements are designed to limit the Chinese government's access to current and future data from U.S. TikTok users. ByteDance does not want to divest from TikTok and sued the Trump Administration.On September 14, 2020, Oracle announced that it had reached an agreement with ByteDance to "serve as [the company's] trusted technology provider" in the United States. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that he had received the proposal. From the terminology used, it appears that the deal may involve a partnership between the two companies rather than a sale. This arrangement would keep the source code of the For You recommendation engine in the hands of ByteDance. It is unclear if this deal satisfies the conditions in President Trump's Executive Orders. Secretary Mnuchin said that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) would review the proposal and present President Trump with its opinion. On September 19, 2020, Oracle announced that Walmart would be joining the TikTok acquisition. TikTok originally had until November 27, 2020, to persuade the U.S. government to approve this sale.On September 27, 2020, Judge Carl J. Nichols of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration order. He stated that while President Trump has broad authority to prohibit business transactions with foreign entities that are deemed to pose a national security risk, TikTok appears to be exempt from such a prohibition because it is a personal communication service, which is protected by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.On October 30, 2020, a federal judge in Pennsylvania granted a preliminary injunction against a series of bans by the U.S. Department of Commerce (DoC) that had been set to go into effect on November 12, 2020. Although TikTok is suing to block its app from being banned, this ruling is from a lawsuit brought by three TikTok creators who worried the ban would prevent them from earning a living. The judge agreed that the videos constitute "informational materials," which are protected by law. On November 12, 2020, the DoC stated that it would comply with the injunction. On November 10, 2020, TikTok filed a petition in the U.S. Court of Appeals asking for a review of actions by CFIUS because the company hadn't heard from the committee in weeks.Some believe TikTok and other Chinese-owned apps pose a serious security risk to the United States because Chinese companies are subject to China's laws that require compliance with government requests for data. Others believe that TikTok has fallen into "the crosshairs of a global technology battle" based on technology trade protectionism. Similar situations may arise in the future with other apps created by foreign companies. Options that Congress may consider include (1) developing an overarching legal and regulatory framework to protect the security and privacy of U.S. citizens' data and communications, and (2) developing a uniform, transparent process to assess and mediate risks from foreign apps.BackgroundTikTok is a popular video-sharing smartphone application (app) owned by ByteDance Ltd., a privately held company headquartered in Beijing, China. The app is under intense scrutiny by the U.S. government as a potential privacy and security risk to U.S. users. A major concern is that ByteDance is subject to Chinese laws that require companies operating in China to turn over user data when asked to by the national government. On August 6 and August 14, 2020, President Trump signed Executive Orders aimed at stopping U.S. persons and entities from doing business with ByteDance/1 and requiring ByteDance to divest from any holding used to support the operation of TikTok in the United States./2Researchers differ over how TikTok's collection of user data compares with other social media apps and whether TikTok poses a unique threat to the privacy and security of its U.S. users, including many minors.WeChat, another Chinese-owned app, is often mentioned in conjunction with TikTok, but the two apps are quite different. TikTok has a single function--short video--while WeChat has multiple--voice and data messaging, social media, and digital payment. WeChat is used in the United States primarily by the Chinese language community, whereas TikTok is used more widely. On the same day as the TikTok order, President Trump also signed an Executive Order prohibiting any U.S. individual or entity from engaging in any transaction related to WeChat and its owner, Tencent Holdings Ltd./3While issues with the two apps are often conflated, their functions, technical capabilities, and the data collected from their users are different. Only TikTok is discussed in this report. Background information about WeChat is in the Appendix.What Is TikTok?On August 2, 2018, U.S. users of the Musical.ly app, a short video service headquartered in Shanghai, China, with a U.S. office in Santa Monica, CA, found that it had been merged into TikTok. Musical.ly had been acquired by ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, in November 2017 for $1 billion as a means to enter the U.S. market. The TikTok app is available in over 155 countries in 39 languages, and has approximately 800 million monthly active users./4In the United States, TikTok has approximately 49 million monthly active users/5and the company maintains offices in Los Angeles and New York. When ByteDance first released the TikTok app in September 2016, videos could be no longer than 15 seconds, but now users are allowed to link together four 15second segments./6Longer videos recorded outside the app can also be uploaded to the platform.ByteDance is currently estimated to be worth over $100 billion./7The company's core product in China is Toutiao, which means "Headlines." Toutiao began as a mobile news recommendation engine, but has evolved into a platform to deliver content and targeted advertising in other formats as well (e.g., text messages, images, question-and-answer posts, microblogs, videos).TikTok's Recommendation EngineTikTok's appeal relies on what has been called its "addictive" video feed, For You./8The app builds this feed through a "recommendation engine" using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and data mining practices. How each user's feed is constructed had been a tightly held secret until recently. On June 18, 2020, TikTok published a blog post, "How TikTok Recommends Videos #ForYou."/9The company says its algorithm relies on a complex set of weighted factors to recommend content based on user preferences, including hashtags and videos watched; videos "liked," shared, and commented on; as well as the kind of device a person is using. Each user's feed is unique. Table 1 lists the specific factors the company says it uses.Content omitted: Table 1. "For You" Feed Factors and Elements (View table at: https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46543)According to TikTok,"[a]ll these factors are processed by our recommendation system and weighted based on their value to a user. A strong indicator of interest, such as whether a user finishes watching a longer video from beginning to end, would receive greater weight than a weak indicator, such as whether the video's viewer and creator are both in the same country. Videos are then ranked to determine the likelihood of a user's interest in a piece of content, and delivered to each unique For You feed."The blog post was seen by most as an effort to provide more transparency to the public as the U.S. government was increasing its scrutiny of the company's practices./10Data Collection, Storage, and Sharing by TikTokCritics, as well as some members of Congress, cite as problematic the amount of data that TikTok collects from and about its users, how that data is stored, and how it could potentially be shared with the Chinese government and used in influence campaigns/11 or against U.S. citizens./12Based on these concerns, both the Democratic and Republican national committees, the Department of Defense, and some private firms, such as Wells Fargo Inc., have banned or discouraged the use of the TikTok app./13Data CollectionAccording to its privacy policy,/14 TikTok collects a range of user information, including location data and internet address, keystroke patterns, and the type of device being used to access the app. The app also collects and stores a user's browsing and search history within the app, as well as the content of any messages exchanged using the app. Additional information can be collected based on user permission: phone number, phone book, and social-network contacts; GPS data; user age; user-generated content (e.g., photos and videos); store payment information; and the videos "liked," shared, watched all the way through, and re-watched. TikTok states that the app collects less personal data than many other apps, such as Facebook and Google, both of which track user activity across devices (TikTok claims that it does not)./15The data that TikTok collects from users appears in many regards to be comparable to what other social media companies gather and use./16Some critics have described TikTok's approach to data mining as aggressive/17 and that its ability to track user behavior while using the app, as well as access to a user's photos, videos, and phone book and geolocation tracking (based on user permissions), means that it can build extremely detailed behavioral profiles of its users that could potentially be shared with the Chinese government./18On August 11, 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported that TikTok avoided privacy safeguards in Google's Android operating system to collect users' mobile device MAC addresses, unique identifiers that allow "the app to track users online," and concealed this activity with an additional layer of encryption before ending the practice after 15 months in November 2019./19Data StorageTikTok claims to store all content created by U.S. users--as well as data about those users--only on servers located within the United States and backed up in Singapore. Those servers are owned or controlled by TikTok, but the company denies that it shares or would share this data with the Chinese government,/20 stating that"The key personnel responsible for TikTok ... are all Americans based in the United States--and therefore are not subject to Chinese law. U.S. content moderation is likewise led by a U.S.-based team and operates independently from China, and, as noted above, the TikTok application stores U.S. user data on servers located in the United States and Singapore."/21Data SharingDespite these assertions, TikTok's website says that information can be shared with its parent company in China or other affiliates (usually advertisers), which operate under Chinese law./22Further, a lawsuit filed in federal court in December 2019 asserted that user data was harvested and sent to servers in China./23White House TikTok Executive OrdersPresident Trump has issued two Executive Orders affecting the future of TikTok in the United States, one on August 6, 2020 (E.O. 13942), and another on August 14, 2020 (No number assigned).Prohibiting Transactions with ByteDanceThe August 6, 2020, E.O. 13942 had been set to take effect on September 20, 2020, but that date was extended. The order does not state which specific transactions would be prohibited, but it would likely result in the removal of the TikTok app from Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store in the United States. It could also make it illegal for U.S. companies to purchase advertising on TikTok. Some U.S. TikTok employees have speculated that they would no longer be able to be paid.TikTok Creators LawsuitOn September 18, 2020, TikTok creators Douglas Marland, Cosette Rinab, and Alec Chambers ("plaintiffs") filed a motion to prevent implementation of E.O. 13942. TikTok is suing separately to block its app from being banned, but this lawsuit is based on plaintiffs' assertion that the ban would prevent them from earning a living. The motion was amended by plaintiffs on October 1, 2020. On October 30, 2020, a federal judge in Pennsylvania granted a preliminary injunction against a series of bans by the U.S. Department of Commerce (DoC) that had been set to go into effect on November 12, 2020. Although TikTok is suing to block its app from being banned, this ruling is from a lawsuit brought by three TikTok creators who worried the ban would prevent them from earning a living. The judge agreed that the videos constitute "informational materials," which are protected by law. On November 12, 2020, the DoC stated that it would comply with the injunction. On November 10, 2020, TikTok filed a petition in the U.S. Court of Appeals asking for a review of actions by CFIUS because the company hadn't heard from the committee in weeks.Requiring Divestiture of ByteDance from TikTokOn August 14, 2020, President Trump issued an additional Executive Order, "Regarding the Acquisition of Musical.ly by ByteDance Ltd.,"/24 that imposed additional conditions on the ability of ByteDance to operate TikTok in the United States. The order requires ByteDance and its "subsidiaries, affiliates, and Chinese shareholders" to divest from "any tangible or intangible assets or property, wherever located, used to enable or support ByteDance's operation of the TikTok application in the United States" as determined by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)./25The order also requires ByteDance to destroy all data obtained or derived from either the TikTok or Music.ly apps from U.S. users upon divestiture and certify in writing to CFIUS that it has done so. The order requires these actions within 90 days (November 12, 2020), rather than the 45 days included in the first order, giving ByteDance additional time to find a buyer./26A transfer of ownership and operation of TikTok to a U.S. entity not subject to Chinese laws, including management of collected user data, appears designed to limit the ability of the Chinese government to acquire access to future U.S. user data.ByteDance Lawsuit Against Order to DivestByteDance opposed divestiture from TikTok and, on August 24, 2020, sued the Trump Administration./27In a blog post, TikTok stated that it was "shocked by the recent Executive Order, which was issued without any due process."/28On September 27, 2020, Judge Carl J. Nichols of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration order. He stated that while President Trump has broad authority to prohibit business transactions with foreign entities that are deemed to pose a national security risk, TikTok appears to be exempt from such a prohibition because it is a personal communication service, which is protected by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.China's Cybersecurity Law and Export RulesThe Cybersecurity Law of the People's Republic of China was passed in November 2016 and went into effect in June 2017. It was updated in November 2018 by the Regulations on Internet Security Supervision and Inspection by Public Security Organs. These laws -* strictly control online activities;* mandate the local storage of user data and the registration of certain network assets; and* allow the government to conduct onsite and remote inspection of computer networks./29The law requires Chinese companies to cooperate with government intelligence operations if so requested/30 and may allow the Chinese government access to user data collected by any company doing business in China. One analyst notes that "by demanding access to any data collected and stored in China, the updated regulations force [domestic and] foreign companies based in China to comply with its investigative measures, leaving intellectual property and private information vulnerable to government abuse."/31On August 31, 2020, China took specific action that could prohibit the sale of TikTok's underlying technology and processes. The new export regulations cover such technologies as "text analysis, content recommendation, speech modeling, and voice recognition."/32Since the For You feed and algorithmic recommendation engine is considered the key element of TikTok's success, a ban on transferring the technology and processes used to create it could make it more difficult to sell the app or prevent a sale altogether./33Status of Potential Oracle and Walmart Partnership with TikTokIn response to the TikTok Executive Order, two leading bidders emerged as potential buyers of the app: Oracle and a partnership between Microsoft and Walmart. Bids were reported to be in the range of $20 billion to $30 billion./34Twitter and Google were also rumored to be interested in acquiring the app./35On September 13, 2020, Microsoft announced that its bid had been rejected by ByteDance. In its announcement, the company stated, "We would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combating disinformation." One expert, Alex Stamos, Director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, commented that this statement is "an attempt to poison the well against an Oracle deal where they only take over hosting. And [Microsoft] is right to do so."/36On September 14, 2020, Oracle announced that it had reached an agreement with ByteDance to "serve as [the company's] trusted technology provider" in the United States. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that he had received the proposal./37From the terminology used, it appears that the deal may involve a partnership rather than a sale, with TikTok using Oracle's cloud hosting services./38This arrangement would keep the source code of the For You feed and algorithmic recommendation engine in the hands of ByteDance. Secretary Mnuchin said that CFIUS will review the proposal and present President Trump with its opinion.On September 19, 2020, Oracle announced that Walmart would join its bid for TikTok, with the two companies acquiring 20% of a newly formed company, TikTok Global,/39 with the remaining 80% owned by ByteDance. According to announcements made by the companies, 40% of ByteDance is owned by U.S. investors, which is meant to indicate that the new company would be under majority U.S. ownership./40However, this arrangement, along with TikTok keeping the For You recommendation engine algorithm,/41 would not appear to satisfy conditions in President Trump's Executive Orders. In addition to U.S. approval of the proposal being uncertain given its provisions, Chinese approval of the proposal is also uncertain. China's new export regulations appear to forbid transfer of the For You algorithm, but the United States appears to require such a transfer. So, the legal requirements of each country are at odds with each other.On September 23, 2020, TikTok filed for, and was granted, an injunction in federal court to stop the ban on the app that was set to take effect on September 27, 2020. TikTok has now been granted an extension until November 27, 2020, to persuade the U.S. government to approve the deal with Oracle and Walmart.DiscussionSome believe TikTok and other apps developed and owned by Chinese companies pose a serious security risk to the United States because Chinese companies are governed by China's Cybersecurity Law. Others believe that TikTok is caught up in increasing trade tensions between China and the United States./42Threat to SecurityAlthough TikTok forcefully states that it does not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government, many security and privacy advocates are skeptical. For example, in addition to the lawsuit cited above (see "Data Sharing"), the American Civil Liberties Union argues that "Chinese apps in particular have a reputation for grabbing more data than required to provide their services, often sending information to advertising networks ... [they] are frequently far more abusive than others...."/43The Chinese government obtains data about and created by its own citizens, for purposes that range from censorship to mass surveillance./44Other countries have also taken action against TikTok on the grounds of security. India banned TikTok and 50 other Chinese apps in June 2020, calling them a "threat to sovereignty and integrity."/45Also in June 2020, the European Union opened an investigation into TikTok to examine possible violations of its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)./46Australia had threatened to ban the app, but on August 4, 2020, the country's Prime Minister indicated that TikTok would not be banned; however, he warned Australians against the app, saying it "connects right back to China."/47Japan, Turkey, and Pakistan48 have also taken various measures to protect their countries' users from possibly security risks./49Technology Trade ProtectionismOther observers argue that TikTok is caught in "the crosshairs of a global technology battle," /50 and that a unilateral U.S. ban on any app may be comparable to China's "Great Firewall." /51One way to potentially understand U.S. and Chinese government actions in this dispute may be through the concept of techno-nationalism,/52 which refers to a country's refusal or reluctance to import other countries' advanced technology, as well as to export, or to allow other nations to benefit from, its own advanced technology. Within this framework, technology is considered a central pillar of a country's wellbeing:"Techno-nationalism ... links technological innovation and capabilities directly to a nation's national security, economic prosperity, and social stability.... [It] seeks to attain competitive advantage for its stakeholders, both locally and globally, and leverage these advantages for geopolitical gain."/53One policy mechanism that nations use to protect what they view as important or sensitive technologies are export controls, rules which limit to which foreign entities and under what circumstances or conditions specific technologies may be sold or licensed./54For example, in August 2020, the Bureau of Industry and Security at the Department of Commerce announced sanctions that restrict foreign semiconductor companies from selling chips developed or produced using U.S. software or technology to Huawei, another Chinese company, without first obtaining a license to do so./55This restriction has been called a "lethal blow" /56 to the company.Another mechanism is the use of protectionist practices that privilege domestic entities' access to domestic markets. For example, China requires U.S. telecommunications companies to enter into a partnership with a Chinese company to provide services in that country. In June 2020, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations issued a report, "Threats to US Networks: Oversight of Chinese Government Owned Carriers." The report notes that while China has access to the U.S. telecommunications market, U.S. companies do not have that same level of access in China."China does not provide US telecommunications companies reciprocal access to the Chinese market and requires foreign carriers seeking to operate in China to enter into joint ventures with Chinese companies. These joint ventures often require U.S. companies to give their technology, proprietary know-how, and intellectual property to their Chinese partners."Since China was allowed to join the World Trade Organization in 2001, the report notes that "not a single foreign firm has succeeded in establishing a new joint venture" to provide basic telecommunications services in China."Related Congressional ActivityCongress began taking an interest in TikTok as early as October 2019, when Senator Marco Rubio reportedly called for a formal investigation into whether TikTok posed a national security risk./57Later that month, Senators Charles Schumer and Tom Cotton sent a letter/58 to the Acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, expressing their concerns about TikTok and the national security risks they believe it poses. More formally, Congress has scrutinized TikTok in two hearings, and Members have introduced three related bills.HearingsThe Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism has held two hearings on, among other topics, the impact of Chinese smartphone apps on U.S. citizens' privacy:* "How Corporations and Big Tech Leave Our Data Exposed to Criminals, China, and Other Bad Actors" was held on November 5, 2019./59* "Dangerous Partners: Big Tech and Beijing" was held on March 4, 2020./60TikTok was invited to testify at these hearings, but declined to appear./61LegislationThree bills have been introduced that would prohibit the use of TikTok and WeChat on U.S.government devices:* S. 445262 is a bill to prohibit federal employees from downloading or using WeChat on government devices. It was introduced on August 5, 2020, by Senator John Kennedy and referred to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs the same day.* S. 3455,/63 the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, was introduced on March 12, 2020, by Senator Josh Hawley. This bill was passed by the Senate on August 6, 2020, and received in the House the following day. (See S.Rept. 116-250./64)* H.R. 6896,/65 also called the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, is the House companion bill to S. 3455. It was introduced on May 15, 2020, by Representative Ken Buck and referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform and the House Committee on Administration the same day.ConclusionThe variety of apps available to U.S. users is enormous. Situations similar to the case of TikTok may arise in the future with other apps created by foreign companies. Congress may consider taking one or both of two parallel approaches to address such situations: (1) developing an overarching legal and regulatory framework to protect the security and privacy of U.S. citizens' data and communications, and (2) establishing a uniform, transparent process to assess the risks posed by foreign apps and establish mechanisms to mediate those risks.* * *REPORT, TABLE, FOOTNOTES and APPENDIX: https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46543[Category: CRSCRS]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7317385 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 8, 2020End of Document

Europe and China, an inescapable relationshipCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 30, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1137 wordsBodyBeijing/Brussels, Dec 30 (EFE).- The investment agreement between the European Union and China is a milestone in relations between the two economic powers and a strategic movement on the global geopolitical board in the midst of a transition period in the United States between Donald Trump's administration and Joe Biden's.Both blocs were very interested in closing seven years of negotiation before the end of this year, especially the Chinese, who have led to the final push with concessions on social aspects that Europe has welcomed, as a icing on Angela Merkel's six-monthly Council of Germany presidency.The pact, as China wanted above all, arrives before Biden assumes the presidency, predictably on January 20.Beijing struggled in 2020 - especially since last spring, when Trump began blaming China for the covid pandemic and redoubled sanctions on its tech giants - in improving its relations with Europe and seeking an ally in the face of what might happen in the November US election.If Trump revalidated the presidency, the continuation of the confrontation in every camp with the US, which was already talking about "new cold war," was inevitable.But also if Biden won, as it finally happened, the danger of the Democrat trying to form an "anti-China" alliance with Europe, something clearly unworkable with the Republican, was of great concern in Zhongnanhai, the seat of the Chinese government.CHINA, EUROPE'S AWKWARD FRIENDFor the European Union, China is a partner with which to collaborate and negotiate, an economic competitor and a systemic rival. It is the literal definition that appears in a 2019 strategic communication from the EU External Action Service, and which the investment agreement agreed by Brussels and Beijing once again highlights.For Brussels, it is uncomfortable to strengthen ties with a country that departs from the democratic values that the EU uses as a diplomatic banner and at the same time a state that disputes its areas of influence.EU High Representative for Foreign Policy Josep Borrell recently noted in an interview with Efe that China is threatening to displace the EU in Latin America.But at the same time, Brussels finds it impossible to live with its back to the great emerging power, the second largest economy on the planet, with a population of almost 1.4 billion and around 15% of world GDP.Between the US, China and the EU, more than half of the world's economy is added up. And since Washington, Biden's transition team has publicly affrated Brussels for a lack of "early consultations" about "common concerns about China's economic practices."But in Brussels they say they have sent "signals" to the future US administration, although it cannot enter into formal relations with foreign powers until the inauguration."It is a positive contribution to transatlantic cooperation," explains a European source close to negotiation, which stresses that the pact is much less ambitious than a free trade agreement and does not address issues such as overcapacity in sectors such as steel, the impact of foreign subsidies or public tenders, chapters in which Brussels hopes to work together with the US and Japan.Beyond transatlantic gestures, the relationship with China recurrently provokes reactions found within the EU, with countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands, at the spearhead of social demands to the Asian giant, Italy as Beijing's great European partner on the New Silk Routes and frequent criticism in the Eurochamber."Parliament strongly condemns the Chinese government-led system of forced labour, in particular theexploitation of Uighurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and other Muslim minority groups," said a resolution adopted just two weeks ago in the European Chamber, with 604 votes in favour, 20 against and 57 abstentions.EUROPE, VITAL FOR BEIJINGFaced with the first trade war, then technological and after sanctions on Chinese officials and near-daily disqualifications unsealed by Trump, China has made every effort this year to approach Europe.Foreign Minister Wang Yi embarked on a late August tour of Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands with the intention of convincing major EU countries of the need to close the investment agreement in order to move forward in other areas.The Chinese chancellery has considered the treaty the "most important" on the agenda in Beijing-Brussels relations, and the vice-president of the Asian giant advanced as early as July, which would be signed before the end of the year.Europe has become China's second trading partner this year after Southeast Asian countries, and the strong presence of large German and other European industries in the country is critical for both.But the agreement is also a clear counterpoint to the dynamics of confrontation with the US in which the Asian giant has been involved this year and a commitment to protectionism and multilateralism, so advocated by Beijing.China appears to have finally ceded to some key EU claims, such as committing to ratify international conventions against forced labour or allowing European companies access to their market under conditions similar to those enjoyed by Chinese companies on the Old Continent.And it has managed to overcome strong oppositions to the treaty, both between the Twenty-Seven and outside its borders, by prevailing other arguments on political differences on issues such as Xinjiang or Hong Kong or on the human rights situation in the Asian nation.Beijing ends the year of the pandemic with the closure of two major key agreements, of which Washington has been left out: that of the EU and that of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the world's most important free trade agreement in terms of gross domestic product (GDP), signed last November.DOOMED TO BE UNDERSTOOD IN A MULTIPOLAR WORLDChina and the EU are not understood on many issues but are doomed to do so in many others within the multipolar world that is making their way with China's rise and whose challenges will be accentuated after the pandemic.As Trump retreated his country from international consensuses such as the Paris Agreement or the Iranian nuclear pact, the European Union and China approached multilateral issues, such as the inplaceable fight against climate change.The signing of the agreement between Brussels and Beijing also coincides with that of brexit, which clears the way for a complicated process for the EU, riddled with obstacles."We can finally leave Brexit behind and the European Union can move forward," said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, in announcing last Christmas Eve the agreement on the future relationship with the UK, speaking on behalf of an EU that does not hide its cravings for more geopolitical and strategic weight on the planet. Javier Garcia and Javier AlbisuLoad-Date: December 31, 2020End of Document

CORTEZ MASTO, PORTMAN INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO STUDY CHINESE GOVERNMENT'S INFLUENCE ON TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS SETTINGStates News ServiceNovember 18, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 460 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto:U.S. Senators Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio) introduced the bipartisan Ensuring American Leadership over International Standards Act to study the impact of the Chinese government's influence in setting global standards for emerging technologies."Nevada is a hub for technology development, and ensuring the United States leads the setting of international standards for emerging technologies will help keep the Silver State on the cutting edge of everything from 5G to artificial intelligence," said Senator Cortez Masto. "Setting international technology standards must be done in a transparent and democratic manner, and this legislation will help ensure the Chinese government isn't exerting undue influence on the process.""Standards setting is an important frontier in the development of artificial intelligence," said Senator Portman . "American competitiveness with respect to China's technonationalist pursuit of dominance in emerging technology requires the United States to prioritize integrity and transparency in international standards setting, and I urge my colleagues to support this common-sense bipartisan legislation."BACKGROUND :The development and deployment of advanced technologies will shape the global economy and national security landscape over the coming decades. It is vital that the United States continues to lead the global standard setting process to ensure the functionality, operability, and safety of emerging technologies. The Ensuring American Leadership over International Standards Act would direct the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to commission a study on the impact of the Chinese government's influence in setting global standards for emerging technologies and would provide feedback on how the United States and our global allies can continue to ensure that international standards setting continues in a transparent and democratic manner. Similar legislation was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Representatives David Schweikert (R-Ariz.-06), Ami Bera (D-Calif.-07), and Denver Riggleman (R-Va.-05) and included in the House version of the FY21 National Defense Authorization Act.Senators Cortez Masto and Portman have also introduced the bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act to strengthen the security and integrity of United States scientific and research enterprise. Senator Cortez Masto also introduced bipartisan legislation to fund research into ways of detecting "deepfakes," online videos that are manipulated to realistically mimic a person's identity, to raise awareness and determine ways to combat the rising threat of this technology.###Load-Date: November 18, 2020End of Document

International Federation of Journalists: China - Chinese Journalist and Filmmaker DetainedTargeted News ServiceDecember 22, 2020 Tuesday 8:21 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 438 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BRUSSELS, Belgium BodyThe International Federation of Journalists issued the following news release:Chinese journalist and filmmaker Du Bin has been detained by authorities for allegedly "picking quarrels and provoking trouble" on December 16. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) calls on the Chinese government to release Du immediately and respect Chinese citizens' right to freedom of expression.Du, 48, is a Chinese documentary filmmaker and journalist who has previously worked for The New York Times as a freelance photographer. According to Du's sister Du Jirong, Du was arrested and detained by Beijing police on December 16 over vague allegations he was 'picking quarrels and provoking trouble'.The journalist's detention may have been linked to his recent writing, including a book on the rule of Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin scheduled for publication in 2021. According to South China Morning Post, Du has been under scrutiny from the Chinese Communist Party for writing and editing a number of politically sensitive books, such as a documentation of the Tiananmen Square Massacre in 1989.The police have recently summoned Du for questioning on multiple occasions, during which he was asked to delete sensitive contents on his Twitter account, according to Weiquanwang, a website tracking detentions and persecution of activists and dissidents in China, as well as Voice of America. Authorities have also inquired about his book projects, the reports said.Violations of press freedom and journalists' rights have increased in China in recent years as authorities continue to expand their control over the media. A number of citizen journalists were detained for their coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic in China during 2020, while about a dozen foreign journalists have been expelled, partly due to the ongoing tension between the United States and China.Last week, the IFJ documented the arrest of Haze Fan, a staff member who has been at the Bloomberg News Beijing bureau since 2017, on suspicion of taking part in activities endangering national security. In August, Cheng Lei, a Chinese-born Australian journalist who had worked in the English service of the state run television CGTN, was detained by the Chinese government for the same accusation leveled against Fan.The IFJ said: "The vague and unjustified allegations against Du are often used by Chinese authorities to crack down on activists and citizen journalists. IFJ calls for Du's immediate release and urges authorities to cease their suppression of press freedom and journalist independence."[Category: Media]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7333918 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 22, 2020End of Document

Conspiracies and coronavirus: how the false story of a former adviser to Donald Trump and a Chinese billionaire was publishedCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 2, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 3106 wordsBodyDr. Li-Meng Yan wanted to remain anonymous. We were in mid-January, and Hong Kong researcher Yan had heard rumors about a dangerous new virus in mainland China that the government disqualified. Frightened by her personal safety and career, she made contact with her favorite Chinese presenter on YouTube, known for criticizing that country's government.Within days, the presenter told his 100,000 followers that the coronavirus had been purposely released by the Chinese Communist Party. He had not wanted to appoint the informant, he said, because officials in the Asian country could make that person "disappear."By September, Dr. Yan had abandoned all caution. It appeared in the United States by Fox News declaring without foundation to millions of people that coronavirus was a biological weapon manufactured by China.Overnight Yan became a media sensation for the right, with top advisers to US President Donald Trump and conservative experts hailing her as heroin. Almost just as quickly, her interview was tagged on social media with the warning that it contained "false information," while various scientists rejected her research as controversial and disguised as technical jargon.Yan's evolution was the product of a collaboration between two distinct but increasingly allied groups that disseminate misinformation: a small but active sector of the Chinese diaspora and the very influential far right of the United States.Each of them saw in the pandemic an opportunity to carry out their agenda. As for the Chinese in diaspora, Dr. Yan and her unfounded claims provided a club to those trying to bring down the Beijing government. In the case of U.S. conservatives, they bet on growing anti-Chinese sentiment and drew attention to the Trump administration's clumsy handling of the viral outbreak.Cover-up and suspicionBoth sides took advantage of a shortage of information from China, where the government has refused to share samples of the virus and resisted transparent and independent investigation. Its initial cover-up of the outbreak has further fueled suspicions about the origins of the plague.A strong set of evidence shows that the virus almost certainly originated in an animal, most likely a bat, before evolving to make the leap to humans. Although U.S. intelligence agencies have not ruled out the possibility of a leak in some lab, they have also found no evidence so far to support that theory.Dr. Yan's career was carefully designed by Guo Wengui, a fugitive Chinese billionaire, and Stephen K. Bannon,former adviser to President Trump.They put the investigator on a plane to the United States, gave her a place to stay, trained her for her media appearances, and helped her get interviews with popular conservative television presenters like Tucker Carlson and Lou Dobbs, who have shows on Fox. Guo Wengui and Bannon fueled her seemingly deep belief that the virus had been genetically created and accepted without criticism what she provided as evidence."From day one I said there are no conspiracies," Bannon said in an interview. "But there are no coincidences either." He also stressed that, unlike Dr. Yan, she did not believe that the Chinese government "did this on purpose." But he did promote the theory of an accidental escape in a risky investigation oflaboratory and attempted to put together a debate about the origins of the new coronavirus."Dr. Yan's voice is small, but at least it's a voice," Bannon said.Rumors and few reliable sourcesThe media they publish for the Chinese diaspora - a tangle of independent websites, YouTube channels, and anti-Beijing-leaning Twitter accounts - have formed a fast-growing echo camera for false information. With few reliable Chinese news sources to check the facts, rumors can quickly consolidate into a distorted reality. They are increasingly nurtured and at the same time fed by the Far Right American media.Wang Dinggang, the YouTube host who was contacted by Dr. Yan and is an associate close to Guo Wengui, appears to have been the first to sow rumors related to Hunter Biden, son of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. A Guo-owned website amplified unfounded claims about Hunter Biden's involvement in child abuse conspiracy that were collected by the Infowars.com conspiracy theories site and other U.S. marginal media outlets Steve Bannon, Wang Dinggang and Guo now promote the false idea that the presidential election was digitized.Large technology companies have begun to set more limits, with Facebook and Twitter trying to improve content surveillance. Twitter permanently banned one of Bannon's accounts for violating its rules on exaltation of violence when he suggested in his podcast that the heads of FBI director and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's leading expert on infectious diseases, should be placed in spades.But that massive notoriety has done nothing but strengthen his anti-establisment credentials. Since January, Wang Dinggang's following on YouTube has almost doubled. Traffic from two of Guo's websites soared to more than 135 million views last month, against less than five million it had last December, according to online data provider SimilarWeb. Many conservatives who claim that Facebook and Twitter censor the voices on the right are also mass-turning to new social media platforms like Parler, with a clear penchant for Trump, a right-winger, and with numerous Saudi nationalist users. Dr. Yan, Mr. Wang and Mr. Guo have already joined them.Through representatives of Bannon and Guo, Dr. Yan rejected multiple interview requests. Another so-called Wang Dinggang alluded to The New York Times' "reputation for fake news."In a statement sent through a lawyer, Guo Wengui said that he had only "encouraged" Dr. Yan's effort "to rise up against the Chinese PC Mafia and tell the world the truth about the Covid-19.""It would gladly help others who seek to tell the truth to the world," he said.At the beginning of the New Year, Wang Dinggang did what he does best: attack the PCCh on YouTube. He charged against China's crackdown on Muslims and pontiffed the U.S. trade war.The outbreak in Wuhan and the onset of the pandemicThen, on January 19, he suddenly jumped into the emerging outbreak in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. It was at the beginning of the crisis, before the city was confined, before China revealed that the virus was spreading among people, before the world paid attention.In an 80-minute program dedicated to an un nameless informant, Wang said he had listened to the world's "leading coronavirus expert," who had told him that China was not being transparent. "I think this is very believable, and veryterrifying, " he opined.Dinggam Wang, who was a businessman in China before moving to the United States for unknown reasons, is part of a growing group of commentators emerging on the Chinese-speaking Internet. His programs, which mix erudition, serious analysis and cheeky rumors, target a diaspora community that often does not rely on Chinese state media and has few reliable news sources in its native language.Since starting his show several years ago, Wang, which broadcasts under the name Lu De, has emerged as one of the most popular personalities of the genre, partly because of his adherence to outlandish theories. He has accused Chinese officials of using "sex and seduction" to catch his enemies and has urged his audience to accumulate food in preparation for the fall of the Communist Party.His January show about the un named informant combined the same elements of reality and fiction. Wang said her source, who was later revealed to be Dr. Yan, was an expert, but exaggerated her credentials a lot.Li-Meng Yan had studied the flu before the outbreak, but not the coronaviruses. Indeed, she worked in one of the best virology laboratories in the world, at the University of Hong Kong, but she was quite new to the field and was hired for her experience with laboratory animals, according to two people employed by the university who knew her. He helped investigate the new epidemic, but was not in charge of overseeing the project.The episode caught the attention of Steve Bannon, who said he began to worry about the virus when China began its confinement. Someone, Bannon didn't say who, highlighted the show and translated it.Fleeing to the United StatesMonths later, Wang Dinggang suddenly told Dr. Yan to flee Hong Kong for her own safety, she explained in later broadcasts. Guo Wengui, her main sponsor, paid the expenses for her to fly first class, Wang added.On April 28, the doctor quietly left for the airport. Her family and friends panicked when they were unable to locate her, according to Jean-Marc Cavaillon, a retired professor of immunology at the Pasteur Institute in Paris who has known Yan since 2017. A missing persons complaint was filed in Hong Kong.Two weeks later, Li-Meng reappeared in the United States."I'm currently in New York, very safe and relaxed," with the "best bodyguards and lawyers," Yan wrote in the Chinese wechat app, which the New York Times was able to see in a screenshot. "What I do now is help everyone take control of the pandemic."Transformation for the mediaAfter Yan arrived in the United States, Bannon, Guo, and his allies immediately set out to pack her up as an informant who could sell it to the American public.She was set up in a "safe house" on the outskirts of New York City and hired lawyers, Bannon said. He was found by a media coach, as English is not his mother tongue. The former White House strata also asked him to submit several documents to summarize his alleged evidence, as later expressed by Dr. Yan."Make sure you can guide people through all this in logical terms," Bannon recalls.He and Guo have taken part for years in a mission to, as they both say, bring down the Chinese Communist Party.Guo Wengui, who also called himself Miles Kwok, was in China a real estate tycoon linked to senior party officials until he fled the country some five years ago under the shadow of corruption allegations.Since then he has characterized himself as a freedom fighter, although many are skeptical of his motivations.Steve Bannon, who patrolled the South China Sea as a young naval officer, has long focused much of his energy on China. During his time at the White House, he advised Donald Trump to take a tough approach to that country that he has described as "the greatest existential threat the United States has ever faced."Guo's deep pockets and Bannon's extensive network provided them with an influential platform. Both men set up a $100 million fund to investigate corruption in China. They disseminated conspiracy theories about the accidental death of a Chinese tycoon in France, calling him a false suicide orchestrated by Beijng.At the end of January, the two were highly concentrated in the outbreak in China.Bannon oriented his podcast to the coronavirus. He called it "the PCCh virus" long before Trump started using xenophobic names for the pandemic. He invited fierce critics from China to his program to discuss how the outbreak exemplified the global threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party.Guo began to claim that the virus was an attack ordered by China's vice president. He circulated the same statement throughout his media chain, which includes the GTV digital entertainment network, a video platform and GNews, a site featuring glowing coverage of Guo Wengui and his associates. Guo released a song called "Take Down the CCP" (something like, Let's take down the PCCh) that briefly appeared at the top of Apple's iTunes world list.The two men continued to target the Chinese government even as they struggled with their own legal problems. Guo is reportedly being investigated by U.S. federal authorities because of fundraising tactics at his media company. Bannon, who was arrested in August on the Guo yacht, faces fraud charges by a nonprofit organization that helped set up to build a wall along the Mexican border.They both found Dr. Yan an ideal face for her campaign.Yan first revealed his identity on July 10 in a 13-minute interview on the Fox News website. He said the Chinese government had concealed evidence of the transmission of the virus among humans. He accused, without evidence, the professors at the University of Hong Kong of assisting in the cover-up. (The university quickly rejected their accusations and called them "rumors.") "The reason I came to the U.S. is to convey the message of the Covid-19 truth," he said.He didn't mention Guo or Bannon, by agreed decision."Don't bond with Bannon, don't bond with Guo Wengui," Guo told him on his own show. "If you mentioned us, American left-wing extremists would attack you and say yours are political interests." After the first interview on Fox, the doctor embarked on a lightning right-wing media tour, echoing conservative topics of debate. He stated that he was taking hydroxychloroquine to protect himself from the virus, even though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had warned that the drug was not effective. He suggested that the World Health Organization had helped cover up the outbreak.These interviews were amplified by social media proclaiming loyalty to Guo. Dr. Yan's appearances were translated into Chinese, then numerous versions were posted on YouTube and posts prepared in other pro-Guo accounts were retwumed.Some of the accounts have tens of thousandsof followers, of a dubious nature. Many have multiple indicators of what has been callednautintic behavior, according to an analysis by First Draft, a non-profit organization that studies misinformation. The analysis of this organization found that these accounts were created in the last two years, lack referencing photos and have usernames that are a mix of letters and numbers.Collectively, followers generated an online boost for the conservative media world, which in turn revitalized pro-Guo accounts. "The two select and re-feed each other," said Anne Kruger, director of first draft for Asia-Pacific.The virus, a gun?In early September, Yan met with Dr. Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease expert at Georgetown University who had raised the possibility that the virus would be the product of a laboratory experiment. Dr. Lucey said Dr. Yan's associates who organized the meeting wanted to find a credible scientist to support the Chinese researcher's claims. "That was the only reason I was summoned," he said.For more than four hours, Dr. Yan referred to her background and research while one of her associates, whom Dr. Lucey refused to identify, entered and eagerly exited the meeting room. Lucey argues that Yan seemed to genuinely believe that the virus had been turned into a weapon, but had difficulty explaining why.Finally, the associate asked Dr. Lucey if he thought Dr. Yan had a "smoking gun." When Lucey said no, the meeting ended abruptly.Days later, Yan divulged a 26-page research work that she said had proved the virus had been manufactured. The paper quickly spread on the Internet.The document, which was not peer-reviewed by the researcher or published in a scientific journal, was uploaded to an open-access online file. It was endorsed by two non-profit organizations funded by Guo Wengui. The other three co-authors of the paper were pseudonyms for safety reasons, according to Bannon.Specialized virologists quickly dismissed the document as "pseudoscience"and "conjecture-based". Some were concerned that the article - full of graphics and scientific jargon, such as "unique furina spin-off site" and "RBM-hACE2 coating" - would give Yan's claims a credibility varnish."It's full of pseudoscientific terms intermingled to make them impressive but lack sustenant," says Gigi Kwik Gronvall, an immunologist at Johns Hopkins University and one of the authors of rebuttal to Dr. Yan's report.Other misinformation on the pandemic has also highlighted alleged expertise. In the Nordic spring, a 26-minute video that went viral featured a discredited American scientist accusing hospitals of exaggerating virus-related deaths. In July, another video showed people with white dusters who called the the thee "U.S. doctors" and claimed that face masks were ineffective; the video was removed by social media platforms for spreading false information.On September 15, a day after her report was published, Dr. Yan agreed to her biggest stage so far: an appearance on Fox News alongside political commentator Tucker Carlson. Carlson's popular show has frequently served as an influential megaphone for the right.Carlson asked Yan if she believed the officialsChinese had intentionally or accidentally released the virus. Dr. Yan didn't hesitate."Intentionally, of course, " he said.The clip went viral.The excerpts from that interview had at least 8.8 million views online, even though Facebook and Instagram tagged them as fake information. High-profile conservatives, including Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, shared it on Twitter. When the Reverend Evangelist Franklin Graham, a Trump supporter, posted a post by Dr. Yan on Facebook, it became the most shared link on the day of a U.S. platform account.Lou Dobbs, another Fox presenter, tweeted a video of him with a guest talking about Dr. Yan's "big case." Donald Trump retwented it.Yan welcomed an audience already prepared to listen to his arguments. A March survey found that nearly 30 percent of Americans believed the virus was most likely manufactured in a lab."Once Tucker Carlson takes someone to his program, he's no longer marginal," says Yotam Ophir, a professor at the University of Buffalo who studies misinformation. "Now it's a massive thing." Fox News declined to comment.Weeks later, Tucker Carlson said on his show that he couldn't be in favor of Dr. Yan's theories. However, she was again invited to discuss her latest statement in detail: Yan's mother, as the investigator stated, had been arrested by the Chinese government.It is common for the Chinese government to punish its critics by harassing relatives. But when The New York Times contacted Dr. Yan's mother on her mobile phone in October, the lady claimed she had never been arrested and was desperate to connect with her daughter, whom she hadn't talked to months ago.The mother refused to say more and asked not to be named, claiming fear that the doctor was being manipulated by her new allies."They're preventing our daughter from talking to us," the woman said, referring to Guo and Wang. "We want our daughter to know that she can video chat with us at any time."By Amy Qin, Vivian Wang and Danny HakimTranslation: Román García Azcárate?CBLook too       Load-Date: December 3, 2020End of Document

It includes $600 checks for many Americans, $300 a week in enhanced unemployment benefits and money for vaccine distribution. Joining me right now is Federated Hermes Chief Investment Officer Steven Auth.Also joining the conversation all morning long this morning is Payne Capital Management President, Ryan Payne and senior writer with the Wall Street Journal Jon Hilsenrath. Great to see everybody this morning. Thank you so much for being here and Stephen, let me kick it off with you. Your thoughts on this - on this package this morning, the relief package and its impact on the economy and markets today.STEPHEN AUTH, CIO, FEDERATED HERMES: Well, it's just another log on the fire here, the Yuletide fire Maria as you know we've been pretty booked. We raced our forecast to 4500 for next year. We think the real news is the vaccine coming and that's just going to unleash you know a lot of pent up spending. The economy is going to be booming next year. The year over year comparisons to last year are going to be very, very powerful.You got the Fed pedal to the metal, every central bank in the world coordinating with them and you have a kind of synchronized global recovery almost going off instantly as this vaccine rolls out in the first half of the year. It's just - it's going to dwarf everything else that's going on.The fiscal package you know keeps people going between now and then, which is a good thing and just it will add to the amount of liquidity out there, once this thing gets going so you know, I don't think the fiscal package is what this is all about frankly but it certainly another Yuletide log on the Yuletide fire.BARTIROMO: Yes. That's a - that's a really good assessment there Stephen. I'm glad you think that things get back to normal and start ramping up and with interest rates where they are, there aren't many alternatives away from stocks. I guess the only other question to ask is what about regulation?Do you expect that we'll see a different regulatory environment where that gets in the way of certain industries and gets you to look at specific groups more so than others? I mean the regulatory will change likely, right?AUTH: Right. Now is a great stimulus under President Trump is that we had you know, the deregulations going you know less choking on the economy going on in what was at the time a very stagnant recovery so yes, the important point Maria, is that on Wall Street there's mixed views on all this, right?So there's plenty of people who think Biden administration will be good for markets you know, I think a lot of folks feel that the increased regulation, the increased taxes if we get them, although it looks like we're not going to be able to get that with the government being divided as it is unless Georgia surprises us but you know that the regulations are negative for long term growth probably.It will take down our growth forecast a little bit but on the other hand, the power of this cyclical recovery next year, I think it's going to overwhelm those kind of issues right now.BARTIROMO: OK, good, that's very good news. What about Europe, Stephen, grappling with this new variant of the coronavirus? Most of the continent banning travel from the United Kingdom over this form of COVID-19 that can apparently spread more easily. You've got the EU medical regulators approving the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine but then this issue about lockdowns and this new strain in the U.K.Your thoughts on allocating money to Europe.AUTH: Well, we've been adding - we actually took ourselves back to neutral and then just last week in that pullback took us to overweight for the first time in I think three or four years in Europe. You know, they're a cyclically driven economy so they're kind of cyclical squared.And you know you're showing others just I mean the big question was does this vaccine work against the new virus and I think as the day progressed, the market began to conclude it probably does. I mean most certainly does and that's the story here. As usual the cure is probably worse than the disease.You know the lockdowns - the cat's already out of the barn here I would guess. I mean most people I think the new strains probably ready in the U.S. and in Europe so I'm not sure if the lockdowns again help all that much but the other day, what's going to help us is the vaccine and it's rolling out right now so Europe will come around and sick will be driven.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's good news. Is this GDP this morning Stephen already baked into the cake? We get the GDP out at 8:30 A. M. Look at this number that we're expecting. I recognize that this is just a complete bounce back from that sharp contraction we saw in the second quarter but expectations are for 33.1 percent read for the final, the second estimate.The final read on the GDP which is out this morning at 8:30 and this is exactly as we saw in the second estimate Stephen.AUTH: I don't think it'll affect markets much this morning Maria. You know the markets is three-quarters ahead on GDP. It's arguing about what the GDP is going to be Q2 - Q3, next year. We think it's going to be pretty good. I had a forecast for that so.BARTIROMO: All right, we like this assessment Stephen Auth, great to see you this morning. Have a very Merry Christmas and we'll see you on the other side.AUTH: OK, bye-bye.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Good to see you. Have a good day. Stephen Auth joining us there, Federated Hermes.

You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox business. Back in a moment.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Caving to the Chinese Communist Party. During a second meeting with Chinese regulators, back in November, billionaire technology tycoon Jack Ma offered "any of the platforms Ant group has as long as the country needs." That's according to the Wall Street Journal yesterday. There has been reportedly no decision by Chinese regulators to take up Ma's offer.And Ant's potential $34 billion initial public offering on the Shanghai stock exchange was skuttled directly by Chinese president Xi Jinping following the meeting. Joining me right now is Atlas organization's founder and author of 'China's vision of Victory' Jonathan Ward.And Jonathan, it's great to see this morning. We appreciate you joining me and the reason that we started with this story on the Ant group is because it's such a prime example of what has taken place. Jack Ma back in October gives a speech, criticizing Xi Jinping and his rules around financial services and then he's called to an office to speak with those securities regulators.They threatened him that they're going to pull the deal. He is forced to say well, take the company, take parts of the company. They say we're still pulling the deal and he hasn't been able to get his Ant group to go public. Your reaction to the significance of that situation.JONATHAN WARD, FOUNDER, ATLAS ORGANIZATION: Hi Maria. Good morning. Well, it shows you the nature of the relationship between Chinese companies and the Chinese state. I mean there have been people saying for so long you know Huawei you know they're not controlled by the government or you know they'd resist if the government has to do something. I mean of course not. The government has total power over these companies. I mean Jack Ma was once thought of as a very independent man in China than he was revealed to be a party member.I mean here we are seeing him under pressure, apparently offering you know pieces of his company to the CCP to aid them and of course the Chinese government has been doing everything they can to erase the lines between the private sector and the Chinese state. This is part of how they intend to do innovation. It's part of how they intend to build their military capability and that's what you're investing in when you're investing in China.And let's not forget Alibaba is the largest holding from China, the largest single piece of the MSCI emerging markets index. It's also potentially under scrutiny of Chinese firms are delisted so we have a huge problem here when people think that they're investing in Chinese private companies and they don't understand the relationship between the party and the corporation.BARTIROMO: Very, very important point that you just made. Already we know that the MSCI index, that's the Morgan Stanley Country Index as well as the FT have dropped certain Chinese companies that are tied to the military because President Trump put that in the executive order.The President signed into law this past week that foreign firms including China's must have American regulators review their financial audit in order to trade on U.S. exchanges. Additionally companies must disclose whether or not they're under government control. Jonathan, what does this mean for these Chinese companies that are traded in the United States?You just mentioned Alibaba. How is this going to play out?WARD: Well, I think we're going to learn a lot of you know darker things about Alibaba over the years as their autonomy sort of erodes as the party becomes more powerful. I mean Alibaba was already named a member of China's national champions team along with Baidu and Tencent several years ago but the Chinese ministry of science and technology, you know they're meant to focus on cloud computing and smart cities.And another you know revelation this week was that they were advertising how to track minorities in China, the Uighurs, the people who are in concentration camps in Xinjiang so again the idea that these companies are totally divorced from some of the horrible things going on in China is very misleading.And I think at the end of the day, do they belong on our exchanges? I mean only if they're in compliance and I think it's also going to be important that whatever rules go along with the SEC to delist Chinese companies should also be adopted with allies, I mean having an agreement in London so these companies simply don't go relist of another international exchange.They will wind up in Shanghai and Hong Kong and therefore have access to Global Corp to Global Capital which also means that I think I direct investment has to be you know examined by U.S. government.And at the end of the day, we have to have a very clear understanding of the ties between Chinese tech giant's and China's state along with every other strategic industry. You know place like Alibaba has a $700 billion market cap and it's basically an artificial intelligence innovation center.You can understand how that is strategically important to the Communist Party of China also has many, many party members throughout the company.BARTIROMO: Let's talk about this broadly speaking because you feel that it's really going to be the corporation that is going to be the tool that is really the most important issue in this conflict between the U.S and China.I mean look, the Chinese Communist Party has been very clear. They want to overtake the United States as the number one super power. They're doing it in whatever ways they want to do it and that includes jailing people who don't agree with that. Jimmy Lai right now a regular guest on this program is sitting in a prison in Hong Kong.We don't know if he's going to be forced to go get tried in China. We don't know if we'll ever see Jimmy Lai again. He gave us his last interview before he was arrested and now he is behind bars and that is because he spoke against the Chinese Communist Party and yet look at the other side of this story where you've got companies like JP Morgan gearing up to own out now its own its own firm in in China.Same thing with UBS has its own firm in ownership in China. Goldman Sachs getting ready to go and own their own securities firm there so tell me about American companies and where they stand in this conflict.WARD: I think the U.S. companies have not even begun to wake up to the problem here. You know right now they are so exposed to China risk and at the end of the day as the Chinese sort of national champions grow, I mean the Chinese companies are the basic instrument of Chinese grand strategies.How they you know build their surveillance, how they build their military capability, it's how they expand worldwide. It's going to put all of our companies in harm's way in global markets so I think our board rooms and CEOs have to begin taking the China threat seriously and at the end of the day, they have to be on the U.S. side.I mean we won the Second World War through the participation of U.S. corporations, we won the Cold War. You know they've always been a part of American grand strategy and that needs to happen again. They need to get on the right side of these issues, understand the long term threat to them. I mean the Fortune 500 is going to change entirely because of the rise of the Chinese corporations and our companies need to be ready.BARTIROMO: Yes, really good point Jonathan. We'll keep watching this and you didn't even mention civil military fusion that means the companies in China are all in with the CCP. They have to be. Jonathan Ward, great to see this morning. We'll keep watching and we'll be right back with General Jack Keane on the other side of this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: That there's an investigation I think that is being handled responsibly and professionally currently within the department and to this point, I have not seen a reason to appoint special counsel and I have no plan to do so before I leave.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: That was Attorney General Bill Barr yesterday saying that he sees no reason to appoint a special counsel to take over the federal investigation into Hunter Biden's tax affairs. He said the same thing about an investigation into voter fraud allegations as well. Barr's final day as Attorney General is tomorrow. John, your reaction to that as Joe Biden is coming in as the next president and there won't be a special counsel according to AG Barr to continue the investigation into his tax affairs.JON HILSENRATH, SENIOR WRITER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Right well, that's unless his deputy Jeffrey Rosen decides to put in the special counsel. You know so Barr is leaving in a day, right? So there still is a possibility that a special counsel will be put in place and as I understand it, the Justice Department is looking at those taxes.And so then it becomes a question of whether you trust the kind of frontline justice department officials to fairly investigate Hunter Biden's taxes and whether you trust a President Biden not to interfere and I think people will have their own opinions on that.But I don't think that this spells the end of investigations or enquiries into Hunter Biden's affairs, certainly not if the Republicans take the Senate because you can be sure that Senate committees are going to be looking at that too.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a good - that's a good point there. At this point is so much out there in terms of the deals that Hunter Biden did with Ukrainian companies. He was on the board of Burisma, making $50,000 a month. He was on the of course putting a deal together with the Chinese state owned CEFC.Here's Peter Schweitzer, investigative reporter who's done a lot on this Biden story. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The email is saying look, I need a set of keys for Joe Biden, Jill Biden, Jim Biden my uncle and the chairman of CEFC Gongwen Dong. So all of these people are sharing an office together in Washington? I mean how close can you get with the Chairman of a company tied to the CCP?PETER SCHWEITZER, PRESIDENT, GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY INSTITUTE: Yes, that's exactly right Maria and that is a great example, symbolic example of how the Bidens basically have blurred their political activities and their commercial activities, that how close and chummy they are.Some of the directors at that company have direct ties to President Xi so this is not some random Chinese company on the fringes of Chinese political life. It's at the center of it and this is the same entity upon which Joe Biden, you know the so called big guy was going to get 10 percent.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Yes, it just - it just struck me that yesterday Bill Barr comes out and says that there's no reason to do a special counsel. I think you're right Jon. We'll see what his successor does, Mr. Rosen. Ryan - Ryan, what do you think about this story?RYAN PAYNE, PRESIDENT, PAYNE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: I mean clearly here, there's a connection and I think it's just going to fall by the wayside. Obviously if you're the president, your son who's under a scrutiny, I'm hard pressed to see that this thing is going to go further but you know, what son isn't on the board of the Ukrainian company.I mean what's more common than that in that case. So you know I have a feeling this is just--BARTIROMO: What - what - what's more common than what? What more common than what? What's more common than what your son being on the board of what?PAYNE: When your son - of a Ukrainian company. I'm saying it's a very, very odd thing to have happened in general. You know you don't see that in general. It's not a very normal thing to hear or see happen so I think you know bottom line is that you know, there probably is some issues here but they're going to be kind of swept away is my opinion.BARTIROMO: Wow, well, that that would be unfortunate given the fact that the Chinese Communist Party has really managed to be successful in getting on the inside some of the most important institutions in the country. Jon Hilsenrath, the string of indictments we saw this year proves that from the Chairman of the Chemistry department at Harvard to the Houston Embassy being shut down?JON HILSENRATH, SENIOR WRITER, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Right, so -- you know, so broadly speaking, I mean, I think this issue of Chinese connections in the United States and you know, potentially the connections back to the Chinese government are going to be a big issue -- and I actually disagree with Ryan. I think in the media certainly, you know, when you look at, you know, conservative outlets, I think the Hunter Biden issue isn't going to go away for a long time. I think it's going to be with President Biden for most of his first terms.So, you know, in terms of these investigations by the Justice Department, you know, I think we have to ask ourselves what does AG Barr know and what does he not know? I mean, he's been a pretty loyal ally to the president, so why is he dismissing this now? Is it the case that he was never actually an ally to the president or is it the case that he just doesn't think there are something there. That's a question, I think we have to get our hands around.BARTIROMO: Or is it that he doesn't want to do the president any favors? He knows the president wants this special counsel, and on his way out, doesn't want to do anything additional. Look, I take issue with you saying this is not going away because it did go away during the election, right, Jon? I mean, Twitter banned the "New York Post's -- saying to all, would not report the story, most of the media except for "Fox" and a couple of stories in the "Wall Street Journal" did not report this story.So, if they want it to go away, it can go away with the media's help, don't you think? Look what happened with Twitter.HILSENRATH: But here we are still talking about it, so it hasn't gone away.BARTIROMO: Yes, well, we're not going to take the spotlight off of any wrongdoing and questionable situations where the president's son is accepting money from a Chinese company. We're going to keep talking about it and we'll look at it next hour with the ongoing China threat front and center. A new report shows that the Chinese government spied and surveilled CIA officials for years using stolen data. We're going to discuss that with General Jack Keane when we come back. And then the top trending foods in 2020, the shopping list that might surprise you making a buzz this morning. Stay with us, we'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Tuesday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, December 22nd, let's take a look at markets this morning, 6:35 a.m. on the East Coast, half hour mark, Dow Industrials down 12, the Nasdaq is up 47 and the S&P 500 right now up 4.75. Futures are mixed this morning. We are standing by for the final reading of the third-quarter GDP, expectations, 33.1 percent growth for the third quarter.This after the Dow managed to eke out a gain after an earlier selloff yesterday, the major indices were fractionally moving yesterday. Dow Industrials up 37, the Nasdaq was down 13 and the S&P was down 14 at 4 O'clock on Wall Street. European markets this morning trading like this even as the U.K. deals with a coronavirus variant that's more easily transmissible. The FTSE 100 is up 10, the CAC Quarante is up 48, the Dax Index is up 133 right now. That's better than 1 percent in Germany. In Asia overnight, red across the board, this is fractional moves pretty much across the board on the downside.Shanghai Composite, the worst performer, down about 2 percent. One of America's oldest movie studios looking to sell. Lauren Simonetti with the details now, Lauren.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Maria, good morning. So MGM is looking for a new owner with the help of Morgan Stanley and Lion Tree, that according to the "Wall Street Journal", they're hoping that their library including co-ownership of the James Bond franchise will attract buyers who want to get in on streaming. MGM reportedly has a market value of $5.5 billion including debt. Well, the SEC now taking aim at the cryptocurrency pioneer Ripple, alleging that one of its assets, XRP should have been registered with the commission and failing to do so violated investor protection laws. Ripple vowing to fight any lawsuit.Is the iCar finally here? Apple reportedly setting a deadline of 2024 to build its self-driving electric car complete with its own battery technology set to drastically reduce the cost and to increase the range. Apple's car plan code-named Project Titan has been an open secret in the automobile and tech world for years. Let's take a look at Apple shares this morning because they pack a punch up almost 3 percent, Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Lauren, thank you so much. The ongoing China threat front and center. A new report says that the Chinese government has spied and surveilled CIA officials in Africa and Europe using stolen data, they've been doing it since 2013. This report goes on to say that in some cases, the spying was so obvious some eyewitnesses think Chinese government wanted U.S. Intelligence to find out in order to disrupt CIA operations. Joining me right now is retired four-star General, Fox News senior strategic analyst General Jack Keane. General, it's great to see you this morning, thanks very much for joining us. Concerning report this morning on this stolen data used to expose CIA operators in Africa and in Europe.JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Yes, certainly, a bit of a surprise, frankly. So our viewers understand that as China's national interest began to expand the globe, and we've seen that in the last 10 years, they're moving their operatives into Africa and into Europe, so goes the Central Intelligence Agency. China is an adversary of the United States, we spy on them as they spy on us, and as they're conducting these operations, we want to be there with them to understand what it is their intent and what they're actually doing.The basis of that is largely, we recruit Chinese nationals to do this work for us or people who are local to the population who are involved in the Chinese operations in those countries. So, that is what the CIA was doing and those operatives on the ground were being exposed, and that is a shocking part of this. And the source we believe is they penetrated our nets, they penetrated our communication nets and they also stole a bunch of data. We know they like to sweep up huge amounts of data as they did of 22 million government records to include all military people as well in 2015, and as we now know, that was actually going on as early as 2012. That includes my records for example.Anybody that had any association with the military or with government service, they have those records and they've had them for a number of years. This is very aggressive, Maria, cyber operations by our adversaries is a huge form of national power, and in a non-conflict, non-war environment, when we're in the competitive zone, is what we're doing right now, we're competing against these countries. This is a major element that they use, not just to spy, but as we are painfully aware of, they steal huge amounts of intellectual property and also to influence American opinion, and to influence world opinion to their favor.Major efforts, hundreds of thousands of people in China are involved in this, not hundreds, not tens of thousands, I'm saying hundreds of thousands of people work for the PLA in conducting these very comprehensive operations.BARTIROMO: Really extraordinary stuff here, general. You've been on this program talking about their efforts in terms of their military, you say that it's the fastest-growing military in the world. We've talked about their Navy, Devin Nunes has joined me many times to talk about his investigation into their military moves whereas they've put military bases across the world, trying to control ports and water ways across the world as far as Djibouti, they have a military base. A word on that and why the military is the priority for the Chinese Communist Party?I mentioned earlier in my conversation with Jonathan Ward, civil-military fusion, which basically says anything that's created or used in the commercial sector must first be used in the military, and must first be the priority of the CCP which is the military, why? Talk about their military and their aspirations, general?KEANE: Well, as we know, we've said so many times, China wants to dominate regionally in the Indo-Pacific and dominate the world and replace the United States as the world's global leader. To achieve that, they have to achieve in their minds, economic domination, military domination and technological domination. And they're moving very hard on all of those fronts simultaneously.They right now have a larger Navy than the United States Navy quantitatively, not qualitatively. The United States has more aircraft carriers and we've got like qualitative capacity in the ships we do have. The Navy is coming forward now with a proposal to build considerable more ships than what we have, 295 is where we are. The Chinese around 355, and the Navy wants to get up into the mid-300s in terms of the number of ships.BARTIROMO: OK.KEANE: And it's a good thing. We need more ships, but -- and this is something that really has to take place in our government between the Congress and the Department of the Defense. We need to see the strategy, not just the number of ships. We need to see the operating --BARTIROMO: Yes --KEANE: Concept. How do we go about the pacing items which is the Chinese military capability, Indo-Pacific region? How are we going to deal with --BARTIROMO: Yes --KEANE: That pacing item? They have long-range missiles that can take out all of our ships. That means these big aircraft --BARTIROMO: Yes --KEANE: Carriers we have are very vulnerable. Maybe we need a different kind of aircraft --BARTIROMO: Yes --KEANE: Navy knows this. Smaller, maybe better, more wildly distributed. We have to have those discussions --BARTIROMO: Yes --KEANE: Maria.BARTIROMO: Really important point that you're making. Compare real quick, we only have a couple of seconds here, but compare the threat of Russia. Because China is the second largest economy, we've been told it is a much bigger threat. Russia is -- has the economy size of Texas, and yet we have the SolarWinds hacking last week, top U.S. agencies including the Treasury and Commerce were hit by a security breach from hackers thought to be from the Russian government. The journal is now reporting that several American businesses were breached as well, including Intel, Cisco, Deloitte, even Kent State University, general, how should the U.S. respond to this?KEANE: Well, first of all, Putin plays, you know, a weak hand very well. I mean, you're right. His economy is in the tank, only a certain percentage of his military is actually very professionalized, it's about 40 percent. But he uses it very adjointly, and he uses cyber warfare very skillfully. They have the second best capability in the world compared to the United States, and that's what we're seeing here. When we unpack this thing, it's going to take us months to figure out how extensive a penetration is that they achieve. What should we do about it? Hit them --BARTIROMO: Yes --KEANE: Hard. Hit them hard! We know who did this, we have the best offensive cyber capability. We don't need to tell the American people the details of any of that. But go after -- and I'm assuming we're either preparing to do that or we're in the process of already doing it. I also think the government should --BARTIROMO: OK --KEANE: Come forward and disclose to the American people what has happened. The American people have a right to know --BARTIROMO: Yes --KEANE: How extensive this is, and give them some assurances that we got it, we understand it --BARTIROMO: Yes --KEANE: We're going to fix it, and we're going to do something about it.BARTIROMO: All right, all really important points, general. It's always a pleasure to tap into your experience and brilliance, thank you, sir. Have a Merry Christmas and we'll see you soon --KEANE: Yes, great talking to you, Maria.BARTIROMO: General Jack Keane joining us there. Coming up, a new variant of COVID-19 putting the U.K. on severe lockdown. One medical expert weighing in next hour. But first, flying high. The founder and CEO of Blade is here, Robert Wiesenthal to discuss his company going public. That's next, don't miss it. And then the top trending foods of 2020, the shopping list that might surprise you making a buzz this morning. You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A sky-high IPO, Blade, an innovated air-taxi- booking company set to become the only publicly-traded company of its kind when it hits the Nasdaq sometime next year. The company recently struck a SPAC deal through a sale of a blank check company backed by KSL Capital. Joining me right now is Blade founder and CEO Rob Wiesenthal. Rob, it's great to see you this morning, congratulations on this news, you must be very much looking forward to going public?ROBERT WIESENTHAL, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER & FOUNDER, BLADE: A lot of work ahead, but we're very excited.BARTIROMO: Tell me how business is, Rob, I know that this has been a really tough period in terms of this pandemic. How have you handled the changes?WIESENTHAL: Well, it's been very interesting. We've noticed the creations and static suburbs, people who have now taken secondary homes and turned them into co-primary homes, commuting every day or once a week and as opposed to potentially just maybe going on weekends. It's a whole new way of dealing with cities and where people live. We now have a situation where people feel comfortable commuting up to 90 miles away for $95 or up to $195, and they may only be doing it once a week, twice a week, but if you think about the volume, it's pretty incredible because, you know, the offices are not fully yet.And in fact, in New York City, we now have a ground traffic, that's a 90 percent of pre-pandemic levels, and this is something we're going to see across the country. But what's exciting here right now is the fact that there's a radical transformation happening in ground mobility with respect to electric cars, charging stations. And we're now at an inflection point in the next battles in the air. And these new electric vertical aircraft are incredibly important because they are quiet, they omit zero carbon, they're zero-carbon emissions and they're less -- and they're cheaper. And that's something you don't see on the ground vehicles.On the ground vehicles, the fact that they are -- they're not cheaper, they are quiet but it really doesn't matter. So, those really are in value propositions. And as you know, a helicopter noise in addition to safety are so important, and these are -- this is a radical transformation that is happening in the next 2 years to 5 years, and it's going to completely change the way people travel in the air.BARTIROMO: So, I was just talking yesterday with one of your original founders and largest shareholder who is very much obviously looking forward to this. Is the thinking, Rob, that now, you'll have the scale and funding once you do this deal, the SPAC, and you will be better poised to take advantage of what you're expecting to be a boost in travel and a boost in business once we get out of this?WIESENTHAL: Yes. Morgan Stanley has viewed this market and stated publicly this is a $150 billion market in 5 years. And you have to look at this as a way, as an index play on the electrification of vertical transportation in terms of replacement for helicopters. And if you think about what is needed, we need infrastructure which we already have, we have 12 terminals in the U.S. and in India, you need that, you need technology. But we're not picking who the winner is, whether it's Airbus or Boeing or Joby or Lilium, whoever ends up winning on that equipment will end up being on the Blade platform and we'll have six years of building a brand, bringing in customers, having the infrastructure to make that a reality.For us, it's an equipment swab, we are asset, like we own no aircraft, the manufacturers and the operators come to us.BARTIROMO: Fantastic. So, tell me about the cost involved in all of this, Rob. I mean, are you going to be changing the way you allocate capital, putting different priorities in place as you anticipate what could be a big boost in business once we get out of this?WIESENTHAL: Yes, as you know, we have a strategic mode around key markets like New York City which is the largest in terms of revenues, vertical transportation market in the world. You can't fly into New York without going either through or around a Blade terminal. We need to be in a situation where we have a greater access to put in charging stations -- start charging stations, places we'll do our health and safety monitoring, security, baggage check, and we need to do this in other cities. We're right now, we are in Miami, we have access to the only rooftop heliport in California, in Los Angeles.So, you'll see a roll out of new cities, new products, lower prices which will especially come down hopefully, significantly as we make these transitions. We have Vitall(ph), and of course, expansion in Asia where India is really doing quite well.BARTIROMO: Wonderful. So, do you see differences in terms of the demand? I mean, your customers, are they looking to go to different cities? Where are you seeing the most questions and interest in as you look to expand your own portfolio in terms of cities?WIESENTHAL: Well, I think the interest again is reducing friction. In New York, we turn 2-hour drives into 5-minute flights to the airport. When travel picks up again to the airport which will inevitable will, that will be -- continue to be a huge business for us. And now we have a new business of people commuting, people who've left New York City and need to come to the city maybe once a week, maybe once every other week for a couple nights or one night, and at the prices of $95 or $195, it's achievable. And when you think about all the pent up demand and all the pent-up cash of people who weren't paying for travel or restaurants, they're ready to do it and they're starting to do it right now.We've never had a seven-day a week business like we do right now. As you know, it's often been very --BARTIROMO: Wow --WIESENTHAL: Pushed towards weekends, Fridays and Sundays, and that's something that has really changed. So we've been actually modifying our routes along with the pandemic and our customers are telling us what they want and we're delivering.BARTIROMO: And are you seeing a broadening out of your customer-base with these declines in pricing? So, if you're making it more attractive to take that trip, do you anticipate you're going to be able to expand your audience that much more? Our audience here is the highest average income in all of cable, we're proud of that and we know that part of that is they're looking at options like yours. What has happened to your clientele-base as you've dropped prices, Rob?WIESENTHAL: Well, it's interesting. Last year, we shattered the Uber black price car barrier to the airport at $195 and $95 with an airport pass. So what we're actually seeing is enterprise coming to us and saying, we need quick and efficient ways to get our passengers to the airport, sometimes at home, they have to be safe, we like your health and safety standards, we like the fact that you're allowing for enhanced physical distancing on your aircraft.So, what we're also seeing here in terms of the changes, as the price is becoming lower, the stigma of travel by helicopter which I think will be completely eliminated once we go to electric vertical aircraft has been reduced to the point where industry is interested in doing long-term deals with companies like Blade to ensure that their employees can get safely, efficiently and in a very rapid manner to and from where they need to go.BARTIROMO: Rob, real quick, do you expect a change in regulation in order to have this electrified portfolio?WIESENTHAL: Well, all this aircraft need to be certified by the FAA. And they've been in process now --BARTIROMO: Right --WIESENTHAL: For four to five years. But the regulation that's actually helpful is the fact that heliports need to be quiet. They have to be quiet, they need to be --BARTIROMO: OK --WIESENTHAL: Friendly to the communities. Our number one priority next to safety is being a good neighbor and that's critical, and now allow more places to land and more places to go. And that's how we grow a business.BARTIROMO: Robert, great to see you this morning, we'll be looking forward to your SPAC, Robert Wiesenthal joining us from Blade. We'll be right back.Load-Date: December 22, 2020End of Document

DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY WARNS AMERICAN BUSINESSES ABOUT DATA SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT FROM FIRMS LINKED TO CHINESE GOVERNMENTUS Fed NewsDecember 22, 2020 Tuesday 12:21 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 416 wordsBodyNEW ORLEANS, Dec. 22 -- The U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued the following news release:Today, the Department of Homeland Security issued a business advisory to American businesses warning of risks associated with the use of data services and equipment from firms linked to the People's Republic of China (PRC).The PRC presents a grave threat to the data security of the U.S. government and U.S. businesses. It has both the intent and ability to covertly access data directly through entities under the influence or jurisdiction of PRC laws, often without the knowledge or consent of the non-PRC businesses or institutions that maintain rights to the data."For too long, U.S. networks and data have been exposed to cyber threats based in China which are using that data to give Chinese firms an unfair competitive advantage in the global marketplace," said Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad F. Wolf. "Practices that give the PRC government unauthorized access to sensitive data - both personal and proprietary - puts the U.S. economy and businesses at direct risk for exploitation. We urge businesses to exercise caution before entering into any agreement with a PRC-linked firm."This advisory highlights the persistent and increasing risk of PRC government-sponsored data theft due to newly enacted PRC laws that can compel PRC businesses and citizens - including through academic institutions, research service providers, and investors - to take actions related to the collection, transmission, and storage of data that runs counter to principles of U.S. and international law and policy. Such activities include requiring companies to store data within PRC borders and turning over routine data to the PRC government under the pretense of national security. The advisory also highlights the PRC's history of manipulation, misuse, and exploitation of that data to serve PRC business and economic goals.Any person or entity that chooses to procure data services and equipment from PRC-linked firms, or store data on software or equipment developed by such firms, should be aware of the economic, reputational, and, in certain instances, legal, risks associated with doing business with these firms.Please find a link to the Business Advisory here (https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/20_1222_data-security-business-advisory.pdf).

Grandparents 2.0; Chinese government teaches older adults about technologyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 29, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 546 wordsBodyIn this age of new technologies, all Chinese are glued to their cell phone. All? No, many older people don't know how to use the internet, so the state now teaches classes to catch up on digital matters.At 70, Li Changming just bought himself a phone. To learn how to use it, he participates in a training organized by the authorities in his Chengdu neighborhood, a metropolis in southwestErn China."I still don't understand all the features, but I feel like knowing," he explains to the AFP. "It's never too late to learn."  In front of him, a teacher teaches him how to close an app. To do this, it adapts to its students with gray hair."It's like there's too many things in the room: you have to clean up," he says. Knowing how to use a cell phone has become vital in China, where e-commerce is gaining ground (24.3% of the total, in the third quarter) and cash is in the process of extinction. Hence the interest of the authorities to make the whole population familiar with trade the line.The paid apps of the giants WeChat and Alibaba are in all shops, even in the little ones. And in markets, it's normal to pay for a lettuce by scanning the seller's QR code.It's a matter of survival. "You can't live without a mobile,"sums up Meng Li, a sexagenary woman from Chengdu who has followed the lineup and just made her first online purchase.The authorities' objectives are also to boost consumption and encourage older people to buy. In China, by 2025 there will be 300 million retired people, virtually the population of the United States, and their purchasing power will represent more than $750 billion, according to Daxue Consulting.Although 98% of rural areas are currently connected to 4G, nearly a third of the population does not have internet access... i.e. 460 million inhabitants.That is why the Government urged in November to "strengthen the skills of the elderly" in the digital sector, through these formations.The pandemic was awakening and caused both negative and positive changes.The new coronavirus, which hit the Asian giant earlier this year, highlighted the urgency of connecting people more.  When the population of Wuhan (center), where the virus was detected at the end of the year, was confined for weeks, residents who could order their purchases remotely had far fewer trouble supplying the test.More than 36 million people first connected to the internet between March and June 2020. Since the epidemic in China, only certain technological knowledge is needed to circulate: many public places and transport require an application to be shown that assesses each person's epidemiological risks based on the contacts they have had.In Chengdu, Li Changming is ready to face the 21st century. After his class, he went to the market. He has taken out his glasses and his cell phone and bought with him some peppers, indispensable ingredient of Sichuan cuisine.Excited, he says he will now use the navigation system to go to certain places, and even put points to restaurants wherever he goes. "I have a lot to learn," he admits, though. "Knowing how to take pictures with my mobile will be my goal for the next 10 years."This is how the discovery of technological tools have made life easier for some older adults who have ventured to learn to adapt.

Wuhan doctors targeted by Chinese governmentCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 29, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 568 wordsBodyJapanese news agency Kyodo has revealed that the Chinese government has issued an order prohibiting Wuhan's doctors from talking about the onset of the pandemic. "They were warned that they could be punished for espionage if they revealed what happened during the initial phase of the outbreak," the publication warned.A doctor from Wuhan stated that health authorities told him that he would be punished by law if he revealed anything from his experience. And if he was charged with espionage, he could be sentenced to death," the Japanese agency said."Academic institutions in the city of Wuhan sought to keep records of the virus and the treatment of the infection, but the authorities did not allow it," kyodo added. Covid's first case reportedly appeared in Wuhan in October or November 2019, but it was not reported by China to the World Health Organization on December 31.Slow and uneven recovery in AfricaFinancial rating agency Moody's says the recovery in Africa will be slow and uneven. "The weak revenue recovery will exacerbate the challenges of debt sustainability (...), while the decrease in foreign currency revenues will increase external vulnerabilities," he adds.Aztrazeneca targeted by computer attackDrugmaker AstraZeneca, which is developing one of the vaccines against Covid-19, has reportedly suffered a computer attack by alleged North Korean hackers. According to Reuters, hackers will have impersonated recruiters on social media. They contacted employees and offered jobs.Trump asks for help for restorationOutgoing U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday encouraged the U.S. Congress to "make a stand and help" the restaurant industry, warning that it is being "completely wiped out" due to Covid-19. "Time is of the essence," Trump warned in a message posted on his Twitter account.PANDEMIC AROUND THE WORLD15,000 casesAngola recorded another death by Covid and 88 new cases - 15 in Luanda, 53 in Lunda Norte, 8 in Huambo, 5 in Cuando Cubango, 3 in Cabinda, 2 in Uíje, 1 in Moxico and 1 in Malanje. Angola now counts 15 008 cases, of which 342 deaths.Reopening of storesBelgium will reopen non-essential goods stores, museums and swimming pools from 1 December, due to improved Covid-19 numbers in the country. Restaurants and bars will remain closed. The measures will be in effect until January 15.Credit riskAngolan Finance Minister Vera Daves de Sousa believes it is "crucial" not to worsen the perception of sovereign credit risk, as the country will have to continue to become indebted to finance the economic recovery. "We will have to continue to finance ourselves in the markets," he warned.RADAR COVIDLoss of teethNew sequelae of the virus have been discovered, the New York Times reported. Symptoms of the so-called 'prolonged Covid' include loss of teeth painlessly and increased sensitivity of gums, according to the American publication.Too many vaccinesSpanish Foreign Minister and Cooperation Arancha González Laya said the "excess" of doses of vaccines purchased by Spain will be channeled to the poorest countries. The ruler admits that vaccines are overspent after vaccination of the entire population.Error in testsMore than 1,300 Britons were incorrectly told they were infected with Covid. The error originated in the laboratory that performed the screening tests for theDisease. They were asked to take the test again and remain isolated if they had symptoms.Load-Date: November 30, 2020End of Document

CHINA'S ONLINE MEDDLING GOES BEYOND THE GREAT FIREWALLStates News ServiceDecember 7, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 807 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Last week, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian posted on Twitter a fake image which portrayed an Australian soldier with a bloody knife next to a child holding a lamb. The Australian government was outraged, describing it as "disinformation."This is just the latest episode of the Chinese government spreading dubious claims and inflaming diplomatic tension on social media platforms that are banned in China. Zhao did it in English, so it immediately caught the world's attention. But more often than not, the Chinese Communist Party's disinformation campaign is in Chinese.In early November, Chinese activist Hua Chunhui tweeted, "[Mainland] Chinese-language Twitter is becoming increasingly unreadable." Other Chinese activists and netizens have expressed the same sentiment to me. After taking risks and jumping through hoops to "climb" over the Great Firewall, China's sophisticated internet censorship system, what they found on the "free internet" was not "the truth," but a Chinese-language space littered with falsehoods and disinformation.Many of us believe that internet freedom is key to exposing people across China to the government's abysmal human rights abuses and taboo concepts like freedom and democracy. But a free internet is not enough. Misinformation is happening in every language in all corners of the internet, but the Chinese-language information environment outside of China is further distorted by forces that impede a free flow of information and peaceful discourse back home.It will be critical for those with a stake in China's human rights environment to help reverse this trend.Twitter has removed tens of thousands of fake accounts created by Beijing to spread disinformation about the Hong Kong protests and the coronavirus. Facebook, and Google have also removed Chinese government propaganda networks on their platforms.But it is not only the Chinese government that is contributing to the messy "free" Chinese-language online space. The other source of misinformation is some overseas-based media outlets, YouTube channels, and social media accounts, including some known for criticizing the Chinese Communist Party. Some of these platforms and their followers spread conspiracy theories and false information on issues ranging from the US presidential election, to Muslim minorities and unauthorized immigration; some use the space to stoke racism.There are various historical and ideological reasons why some netizens fall prey to misinformation, but a big and simple reason is a dearth of fact-based information in comparison to the abundance of misinformation in the Chinese-language social media space. Such an information environment is detrimental to informed discussions on human rights, democracy and other important social and political issues.Supporting the human rights movement in China should also include fostering a fact-based Chinese-language information environment in which activists can get reliable news and analysis, not just about China but also about the rest of the world. As Beijing continues to turn the screws on the internet and media inside China, this will be increasingly needed.International news media and human rights organizations should publish more in the Chinese language. Human Rights Watch has for years translated some of our work on China, the US, and other countries into Chinese. But translated work is not always easily readable. To gain an audience, more should be written and produced directly in Chinese with a mainland Chinese audience in mind.Governments and private philanthropies should also invest in independent, professional Chinese-language journalism. In recent years, news websites such as Initium and community forums such as Matters, albeit banned in China, have expanded the space for Chinese-language speakers to learn about and discuss human rights issues inside China and around the world. More such initiatives are needed. Chinese journalists and writers inside and outside of China, who feel suffocated by the severe lack of free speech in China, can make contributions through the platforms.Finally, a healthy online environment demands that participants take the responsibility to combat the scourge of misinformation, including resisting the urge to spread sensational news that confirms one's own views without verification. Chinese-language speakers who are disappointed with the state of overseas Chinese-language online space should take a more active role in the discussions rather than shunning them out of frustration.Such efforts may not be enough to drain this space of misinformation, but they mean more options for Hua Chunhui and millions of netizens in China who quietly climb over the wall to check what information is out there in the "free world."Load-Date: December 11, 2020End of Document

Chinese surveillance absorbs data, but U.S. technology is key to classifying itCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 16, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 647 wordsBodyURUMQI, China — At the end of a desolate prison-lined road, inside a complex full of cameras, U.S. technology feeds one of the most invasive parts of China's surveillance state.Computers inside the complex, known as the Urumqi Cloud Computing Center, are among the most powerful in the world. You can watch more surveillance videos in a day than a person in a year. They seek faces and patterns of human behavior. They track cars. They're monitoring phones.The Chinese government uses these computers to observe incalculable numbers of people in Xinjiang, a region in western China where Beijing has deployed a campaign of vigilance and repression in the name of combating terrorism.Chips manufactured by Intel and Nvidia,U.S. semiconductor companies, have driven the complex since it opened in 2016. By 2019, at a time when several reports indicated that Beijing was using advanced technology to imprison and track mainly Muslim minorities, new U.S.-made chips helped the resort join the list of the world's fastest supercomputers.Powerful U.S. technology and its potential misuse are at the heart of the biden administration's decisions while addressing america's bitter relationship with China. Last year, the Trump administration banned the sale of advanced semiconductors and other technologies to Chinese companies involved in national security or human rights issues. A crucial initial question for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. will be whether or not to rethink these restrictions.Companies often point out that they have little decision about where their products end up. Chips at the Urumqi complex were sold by Intel and Nvidia to Sugon,the Chinese company that backs the center. Sugon is an important supplier to the Chinese Army and security forces, but also manufactures computers for ordinary companies.That argument is no longer good enough, said Jason Matheny, a security expert at Georgetown University in Washington and a former U.S. intelligence officer."Government and industry need to be more vigilant now that technologies are advancing to a degree where millions of people could be monitored in real time using a single supercomputer," Matheny said.Advances in technology have given authorities around the world substantial power to observe and classify people. In China, leaders have pushed technology to an even greater extreme. Artificial intelligence and genetic testing are used to filter people to see if they are Uighurs,one of Xinjiang's minority groups. Chinese companies and authorities say their systems can detect religious extremism or opposition to the Communist Party.The Urumqi Cloud Computing Center broke into the world's fastest computer list in 2018, positioning itself 221. In November 2019, new chips helped move to number 135.Two data centers operated by Chinese security forces are close to the center, a way to reduce the lag, according to experts. There are also six prisons and re-education centers nearby.On the occasion of a visit by local Communist Party leaders to the complex in 2018, the partywrote on its website that computers had "updated the thinking, to follow up after the fact on predictive surveillance of the fact."In Xinjiang,predictive surveillance often serves as a key to preventative arrests seeking to combat conduct deemed unfair or threatening to the party. That could include a sample of Muslim devotion, ties to family living abroad, or having two phones or not having a phone, according to Uighur testimony and official Chinese police documents.China's reliance on U.S. chips has, for now, helped push, said Maya Wang, china researcher at Human Rights Watch."I'm afraid in a few years' time, companies and the Chinese government will find their own way to develop chips and these capabilities," Wang said. "Then there will be no way to try to stop these abuses."© 2020 The New York TimesMirá also       Load-Date: December 17, 2020End of Document

Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, November 13.Your top stories right now just before 8:00 on the East Coast.Breaking news this morning in the fight for a free and fair election. A whole host of affidavits piling up from the Trump campaign. We have one of them this morning from someone contracted by Dominion Voting Systems, the system used in 64 counties across the United States, alleging they were a witness to clear-cut voter fraud at a Detroit polling center.This is something Rudy Giuliani told me about yesterday. It would be dropping and we've got it. We will bring you the stunning allegations coming up.Plus the latest on the Trump campaign's election lawsuits all morning long right here. RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel is joining me this hour with a lot more.Plus cracking down on China and bad behavior.

The new executive order on Chinese companies coming up.Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy director Peter Navarro is here ahead to discuss.Markets looking to bounce back this morning, we've got a triple digit rally underway for the Dow Industrials. The Dow right now up 200 points just about two-thirds of 1 percent. That is off of the best levels of the morning.The Nasdaq up 74 and the S&P 500 currently higher by 22. This after a dismal day on Wall Street yesterday, a rise in coronavirus cases, threats of new lockdowns dragged on markets yesterday. The Dow Industrials down 317 points at the close. The Nasdaq lower by 76 and the S&P lower by 35.Meanwhile the future of the coronavirus vaccine, new measures President Trump is taking in order to increase access once it is ready for rollout.Health and Humanism Services Secretary Alex Azar joining me in just moments to discuss.Plus a new company holiday, more businesses offering a different way for you to ease your stress. It's making a buzz this morning.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.BARTIROMO: European markets meanwhile are mixed the FT 100 is down about 40 points. But the CAC 40 is up 8 and the Dax up 16. This is -- off of the best levels of the morning here, in Europe right now.In Asia overnight fractional moves, pretty much across the board and could have benched mostly lower with the exception of Korea.Meanwhile this, new progress on distribution of a coronavirus vaccine program. The Trump administration announcing a new partnership this week pharmacies across the United States to provide access to COVID-19 vaccines. The agreement covers 60 percent of chain and independent pharmacies across the U.S. including big names like CVS, Walmart, Rite Aid and Walgreens.BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is U.S. Health and Human Services secretary, Alex Azar. Secretary, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks for being here.AZAR: Glad to be with you, Maria. Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Before we get to the new program and the distribution deal that the administration has set with these pharmacies, assess where we are, Secretary. A lot of commentary about going into the colder months will mean a spike. We're seeing the biggest spikes that we have seen, certainly in the number of cases.How do you characterize things right now with regard to COVID?AZAR: Well, Maria, we're seeing cases increase right now, but we're seeing that happen in Europe, we're seeing that happen here. In fact, Europe, on a per capita basis, has got about 45 percent more cases per day than the United States has now.They're taking the same types of measures that we take, which is encouraging people to exercise good, responsible behavior. Wash your hands, watch your distance, wear a face covering when you can't watch your distance. And stay out of indoor settings, especially, where you're going to let your guard down, take your mask off, or get too close to other individuals.But this is because we're getting cold weather. People are moving indoors - - that's happening and it's really on all of us.But here's the important thing. Thanks to President Trump, this week, we have delivered so many important milestones that are going to get us out of the coronavirus crisis, whether it's Pfizer's vaccine with 94 percent efficacy -- positive date, an historic time -- or if it's approving Eli Lilly's monoclonal antibody for -- to outpatients to keep them out of the hospital. Or if it's Moderna hitting a critical milestone a couple of days ago, days away from seeing their data.Or as you mentioned yesterday, a critical new partnership with the business networks of our pharmacy chains that are going to help distribute a vaccine, meeting patients where they are in their communities.BARTIROMO: Yes, congratulations to your team, and really, this incredible mobilization of the entire industry to get everything on the fast track. Obviously, so needed and so wonderful to be able to achieve that.Tell me more about this partnership. What does it involve? How will you ensure that the vaccine gets to those who need it in a timely amount of time -- amount of period?AZAR: Yes. So, depending on which vaccine we're talking about, Pfizer will be doing its own direct distribution to pharmacies that we asked them to send to based on the instructions of our nation's governors under their distribution plan. So the vaccine will arrive at these pharmacies -- white- glove service -- and the pharmacies will then execute distribution plans to the targeted populations that the governors have selected we hope, based on eventual CDC guidance, for various groups.So we're talking in December, largely America's most vulnerable citizens, we'd have enough vaccine for them by the end of January -- enough for all of America's senior citizens, our health care workers, and our first responders. And as we progress to the end of March to early April, enough for all Americans who want to get it.But 90 percent of Americans live within five miles of a pharmacy, so -- and the pharmacists are some of the most trusted people in health care where people like myself and my family get our vaccines is through our pharmacists and our pharmacy chains. So we want to meet people where they are. This is typical of President Trump using the private sector's expertise to get the job done.BARTIROMO: And with this vaccine, it's a little tricky versus others because it needs to be refrigerated, right?Yesterday, we spoke with the CEO of BioNTech, Dr. Ugur Sahin, about the challenges involved in distribution because of the infrastructure it requires. Listen to what he had to say.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: How does that impact distribution of the vaccine, given that it needs to be refrigerated?DR. UGUR SAHIN, CEO, BIONTECH: (INAUDIBLE) allowing us to store the vaccine at minus-70 degrees to any place on the planet. We are coordinating and organizing a vaccine supply to government and organizations to ensure that the vaccine could be supplied (INAUDIBLE) to hospitals. And then, from hospitals to the vaccination centers.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Are there new challenges as a result of that distribution method that it needs to be cold?AZAR: Yes, Maria. The Pfizer vaccine does present unique challenges that we, and the military, and Pfizer, and the distribution channels have all been -- have all worked out with our governors. So, the Pfizer vaccine does require extra-cold storage.It also will come in large quantities so it will be best attuned early on to mass vaccination programs, for instance, of health care workers at hospitals or our skilled nursing facilities, which was another key initiative we rolled out a week ago, which was with CVS and Walgreens where they're going to be available to assist all of our skilled nursing -- our nursing homes and our assisted living facilities for mass vaccination programs, especially with the Pfizer vaccine if the data and science support vaccinating those populations with the Pfizer vaccine.BARTIROMO: You know, Secretary, we've spoken about this before. We are going to have to adapt and live with this, right, because the vaccine will come on the market, which is great.You and the president have said we'll get the vaccine by year-end. You were right. Great that the president said it and now it's actually materializing. But we're still afraid, given the spikes that we're seeing.Do you agree with some of the efforts being put into place across the country? In Chicago, the mayor saying don't have -- you know, cancel your Thanksgiving plans. In New York, Gov. Cuomo says look, no more than 10 people at your home for any gatherings, and everything needs to shut down in New York by 10:00 p.m.AZAR: Well, Maria, all of our measures have to be guided by evidence and science and not just -- not just assumptions.And what does the data tell us? The data tell us that our universities, our K-12 schools have not proven to be major vectors of disease transmission. Our workplaces have not proven to be vectors of disease transmission. Our airlines have not proven to be vectors of disease transmission.Why is that? Because we have leadership at each of those types of institutions that are working with CDC guidance and putting in good controls in place to ensure people wash their, watch their distance, and wear face coverings when they can't do so.We're seeing the spread occur in informal gatherings in indoor settings as we're now in the colder months. We're seeing the identical syndrome in Canada and in Western Europe. We are not unique in that regard.And that just means when we have our household gatherings we've got to be extra vigilant because those are settings where you're going to relax, you're going to maybe get too close with people who don't live with you, and you're going to take your face coverings off. And especially, for Thanksgiving and Christmas, just advise people, please exercise extra caution because you can get that disease from your family members and from neighbors.BARTIROMO: Yes, but I mean, people are worried that all of the lockdowns will come back and that we'll be --AZAR: You don't need -- you don't need lockdowns, Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly. That's what I was trying to understand because -- yes.AZAR: I mean, the data -- the data -- the data -- you know, the -- that's what I'm saying. The data -- the data clearly demonstrate the interventions we need are simple, they're demonstrated, they're proven. But they're not forcing people to stay in their homes, shutting down our businesses, shutting our schools.You know, here's the amazing thing. In the United States, as soon as we see disease spread, so many local leaders and governors go immediately to shutting down our schools.You know what the Europeans do --BARTIROMO: Yes.AZAR: -- and you know how cautious the Europeans are. The Europeans have placed a primacy on keeping their universities and their K-12 schools open. They've done so even as they take other aggressive measures in their countries.We need to be having the same type of prioritization of our kids and our safe settings, keeping those open. And then taking interventions that all of us can do that are common sense that will prevent the spread of disease in our personal lives.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there.Secretary, it's good to see you this morning, sir. Thanks very much.AZAR: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Secretary Alex Azar.Much more ahead. Up next, Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Director Peter Navarro is here talking about the Trump administration's move to bar investors from investing in Chinese companies tied to the Chinese military.And then later in the hour, Republican National Committee, Chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel. On the President fight for every legal vote.Joining the conversation all morning long: Dagen McDowell, James Freeman.We're going to take a break, come back to them when we come right back.You are watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on fox business.BARTIROMO: welcome back.Protecting national security. The Trump administration, unveiling an and executive order which bands order bans which bans U.S. investments in Chinese companies with ties to the military in China.The order applies to 31 Chinese companies. It impacts some of China's biggest companies Huawei, China Telecom Corp. and a China mobile a spokesperson for china's military of Senator foreign affairs minister it Telecom corporation and China mobile.A spokes persons for China's Ministry of Foreign affairs, blasted President Trump's executive order saying this quote, "will not only seriously damage the legitimate interests of Chinese companies but it will also damage the interest of investors in various country including the U.K.Joining me right now is the Assistant to the President for Trade and Manufacturing Policy, Peter Navarro. Peter, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks very much for being here.NAVARRO: Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO: Tell me about the order and what the president is trying to do here. We know that the Pentagon had a list of the companies that are -- public companies that are investable companies that have ties to the military months ago. Why did the president now decide to make this move?NAVARRO: The underlying principle is that American capital should not be used to finance Chinese militarization, particularly weapons that are going to be used to kill Americans. That's the top line.Now, we have 31 companies in there, but there's also over 100 subsidiaries. They're traded on the Chinese exchanges as well as our own exchanges, and what you have for example is AVIC, which is kind of the Chinese equivalent of Boeing. They make the Chengdu J-20 fighter, for example, which is based on stolen designs from the Pentagon.You have to ask yourself why would an American investor - American pension fund invest in that. You have Norinco, which builds combat vehicles. You've got Kasich (ph). I've written extensively about China's asymmetric warfare with missiles. You know, missiles are a lot cheaper than aircraft carriers, but these companies make what they call openly the aircraft killer.So what the president has done, which has been in the tradition of his presidency, is to crack down hard on China. In this case what we're tackling are these Chinese companies that mean to do America harm. You've also got Hikvision. That's the one that surveillance. They do all the concentration camps, both digital and real, for example, in Xinjiang province. Huawei's in there. These are bad, bad, bad, bad companies doing bad, bad things -BARTIROMO: Yes.NAVARRO: -- with the goal of driving the American Navy out of the Pacific.BARTIROMO: Yes, I think this is an important point that you're making because I think we - the audience probably would like to hear the background of this and the backdrop. I mean, Chinese law says that any company in China has to answer the Chinese Communist Party, should the Chinese Communist Party say, look, I want this data. I want the data of your customers. They are forced to give that up to the CCP, and the CCP has made it very clear that it wants to replace the United States as the number one super power. So in investing in these companies, you are inadvertently funding that movement, right?NAVARRO: That's exactly right. It's a doctrine of civil military fusion which allows the state, the CCP to lay claim to any company. So even an American company that goes into China becomes effectively an organ of the Chinese government, and this is the kind of thing, Maria, that we simply can't tolerate. And Wall Street is very complicit in this.There's this index, the MSCI which is used to allocate pension funds, American pension funds, including pensioners for military veterans that funnel - force that money to be funneled into these companies. So that's going to be over with. There's going to be a decent interval where people can unwind their positions, but after that decent interval, we will not engage in the indecent investment in these companies which are designed to kill Americans.BARTIROMO: I want to - I want to ask you about what happens should Joe Biden become president. Does all of this change? I mean, you've got the TikTok story, right? TikTok has already avoided shutdown. The Commerce Department says it will abide by a temporary injunction which prevents the government from effectively shutting down TikTok. It is waiting for further guidance about how to proceed with its minority stake sale to Oracle and Wal-Mart.So Peter, what about that? What's the ultimate outcome for TikTok, and even the president's executive order on not investing in Chinese companies tied to the military? Do you believe these things will be reversed should Joe Biden become the next president?NAVARRO: Maria, we're moving forward here at the White House under the assumption that there will be a second Trump term. I think it's really important before people's heads explode here to understand that what we seek here is verifiable ballots, certifiable ballots, and an investigation into what are growing numbers of allegations of fraud under signed affidavits by witnesses.And my own view, looking at this election, we have what appears in some sense to be an immaculate deception, but if you look statistically at what happened, clearly the president won this election and was leading on Election Day, and then after Election Day somehow in these key battleground state they got just enough votes to catch up to the president. That's kind of what is being investigated.So I think what's important here is that this is a country of laws and rules. We have a very clear set of election laws, and what we need to do is go through the process as we did with Gore - Bush v. Gore and see where we get. So until we do that, our assumption is the second Trump term. We think he won that election. And any speculation about what Joe Biden might do, I think, is moot at this point.BARTIROMO: So how long will this process take, Peter? We've been talking about the affidavits that I've been able to get my hands on. There's a whole host of affidavits I know that the Trump legal team has. They've spoken with a number of witnesses who have said I saw voter fraud. What are your expectations in how long this takes to flow through the courts? And when we'll have a better idea of whether or not the legal system agrees with your notion?NAVARRO: This is clearly not my lane in terms of the granularity of the whole issue, but clearly there's going to be recounts in some states, as required by law. There may be also contesting following those recounts, and clearly based on the lawsuits that are being filed, there has to be investigation, and some of these allegations are very, very troublesome.So I think it's important for this country, if we're going to go forward as a - as a vibrant democracy, that we have free and fair elections that people have confidence in. In this election, unless we - unless we very carefully do go through this process and exhaust all remedies, we're going to lose that confidence, so this is a historic election. As the president says, let's see what happens.BARTIROMO: All right. Peter, good to have you this morning. Thanks very much. We will certainly do that.NAVARRO: Take care.BARTIROMO: We'll be watching. Peter Navarro.Be sure to order my new book written along with James Freeman. We talked about economic policy as well as China. It is called "The Cost: Trump, China and American Revival". Check it out.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez still pushing toward the defunding the police movement. Some of her fellow Democrats have been critical of her very vocal stance on socialism and law enforcement.During a virtual town hall, a 14-year-old asked her to define the meaning of defund the police.She said quote "I believe the path toward justice is a long ark -- safety is not just an officer with a badge and a gun. She went on to say, the police budget is too high and quote, "it's a about budget shift.James what do you think about these comments as we continue to see high crime rates certainly across the country, New York among other big cities.JAMES FREEMAN, "WALL STREET JOURNAL": Well I think it shows that even AOC is not able or willing to defend the lunatic idea defund the police. She says there that safety is not just about a police officer with a gun and badge which clearly accepts the idea that a police officer with a gun and a badge is a necessary part of safety, is an important part of public safety.And if she now wants to argue about the level of budgets, I think she's not going to find a lot of people who want to reduce the budget but that is very different from the extreme radical defund the police movement that got so much attention this past summer. And, as you said, I think it cost Democrat seats in Congress.BARTIROMO: Yes. Dagen, you know, there is the Trump Accountability Project which I guess was AOC's idea as well where she says the Trump Accountability Project was started because we believe restoring democratic norms are vital to protect America's future.And what it is a whole list of people who were supportive of President Trump and she says that she is going to make them unemployable. If you are on the list it's sort of like a blacklist. She says that it is -- Marsha Blackburn says we will not back down to the radical left. We must keep fighting and hold activists accountable.We will not be intimidated by this and I guess it's being closed down now, but you can imagine this blacklist that she created?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:: Yes, dictators tyrants and despots keep lists of their enemies and I'm guessing she probably admires some of those despite the fact that the left has called Donald Trump a dictator for more than four years.She does believe in defunding the police. Senator Joe Manchin a day ago tweeted this. "Defund the police? Defund my butt. I'm a proud West Virginia Democrat. We're the party of working men and women. We want to protect Americans jobs and health care. We do not have some crazy socialist agenda and we do not believe in defunding the police.Well, she retweeted that with a photo from what appears to be a state of the union address where she is glaring at the back of Joe Manchin's head. That's cute but just remember, she's a Congressman two-year term Senator Joe Manchin is -- well, a senator. Get in line.And then I'll add this. there is I a Portland City Commissioner I don't know if you all read this, who was advocating for an 18 million cut to the police department. She called 911 on her Lyft Driver.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: The Lyft driver dropped her Lyft driver dropped her somewhere at a service station and she was upset by that. So again, they don't want the police there, unless they are there for them. And you can have police who better at trained handling people with mental illnesses. I think about a quarter of police shootings involved the mentally ill.They get roughly in some places about eight hours of training handling people who are mentally ill and you see it every day in New York City. But that doesn't mean that social workers are the people who are going to be protecting you from people who are violent in the streets.BARTIROMO: Yes, and by the way, because of all of this, defund the police, and because of the mayors not standing by the police, many police officers have either resigned or decided to take retirement early. So there is that, as well.MCDOWELL: And by the way, they've already defunded the police in if a different way here in New York city, because of the bail reform there is zero incentive for any police officer to pick up an individual and arrest them if they're going to be immediate released or not prosecuted.I will point to all the looting and crime that happened earlier this year when stores were broken into and just robbed at will. The individuals who were arrested for those crimes were not prosecuted. So where does that leave the police? You don't need to remove the budget you just need to remove power from their hands and tell them to stand down, that is exactly what is happened in New York and it's not made it a safer city. It is more dangerous.BARTIROMO: It's a very sad state of affairs actually. Let's look at market here the Dow Industrial is up 220 points as we wait for inflation data this morning. We are waiting for the producer price index. We have not seen a big move in inflation on the producer level in sometimes. The estimates are once again showing fractional movers up two tens of a percent is the expectation on PPI. Let's get right to this breaking economic data with Cheryl Casone she's got the numbers.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Right. And let's take a look first at the month-over-month for PPI, again this is producer prices, again the expectation was 0.2 percent we came in 0.3 percent, remember the consumer with this numbers are they passed us on to the consumer. The month-over-month for PPI the year - excuse me the year-over-year was an expectation of 0.4 percent to the upside that came in at 0.5 percent, so that's one of the things that we got going on here.Also I'm looking at PPI final year-over-year demand that came in at 0.5 percent the expectation was 1.2 percent so that came in - the little - that came in little bit lower than I thought. And then looking at core that excludes food and energy the year-over-year, the expectation was 1.2 percent we came in at 1.1 percent, Maria. So we're getting all of these numbers crossing right now, looking at markets Dow at 223, as you can see on your screen, back to you.BARTIROMO: All right Cheryl, thank you so much. We are going to take a short break. When we come back, we will look at the impact of the inflation reports. We'll get some analysis on the breaking economic data. Stay with us. We're speaking to Mark Mobius on the other side of this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back capital is coming out of the United States right now and under a Biden/Harris White House. We could see higher taxes spot even money pouring out of U.S. into overseas markets. Joining me right now is Mobius Capital Partners Founder Mark Mobius. Mark it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining me.MARK MOBIUS, MOBIUS CAPITAL PARTNERS FOUNDER: Thank you. It's pleasure to be with you again.BARTIROMO: What do you see Mark in terms of capital, leaving the United States. I was talking with one trading desk source yesterday and he said money is leaving the United States at an alarming rate. Do you see that?MOBIUS: Yes. We are seeing more and more money going into emerging markets, you must remember number of this emerging markets have done very well. China has - China is doing very, very well. India is doing very well. Korea, Taiwan their currencies are getting stronger against U.S. dollar. So investors look at that and say hey, wait a minute maybe I shouldn't be so expose to the U.S. dollar. But the other things with Biden in, if and this is a big if, if he is able to raise taxes, so call rich and corporations that would be very bad for the markets and that was my view, as you know, a few months ago.Now, however there is a chance that he will not be able to implement those changes. So, that could be one thing in favor of the market. The other thing I think that is happening is that with the COVID vaccinations now being a possibility, that will raise sentiment in the market generally and of course that's globally, not only the U.S, so a number of moving parts in all these markets.BARTIROMO: Now you just mentioned China in terms of one place for people's money but the Trump administration of course unveiled the executive order this week banning U.S. investments in Chinese companies that are tied to the military, the order applies to 31 Chinese companies that impacts some of China's biggest companies including Huawei, China Telecom and China Mobile, your reaction to what we've seen in terms of this executive order and what it will mean for those Chinese companies and their stocks?MOBIUS: That's very, very interesting move. Of course, the question is who will be banned. I am wondering whether the major pension funds let say, California teachers pension fund will be banned from investing in this stocks. I think we have to look at that carefully. I think the executive order probably only relates to the federal pension funds and not to the state and others.So, but if it is covering everybody then it's very bad news for the Chinese market, at least in the short term but you must remember the Chinese market is huge and the biggest players in the Chinese markets are the Chinese themselves. So, yes, there will be an impact but probably be temporary. And of course with Biden coming in, as you know Biden has won this election. So they probably will change that order very quickly.BARTIROMO: What do you mean by that China has won this election? I think our viewers agree with that because there is a completely different approach between President Trump and Joe Biden as it relates to China.MOBIUS: Yes. That is what I mean. I am saying is that Biden will probably reverse that order that Trump has just implemented. So then that means that the ban on Chinese investments will go by the board.BARTIROMO: Let me bring in James Freeman. Go ahead James, James from the "The Wall Street Journal".FREEMAN: Thanks, Maria. Hi Mark, you mentioned the outlook for China in the short term. I am wondering about the long term, one of the things (ph) so Maria and I talked about in our book the cost, is how, China's move toward capitalism, toward exposure international markets has not led the political freedom there. As we look at estimates that China may have the largest economy in the world as early as the 2030s or the 2040s. Do you expect eventually this is both the world's largest economy and it remains a communist dictatorship?MOBIUS: Yes. I think there is a good chance of that still happening. You must remember that on the ground, if you go to China you will find there is an incredible amount of freedom on the streets. As long as you don't talk about politics or don't attack the party then you are in pretty good shape.And you can see the growth of the economy is based on a lot of these high- flying entrepreneurs who did a lot of things in China, they could never get away with in the U.S., antitrust actions in China are not very prevalent and so forth. So I think they are able to move ahead in this direction improving technology and, of course with the surveillance technology that they have now, their ability to monitor people's behavior is much, much greater. So, people getting out of line can be stepped on very quickly.FREEMAN: Are those entrepreneurs getting mores discouraged though? We see for example Jack Ma increasingly been pressured, restricted by the government there most recently with this offering of his Ant Group.MOBIUS: Definitely, you are going to see a lot of these huge internet companies being cracked down on. Because they've gotten too big and it is really antitrust type of action that you see happening in Europe, in the U.S. going forward. It's a global phenomena but I don't think these companies are - going to get much smaller, they are still going to be very, very large and very prevalent, it just their behavior is going to be restricted.BARTIROMO: What do you think was behind that shut down of the Ant deal, Mark?MOBIUS: Well, I personally feel that they were having trouble selling it because my bank and CFO called me and asked me, if I was interested. That was the first time I ever got such a call. So I think they were having trouble selling it. And also, I think the Chinese leadership felt that the financial system was at a risk because the amount of money they were raising meant that they could really dominate the financial system if they were going in the same direction that we're moving, so it was probably both factors at work here.BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Mark it's great to see you this morning. Thanks very much for being here.MOBIUS: Thank you very much.BARTIROMO: Mark Mobius joining us. Stay with us. Ronna McDaniel on the other side of this break. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The fight for a free and fair election, a new affidavit from a dominion voting system contractor alleges mysterious ballots were dropped off in Wayne County Michigan. The contractor says "there were two vans that pulled into the garage of the counting room, one on day shift one on night shift, these vans were apparently bringing food into the building because they only had enough food for about one-third of the workers not even, she says I never saw any food coming out of the vans. Coincidentally, it was announced on the news that Michigan had discovered over 100,000 more ballots that even two hours after the last van left.Joining me right now is RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. Ronna it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us. What can you tell us about these lawsuits from the Trump campaign, and the - and the current state of the election?RONNA MCDANIEL, RNC CHAIR: Well, we have nine lawsuits currently going across the country. We have recount next week in Georgia. We're going to have a recount in Wisconsin. But beyond that Maria we have 12,000 incidence reports with over 400 affidavits and affidavits are evidence. Because these are people testifying under oath that they saw in Detroit ballots coming in they couldn't get a clear picture as to where they were coming from but they saw many been FED (ph) into machine that they were forced to backdate or told to backdate ballots as election workers who are working in Detroit. All of these things are very, very real. And show us why we can't just move on and close the book on this election there is a lot more to go still.BARTIROMO: So what do you think is going on here Ronna? I mean are these episodes of irregularities or is their systemic fraud?MCDANIEL: Well, it's only happening in Democrat run cities, major cities that were late to get their vote counts in and they remove the Republicans from the observing of the ballots in the process. So it raises a lot of issues because what was happening when we couldn't watch. Why couldn't we watch, what was going on and that's why this investigation is happening. That is why these lawsuits are happening. I am so glad that we are fighting because we can never let this happen again. But it also shows, what this massive amount of ballots coming in and also in machines in Nevada that were set at the wrong setting for signature verification. We need to see this process through because this is been called too early with too close of a vote margin.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean we've got lots of information about the dominion voting system which I have been investigating myself. We are going to have news on that on "Sunday Morning Futures" over on "Fox News Sunday". But on Sunday, you know, we will also talk about Georgia Secretary of State announcing Wednesday that the state will conduct an audit of the 2020 presidential race including the rare by hand recount of every ballot.You mentioned this a moments ago Ronna, the control of the senate is handing on the outcome of these two-runoff elections set for January 5th in Georgia as well. Republicans have secured 50 seats so far what are you expecting in Georgia with the balance of power to be decided in January? And then I want to get your take on what took place this election in terms of Congress, the house gaining as many seats as it has, I was interesting to see but a surprise given that Trump still apparently lost. Does that make sense to you?MCDANIEL: Yes. I mean the President received more votes than any President in history. He turned out more voters, and up and down the ballot Republicans line where 50 in the senate everybody thought we're going to get decimated, picking up 10 house seats everybody thought we're going to lose 10, picking up a state legislature, picking up a governor seat. Keeping the state legislature Democrats thought they were going to flip.And I think that's part of the reason many people think how could Republicans win up and down the ballot and yet the president is having this issue, especially in the cities where people weren't loud to watch, they were kicked out of the rooms and then all these vote totals came in. And that is why we have to investigate. We have to go through this so that every voter and every person has confidence in this election.And I will tell you talking with the people who in Detroit many of them who are my friends, they feel like they were disenfranchised and that's something wrong happened. And how can Democrats talk about unity and bringing people together when they're kicking us out of observing the most important election in our lifetime.BARTIROMO: All right Ronna, we will be watching this is an amazing moment, Ronna McDaniel joining us. Thank you so much. We'll talk with you soon.MCDANIEL: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Coming up, a new company holiday how businesses want you to relax and recharge, it's making a buzz this morning. We will bring it you next. You are watching "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Now this Fox Business alert DoorDash the U.S. food deliver start up back by Softbank Group, just made public its regulatory filing for an IPO. Company will trade them on New York stock exchange teaming up with the company to flow its shares before the end of the year. DoorDash filed an IPO of $100 million that is a placeholder amount. It is expected to change. DoorDash will go public this year.Time for the morning buzz, feeling burned out at the office are you? Well, you are not alone and your company wants to help, more employers are looking to add a company holiday to the yearly roster, a recharge day. So employees can take a much needed break without losing vacation days. Our study show 67 percent of employees reported a higher stress levels when the pandemic started. Dagen, how do you like that a recharge day?MCDOWELL: They don't need these companies to invent a new holiday. They just need to honor Festivus. It is on December the 23rd every year created by Frank Costanza on episode of "Seinfeld". So again, I am all about the airing of the grievances, so - the airing of the grievances. So December 23rd everybody, every company should give employees that day off too.BARTIROMO: What about you James do you agree, and what about your recharge day?FREEMAN: I don't know what I can add to that. The recharge day sounds good too, take a day off where I can get it, you know on a serious note I wouldn't say that - there is a lot of evidence that the shutdowns have been a mental health disaster. And so - whether about this day off does anything for that, I don't know. But as Governors and Mayors once again are looking at that awful medicine as a way to address rising COVID cases I hope they realize that there are a lot of non-COVID illnesses in the world and they make a lot of them worse when they lock us down.BARTIROMO: Yes. It's a very serious subject, you are right James. People have been depressed as well. We'll take a break. When we come back we got more "Mornings with Maria" live on Fox Business, right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are 30 minutes away from the opening bell on Wall Street. We've got a rally under way for the Dow up 233. But check out the morning mover, Cisco shares soaring this morning up better than 7 percent the company reporting a smaller than expected decline in revenue yesterday due to strong demand for its teleconferencing tools, networking equipment and cyber security products during the coronavirus pandemic. The stock is doing very well in volume. We also had Citigroup raising its price target this morning from $43 to $45 a share on Cisco. Markets up as well, up 236 on the Dow Industrials. Final thoughts, Dagen McDowell, what are you looking at today?MCDOWELL: A Festivus for the rest of us. I just wanted to say that. People were tweeting to me. And Jerry Stiller of course passed away earlier this year at the age of 92. So may he rest in peace? And may we all have a joyful Festivus.BARTIROMO: Yes. James, final word?FREEMAN: I want to celebrate Festivus when I see the Judy Shelton is going to get a vote next week in the senate to join the board of the FED this is great for Americans and for our currency.BARTIROMO: We talked about that in the book. You should have pick up my new book "The Cost: Trump, China and American Revival" along with James Freeman, we so enjoyed writing this book. We hope you like it."Varney & Co." begins right now.Load-Date: November 13, 2020End of Document

AUSTRALIA CLASHES WITH CHINA OVER FAKE WAR CRIMES POSTStates News ServiceNovember 30, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 447 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: SYDNEY BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):By Phil MercerNovember 30, 2020 08:14 AMSYDNEY - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is demanding the Chinese government delete a "repugnant" tweet of alleged war crimes in Afghanistan. The doctored image appears to shows an Australian soldier murdering a child. It follows a report last week that found Australian special forces had committed at least 39 unlawful killings in Afghanistan.The image is confronting. It was posted by a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao and shows a doctored image which portrayed an Australian soldier with a bloody knife next to a child. The child is seen holding a lamb. The text beneath the photo reads: "Don't be afraid, we are coming to bring you peace!"Australian media reported the Twitter post appeared to be a reference to unsubstantiated rumors that elite Australian soldiers used knives to murder two Afghan teenagers. An inquiry into misconduct by special forces found no evidence to support the hearsay.It did, however, find "credible evidence" of unlawful killings by Australian forces in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016.Last week Zhao said China "strongly condemned" the soldiers' actions, and that the four-year inquiry "fully exposed the hypocrisy of the human rights and freedom these Western countries are always chanting".The fake picture posted online has infuriated Australia."The Chinese government should be totally ashamed of this post. It diminishes them in the world's eyes," said Prime Minister Morrison. "Australia is seeking an apology from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the Chinese government for this outrageous post. We are also seeking its removal immediately and have also contacted Twitter to take it down immediately. It is a false image and a terrible slur."Relations between the two nations were already frosty over allegations of Chinese interference in Australia's domestic affairs, cyber-espionage and differing views on Beijing's military expansion in the South China Sea and democracy in Hong Kong. Canberra's call for a global investigation into the origins of the new coronavirus, which was first detected in China, angered the Chinese government. It insisted Australia was unfairly targeting China.China now appears to be using trade to pressure Australia. Last week, Beijing announced sweeping tariffs on Australian wine exports, which are likely to inflict huge losses on parts of the industry. China has also imposed restrictions on other agricultural commodities and coal from Australia.Analysts say the dispute over a fake photo posted by a Chinese official on Twitter will only enflame tensions further.Load-Date: December 1, 2020End of Document

RUBIO STATEMENT ON MSCI REMOVING CHINESE MILITARY COMPANIES FROM ITS INDEXESStates News ServiceDecember 16, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 781 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) released a statement following MSCI, Inc.'s (MSCI) announcement that it would remove seven Chinese companies connected to the People's Liberation Army from its indexes. In June 2019, Rubio requested information from MSCI regarding the company's controversial decision to add Chinese companies in its equity indexes, including whether MSCI examined the potential for funding Chinese companies involved in the Chinese government and Communist Party's military, espionage, human rights violations, and Made in China 2025 industrial policy when it performed due diligence on the Chinese firms that it includes in its indexes."More than a year ago, I highlighted how index providers like MSCI funnel U.S. dollars, including from American mom and pop investors and Wall Street, to hostile Chinese companies that are involved in the Communist Party's military, espionage, human rights violations, and Made in China 2025 industrial policy," Rubio said. "I was proud to work with the Trump Administration on their Executive Order to prohibit investment in Chinese military firms, and MSCI's decision to remove these dangerous companies from their indexes is a result of that good work."It is regrettable but unsurprising that nothing short of an Executive Order would move an American firm to eliminate from its indexes securities of companies classified by the U.S. government as 'Communist Chinese military companies' and human rights abusers," Rubio continued. "MSCI's stated decision not to remove these firms' subsidiaries and affiliates underscores the need for Congress to take further action and further justifies the decision made by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board to abandon the use of an MSCI All-World Index. If any future Administration were to reverse course, it would be a clear signal that they are putting the interests of the Chinese Communist Party and Wall Street above the interests of American workers and mom and pop investors."However, there is much more work to be done to address the clear and ongoing risk posed to U.S. economic and national security from the Chinese Communist Party's exploitation of U.S. capital markets," Rubio added. "Congress should move swiftly to pass my American Financial Markets Integrity and Security Act, which will ban malicious Chinese companies, as well as their subsidiaries and affiliates, from operating in U.S. capital markets. Passing this bill will make clear to the Communist Party that they will no longer be able to exploit our financial system."Last month, Rubio welcomed an Executive Order by President Trump to prohibit U.S. investments in Chinese firms that are on the U.S. Department of Defense list of Communist Chinese military companies. The move closely resembles legislation that Rubio introduced last month, the American Financial Markets Integrity and Security Act, which would prohibit malign Chinese companies including the parent, subsidiary, affiliate, or a controlling entity that are listed on the U.S. Department of Commerce Entity List or the U.S. Department of Defense list of Communist Chinese military companies from accessing U.S. capital markets. A one-pager of the legislation is available here.Earlier this month, Rubio welcomed news that the House will pass an amended version of Senator John Kennedy's (R-LA) Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (S.945), which included key provisions from Rubio and would increase oversight of Chinese and other foreign companies listed on American exchanges and delist and ban over-the-counter trading for firms that are out of compliance with U.S. regulators for a period of three years. The legislation is currently awaiting signature by the President to become law.In May 2020, Rubio and Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) welcomed the announcement by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) that it would halt its short-sighted decision to invest billions of dollars from the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) the retirement assets of federal government employees, including members of the U.S. Armed Forces in opaque Chinese firms engaged in human rights abuses and a wide range of military-related activities.Rubio and Shaheen also led a group of lawmakers in introducing the bipartisan, bicameral Taxpayers and Savers Protection (TSP) Act, which would prevent the FRTIB from steering federal retirement savings to China. Specifically, the FRTIB plans to shift the TSP's International Fund Index to the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Investable Market Index that includes Chinese companies under U.S. sanctions and U.S. export bans.Load-Date: December 16, 2020End of Document

Ohio U.S. Attorney: Man Who Worked at Local Research Institute for 10 Years Pleads Guilty to Conspiring to Steal Trade Secrets, Sell Them in ChinaTargeted News ServiceDecember 12, 2020 Saturday 9:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 620 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: COLUMBUS, Ohio BodyThe U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, David DeVillers, issued the following news release:A former Dublin, Ohio man pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court today to conspiring to steal exosome-related trade secrets concerning the research, identification and treatment of a range of pediatric medical conditions.Yu Zhou, 50, also pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit wire fraud.Zhou admitted to conspiring to steal scientific trade secrets related to exosomes and exosome isolation from Nationwide Children's Hospital's Research Institute for his own personal financial gain in China."The Chinese government has created a large-scale, sophisticated system to steal American ingenuity," U.S. Attorney David M. DeVillers said. "We hope this conviction demonstrates that we will fight this system.""Zhou and his wife have both accepted responsibility for establishing a company in China to personally profit from the cutting-edge work done at Nationwide Children's Hospital," stated FBI Cincinnati Special Agent in Charge Chris Hoffman. "The FBI will continue to work closely with our partners to protect the innovations that have made America a global leader."Zhou and his wife, Li Chen, 47, worked in separate medical research labs at the Research Institute for 10 years each (Zhou from 2007 until 2017 and Chen from 2008 until 2018). They conspired to steal trade secrets related to exosome research from Nationwide Children's Hospital.Exosomes play a key role in the research, identification and treatment of a range of medical conditions, including necrotizing enterocolitis (a condition found in premature babies), liver fibrosis and liver cancer.According to his plea agreement, Zhou and Chen conspired to steal and then monetize one of the trade secrets by creating and selling exosome "isolation kits." Zhou's research at Nationwide Children's included a novel isolation method in which exosomes could be isolated from one drop of blood. This method was vital to the research being conducted in Zhou's lab - because necrotizing enterocolitis is a condition found primarily in premature babies, only small amounts of fluid can safely be taken from them.The defendants admitted to starting a company in China to sell the isolation kits. They received benefits from the Chinese government, including the State Administration of Foreign Expert Affairs and the National Natural Science Foundation of China.Zhou and Chen were arrested in California in July 2019 and their case was unsealed in August 2019 when they appeared in federal court in Columbus. Chen pleaded guilty in July 2020 to conspiring to steal trade secrets and commit wire fraud.As part of their pleas, the couple has agreed to forfeit property or gains associated with their crimes. For Chen, this included approximately $1.4 million, 500,000 shares of common stock of Avalon GloboCare Corp. and 400 shares of common stock of GenExosome Technologies, Inc. The details of Zhou's forfeiture will be finalized through the sentencing process. A sentencing date has not been set yet for either defendant.David M. DeVillers, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio; John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security; and Chris Hoffman, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cincinnati Division, announced the plea entered into today before U.S. District Judge Sarah D. Morrison. Assistant United States Attorneys S. Courter Shimeall, Peter K. Glenn-Applegate, Special Assistant United States Attorney J. Michael Marous and National Security Division Trial Attorney Matthew J. McKenzie, are representing the United States in this case.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7324627 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 12, 2020End of Document

'Uighur Alarms' Just The Latest In Long List Of China's Worst Human Rights AbusesThe Daily CallerDecember 12, 2020 Saturday 10:09 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: ANALYSIS; worldLength: 1110 wordsByline: Jordan Lancaster, Reporter, jordanlancaster70@gmail.comBodyLink to ImageChina has a long history of human rights abuses, from dictating how many children their citizens can have, to mass surveillance, censorship, and mass imprisonment of religious groups.In late 2016, China began imprisoning Uighur Muslims in mass detention centers in the Xinjiang region. Since then, China has gradually expanded those camps, and it is estimated that there are currently over 1 million Uighurs imprisoned there. A Buzzfeed News investigation revealed that the Chinese government began by using old schools and buildings as prisons and gradually expanded their prison capacity by building more permanent structures. They also built more factories, suggesting the expansion of forced labor.Buzzfeed identified 268 newly constructed compounds, many of which contain several detention facilities. The government claims that these facilities are used to fight terrorism, but Buzzfeed reported that most of the detainees were not extremists of any sort - in fact, no detainees had even been charged with a crime. (RELATED: US Joins Nearly 40 Countries To Criticize China For '21st Century Holocaust')Link to ImageThis photo taken on June 2, 2019 shows buildings at the Artux City Vocational Skills Education Training Service Center, believed to be a re-education camp where mostly Muslim ethnic minorities are detained, north of Kashgar in China's northwestern Xinjiang region. - As many as one million ethnic Uighurs and other mostly Muslim minorities are believed to be held in a network of internment camps in Xinjiang, but China has not given any figures and describes the facilities as 'vocational education centres' aimed at steering people away from extremism. (Photo by Greg Baker/AFP via Getty Images)Muslims have been sent to detention centers for downloading WhatsApp, praying, maintaining ties with their families abroad, or visiting foreign websites, according to the report which cites interviews with former detainees and leaked documents. Once there, detainees are subject to a wide range of abuses including forced sterilization, torture, overcrowding, and solitary confinement. A bipartisan group of senators introduced a bill in October seeking to declare the situation in Xinjiang a genocide.An internal document obtained by the Washington Post revealed the Huawei, a Chinese tech giant, had worked with facial recognition software startup Megvii to create a system that could recognize members of the Muslim minority and trigger a “Uighur alarm.” The technology was designed to estimate the race, sex, and ethnicity of each person in a crowd - and the addition of a “Uighur alarm” could alert authorities whenever a Uighur was seen in public.China engages in mass censorship, disinformation, and propaganda in order to maintain control of its population. A report from the American Enterprise Institute detailed how the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has organizations that exist to push CCP propaganda, control what information is published, and punish those who post content seen as unfavorable to the CCP. (RELATED: Beijing-Controlled News Outlet Paid US Newspapers Millions To Publish Propaganda This Year)In 2016, CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping announced that “all the work by the party's media must reflect the party's will, safeguard the party's authority, and safeguard the party's unity,” according to the report. Any criticisms of the Chinese government are portrayed by the media as being “anti-China” or “racist” towards all Chinese people.Journalists have been monitored and punished for publishing content unfavorable to the CCP. Three Wall Street Journal reporters were kicked out of China after the paper published an op-ed critical of China's system of government, and China blocked access to the New York Times website after they published a 2012 article about party official Wen Jiabao's family wealth.China has used its power to influence pop culture and curtail free speech in other countries. In order for a film to be approved in China, for example, filmmakers and producers must coordinate with the CCP, AEI reported. Hollywood films that portray any Chinese character in a negative light are not approved for screening in China, meaning filmmakers lose access to that market.American corporations are also affected. After Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey posted a tweet in support of Hong Kong, China swiftly banned Rockets games from being broadcast and pulled sponsorships. With their access to the billion dollar Chinese market at stake, the NBA released a statement in Mandarin condemning Morey for his tweet.Link to ImageProtesters shout slogans as they hold flyers at the Southorn Playground in Hong Kong on October 15, 2019, during a rally in support of NBA basketball Rockets general manager Daryl Morey and against comments made by Lakers superstar LeBron James. - US basketball superstar LeBron James on October 14, 2019, has sharply criticized a Houston Rockets executive for angering China with a tweet supporting protesters in Hong Kong, saying the executive was “misinformed” and should have kept his mouth shut. (Photo by Anthony Wallace/AFP via Getty Images)In 2015, China announced an end to its policy that prohibited families from having more than one child. The one-child policy was enforced through forced abortions, steep fines, and restricted access to public services like education for anyone who violated the policy, according to Human Rights Watch. Women were often pressured to insert intrauterine devices in order to prevent pregnancy. Because families traditionally preferred to have sons, many families had sex-selective abortions, creating a gender imbalance that left many single men unable to find wives and start families, Bloomberg reported.Despite the documentation of horrific human rights abuses, the United States continues to be heavily dependent on China for everything from pharmaceuticals to iPhones.  It is estimated that 90% of antibiotics and 70% of acetaminophen comes from China, and studies have shown that China supplies up to 80% of the basic ingredients in drugs come, according to AEI. In 2019, 18% of U.S. imports came from China.The coronavirus pandemic, coupled with increased awareness about the mass detainments in Xinjiang, has resulted in many politicians questioning the relationship between China and the United States. President Donald Trump has emphasized his “tough on China” policies, and President-elect Joe Biden has promised to be tough on China too, despite a record that says otherwise. Still, the U.S. continues to rely on China for drugs, tech and everyday goods - and it's unclear when and how that will change.Graphic Chinas national flag is flown during a rock-and-roll festival to mark Chinese National Day on October 2, 2005 in Beijing, China.

Entrepreneurs launch study to defend Brazil's business with ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 26, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1083 wordsBodyA study commissioned by the Brazil-China Business Council proposes that Brazilians look at the Asian partner less and less as a competitor and threat and increasingly as a reference and opportunity, especially to diversify the export agenda and absorb new technologies.The document, which was named "Bases for a Long-Term Strategy from Brazil to China", will be released on Thursday (26) by the entity in an event that provides for the presence of Vice President Hamilton Mourão.The council brings together Brazilian diplomats and businessmen who already have relations with China or have an interest in the trading partner. Among the associates are financial institutions and companies such as Banco do Brasil, Bradesco, BRF, CPFL Energia, Embraer, Itaú and Vale.The study is launched at a time of political and economic controversy, in which the Asian country is singled out as a threat by the Jair Bolsonaro government and in the context of a fiercer trade and technological dispute with the United States.In the most recent chapter, Eduardo Bolsonaro posted on his Twitter account, on Monday (23), that the Clean Network program, to which Brazil declared support, protects its participants from invasions and violations. According to him, the initiative removes technology from China and prevents its spying.The next day, the Chinese government hit back. China's embassy in Brazil said on Tuesday (24) that the deputy follows the United States to slander China and called for the American rhetoric to be abandoned to avoid "negative consequences".Ambassador Luiz Augusto de Castro Neves, president of the Brazil-China Business Council, said he expects a good reception of the proposals by the Brazilian government, but says the priority target is private initiative."I would draw the attention that he is being introduced to the Vice President of the Republic. We hope that it will receive a good welcome from the Brazilian government, but i would remember that we are a business council, formed by private companies that have interests in doing business with China, in selling, investing and receiving investments", says Castro Neves.Hamilton Mourão is part of the Sino-Brazilian Commission chaired by the vice-presidents of the two countries, which will meet again in 2021.The study was prepared by diplomat and economist Tatiana Rosito, who is part of the entity's Advisory Committee and represented Brazil as a diplomat and as head of Petrobras' Beijing office.It indicates three main ways to take advantage of the opportunities generated by the advance of the Chinese economy. It also points out three axes (economic, institutional and sustainability) and three agendas (infrastructure, finance and technology) for the relationship with China.The first way is to add value to commodities exported by Brazil to China, through the intensification of relations with the Chinese market and the discovery of new niches.The proposal also cites the country's adoption of technologies or parts of the production chains that will leave China, as well as a combination of imports of Chinese industrial commodities with the aggregation of value for consumption in Brazil or exports."Just as important as what Brazil can export to China is what Brazil imports or can import and how it can build stable and efficient channels for absorbing new technologies in which China offers increasing leadership," the document says."There are also opportunities to be explored by Brazilian companies supplying raw materials to China in the development of business that can meet Chinese needs, including through the creation of new markets through the education ofchinese consumers for sustainable products produced in Brazil or associated with Brazilian brands."Within the idea that a long-term strategy for China should be linked to a national development strategy, Tatiana used as a starting point a document released in 2018 by the government Michel Temer, revised and consolidated by the current government in the Federal Development Strategy 2020-2031, which has as its main guideline to raise the income and quality of life of the Brazilian population , reducing social and regional inequalities."If these are our goals, it makes more sense to look at China as a new power in the area of innovation, scientific and technological, than just looking from the perspective of competition with Brazilian products and export. The study is more of a wake-up call. We have achieved excellent results in the commercial area, especially in the agricultural trade, but it is necessary to get out of it a little and think about the long term", says Rosito.The diplomat says the two countries already have what she calls an institutional framework that is only comparable to what Brazil has with Mercosur countries. She cites as an example the Sino-Brazilian commission itself."This allows us to continue to have a relationship with pragmatic China, a relationship of states, even at a time when China is being criticized by certain sectors in Brazil. This framework allows us to continue walking this path of approach", says the diplomat.According to the author of the paper, the recent American election points to a distension in some issues in relations between the United States and China and opens an opportunity for Brazil to also rethink the relationship with the Asian country.In foreign trade, for example, positive results for Brazil have fluctuated in the face of Chinese demand, with a concentration on few products that is not considered healthy by either side, according to Rosito.According to the document, China's middle class is estimated to be 400 million people (30% of the urban population, up from 50% in the U.S.) and urbanization and per capita income growth are expected to incorporate hundreds of millions more people by 2050, a potential consumer market for Brazil.According to the diplomat, among the main challenges for expanding and diversifying Brazilian exports to China are the low presence of Brazilian companies and class associations on Chinese soil and the absence of a coordinated campaign of Brazil's image."We explore little of the huge Chinese market. You could from ecommerce identify niches for product exports in areas such as cosmetics, processed foods, areas linked to bioeconomy and sustainability, even small communities could reach niche markets in China, but for this you need to understand the Chinese consumer. All this is a new world that could be open to us," rosito says.Load-Date: November 27, 2020End of Document

Justice Dept.'s China focus likely to continue under BidenAssociated Press InternationalNovember 19, 2020 Thursday 5:28 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICAL NEWSLength: 1013 wordsByline: ERIC TUCKER, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has identified China as the country's biggest foe and the Justice Department mirrored that emphasis over the last four years with a drumbeat of cases against defendants ranging from hackers accused of targeting intellectual property to professors charged with grant fraud.But even after Democrat Joe Biden's administration arrives, the law enforcement focus on China may not look radically different, in part because of actions by Beijing that U.S. officials, lawyers and analysts say run afoul of international norms. Even if the anti-China rhetoric is cooled in the White House, cases against agents of the Chinese government may well continue apace, especially since some of the focus — including against trade-secret theft — preceded the Trump administration.“I think this is going to continue because it’s not really up to the U.S. It’s the Chinese who are being really aggressive,” said James Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The Justice Department in 2018 launched what it called the China Initiative to combat what officials saw as a multi-pronged effort by Beijing to steal intellectual property and conduct foreign influence operations in the U.S. It was part of an administration-wide focus on China, which accelerated in the last year as Trump blamed the country for the spread of the novel coronavirus and as leaders of multiple agencies, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, delivered speeches blasting Beijing.Department officials expect the focus to persist.“There is no turning back the clock to an era when free market liberal democracies turned a blind eye to the PRC’s theft of intellectual property, appetite for sensitive personal data, and repression and censorship,” John Demers, assistant attorney general for national security, said in a statement, referring to the People's Republic of China.“The Department’s commitment to disrupt the illegal and predatory Chinese activity aimed at America and its allies, as illustrated in prosecution after prosecution, will not waver," he added.President-elect Biden referred to China during the campaign as a “serious competitor.” As president, analysts expect him to make few major changes to U.S. policy in conflicts with China over trade, technology and security amid widespread frustration with Beijing’s trade and human rights record and accusations of spying and technology theft.The Trump administration's emphasis on China opened the president to criticism that he was trying to deflect attention away from Russia, which had interfered in the 2016 presidential election and which officials and experts regarded as the bigger threat for meddling in this month's election. The Justice Department, for its part, did keep an eye on Moscow, unsealing an indictment last month that accused six Russian military officers in a global hacking campaign.But most of the department's high-profile actions have centered on China. FBI Director Chris Wray has said the FBI opens a Chinese counterintelligence case about every 10 hours. The Justice Department says it has charged more than 10 trade-secret theft cases tied to China since the China Initiative began.In the last year, prosecutors charged Chinese hackers they said were working with the government with targeting companies working on coronavirus research, and accused others in a major hack of Equifax. The U.S. government also closed China's consulate in Houston in July and charged six people in recent months with studying in the U.S. while hiding ties to People's Liberation Army military institutes.A particular area of emphasis has been on American college campuses and research institutions, where dozens of academics working in the U.S. have been charged in cases that often accuse them of failing to disclose research grants they had received from universities in China. A persistent concern is that talent recruitment programs linked to the Chinese government are enticing academics to steal research from American universities for Beijing's economic benefit.Peter Zeidenberg, a Washington defense lawyer who represents Chinese professors across the country, said that though he expects a new Justice Department to continue to prioritize intellectual property theft, he believes the China Initiative had “gotten so far badly off course” by targeting academics without any allegation that they had stolen research or passed along secrets. The scrutiny is causing professors to be summarily fired from universities, he said.“The result is that a lot of really super-talented professors are having their lives wrecked unnecessarily. My hope is that they keep in mind the harm that it is that they're trying to prevent and then go after the people who are causing that harm,” Zeidenberg said of federal prosecutors.“Because right now what they're doing is entirely counterproductive to the United States' interests because they're decimating our science and technology, and alienating loyal citizens and scientists,” he added.To be sure, the Justice Department had begun a focus on Chinese hackers well before Trump took office. It brought a first-of-its-kind indictment in 2014 against five Chinese military intelligence officers, accusing them of hacking into major American corporations to siphon corporate secrets.The next year, President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that their countries had agreed not to conduct or support hacking for economic espionage. But China's activities continued.“I think there is broad consensus that individuals who engage in grant fraud and who fail to disclose foreign ties in violation of U.S. law pose a real risk to our intellectual property in the U.S. and to the integrity of our federal grants process,” said Justin Danilewitz, a former federal prosecutor and Philadelphia attorney.“Regardless of what side one is on politically, I think that is going to continue to receive a lot of focus and attention," he said.___Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP.Load-Date: November 19, 2020End of Document

EU expresses support for completing investment agreement with ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 28, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 427 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- The governments of the European Union on Monday expressed support for completing work on an agreement with China that seeks to further open up the Chinese market to EU investors, leaving both sides closer to a major economic and political victory.Envoys from EU member countries urged the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, to complete negotiations with the Chinese government within days, according to a European official who spoke on anonymity because the deliberations in Brussels are confidential. Another official said the commission could announce a draft agreement imminently.A successful conclusion of the talks that began in 2013 on an investment agreement between the EU and China would be a blow to the challenge to multilateral order representing outgoing US President Donald Trump's "America First" initiative.For the EU, the agreement would expand access to the Chinese market to foreign investors in industries ranging from cars to biotechnology. In addition, the pact would address the underlying Chinese policies that Europe and the US consider to distort the market: industrial subsidies, state control of companies, and forced technology transfers.EU-China relationsFor China, the agreement would reinforce its assertion as a conventional geopolitical force and could limit the risks of a tougher EU stance on Chinese investment in Europe. It would also strengthen Beijing's old call to begin negotiations on a free trade agreement with the EU, which has insisted that such a measure depended on first reaching an investment agreement.This expected achievement highlights global cross-cutting currents after Trump undermined the postwar system over the past four years by marginalizing himself from the World Trade Organization, starting a tariff war against China, and hitting or threatening U.S. allies in Europe with controversial import duties.EU-China relations have been strained this year. A recent Chinese law restricting Hong Kong's autonomy has provoked strong criticism across Europe, while the EU has accused Beijing of spreading misinformation about the coronavirus and threatened operators in China to impose the bloc's first cyberattack sanctions.While the EU and China pledged in April 2019 to reach an investment agreement by the end of 2020, the European side in recent months minimized the possibility of sealing a pact this year on the argued that the Chinese government needed to make more concessions.Original Note:EU Governments Signal Support to Complete China Investment Deal©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: December 29, 2020End of Document

ONLINE EVENT: A PARTNERSHIP FOR TAIWAN AND LATIN AMERICA: THE CREATIVE ECONOMYStates News ServiceDecember 15, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 8830 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS):Daniel F. Runde: Good morning. My name is Dan Runde. I'm a senior vice president at CSIS. And I head the Americas Program. Thank you for joining us today for a discussion on the opportunities for the creative economies of Guatemala, Haiti, and the rest of the region, taking into consideration lessons learned from Taiwan. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that you can submit questions to our panelists by clicking on the link on the event webpage.Taiwan has become a global economic success story by taking steps to avoid the middle-income country trap, increasing innovation-led economic growth and emphasizing its creative economy. Before the pandemic, Taiwan focused on increasing and supporting intellectual property rights, promoting democracy and free speech, providing financial incentives to support the creative economy and to support small and medium-sized enterprises. During the pandemic it has like everyone else, Taiwan has switched to virtual events, has been fostering to reach the world and Taiwan through local digital streaming platforms.Colombia is one example here in the region, in the Western Hemisphere of the economic importance of cultural and creative industries. Three percent of Colombia's economy is comprised of its creative industries and the goal is for creative industries to make up 6 percent of the country's GDP by 2022. It's a very ambitious goal. During the pandemic, the creative economy unfortunately has shrunk has by as much more than 30 percent in Colombia.Haiti we're very lucky to have the ambassador the Haitian ambassador to the U.S. with us today also has enormous potential to expand its creative industries. There's been an emphasis on rebuilding culture after the after the earthquake, aided by UNESCO. The foreign minister of culture, Limond Toussaint, said in 2017 that Haiti has an impression bastion of creators, will provide a competitive advantage to leverage Haiti's cultural and creative industries.Guatemala's creative industries grew over $100 million in less than 10 years. Their creative sectors account for 3 percent of the country's GDP. Young people in Guatemala account for 60 percent of the creative economy's employment. And there's an enormous youth bulge in places like Haiti and Guatemala. So if we want to answer the challenge of a youth bulge, the creative economy is going to be a part of that answering the mail on that.So you know, the other thing is that, you know, we've got we're very, very fortunate, though. I think the creative economy is something we need to understand if we want to escape the middle-income country trap, if we want to think about diversifying economies away from commodities, if we want to leverage the creativity of human talent that's innate in all of us and in all societies, then we can learn a lot from Taiwan and there's a lot of potential in the region. That's the point of this conversation today.We're very fortunate to have Congressman Albio Sires from New Jersey. He is we really appreciate him being with us. He's been a congressman for 13 years. He's currently the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. He also is the co-chair of the Taiwan Caucus. He's a very strong supporter of Taiwan, encouraging stronger U.S.-Taiwan relations. And we're very, very grateful. He's also very focused on supporting human rights and freedoms across the globe.We also have one other keynote speaker, who is Ambassador Yui. Thank you, Ambassador Yui, also for being with us today. He's the director-general for the Department of Latin American and Caribbean Affairs for Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.But without further ado, I'm going to turn the floor over to Congressman Sires first. Congressman, thank you for being with us today.Congressman, I think you're on mute or your screen is frozen. Yeah, now to unmute, Congressman.Uh-oh. Technology isRep. Albio Sires: How's that?Daniel F. Runde: Much better.Rep. Albio Sires: Can you hear me?Daniel F. Runde: Yes. Yes, weRep. Albio Sires: Can you hear me?Daniel F. Runde: Yes, sir.Rep. Albio Sires: Well good. Well, first of all, thank you, Mr. Runde, for that kind introduction and all you do for the Western Hemisphere. And I know you're in my office often and talking (inaudible, technical difficulties) everything that we do, especially when it comes to some of these countries that need so much. So thank you for all your efforts.I want to recognize Ambassador Yui. Nice to see you again. I know it was a year since we last saw each other. But hopefully it won't be that long next time we can sit down and discuss important issues in my office in the near future. So nice to see you.Ambassador Edmond, same thing. Nice to see you too, and the distinguished panel of speakers, along with everyone joining us who is joining us virtually today.I want to thank the Center for Strategic and International Studies for convening this event to discuss the important diplomatic and economic partnerships between Taiwan and Latin America. As chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, I work every day to deepen the United States' engagement with Latin America and the Caribbean.I also serve as co-chair of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, because I am committed to strengthening U.S. relations with Taiwan. And I believe Taiwan is a force for good in the world, including in Latin America and the Caribbean. For decades, Taiwan has worked to support democratic institutions, promote human rights, and advance economic opportunity (in the Western ?) Hemisphere.As the coronavirus pandemic (devastated ?) communities throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, Taiwan has donated over 13 million surgical masks to countries in the region. Taiwan also provided material support for the United States and sent masks to hard-hit areas, including my home state of New Jersey, which I greatly appreciated.In recent weeks, many communities in Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua were devastated by Hurricane Eta and Iota, affecting over 7 million people and leaving hundreds of thousands displaced. Taiwan stepped up again, providing over $600,000 in direct humanitarian assistance.Unfortunately, it has become clear in recent years that the Chinese Communist Party would not accept Taiwan's constructive relations. The Chinese government has sought to isolate Taiwan by aggressively targeting countries which recognize Taiwan diplomatically. In the last few years, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Panama have all decided to end their recognition of Taiwan. Government officials throughout the region have told me they feel pressured by China, but that it is that it is difficult to resist China's offers for instant capital with few strings attached. Yet, in some cases Chinese investments (inaudible, technical difficulties) America (inaudible, technical difficulties).Let me give you an example. In Ecuador, China provided over $18 billion in loans for a series of infrastructure projects. One project, the Coca Codo Sinclair (inaudible, technical difficulties) billion dollars. The dam was built next to an active volcano. Today, this dam has thousands of cracks and is routinely clogged with debris, prevented it preventing it from (functioning ?). Ecuador's government has had to implement emergency measures to try to minimize the dam's erosion and prevent it from collapsing.By any objective assessment, this project was a failure, a true failure, yet Ecuador is sending approximately 80 percent, now, mind you, 80 percent of its oil exports to China to pay back the debt for this (inaudible, technical difficulties) dam and other wasteful (projects ?). A former Ecuadorian minister told The New York Times China took advantage of Ecuador.It is the same formula we have seen the Chinese government use around the world. It is a strategy that exploits murky public procurements processes and takes advantage of short-term thinking on the part of local governments.I mention this example not to cast blame upon every government that has accepted Chinese financing. This is a simple question of political and economic incentive. I also recognize in many cases the United States government has been quick to criticize Chinese the Chinese while slow to offer any alternative. I believe that if we want to advance the values of economic competition and accountable governance, we need to be at the table.The U.S. needs to do much more to open up opportunities for private-sector-led development and investment in the region. We need to reengage in multilateral institutions. And we need to commit to doing the hard work of combating corruption even when that hurts our own political interests in order to (inaudible, technical difficulties).Earlier this year, I introduced a House companion to a bill from Senator Menendez and Rubio that calls for a long-term strategy to expand our diplomatic and economic cooperation with Latin America and more effectively counter China's growing role in the region. I look forward to working with the incoming Biden administration and the new Congress to deepen our ties with allies in Latin America and the Caribbean.U.S. support will be critical as the region seeks to recover from a devastating pandemic and begin distributing a COVID-19 vaccine. As we all know, Taiwan provided a model for the world in its virus response. With just seven deaths out of a population of nearly 24 million, not only has Taiwan served saved lives, it has provided an example of what a transparent government response can look like. Taiwan has followed the science and deployed effective testing and contact-tracing strategies. Looking ahead, it will be important to learn from Taiwan's success as we seek to spur economic recovery and promote innovations in science and public health. I look forward to working closely with Taiwan during this next phase of the pandemic response.Again (inaudible, technical difficulties) for inviting me to (inaudible, technical difficulties) and thanks to everyone joining us today. Thank you.Daniel F. Runde: Thank you, Congressman. We so appreciate it.Ambassador Yui, over to you.Amb. Tah-Ray Yui: Thank you, Dan. Again, thank you, Dan, for and CSIS for hosting another conversation on Taiwan and Latin America and how we can collaborate together.And also, I want to especially say hi to my respects to Congressman Albio Sires. As we mentioned at the beginning of this event that we met about a year ago at your office and talked about very important things about the Western Hemisphere.And I look forward to, myself and my government, to working with you on Western Hemisphere in the next Congress to come. At the same time, I understand that the designated chairman for the Foreign Affairs Committee at the House, Congressman Gregory Meeks, is also a staunch supporter of Latin America, particularly Caribbean region and Haiti in particular. We've got the ambassador here. We also look forward to working alongside with Congressman Sires, and also with Congressman Meeks to work not only with Latin America but also the rest of the world.To my good friend Ambassador Bocchit Edmond, hello and congratulations on your new assignment in Washington. We've had many strange time conversations (laughs) which maybe one day when we publish our autobiographies we'll share our very interesting conversations. But also, you know, Dr. Tai, a fellow Taiwanese countryman who is joining us, she is the real expert for today's event. And all the distinguished panelists who are with us today, thank you for joining us to talk about Taiwan and Latin America.You know, most people what they know about Taiwan is that we make a lot of things. We make toys, we make electronic apparatus. Nowadays maybe people know that we're the country which makes most of the chips in the world. You know, there was an article today in The New York Times, an op-ed, saying that pound for pound Taiwan is probably the most important place in the world because of the chips that we're making. But perhaps, Mr. Carlos, what you'll know also about Taiwan is that we're also a cultural powerhouse.You know, back in the '60s, '70s, you know, most people in Asia when they saw movies when they went to see movies they went to see Taiwanese movies. You know, martial arts and others, you know, the romance. And we were very famous on novels you know, romance novels, TV soap operas, books, literature, et cetera. So Taiwan's and also performing arts. Visual arts, Taiwan some data I just read, you know, just preparing for this event Taiwan, I think, ranks number six in terms of visual arts market in the world. We're behind Germany, but way ahead of Singapore in terms of visual arts market.So Taiwan cultural is the powerhouse. And every year when we hold the Golden Horse Awards, which is the Asian equivalent of the Oscars for the movies, it's a well-respected event in Asia. But the difference that we have here against the PRC is that we are like-minded countries with you. We share the same values. We share the same principles. And being a free and democratic society, we inspire, you know, creativeness. We inspire, you know, freedom of speech. And that makes the reason for a variety of opinions and ideas.Taiwan has, I think, again, according to the data I just looked at earlier today, probably about 10,000 publishing houses, which means we are very flourishing you know, we transited from authoritarian regime when the nationalist government came to Taiwan in 1949 and evolving to a fully full-fledged democracy. And now people in Taiwan, they speak their minds, you know, without any hesitation. And having 10,000 publishing houses that marks the spot.But to be honest, when Dan invited me to this event and I said, well, creative economy, what is it? So I had to look it up. And thank you, Dan, for that, because doing my Google I saw this you guys published an article in September, I think, on what the meaning of creative economy is. So it was last minute, you know, but so I'm not the expert in this field. But I have my own definition of what creative economy is, you know? I think creative economy basically is making, like, economic activity out of creative ways of doing things, you know? But it has to do with intellectual property. It has to do with performing arts, film industry, TV, gaming, et cetera.And it has to do a lot with culture and tourism. But a lot of what we do in Latin America, in my definition, has also a lot to do with creative economy, and basically things that were not done before in Latin America, in certain countries. And we share our experiences with these countries, with our brothers in Latin America, to improve their economies, to improve the social wellbeing of these people. And I consider that as an economic creative economy, which I'll very happily share with you later, as we discussed.But Taiwan, as Dan mentioned and Congressman Sires mentioned, you know, we are at odds with the PRC. And the difference between us and them is that, for example, their loyalty or their value towards, you know, what they serve for and to is the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party. Even if they joined the international organization section of the world, you know, World Health Organization, the United Nations, which you're supposed to work for the common good of humanity and the universality, which most even though you're Colombian, you're from Argentina, but you work for this, you know, bigger entity.But for the but for the Chinese from mainland China, when they join the United Nations, they're still working for the CCP. And in many cases there was also an article probably yesterday about this leak in Telegram, about a list of the Chinese Communist members in London or in Great Britain that pledged allegiance to the Chinese Communist Party, but they were working in different consulates, in defense industries in London, in England, or the government offices.So that is the difference between Chinese from Taiwan and someone from the PRC. And this makes a whole difference when we when you work with Taiwan and Latin America, or when Latin America works with the PRC. And which also Congressman Sires has pointed out some of the caveats of working with them. I think I'll leave it at this at that right now, because we have a lot of experts to talk about creative economy. But also I'll put it I'll pitch in later on during the conversation. Thank you very much.Daniel F. Runde: Thank you, Ambassador Yui. Thank you so much. I'm so appreciative of you and Congressman Sires for being with us today. We so appreciate it.We're now going to turn to our panel. We've got some excellent panelists, some really thoughtful people. And the conversation we're going to be having today is about the concept of the possibility of partnership for Taiwan and Latin America and the creative economy. Before we get there, maybe let's have a conversation. Let me start with I want to start with Alejandra Luzardo about the concept of a creative economy.Alejandra, you've been working on these issues at the Inter-American Development Bank. And you're the lead specialist in innovation and the creative economy at the IDB. What is when I say to you "the creative economy," what is the creative economy? And what does that mean in the context of Latin America? You're on mute, Alejandra..Alejandra Luzardo: Yes. Yes. Thank you, Dan, and thank you for all the panelists for this invitation.Basically at the IDB when we started working with the creative economy we defined that the products and services that are coming from the creativity. But it is related to the copyright issue, to the intellectual property. So for example, when we produce a video game, you can basically copyright some part of that. The same thing with a film. So all these products and services are part of the creative economy. This is what we call it. And we have many sectors. We have more than 38 sectors, from publications, the editorial sector, video games, film industry, and many others.Daniel F. Runde: Is advertising part of it?Alejandra Luzardo: Advertising, yes.Daniel F. Runde: ICT?Alejandra Luzardo: ICT when you are talking about developing software that are related to content, mmm hmm.Daniel F. Runde: How about music?Alejandra Luzardo: Music is also another sector, yes.Daniel F. Runde: Publishing houses?Alejandra Luzardo: Publishing houses, yes.Daniel F. Runde: How about artists?Alejandra Luzardo: Obviously. Everything related to art is part of the creative economy, yes.Daniel F. Runde: Dance?Alejandra Luzardo: Dance, yes.Daniel F. Runde: Theater?Alejandra Luzardo: Yes.Daniel F. Runde: Museums?Alejandra Luzardo: We have more than 38. Yes, museums too.Daniel F. Runde: Well, let's just just humor me a little bit here in terms of there's a lot of it's quite broad, and when people think of the creative economy they shouldn't just think about art and museums and writers.Alejandra Luzardo: No.Daniel F. Runde: It's about it's broader than that.Alejandra Luzardo: It's broader than that. What we have here is an amazing opportunity, because if we think about what happened during the pandemia (ph) when everybody's locked down at home, when you have actually consuming content through many different platforms, all this content and all these sectors that are creating this content (we save it ?) for the musician, the animators that do the animation for stories and a lot of that are these this is translate an amazing opportunity for an economy to actually produce the content we consume. Because what happened in Latin America, for example, is we are very big consumers of content but we are not the biggest producers. So we have to make the switch about how we can really produce what we consume.Daniel F. Runde: And what percent of the GNP of Latin America and the Caribbean is the creative economy?Alejandra Luzardo: It's approximately 2 percent. Especially now that we you know, with the pandemia (ph) we have so many effects, it's down. We are talking about more than 80 and 90 percent of employment coming from the creative economy that are lost and affecting many sectors, especially sectors that do not use technology. Like we are talking about performing arts, (editorial ?), festival, carnivals; all those sectors are impacted.On the other hand, we have sector like, for example, that use technology, like app tech, like videogames, like the audiovisual sector, that have less impact in the in the (inaudible). We have also sector(s) like videogames or app tech that actually grow during the pandemia (ph). And this is one of the thing(s) that we are looking because, obviously, from the bank we are focused on job creation, but there is no doubt that we have to start thinking out of the box, taking seriously a sector like videogame(s). Never having taken that serious in the past, today, that represent(s) an opportunity.Daniel F. Runde: Are you seeing Alejandra, are you seeing traditional sectors moving to digital platforms? And what kind of success are they having with that?Alejandra Luzardo: Definitely. Right now what we see is in order to survive, you know, in the next two or three year(s), where we are not sure about how is going to be the impact of the vaccine we don't know how many time we have to be close again and come back, et cetera so let's give you an example. Like carnivals, how they're going to actually monetize if that they are like a physical experience, so they have to start thinking in different ways, or creating a small product of something that the consumers capture, inspire, and also try to be able to monetize from that. Because right now, nobody's traveling. So how we are going to be able in that process to keep the I would say the inspiration to people that want to go to different part(s) of the Caribbean, for example, to travel and to actually consume before you get there? So this is a challenge that we have and this is something that all this industry has to start rethinking how they can diversify the model the business model they has today.Daniel F. Runde: Great. I know we're going to hear more about this. Thank you so much, Alejandra.Dr. Tai, thank you for being with us. I think it's very appropriate that I turn to you, given that you're the director general of International Digital Commerce Research Division. Thank you, Dr. Tai, for being here.So how are you seeing, because of the pandemic I mean, the pandemic's been a disruptor and an accelerator, and perhaps created opportunities. How has the how has the pandemic disrupted the creative economy? And how can we see digital platforms as a way to help respond to some of this?Tai Fan Chan: Thank you, Mr. Runde.Actually, yes, after I think after COVID-19 it is well-recognized that e-commerce and also the digital platform that you mentioned has become a very essential infrastructure to keep the society function under lockdown. So we see that during the country's pandemic experience that a lot of people stopped traveling, so they have to find a way the industry has to find a way to as Alejandra said, you have to replicate that experience, that physical experience, through the digital platform to keep the consumers spend money over these digital platform. So that this digital platform, it becomes the intermediaries that can channel these artists' performance or artists' work to convey that experience to the consumers, to keep the artists to still have income under the lockdown. So we see that.But you know that in Taiwan the COVID-19 has been controlled very well, so we haven't felt that need, that urgent need to accelerate the development of digital platform. But we see the experience in America and some of the Latin American countries that we need a digital platform, we need a digital service, in order to make the artists' daily live or their production be normal. That's what we see.And we also see we also urge that governments around the world start to see e-commerce and also digital platform not only as an industry, but we need to start to see it as an infrastructure, an infrastructure that help the human society to fight the COVID-19, fight the virus, because we see that there may be COVID-20 or COVID-25 or whatever; a lot of waves coming. So the virus will not vanish. The virus will only evolve.So the e-commerce or digital platform will become our tools, our weapons, to help our society's resilience to this virus attack. And that's what we see.Daniel F. Runde: Great. Thank you so much, Dr. Tai.One of the things I've taken away from my work with Taiwan in Asia is that there's been several things. One is you need strong intellectual-property rights. Second, you need education and training systems that support various professions in the arts and whether it's film schools or dance schools or music schools, but also even enabling young people to code and to participate in the ICT, having a strong advertising sector.Many of these things are present in the Americas, but I also think we're going to have to add this issue of having strengthened digital infrastructure, because unfortunately, Dr. Tai, I think we're going to have, like you said, a COVID-25 because of a variety of things; zoonotic transfer of diseases between from animals to people. Unfortunately, we're going to continue to have that.I plan to get on an airplane, and I hope other people do too, and people are going to continue to travel over air. And so that's going to create that's the you know, there's a down side to that, and urbanization all mean that there that we're going to have to think we're going to need to be prepared and more resilient as societies, because unfortunately we may have another one of these again and it may be worse or not.But we need meaning in our lives. And I think that the creative economy not only enriches us and gives us a sense of meaning and gives us a connection oftentimes to the divine you know, I think that there's something special about the creative economy.Tai Fan Chan: We keep ourselves sane when we lock home. (Laughs.) So we still can getDaniel F. Runde: And Dr. Tai, does it matter that Taiwan's a democracy. And the Western Hemisphere largely is democratic, except for a couple of glaring exceptions in the Western Hemisphere. Doesn't it matter for the creative economy to participate in having free speech and freedom of association and freedom of thought? Isn't that those are important things; freedom of religion. Those are all probably important things to having a creative economy. Is that true, Dr. Tai?Tai Fan Chan: Yes, yes, yes to be able to speak up your mind, to be able to exercise the creativities that you have, to have that freedom, is actually the soil, the foundation, of creative economy. I think so.Daniel F. Runde: I think so. What I was noticed when I was in Taiwan is you had many artists and oh, and we didn't talk about the fashion sector, Alejandra; one of the other sectors we didn't talk about earlier. There's a fashion sector in Taiwan.Tai Fan Chan: Yes.Daniel F. Runde: There are prominent filmmakers in Taiwan. Some people come from other parts of Southeast Asia to move to TaiwanTai Fan Chan: Yes.Daniel F. Runde: to do work, films, because they don't feel free to do that in their countries. Is that correct, Dr. Tai?Tai Fan Chan: Yes, from Burma, Myanmar.Daniel F. Runde: Myanmar.Tai Fan Chan: So because Myanmar, yes.Daniel F. Runde: OK. Well, look, thank you so much. I just think there's so much that Taiwan can be doing to partner. There are nine countries that recognize Taiwan diplomatically. You're a generous cooperator with many of them. I'm going to turn to the ambassador of Haiti in a minute. And there's so much potential in the region. It seems to me that Taiwan a partnership between Taiwan and the Americas, given this context, is a logical one and a big opportunity.So as Taiwan thinks about its development cooperation and thinks about its trade relationships and its commercial relationships and its foreign policy, that I hope to see even more I know you've been leading, Taiwan's been leading on this and doing more on this, but I think there's a demand pull from the region, as Alejandra was talking about, and you all are a potential solutions provider on a number of different ways to this demand that you're seeing in the region. So I hope, Dr. Tai, that I hope to see more of you in person, whether in Taipei or WashingtonTai Fan Chan: Sure, sure.Daniel F. Runde: or the Western Hemisphere at some point. We have to stop meeting like this over blue jeans.Tai Fan Chan: (Laughs.)Daniel F. Runde: I hope we can meet in person.Tai Fan Chan: Sure.Daniel F. Runde: All right, thank you, Dr. Tai.Ambassador Edmonds, thank you for being Edmond thank you for being here. You represent the country of Haiti here in the United States. When I think about Haiti, one of the things I think about is the great artists that you have in Haiti. You have great musicians in Haiti. And you have a lot of important culture is an enormous asset of the country of Haiti. So thank you for being here, Ambassador Edmond.Amb. Bocchit Edmond: Thank you so very much, Dan.First of all, let me take this opportunity to thank CSIS for inviting me to take part in this panel. And it's a pleasure to see all my friends, those I know already and those I will have to meet soon.Yes, indeed, Haiti you know, the Haitian people are very imaginative as far as the steps are that we are taking to harness the creative abilities of our people and to economic opportunities and generate wealth and economic growth. So, in fact, we do have a lot of artists, a lot of potentialities, that we believe that a creative economy has no single definitions. If I want to refer to the UNCTAD definition, as well, this is an evolving concept which builds on the interplay between human creativity and ideas and intellectual property and technology. Essentially, it is the knowledge-based economic activities upon which the creative industries are based.So it's very important, this item today to discuss about Taiwan and Latin America, because Taiwan has made significant strides and growing its economy and becoming an economic success story, therefore, you know, as well as a democratic country. So it is also a country that has been working to escape the middle-income-country trap by increasing innovation-led growth and technology, including creative economy.So we understand and we believe the Taiwan model could be an example to follow and to try on. But at the same time, it's very important for Taiwan in our discussions, in our bilateral relations, to see how they can be more of good effort to strengthen that particular economy from those small countries. So we can, you know, strengthen them and make them more productive, you know, and contribute particularly in the standardization. And so they could be more competitive and so on.So, therefore, as you well pointed out from the introductions, Haiti has a lot of potentials in this area and to unlock our craft, artists, and performers, and so on. So we do have those potentialities, but we just need the time and the moment to unleash them or to continue to unleash them so this kind of potentialities can be converted in economic growth.Daniel F. Runde: Ambassador, thank you so much. I couldn't agree more. Thank you so much.I'm so pleased to have my friend Dr. Carlos Diaz, who's the chief operating officer of the National Endowment for the Humanities, a friend of CSIS, a friend to many of you here, a friend to Taiwan. Thank you, Dr. Diaz, for being here.You are dealing with you see culture and the National Endowment for Humanities as a driver of jobs and growth in the United States. And so you were early to this conversation. But also I know you're also thinking about partnerships and developing partnerships around the world, including in the Western Hemisphere and potentially with Taiwan. So Dr. Diaz, thanks for being here today.Carlos Diaz-Rosillo: Thank you, Dan. And thank you to CSIS for this great invitation. And hi to all the panelists.Dan, as you know very well from having me come to some of these sessions, beyond the intrinsic value of minds and souls enriched, I also speak about the importance of the cultural sector in two different but complementary ways.First, in terms of dollars and cents. The creative economy is one of the leading sectors of the global economy. As you've heard me say, in the U.S., for example, for the past two years the Bureau of Economic Analysis has reported that the arts, entertainment and recreation industries had nominal growth output on average in the range of more than $370 billion that's billion with a B up until the first quarter of this year. And that is using a very conservative definition of what constitutes those industries. So investing in the creative economy, simply put, makes a lot of good economic sense. And we need to do a better job promoting how much economic sense it makes.The second way in which I often speak about the creative economy stems from my background and interest in national security policy. I firmly believe that targeted, strategic investments in the creative economy can lead the nation to the promotion of the type of soft power that can be harnessed to great effect through a wise foreign policy. That is why, during my time working both in the White House and now at the NEH, I try to put this t the forefront of my efforts through a number of initiatives, but emphasize the importance of soft power and that take advantage of opportunities to collaborate with other nations on projects that bring ideas, that bring insights, and that bring new perspectives to our policy efforts.So let me share with you some of the highlights or some of the projects that we have been working on at the NIH over the past couple of years to promote these partnerships. We have hosted the President of the Republic of Colombia Ivan Duque Marquez for a discussion on culture and the creative economy. We have partnered with the Department of State to do a number of things, such as leading the U.S. delegation to the OAS eighth annual meeting of ministers of culture to reaffirm American leadership on cultural diplomacy and to deepen cultural cooperation with our western hemisphere partners.Promoting cultural cooperation at the third U.S.-Qatar strategic dialogue, engaging with Doha on their year of culture. Promoting cultural cooperation at the inaugural U.S.-UAE strategic dialogue and executing an officious interagency agreement to showcase the best of American culture, history, and heritage to a worldwide audience at the U.S. pavilion in the upcoming Expo Dubai. Partner with the embassy of France in the United States on an international culture festival that will take place around the world. And another project that we haven't yet announced, so I'm not going to get ahead of myself with those.But these are just a few of the many examples in which our small agency is helping to shape the narrative that the United States cares deeply about culture and promoting the creative economy. And I can unequivocally say that I would be honored to add Taiwan to the list of successful partnerships that we have cultivated over the years with our closest allies. Because culture, as we all know, is a powerful instrument of global American leadership. And in my opinion, it needs to be have a more central role in our foreign policy strategic objectives.As we all know so well, and as the congressman pointed out a few minutes ago, we're not the only nation that has figured out the power of culture in helping to promote foreign policy objectives. The money coming out of Beijing and going all across the globe is meant to supplant and take the place of the goods and services that our democracies organically produce by virtue of the fact that we're part of a free and open society.Beijing understands all too well the importance of soft power, and it's clear that they will do whatever it takes to shift the balance away from the U.S. through their international investments in things like Confucius Centers all around the world, in telecommunications, in infrastructure, in heavy industry, and so many other ways. So the United States and its partners need to take a much more aggressive and concerted effort to strengthen the cultural partnerships that nourish our creative communities, and to use the power of ideas and of shared values to counter the suitcases of cash that are leaving Beijing and going all over the world.I believe that the dissemination of our creative goods and services can speak directly to individuals around the globe and earn goodwill and understanding for our nation. The creative economy indeed is not a dismissible luxury. It is essential to our national security. And I know that everyone in this virtual room shares a passion for creative economies. So let's ensure that we continue to promote their growth, their importance, and their effectiveness. And there's no way to do this than through tangible projects and mutual cooperation between nations.And that is why it's so critical, I believe, to have discussions like this one, sponsored by CSIS, to explore different ways in which we can generate those projects and collaborate together as free nations. Thank you.Daniel F. Runde: Carlos, thank you so much.Ambassador Yui, Dr. Tai, Dr. Diaz is one of the most effective, most strategic public servants the U.S. has right now in government. I encourage Taiwan to call my friend, Dr. Diaz, today our friends at TECRO, and have a conversation with him, because you have it's quite clear the United States has an open door with Taiwan on this issue of culture. I encourage you to call him as soon as this is over, please. I encourage that, because I completely agree. And I've known Dr. Diaz a long time. And he's really one of our most strategic and most effective public servants. And so, Dr. Diaz, thank you for being with us today. I really appreciate it.Carlos Diaz-Rosillo: Thank you. Thank you.Daniel F. Runde: Carlos OK. Thank god for blue jeans. (Laughter.)So Carlos Arguello, you're from Guatemala. We wanted a creator, a doer. We talk about theory and grand strategy. These are all important things. I do this for a living. But we needed to talk about something that was real, and tangible, and creative because you're in the creative economy, you make a living in the creative economy, Carlos. You're Guatemalan and you have a video to show us to give us a sense of sort of what's there. So please, I'm going to start. I'd ask my friends John (sp) and company on the tech team to start the video. And then we'll give Carlos Arguello a chance to comment on his video afterwards. OK, Carlos Arguello, is that all right? It's all on you.(A video presentation is shown.)Carlos Arguello: My name is Carlos Arguello. And this is some of the educational visual aid I had in Central America when I grew up. I have dyslexia, and letters and words were very difficult for me. At 17, I left Guatemala, where I went to San Francisco to art school, where I had encounter with computers. And I started working through the mixture of art and technology.Music videos for Michael Jackson and movies like "Space Jam," "Batman and Robin," "The Mummy," "Armageddon." Then I went back to Guatemala. And I realized that there was a lot of youth with talent but no connections to the industry. We started Studio C. At that time, there was no schools in Guatemala, so everybody learned in the studio. I came back to L.A. and I started working in "Chronicles of Riddick," "The Ring," "Fast and Furious," and other big productions. Then "Chronicles of Narnia" came in. We worked on 370 shots for "Chronicles of Narnia," and it was nominated for the Oscars.Since then, we separated the studio in two a nonprofit that helps with the education and a studio to help to bring the jobs. There are several projects we would love to work with Taiwan. In Guatemala, we want to train from 100 to 500 youth to work on educational projects to revolutionize the way Central America and the rest of Latin America learns. In Colombia, we are concentrating in visual effects. Netflix have grown from doing five series to planning on doing 50 series a year. This is Always a Witch, filmed in Cartagena, and Green Frontier in the Amazons.Due to Colombian film and digital content incentives, Hollywood will produce more in Colombia. We are trying to do an additional effects studio of 100 people with Ruta N, and we're also trying to do animation studio with three known producers from Hollywood Andrew Adamson from "Narnia," Aron Warner from "Shrek," and Dan Shule (sp) from "Angry Birds." We have three movies and series in different stages of production. And finally in Colombia, a (CA ?) digital academy, a distance learning digital academy to be able to standardize the way Latin American youth learn animation and visual effects.(Video presentation ends.)Daniel F. Runde: OK. Carlos, that was fantastic. Thank you so much. There's an enormous youth bulge in Guatemala. And we need to find jobs and opportunities for young people in Guatemala. And obviously, this is I think one of the areas is the creative economy. And one of the things I've learned is, working with my friends in Taiwan, it's about creating pathways for them to participate in various parts of the creative economy. So, please, I'd welcome some additional thoughts that you have, Carlos Arguello, about this.Carlos Arguello: Yes. You know, I came into the creative economy sort of by chance. I left Guatemala when I was 17 to study art in the U.S. That's where I encountered computers, and I immediately touched computers. And my first job was with NASA and Ford Aerospace, then moving into, you know, the movies that I showed, like "Space Jam," "The Ring," "Fast and Furious," "Chronicles of Narnia," and so forth.The idea is that, basically, talent is everywhere but opportunities are not. And essentially, when I went back to Guatemala in the year 2000 I found out there was a lot of use. Basically, Latin America is a very creative country I'm sorry, continent by itself. There's a lot of writing, paintings, dancing, colors in general. And if you mix that creativity from Latin America with technology, then you can create products that you can sell not just in your country but in the region and the world. So the idea is, basically, how do we bring jobs especially to the young people in Latin America and we connect them to a global economy? And we believe that creative industries is the way to go.We concentrate mostly in what we call digital content for animation, series, movies, education. There's a lot of different levels that you can participate in the creative economies.So I've been lucky enough now, with our foundation, I've been traveling all over Latin America. I worked with Tomy International Animation for the last three years seeing animation and what's happening in Latin America, and then with Netflix in the area of visual effects. So the talent is there in Latin America. We do have issues still about connectivity in countries like Guatemala, but I also work very closely with Colombia. And Colombia, for example, in Antioquia, Medellin, we trained 2,000 youth in six months. So the talent is there. We can connect them to the global industry. And we would love to work with Taiwan, also, on several projects. I know that there's a lot of animation for education for youth that we can participate and work with. I know you have film, visual effects, technology also that we would love to share with you guys.And one of our other issues is that we don't have standardized education, so we're trying to create a long-distance digital academy to be able to teach the same in Guatemala, in Haiti, in Mexico, in Argentina, Colombia, everywhere, so then the youth can work from different countries and different places but work as a unit with the same sort of knowledge and sort of helping the numbers that the global industry needs because this industry moves with a lot of numbers. So Latin America has a lot of studios of people that have 10, 15 studios, but really over here in Los Angeles where I am the studios are 1,500 people, 2,000, and 5,000 people in one studio. So ideally, we want to increase our numbers by mixing our countries and working together. But we're open and we're glad to work with Taiwan in any of these projects.Daniel F. Runde: I love this. I love this. This is fantastic. Carlos, thanks for being with us today.I've got some really thoughtful questions from the audience. Let me start with my friend Christina Borrelli (sp). I understand that as part of the creative economy Taiwan is also hoping to be a leader in sustainable alternative activities agroforestry, et cetera to be developed in the Amazon. Is this true? Can you talk about this? Ambassador Yui, let me go to you about this, about sustainable alternative activities, agroforestry, et cetera. Do you have a do you have a comment on this, Ambassador Yui?Amb. Tah-Ray Yui: OK. Well, not in particular. We're not we haven't incurred into the Amazon yet. We haven't been invited. But if there was if there was a chance, we will be more than happy to you know, again, we have developed many technologies and sustainable. You know, Taiwan you know, the Taiwan development model, we spent a lot of time developing our industries, the first since 1949 and on until the '70s, without putting much attention to pollution, environment, et cetera. But in the early '80s we it was not until the early '80s that we set up an EPA. Imagine that. But since then, we have placed a lot of importance on environmental protection, sustainable economy, or what they call a circular economy you know, things that we recycle being given a new life. So we've been placing a lot of importance on that lately. But we're more than happy to share.But I would like to also put make some input on Dr. Tai's when she mentioned the digital or, Dan, you mentioned about the digital platform and how to use it in the creative economy, or Dr. Tai saying, well, how to make people, you know, open their purses during the lockdowns. Well, digital platform but I'll just make one example of this the combination of all of this.We have a very famous band, you know, pop band, called Mayday. You know, it's four or five guys, you know, a very popular band in Taiwan. But during our early stages of pandemia (ph), we also had lockdowns. You could not have mass concentrations such as a concert. So what they did this band, what they did was they did make a concert in a stadium, empty stadium, but they did a live concert, and then people logged on to a certain, you know, code through the internet, and they paid to see the live concert via the internet. So they actually, they were in the live event, but not physically at the in the concert stadium. But they were looking at so that was a very creative way of making money, even though people were not in the stadium.But my when I mentioned at the beginning my definition of creative economy is also like the ambassador mentioned. You know, it's not just the 38, you know, that Alejandra mentioned. But for example, in Haiti lately we've been the president has been President Mo¯se and my ambassador has been going to the countryside for what I consider a creative way of, you know, making an economy. Haiti has a chronic shortage of electricity, especially in the countryside. So what we've done in Haiti is we've set up and they also need water for irrigation. So what we've done is we've set up pumping stations using solar energy so they do not need electricity. They do not need to be wired to a power source because they have their own power source via the sun. And we have established so far 17 solar-powered pumping stations across the country, and we'll be setting up more. It has been a fabulous result because, obviously, without you know, instead of having just by hand, now we have a(n) electrical pump via solar power.Also, in Guatemala, for example, we there's a very successful program that we did in Guatemala. It's called OTOP one town, one product. Because tourists went to, you know, Antigua Guatemala, they went to Peten, they went to, you know, Atitlan, they always bought the same arts crafts. Wherever you go, you always bought the same things. You know, you said, well, there's really no difference. So what we did is we brought our own experience in Taiwan and made two (pods ?) in each town to develop their own particular arts crafts. For example, if this town is good in pottery, you know, concentrating on pottery, if you're good on, you know, woven texture, you would concentrate on that. We also taught them how to improve their products, improve their packaging, and improve their salability or whatever. And as we you know, a fairly successful project in not only in Guatemala, but also Nicaragua and Honduras.Another example, which probably will go a little farther, but in Paraguay, you know, people in Paraguay, they love to eat meat. You know, they're a meat-eating country. They eat meat breakfast, lunch, and dinner. But we brought about 10, 15 years ago we brought in an alternative to meat, which was tilapia you know, the fish, tilapia, raised fish. And nowadays, after our efforts, you can find tilapia all over the country as an alternative to beef. But at the same time, using technology, creative technology, we also helped Paraguay. They have their own indigenous kind of fish called pacu, which is sort of like well, it's a very tender beef, and also meat and also called surubi, which is a sort of local catfish which they like a lot, but they can only catch a lot in the river. So we through our technology, we were able to make it so that it can be farm-raised, you know, in captivity. And that basically changed completely the availability of this fish in Paraguay.And in my opinion or, obviously, my broader sense of creative economy it comes from that, and we've been willingly sharing these experiences with our friend countries.Daniel F. Runde: Ambassador, that's great. Why don't we I've got one last question I need to ask our colleagues. Let me to turn to Ariana (sic; Alejandra) and just give her a chance to how can a digital platform truly help fine arts and impact on the level of intimacy, authenticity of a gathered audience. Alejandra.Alejandra Luzardo: Well, sorry to talk a little bit, I wanted to go back one thing regarding the sectors, which I think is important. It's important that we actually by country define the sectors well so we can measure the impact. And this is something that will allow to you know, when we go to the governments and when we go to looking for finance, they will have to finance the sectors under the creative industry. So I wanted to make sure that this is why, from the IDB, we define this sector very specific, so we can help the countries in the region.Regarding your questions about how we can grow and how we can grow these platforms, I think there are many things that we can do regarding skills. I think there is an opportunity to learning from people like Taiwan, United States, Canada, and many other countries that have been going through that. I will say, reskilling the students in different ways, using technology for a long time, and bringing this knowledge to our region.The other thing is the volume needed, as Carlos mentioned, in order to produce a movie let's say, Shrek, you needed 300 animators only for that specific movie. Sometimes in small countries, like in the Caribbean or Paraguay, we don't have the volume. And this is why it's so important to standardize the skills, to understand what is needed to the production of this content in the digital world, so we together as a region can present these solutions and opportunities.And also one other thing that is important to mention is how we partner with these different with the private sector. Not only with the government, with the private sector. The private sector is key to help people from small companies to big companies to make sure they can understand how marketing is, how they can take this product to the next level, to the global market. And this is only be able to happen if we actually bring this company and give them opportunity to invest in our countries and to you know, and to work with them to make sure that we can export these services and products.Daniel F. Runde: Excellent. I think we have to stop there, sadly. I think we need to I promised to cut it off at 9:00. I'm sorry, Ambassador Yui and I'm sorry to the rest of the panelists. But thank you all very much. I think this was a really rich discussion. We're grateful that you all were with us today, and I need to end it here. But thank you all very, very much. This was excellent. Thank you so much.Load-Date: December 16, 2020End of Document

New Zealand joins Australia in denouncing China's tweetAssociated Press InternationalDecember 1, 2020 Tuesday 2:58 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 619 wordsByline: NICK PERRY, Associated PressDateline: WELLINGTON, New Zealand BodyWELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand has joined Australia in denouncing a graphic tweet posted by a Chinese official that shows a fake image of a grinning Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to a child’s throat.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Tuesday that New Zealand has voiced its concerns directly with Chinese authorities.“This is an image that wasn’t factual. It wasn’t correct. And so in keeping with our principled position where images like that are used, we will raise those concerns and we’ll do it directly,” Ardern told reporters.China has not backed down from the tweet and said there will be no apology.Ardern's criticism was more muted than Australia's. She faced an awkward choice of how far to get involved in a conflict between New Zealand's closest ally, Australia, and its biggest trading partner, China.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday called the image “repugnant” and demanded an apology from the Chinese government. The post took aim at alleged abuses by Australian soldiers during the conflict in Afghanistan.The incident is further souring already tense relations between Australia and China.The image, which appeared to show the soldier slitting the child’s throat, was posted by Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry. He wrote a caption with his tweet: “Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, & call for holding them accountable.”He was referring to a disturbing report by Australia’s military earlier this month which found evidence that elite Australian troops unlawfully killed 39 Afghan prisoners, farmers and civilians during the Afghanistan conflict. The report recommended that 19 soldiers be referred to federal police for criminal investigation.Asked about the issue at a daily briefing, foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying cast blame on the Australian side.“What Australia should do is to reflect deeply, bring the perpetrators to justice, make a formal apology to the Afghan people, and solemnly promise to the international community that they will never commit such terrible crimes again,” Hua said.Morrison said Zhao’s tweet was “utterly outrageous” and a terrible slur against Australia’s military.It "is truly repugnant. It is deeply offensive to every Australian, every Australian who has served in that uniform,” he told reporters in Canberra. “The Chinese government should be totally ashamed of this post. It diminishes them in the world’s eyes.”Morrison said his government contacted Twitter asking it to take the post down. The post had a warning tag on it on Tuesday but could still be viewed. Zhao’s account comes with a Twitter label stating that it’s a Chinese government account.Despite China blocking Twitter and other U.S. social media platforms within the county, Chinese diplomats and state media have established a strong presence on them.Zhao was criticized by the U.S. in March after tweeting a conspiracy theory that U.S. soldiers may have brought the coronavirus to China. He is considered a leading representative of China’s high-pitched new strain of assertive foreign relations.Morrison acknowledged there were tensions between China and Australia.“But this is not how you deal with them,” he said. “Australia has patiently sought to address the tensions that exist in our relationship in a mature way, in a responsible way, by seeking engagement at both leader and ministerial level.”The rift between the two nations has grown since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. China has since imposed tariffs and other restrictions on a number of Australian exports.Load-Date: November 30, 2020End of Document

China Bunker Fuel Markets, 2020-2025 with Profiles of Key Fuel Suppliers & Ship OwnersPR NewswireNovember 11, 2020 Wednesday 9:30 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1042 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, Nov. 11, 2020 BodyPR NewswireThe"China Bunker Fuel Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecasts (2020 - 2025)"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.The China bunker fuel market is expected to grow at a CAGR of around 4.5% during the forecast period.Factors such as high trade activities with major economies across the globe is expected to drive the market. However, as the country is a net exporter to a diversified destination, so with the outbreak of COVID-19, the global economic slowdown had a significant negative impact on the Chinese maritime industry during 2020. With the slow recovery from COVID-19 in some major export, destinations are likely to hinder the market growth during the forecast period.Trade tension between the United States and China is likely to have a negative impact on the Chinese maritime business and the country's bunker fuel market during the forecast period.Chinese Ministry of Transport plans for building infrastructure and utilizing LNG as a marine fuel by 2025 is likely to create an opportunity for the LNG marine fuel growth in the near future.The container vessels held a significant market share in 2019, and is likely to continue its dominance during the forecast period.Key Market TrendsTrade Tensions between the United States and China is Likely to Restrain the Market GrowthTrade tension began between the United States and China due to high tariffs imposed and other trade barriers on Chinese goods by the United States government in 2018.During 2018, the United States imposed a tariff of more than USD 360 billion on Chinese goods, and on retaliation, China imposed tariffs of more than USD 110 billion on United States' products. The last tariff imposed by the United States was in September 2018 on food items and various other musical instruments. The trade war continued till June 2019, when the Chinese government imposed a tariff of USD 60 billion on the United States' goods. The high tariff on both sides affected the trade and marine transportation between the countries and significantly affected the trade volume. In 2019, the trade volume of goods handled by the Chinese coastal ports decreased by nearly 0.3 billion metric tonnes compared to 9.46 billion metric tonnes in 2018. With COVID-19 outbreak, the trade war took a new dimension. The United States government considered China a primary reason for the pandemic and accused the country of suppressing vital information regarding the first virus outbreak in China. Though the conflict was not related to trading, the United States banned Chinese company, Huawei, from using United States' software and hardware in strategic semiconductor processes in May 2020. The United States also pressurized the European government to refrain from collaborating with Huawei. Thus, such a situation is expected to repeat the 2018 trade relation of the United States and China, which is likely to negatively affect the sea trade market and the marine fuel market during the forecast period.Container Vessels to Witness Significant GrowthContainer fleets are cargo ships with truck-size intermodal containers used to carry all the load. These are widely used for commercial intermodal freight transport. These are typically large, fast, and complex ships operated on a liner service.The capacity of the container fleet is measured in Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEU). These container fleets hold a capacity of 20-foot to 40-foot (2-TEU). Modern container ships today hold the ability to carry over 19,000 TEU. About 85% - 90% of the non-bulk cargo is transported through container fleets. The containerized form of freight is the preferred medium of transportation for various industrial products. Container vessels are mostly operated on China and the United States sea route, which is mostly used to transport goods like meat, toys, electrical machinery, electronic goods, etc. Ports that handle the highest number of container vessels in China are Shanghai, Shenzhen, Ningbo-Zhoushan, Guangzhou Harbor, Hong Kong, Qingdao, Tianjin, Kaohsiung, and few others. During 2019, the ports handled 231 million TEUs. With increasing trade relation with countries like Greece and Israel, and on order five new 23,000 TEU containers vessels by Orient Overseas Container Line (OOCL), it is expected to have significant growth in containers vessels traffic in Chinese ports, which is likely to a positive impact on the market growth.Key Topics Covered:1 INTRODUCTION2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY3 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY4 MARKET OVERVIEW4.1 Introduction4.2 Market Size and Demand Forecast in USD billion, till 20254.3 Recent Trends and Developments4.4 Government Policies and Regulations4.5 Market Dynamics4.5.1 Drivers4.5.2 Restraints4.6 Supply Chain Analysis4.7 PESTLE Analysis5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 Fuel Type5.1.1 High Sulfur Fuel Oil (HSFO)5.1.2 Very-low Sulfur Fuel Oil (VLSFO)5.1.3 Marine Gas Oil (MGO)5.1.4 Others5.2 Vessel Type5.2.1 Containers5.2.2 Tankers5.2.3 General Cargo5.2.4 Bulk Carrier5.2.5 Other Vessel Types6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE6.1 Mergers and Acquisitions, Joint Ventures, Collaborations, and Agreements6.2 Strategies Adopted by Leading Players6.3 Company Profiles6.3.1 Fuel Suppliers6.3.1.1 PetroChina Company Limited6.3.1.2 Sinopec Fuel Oil Sales Co.

FT: Despite Washington restrictions, China-backed funds invest in U.S. technologyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 3, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 959 wordsBodyChinese state-backed funds are still looking in the U.S. for opportunities to invest in critical technologies despite stricter restrictions on such agreements, which has raised bipartisan concern in Washington about the implications of national security.Over the past few months, Pixelworks, Black Sesame Technologies and LightIC Technologies, three companies in the sensitive U.S. semiconductor sector, have attracted investments from some of china's so-called government-led funds.Strategic investment funds, which total more than 1600, are estimated to control more than Rmb4 trillion ($610 billion) in capital, according to Chinese consultancy Zero2IPO.Financial Times: Janet Yellen is the perfect woman right nowThe United States has intensified the scrutiny of Chinese investments for fear that critical technologies and intellectual property could be stolen, with even minority investment being considered a security risk under the rules passed in 2018.Joe Biden, the president-elect of the United States, has promised to continue to take a tough line with China. However, advisers have indicated that he will be more likely to listen to the concerns of American technology companies, who argue that they have been harmed by the trade war between the world's two largest economies.Funds led by China's government are instructed by the National Development and Reform Commission, the country's leading economic planner, to invest in strategic emerging industries and advanced manufacturing sectors such as semiconductors, an area in which China is determined to reach the U.S.Two of the semiconductor investments in U.S. companies involve China's National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund (CICF), which was created by order of the country's cabinet in 2014 and was initially capitalized with $20 billion. Its largest shareholder is the Ministry of Finance.Pixelworks, a California-based, NASDAQ-listed company, said in October that a consortium of Chinese investors, which are linked to CICF, had acquired a stake. The company, which designs, develops and markets video and pixel processing semiconductors, said in a statement that the $6.6 million agreement "serves as an additional validation of the interest and opportunity to expand our technology in the Chinese market."In a separate agreement, the Beijing Xinkin Energy Investment Fund, which is partially owned by CICF, reported a 1.9% stake in the artificial intelligence company Black Sesame Technologies in September 2019, according to a Chinese government website. The Silicon Valley-based company was founded in 2016, and develops semiconductor chips that are used to improve vehicle navigation and safety.Financial Times: there is light at the end of the coronavirus tunnel to...Separately, two investors linked to government-led funds last month requested a 16.7% stake in LightIC Technologies, according to a notice on a website that is a database of Chinese tenders. The California-based company develops systems that help boost robotics and drone navigation.Chinese venture capital investments in the U.S. have plummeted since Washington strengthenedForeign Investment Committee (CFIUS), an interinstitutional committee that can block agreements for national security reasons. The new rules gave cfIUS authority to scrutinize any arrangement involving "critical technologies," such as biotechnology and semiconductors. Previously, you could only review agreements in which control changed hands. The CFIUS did not wish to comment on any specific agreements.Chinese venture capital investments in the U.S. nearly haled in 2019 to $2.5 billion, compared to 2018, according to consultancy Rhodium Group. During the first half of this year, Chinese venture capitalists invested $830 million in U.S. startup companies, according to Rhodium.Adam Lysenko, a U.S.-based Rhodium analyst, noted that it was unclear why some investments were still being made in seemingly sensitive sectors. However, he suggested that it was possible that the CFIUS had approved some agreements but that its investigations had not been made public."Chinese policy-led funds often have a mandate to invest globally in any asset that can help achieve their planned ends," Lysenko added. CICF "has a vast network of hundreds of domestic subsidiaries and is linked to foreign companies through multiple investments."News of investments in U.S. semiconductor companies sparked bipartisan criticism from U.S. senators.Financial Times: what changed in the treatment of corporations...Mark Warner, Democratic vice president of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said several U.S. companies that have accepted investments of Chinese interests have subsequently been victims of theft of their intellectual property by companies connected to Beijing.In 2019 Washington accused Huawei, the Chinese technology group, of trying to steal technology used by T-Mobile, one of its U.S. trading partners. The charges are the subject of a case under the Department of Justice."No Chinese company is completely independent of the Chinese Communist Party, especially in the cutting-edge industries in which the regime focuses," Warner said. He added that U.S. companies should be fully aware of the risks they face in partnering with them.Ted Cruz, Republican senator from Texas, said there are still "too many gaps" in U.S. regulations that allow such investments. "The Chinese Communist Party uses investment in U.S. technology startups to gain access to intellectual property, to manipulate markets, and very often to conduct brazen corporate and state espionage," Cruz said.Pixelworks, Black Sesame and LightIC did not respond to requests for comment, nor did the Ministry of Finance or china's Ministry of Commerce.Load-Date: December 4, 2020End of Document

Chinese probe lands on the moon; collects samples of lunar soilCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 2, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 431 wordsBodyChina.A Chinese probe successfully landed on the Moon on Tuesday, at a new milestone in Beijing's space program that, in this case, seeks to bring lunar soil samples back to Earth.This mission is a new stage of China'sambitious space program, which brought a remote-controlled robot to the hidden face of the Moon in early 2019, a global scoop.China has invested billions of dollars in its program, hoping to have a manned space station by 2022 and eventually send humans to the Moon.The goal of this new mission is to bring dust samples and lunar rocks, to help scientists better understand the moon's origins, its formation and volcanic activity on its surface.The Chang'e-5 probe "landed on the visible face of the Moon on Tuesday afternoon," the state Xinhua news agency said, citing the Chinese National Space Administration.If successful, China will be the third country to have extracted samples from the satellite, after the United States and the former Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s.The Chang'e-5 probe, named after a moon goddess in Chinese mythology, entered the moon's orbit on Saturday after a 112-hour journey from Earth, Xinhua said, after taking off from Hainan Province (south) last week. "Nice space dream"The Chang'e-5 probe will collect two kilos of material from the surface in an unexplored area known as Oceanus Procellarum ("Ocean of Storms"), which consists of a vast lava plain, according to the journal Nature.The ship is expected to collect the material on a lunar day, the equivalent of about 14 days on Earth.Samples will be sent to Earth in a capsule to land in China's Inner Mongolia region (north) in early or mid-December, according to NASA.This ambitious operation will also enable the Asian giant to test new technologies, crucial for sending astronauts to the lunar star by 2030.Plans for China's "space dream," as President Xi Jinping calls it, have been launched under his rule.The goal is to equate with Europe, Russia and the United States in space milestones.This is not the first time China has sent a probe to the Moon under the Chang'e program.A Chinese remote-controlled robot landed on the hidden side of the Moon in January 2019, in a global scoop that boosted Beijing's aspirations to become a space superpower.Ambitious targets set by the Chinese government include the creation of a super powerful rocket capable of delivering heavier loads than NASA and private spacex, a lunar base and a manned permanent space station.Chinese astronauts and scientists have also addressed the possibility of sending manned missions to Mars. EmbLoad-Date: December 3, 2020End of Document

Biden, China, Huawei and technologyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 13, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1011 wordsBodyWhat Joe Biden's relationship with China will be, particularly with some of his tech companies such as Huawei, is one of several unknowns of the new US government.Change or continuity? The Democratic nominee won the majority of the vote in the presidential election with a moderate speech opposed to Trump's confrontational messages. Biden is even more equal than other Democratic politicians described as "socialists" like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. The latter is in the possession of an antitrust policy that limits power and even separates large platform Internet companies.As for Chinese tech companies, will Biden take a contrasting stance with Trump and reopen the technology supply chain? Will you take a traditional position of supremacy and caution with China as happened to Obama? Will it inaugurate a new post-pandemic cooperation relationship and recognize the Asian power as an equal?Technological warfare. 2019 was the year anti Huawei. The U.S. Department of Justice accused the manufacturer of Chinese telecommunications equipment and solutions of banking fraud, trade relations with Iran, and of violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Trump signed an Executive Order declaring as a "national emergency" to secure and protect the supply chain of information and communications services and technologies from foreign threats and adversaries.Commerce blacklisted Huawei and other Chinese manufacturers prohibiting U.S. technology companies from selling or transferring components and software to the Chinese consortium. However, they are the U.S. technology companies themselves (chip manufacturers such as Qualcomm and Intel and operating system developers such as Alphabet's Android), most interested in reopening supply with the Chinese manufacturer.Huawei has been singled out from spying for the Chinese government via digital networks, in course abiding by China's State Security Act which requires "assistance with state security work." But the U.S. National Security Act of 2002 also forces communications infrastructure owners to share information with the Department of Homeland Security.Submissions. Through the State Department and its secretary, Michael Pompeo, Trump has pressured countries to ban their operators from using Huawei equipment on their networks, calling them "clean operators." This intervention has been successful in countries such as the United Kingdom, where without evidence of security flaws, the government blocked the Chinese developer.Huawei has been a leader in the deployment of 5G networks, with nearly 100 contracts with telecom operators around the world and having the largest number of patents (13,474) for 5G (GreyB).A study by Assembly Research estimates that Huawei's total ban on the UK telecommunications value chain would delay the benefits of a 5G national network by 2 years at a cost of between 4.5 and 6.8 billion pounds. Another Oxford Economics study estimates that restricting a key 5G infrastructure provider would increase investment costs by 8-29%.Resistances. But the balance of power has already changed. Following adverse results for Trump in the November 3 election, Brazil's four major telecom operators (Vivo, Claro, TIM and Oi) rejected an invitation to meet keith Krach, Undersecretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and Environment, during their visit to the country on November 9, "about the current scenario5G in Brazil and its outlook in the short and medium term."Prior to the election, Brazil signed an agreement with the U.S. Export and Import Bank, EximBank, which guarantees a billion-dollar line of credit to acquire 5G equipment in the country, except Huawei. The Chinese Embassy in Brazil noted that the U.S. spreads "political lies" to disrupt Chinese-Brazilian cooperation.Even with a "supporter" Bagaro of Trump's policies, Brazil is an example that the U.S. can no longer pressure governments to have their telecommunications companies ban Huawei equipment on future 5G networks.Different from Trump. Some signs indicate that Biden is different from Trump and could act differently than the Republican did. Biden is angry with Facebook because he continued to disseminate missing information in a case involving the Republican candidate's son with Ukraine. Trump was less severe in his criticism of Facebook as he was against Twitter. Biden has stated that Mark Zuckerberg and his social network must be subjected to civil liability for spreading falsehoods with knowledge of the cause.Diplomacy. They also tell the diplomatic background to China when Biden was Vice President during Barack Obama's administration. One of Obama's diplomatic priorities was the "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategy, which caused tension with the Asian giant. During his rule, China outperded the U.S. in industrial production, which had a major impact on U.S. leadership. Obama visited China in November 2009, the first year of his presidency. China surpassed the United States as the largest economy in 2014. At the end of 2015, China's total manufacturing output accounted for 150% of that of the US. As of mid-2016, China's GDP was already 12% higher than that of the American Union.In an interview with ABC television, Biden said the main threat to the U.S. was Russia (which takes him away from Trump, who shook ties with Vladimir Putin) and acknowledged that his biggest competitor was China. He clarified, "Depending on how we handle that, it will determine whether we are competitors or end up in a more serious force-related competition."Barney Frank, a former congressman for 16 terms and former chairman of the House Finance Committee, told Asia Times that it will not change America's rhetoric toward China, but the Biden administration would ease some of the technological restrictions in exchange for Chinese concessions. Sounds logical. After a speculative silence of nearly a week, China finally congratulated Biden on his election victory.*The author is President of the Mexican Information Rights Association (Amedi).Twitter: @beltmondiLoad-Date: November 14, 2020End of Document

China Bunker Fuel Market Report 2020 - Growth, Trends, and Forecasts to 2025 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireNovember 4, 2020 Wednesday 12:13 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 962 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "China Bunker Fuel Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecasts (2020 - 2025)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The China bunker fuel market is expected to grow at a CAGR of around 4.5% during the forecast period.Factors such as high trade activities with major economies across the globe is expected to drive the market. However, as the country is a net exporter to a diversified destination, so with the outbreak of COVID-19, the global economic slowdown had a significant negative impact on the Chinese maritime industry during 2020. With the slow recovery from COVID-19 in some major export, destinations are likely to hinder the market growth during the forecast period.Trade tension between the United States and China is likely to have a negative impact on the Chinese maritime business and the country's bunker fuel market during the forecast period.Chinese Ministry of Transport plans for building infrastructure and utilizing LNG as a marine fuel by 2025 is likely to create an opportunity for the LNG marine fuel growth in the near future.The container vessels held a significant market share in 2019, and is likely to continue its dominance during the forecast period.Key Market TrendsTrade Tensions between the United States and China is Likely to Restrain the Market GrowthTrade tension began between the United States and China due to high tariffs imposed and other trade barriers on Chinese goods by the United States government in 2018.• During 2018, the United States imposed a tariff of more than USD 360 billion on Chinese goods, and on retaliation, China imposed tariffs of more than USD 110 billion on United States' products.• The last tariff imposed by the United States was in September 2018 on food items and various other musical instruments. The trade war continued till June 2019, when the Chinese government imposed a tariff of USD 60 billion on the United States' goods.• The high tariff on both sides affected the trade and marine transportation between the countries and significantly affected the trade volume. In 2019, the trade volume of goods handled by the Chinese coastal ports decreased by nearly 0.3 billion metric tonnes compared to 9.46 billion metric tonnes in 2018.• With COVID-19 outbreak, the trade war took a new dimension. The United States government considered China a primary reason for the pandemic and accused the country of suppressing vital information regarding the first virus outbreak in China.• Though the conflict was not related to trading, the United States banned Chinese company, Huawei, from using United States' software and hardware in strategic semiconductor processes in May 2020. The United States also pressurized the European government to refrain from collaborating with Huawei. Thus, such a situation is expected to repeat the 2018 trade relation of the United States and China, which is likely to negatively affect the sea trade market and the marine fuel market during the forecast period.Container Vessels to Witness Significant GrowthContainer fleets are cargo ships with truck-size intermodal containers used to carry all the load. These are widely used for commercial intermodal freight transport. These are typically large, fast, and complex ships operated on a liner service.• The capacity of the container fleet is measured in Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEU). These container fleets hold a capacity of 20-foot to 40-foot (2-TEU). Modern container ships today hold the ability to carry over 19,000 TEU.• About 85% - 90% of the non-bulk cargo is transported through container fleets. The containerized form of freight is the preferred medium of transportation for various industrial products.• Container vessels are mostly operated on China and the United States sea route, which is mostly used to transport goods like meat, toys, electrical machinery, electronic goods, etc.• Ports that handle the highest number of container vessels in China are Shanghai, Shenzhen, Ningbo-Zhoushan, Guangzhou Harbor, Hong Kong, Qingdao, Tianjin, Kaohsiung, and few others. During 2019, the ports handled 231 million TEUs.• With increasing trade relation with countries like Greece and Israel, and on order five new 23,000 TEU containers vessels by Orient Overseas Container Line (OOCL), it is expected to have significant growth in containers vessels traffic in Chinese ports, which is likely to a positive impact on the market growth.Key Topics Covered:1 INTRODUCTION2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY3 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY4 MARKET OVERVIEW4.1 Introduction4.2 Market Size and Demand Forecast in USD billion, till 20254.3 Recent Trends and Developments4.4 Government Policies and Regulations4.5 Market Dynamics4.5.1 Drivers4.5.2 Restraints4.6 Supply Chain Analysis4.7 PESTLE Analysis5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 Fuel Type5.1.1 High Sulfur Fuel Oil (HSFO)5.1.2 Very-low Sulfur Fuel Oil (VLSFO)5.1.3 Marine Gas Oil (MGO)5.1.4 Others5.2 Vessel Type5.2.1 Containers5.2.2 Tankers5.2.3 General Cargo5.2.4 Bulk Carrier5.2.5 Other Vessel Types6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE6.1 Mergers and Acquisitions, Joint Ventures, Collaborations, and Agreements6.2 Strategies Adopted by Leading Players6.3 Company Profiles6.3.1 Fuel Suppliers6.3.1.1 PetroChina Company Limited6.3.1.2 Sinopec Fuel Oil Sales Co.

Australian leader calls China's graphic tweet 'repugnant'Associated Press InternationalNovember 30, 2020 Monday 9:26 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 511 wordsByline: NICK PERRY, Associated PressDateline: WELLINGTON, New Zealand BodyWELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Australia’s prime minister said Monday that a Chinese official’s tweet showing a fake image of an Australian soldier appearing to slit a child’s throat was “truly repugnant” and merits an apology.China said there would be no apology.The incident is further souring already tense relations between the two nations. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he was seeking an apology from the Chinese government after Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry, posted the graphic image that shows a grinning soldier holding a bloodied knife to the throat of a veiled child, who is holding a lamb.Zhao wrote a caption with the tweet saying: “Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, & call for holding them accountable.”He was referring to a disturbing report by Australia’s military earlier this month which found evidence that elite Australian troops unlawfully killed 39 Afghan prisoners, farmers and civilians during the conflict in Afghanistan. It recommended that 19 soldiers be referred to federal police for criminal investigation.Asked about the issue at a daily briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying cast blame on the Australian side.“What Australia should do is to reflect deeply, bring the perpetrators to justice, make a formal apology to the Afghan people, and solemnly promise to the international community that they will never commit such terrible crimes again,” Hua said.Morrison said Zhao's tweet was “utterly outrageous” and a terrible slur against Australia's military.It “is truly repugnant. It is deeply offensive to every Australian, every Australian who has served in that uniform,” he told reporters in Canberra. “The Chinese government should be totally ashamed of this post. It diminishes them in the world’s eyes.”Morrison said his government had contacted Twitter asking it to take the post down. The post had a warning tag on it by Monday afternoon but could still be viewed. Zhao's account comes with a Twitter label stating that it's a Chinese government account.Despite China blocking Twitter and other U.S. social media platforms within the county, Chinese diplomats and state media have established a strong presence on them.Zhao was criticized by the U.S. in March after tweeting a conspiracy theory that U.S. soldiers may have brought the coronavirus to China. He is considered a leading representative of China’s high-pitched new strain of assertive foreign relations.Morrison acknowledged there were tensions between China and Australia.“But this is not how you deal with them," he said. “Australia has patiently sought to address the tensions that exist in our relationship in a mature way, in a responsible way, by seeking engagement at both leader and ministerial level.”The rift between the two nations has grown since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. China has since imposed tariffs and other restrictions on a number of Australian exports.Load-Date: November 30, 2020End of Document

China testing blunders stemmed from secret deals with firmsAssociated Press InternationalDecember 3, 2020 Thursday 12:52 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 3758 wordsByline: DAKE KANG, Associated PressDateline: WUHAN, China BodyWUHAN, China (AP) — In the early days in Wuhan, the first city struck by the virus, getting a COVID test was so difficult that residents compared it to winning the lottery.Throughout the Chinese city in January, thousands of people waited in hours-long lines for hospitals, sometimes next to corpses lying in hallways. But most couldn’t get the test they needed to be admitted as patients. And for the few who did, the tests were often faulty, resulting in false negatives.The widespread test shortages and problems at a time when the virus could have been slowed were caused largely by secrecy and cronyism at China’s top disease control agency, an Associated Press investigation has found.The flawed testing system prevented scientists and officials from seeing how fast the virus was spreading — another way China fumbled its early response to the virus. Earlier AP reporting showed how top Chinese leaders delayed warning the public and withheld information from the World Health Organization, supplying the most comprehensive picture yet of China’s initial missteps. Taken together, these mistakes in January facilitated the virus' spread through Wuhan and across the world undetected, in a pandemic that has now sickened more than 64 million people and killed almost 1.5 million.China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention gave test kit designs and distribution rights exclusively to three then-obscure Shanghai companies with which officials had personal ties, the reporting found. The deals took place within a culture of backdoor connections that quietly flourished in an underfunded public health system, according to the investigation, which was based on interviews with more than 40 doctors, CDC employees, health experts, and industry insiders, as well as hundreds of internal documents, contracts, messages and emails obtained by the AP.The Shanghai companies — GeneoDx Biotech, Huirui Biotechnology, and BioGerm Medical Technology -- paid the China CDC for the information and the distribution rights, according to two sources with knowledge of the transaction who asked to remain anonymous to avoid retribution. The price: One million RMB ($146,600) each, the sources said. It’s unclear whether the money went to specific individuals.In the meantime, the CDC and its parent agency, the National Health Commission, tried to prevent other scientists and organizations from testing for the virus with their own homemade kits. In a departure from past practice for at least two epidemics, the NHC told Wuhan hospitals to send virus samples — from which tests can be developed — only to central labs under its authority. It also made testing requirements to confirm coronavirus cases much more complicated, and endorsed only test kits made by the Shanghai companies.These measures contributed to not a single new case being reported by Chinese authorities between Jan. 5 and 17, even though retrospective infection data shows that hundreds were infected. The apparent lull in cases meant officials were slow to take early actions such as warning the public, barring large gatherings and curbing travel. One study estimates that intervention two weeks earlier could have reduced the number of cases by 86 percent, although it's uncertain whether earlier action could have halted the spread of the virus worldwide.When tests from the three companies arrived, many didn’t work properly, turning out inconclusive results or false negatives. And technicians were hesitant to use test kits that would later prove more accurate from more established companies, because the CDC did not endorse them.With few and faulty kits, only one in 19 infected people in Wuhan was tested and found positive as of Jan. 31, according to an estimate by Imperial College London. Others without tests or with false negatives were sent back home, where they could spread the virus.Days after he first started coughing on Jan. 23rd, Peng Yi, a 39-year-old schoolteacher, waited in an eight-hour line at a Wuhan hospital. A CT scan showed signs of viral infection in both his lungs, but he couldn’t get the test he needed to be hospitalized.When Peng finally got a test on Jan. 30, it turned out negative. But his fever wouldn’t drop, and his family begged officials for another test.His second test, on Feb. 4, turned out positive. It was too late. Weeks later, Peng passed away.“There were very, very few tests, basically none\u2026.if you couldn’t prove you were positive, you couldn’t get admitted to a hospital,” his mother, Zhong Hanneng, said in a tearful interview in October. “The doctor said there was nothing that could be done.”China was hardly the only country to grapple with testing, which varied widely from nation to nation. Germany, for example, developed a test that became the World Health Organization gold standard days after the Chinese government released genetic sequences on Jan. 12. But in the U.S., the CDC declined to use the WHO design and insisted on developing its own kits, which turned out to be faulty and led to even longer delays than in China.Other countries also had the benefit of learning from China’s experience. But China was grappling with a new pathogen, and it wasn’t yet clear how bad the pandemic would be or how many tests would be needed.“It was very early,” said Jane Duckett, a professor at the University of Glasgow examining the Chinese government’s response to the coronavirus. She said the government was “just trying to figure it out.”Still, the hiccups and delays in China were especially consequential because it was the first country to detect the virus.“Because you have only three companies providing testing kits, it kept the capacity of testing very limited,” said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. “It was a major problem that led to the rapid increase in cases and deaths.”China’s foreign ministry and China’s top medical agency, the National Health Commission, did not respond to requests for comment.“We did a brilliant job, we worked so hard,” said Gao Fu, the head of China CDC, in a videoconference in July. “Unluckily, unfortunately, this virus we are facing, it’s so special.”__________None of the first three diagnostics companies tapped to make test kits for the biggest pandemic in a century were well-known in the industry. For one engineer from a Wuhan-based diagnostics firm, the Shanghai competitors popped out of nowhere “like bamboo shoots” – all the more so because his company had the factories and expertise to produce testing kits in the city where the virus was first detected.“We were surprised, it was very strange,” the engineer said, declining to be named to speak on a sensitive topic. “We hadn’t heard about it at all, and then suddenly there’s test kits from certain companies you have to use, and you can’t use ones from anyone else?”BioGerm was officially founded just over three years ago in a conference room, where the CEO mulled how to survive in a small and crowded market for test kits. GeneoDx had fewer than 100 employees, according to Tianyancha, a Chinese corporate records database – compared to competitors that employ hundreds or even thousands of staff.But what the companies lacked in resources or experience, they made up for in connections.Company posts, along with hundreds of internal emails and documents obtained by The Associated Press, show extensive ties between the three companies and top China CDC researchers in Beijing and Shanghai. Chinese regulators barred AP attempts to obtain credit reports on the companies, saying they were classified as “confidential enterprises” during the outbreak.Despite China’s efforts over the years to reform public health and push for open bidding in a competitive marketplace, medical companies still cultivate personal relationships with officials to secure deals, according to seven executives from different competitors. Under President Xi Jinping, China has cracked down on corruption, but industry insiders say a lack of firm boundaries between public and private in China’s health system can create opportunities for graft.It’s unclear whether the agreements between the China CDC and the three test kit companies violated Chinese law.They raise questions around potential violations of bribery laws, along with rules against abuse of authority, self-dealing and conflicts of interest, said James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based corporate attorney and former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. Even amid the uncertainty of the pandemic, “there is no excuse for the flow of cash from these companies to the CDC,” he said.Chinese bribery laws also state that any financial transaction has to be recorded and documented clearly. The AP was unable to ascertain whether the agreements between the CDC and the Shanghai companies were documented, but a CDC employee with access to some of the agency’s finances said there was no record of them.Despite the questions around bribery, other experts caution that the state may have designated the three companies to make test kits under special laws on the procurement of emergency goods during major natural disasters. The Chinese government is pushing to cultivate domestic companies focused on emergency response technologies, including test kits, to protect its national interest.“Things will be different in the middle of a crisis,” said Lesli Ligorner, a Beijing-based attorney specializing in anti-corruption law. “Anything affecting the national interest can be deemed to be of utmost importance for special regulations... I wouldn’t be so quick to rush to judgement.”China CDC guidelines state that the agency is responsible for maintaining a reserve of testing chemicals to screen for rare pathogens, but do not specify how to procure them. An AP search of CDC procurement bids did not turn up any records, even though some other emergency procurements were publicly documented.Funding for the China CDC has stagnated in recent years, and researchers there often earn far lower wages than in the private sector. Many employees have departed for private sector jobs over the past decade, draining its labs of talent.Among those who left was BioGerm’s founder, Zhao Baihui, the former chief technician of the Shanghai CDC’s microbiology lab. Emails and financial records obtained by the AP show that Zhao first started BioGerm’s predecessor through an intermediary in 2012, while she was still at the Shanghai CDC. In the next five years, she sold thousands of dollars’ worth of test kits to her own workplace through the intermediary even as she herself was at times in charge of purchasing, internal emails, records and contracts obtained by the AP show.After quitting the CDC in 2017, Zhao spearheaded lucrative contracts with government officials – such as one worth 400,000 RMB ($60,000) with Shanghai customs officials where her husband worked, and another worth 55,500 RMB ($8,400) with CDC officials in Shanghai’s Pudong district, the emails and contracts show. Zhao declined to speak when reached by phone, and did not respond to an emailed request for comment.Another of the three companies, GeneoDx, enjoyed special access because it is a subsidiary of the state-run firm SinoPharm, which is managed directly by China’s cabinet. Before the outbreak, GeneoDx largely imported kits and acquired foreign technology to expand its business rather than develop its own products, according to company posts and a China CDC employee familiar with its operations.In October 2019, GeneoDx co-organized an internal CDC training conference on emerging respiratory diseases in Shanghai. Tan Wenjie, the CDC official who ran the training, was later put in charge of developing test kits, according to an internal document the AP obtained. In November, the company won a contract to sell 900,000 RMB ($137,000) worth of test kits to Tan’s institute.GeneoDx did not respond to requests for comment or interviews. The National Health Commission did not respond to a request for a comment or an interview with Tan.Also in attendance at the invitation-only event was BioGerm, as well as other companies that used the conference to promote their products, blurring the line between the government and the private sector. China CDC staff were invited to join a BioGerm group on WeChat, a Chinese messaging application, which CEO Zhao later used to sell coronavirus test kits, according to a CDC employee and a screenshot seen by the AP.The last company, Huirui, is a longtime partner with Tan, the CDC official in charge of test kits. Its founder, Li Hui, coauthored a paper with Tan on coronavirus tests in 2012 and “jointly developed” a test kit for the MERS outbreak in 2015 with Tan’s institute.In an interview, CEO Li said the CDC routinely contracted with his company to make emergency testing chemicals. He said Tan’s lab at the China CDC had contacted him on Jan. 4 or 5 to make testing chemicals for the coronavirus based on CDC designs. He denied any personal relationship with Tan or any payments to the CDC.“We’ve been working with the CDC to respond to emerging new diseases for about ten years, not just for a day or two, it’s normal,” Li said.Their connections situated the three little-known companies in prime position in January, when a then-unknown pathogen was about to sweep the country and the world and change their fortunes._________The first step in making test kits is to get samples of the virus and decode its genetic sequence. This leads to test designs, essentially a recipe for the tests.In the past, such as with H7N9 in 2013, the China CDC sent test designs to laboratories across the country just days after identifying the pathogen. It also shipped along the chemical compounds needed – in effect the ingredients – for hospitals and CDC branches to mix their own test kits as soon as possible.At first it looked like the China CDC was using the same playbook this time. The CDC had found the genetic map, or genome, of the virus by Jan. 3. By the next day, under CDC official Tan, the Emergency Technology Center at its Institute for Viral Disease Control had come up with test designs.But this time, the government held back information about the genome and test designs. Instead, the China CDC finalized “technology transfer” agreements to give the test designs to the three Shanghai companies, according to four people familiar with the matter. The selection process was kept secret.The CDC did not have the authority to altogether prevent other scientists with competing agencies and companies from getting samples through back door routes and coming up with their own test recipes. But it tried to stymie such efforts and stop testing from being carried out.For example, Dr. Shi Zhengli, a renowned coronavirus expert at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, obtained patient samples on her own, found the genome from them and came up with a test by Jan. 3, according to a slideshow presentation she gave in March. But her lab fell under the jurisdiction of a competing agency to the CDC, the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology. The CDC barred her from obtaining more samples and testing for cases.“There’s no open collaboration mechanism,” said a public health expert who often works with the China CDC, declining to be named for fear of damaging relations there. “Everyone wants their turf.”Provincial CDC staff were told that instead of testing and reporting cases themselves, they had to send patient samples to designated labs in Beijing for full sequencing, a complicated and time-consuming procedure. Otherwise, the cases would not be counted in the national coronavirus tally.“It was absolutely abnormal,” said a CDC lab technician, who declined to be identified out of fear of retribution. “They were totally trying to make it harder for us to report any confirmed cases.”In secret evaluations of test kits on Jan. 10, the CDC also approved only those from the three Shanghai companies, according to internal plans and instructions obtained by the AP.The Chinese government finally made its genomes public on Jan. 12, a day after another team published one without authorization. That opened the door for more companies to make their own test kits. However, China’s top health agency, the National Health Commission, still urged medical staff to buy the test kits from Huirui, BioGerm and GeneoDx that the CDC had validated, according to internal instructions obtained by the AP.The evaluations and selections of test kits were conducted with the knowledge and direction of China’s top health official, Ma Xiaowei, according to a CDC post on Jan. 13.On Jan. 14, Ma held an internal teleconference to order secret preparations for a pandemic, as AP earlier reported. After that, China’s health authorities relaxed the requirements to confirm cases and started distributing the CDC-sanctioned test kits. BioGerm began taking orders from provincial CDC staff across the country on WeChat, a Chinese social media application.“We’ve been entrusted by the national CDC to issue kits for you,” Zhao said, according to a screenshot of one of the group chats obtained by The Associated Press.“Quick! Give me, give me,” said one staffer in the Sichuan CDC.But the kits from GeneoDx kept showing inconclusive results, the CDC technician told the AP, and eventually her superior ordered her to toss them aside. The kits from Huirui were also unreliable, and the only ones that worked consistently were from BioGerm, she said.“The quality was not good. Bad, poor quality,” said a public health expert familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified to avoid damaging ties with the China CDC. “But because they had a collaboration with the (CDC) Institute for Viral Disease Control and\u2026 they paid a million yuan, they were on the list.”BioGerm’s test kits were more dependable in part because they used chemicals from Invitrogen, a subsidiary of U.S. biotech giant Thermo Fisher. Huirui and GeneoDx used their own mixes instead, with more unreliable results.Much larger competitors, including Chinese genetics giant BGI and Tianlong, developed their own kits in January, which were later found to be more effective than those made by the Shanghai companies. But those test kits weren’t endorsed by the China CDC.“No test protocol, no primers and probes, then of course there’s no way to confirm cases,” said another China CDC employee who declined to be identified for fear of retribution. “And then, all of a sudden, you tell all the CDCs: purchase from these companies, now go for it. Then – chaos and shortage. Valuable time wasted.”Chen Weijun, BGI’s chief infectious disease scientist, also said the early products recommended by the China CDC had “quality problems.” When asked why the China CDC selected the three Shanghai companies, Chen demurred.“You better ask the CDC this question,” said Chen, who collaborated with CDC researchers to publish the first paper on the virus. “But actually, everyone understands what’s going on, why this happened, right? You can reach your own conclusions, right?”____________A day after the first test kits finally arrived in Wuhan on Jan. 16, the case count began to rise again. But test kits were scarce. Some other cities in the same province didn’t get kits until Jan. 22, and even those were often flawed.Samples from 213 patients in February using GeneoDx tests suggested a false-negative rate of over 30 percent, a study by Shenzhen doctors found. A March clinical trial report showed that among the test kits certified at the time, GeneoDx was the worst performer, followed by BioGerm. In general, the rate of false negatives for COVID tests varies widely, from 2% to more than 37%.Philippe Klein, a French doctor who treated foreign patients in Wuhan during the outbreak, estimated that about 20 percent of the tests turned up false negatives. Still, he said, delays in producing accurate tests kits are natural at the start of an outbreak.“The Chinese did a lot in a short time,” Klein said. “It was a new test, so in the beginning, there was a lack of tests, of course.”On Jan. 22, the National Health Commission quietly removed the names of the three Shanghai companies from its coronavirus guide as preferred distributors. After the Chinese government ordered Wuhan shut down on Jan. 23, the three companies faced massive logistical hurdles to getting their tests in.On Jan. 26, officials set up a fast-track “green channel” for companies to get their test kits approved. The National Medical Products Administration approved test kits from seven companies, including BioGerm and GeneoDx but not Huirui. Li, Huirui’s CEO, said it was because his company was inexperienced in obtaining regulatory approvals for commercial tests.But it took time for other companies to ramp up production and ship tests in, leaving Wuhan struggling to meet demand into early February and depriving many residents of treatment.Peng died on Feb. 19. His mother now passes the days gazing blankly out her window, sobbing and lighting candles in his memory.“In the eyes of officials, he was like a grain of sand or a blade of grass. But in our home, he was our sky, he was our everything,” Zhong said. “Without him, we can never be happy again.”The same pandemic that killed Peng brought the Shanghai test kit companies and related scientists fame and fortune.In September, Tan, the China CDC researcher in charge of developing test kits, was appointed the inaugural director of a new National Novel Coronavirus Center. In a nationally televised ceremony, GeneoDx’s parent firm won plaudits from President Xi for “outstanding” contributions in the struggle against COVID-19, including developing a test kit.Huirui has expanded and is now selling commercial test kits for the first time — not in China, but in Latin America, CEO Li said. And the pandemic has allowed BioGerm to “stand out,” reaching its business targets much faster than planned, said top marketing executive Guo Xiaoling at a trade show in late August at a five-star hotel.“Because of the epidemic, 2020 has been a really special year,” Guo said. “The country and the economy suffered major damage.

Trump bans US investment in Chinese military-linked firmsAssociated Press Financial WireNovember 13, 2020 Friday 10:09 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; INTERNATIONAL NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 643 wordsByline: JOE McDONALD, AP Business WriterDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump has stepped up a conflict with China over security and technology by barring Americans from investing in companies that U.S. officials say are owned or controlled by the Chinese military.The Chinese government accused Washington of misusing national security as an excuse to hamper competition and warned Friday that Trump's order would hurt U.S. and other investors worldwide.The impact of Thursday's order wasn't immediately clear but it could add to pressure on companies including telecom equipment giant Huawei and video surveillance provider Hikvision that already face U.S. export bans and other sanctions.It is Trump's first major action toward China since he lost his reelection bid to challenger Joe Biden. Economists and political analysts had said that even if Trump was defeated he was likely to launch more actions against Beijing before leaving office on Jan. 20.Political analysts expect little change in policy under Biden due to widespread frustration with China’s trade and human rights records and accusations of spying and technology theft.China's foreign ministry on Friday accused Washington of “wantonly suppressing Chinese companies under the pretext of national security” and violating market principles.“The U.S. government maliciously slandered China’s military-civilian integration development policy out of political motives and abused national power to unreasonably suppress Chinese companies," said a foreign ministry spokesman, Wang Wenbin."This move will not only seriously damage the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, but will also damage the interests of investors from all countries, including the United States," Wang said.He said Beijing will “firmly safeguard" the rights of Chinese companies, a statement Beijing often makes following unwelcome U.S. policy changes but that often results in no action.U.S. officials complain China’s ruling Communist Party takes advantage of access to American technology and investment to expand its military, already one of the world’s biggest and most heavily armed.Thursday’s order said the companies targeted “directly support” the Chinese military, intelligence and security apparatus. It said Beijing “exploits United States investors” to finance military development by selling securities in American and foreign financial markets.The order bars American investors from conducting any transactions in publicly traded securities issued by any Chinese companies designated by the secretary of defense as being linked to the Communist Party’s military wing, the People’s Liberation Army.The Pentagon earlier designated 31 companies as being owned or controlled by the Chinese military. Many are military contractors or state-owned companies such as phone carrier China Telecom Ltd. But the list also includes Huawei Technologies Ltd. and Hikvision Digital Technology Co., which say they are private and deny they are controlled by the military.Hikvision criticized its inclusion in Thursday's order as unjustified. The company said it is independent of the PLA and never has participated in research and development for “military applications.”“As we have shown time and again, Hikvision is not a ‘Chinese military company,'” a Hikvision statement said. “These punitive actions against the company do not make America, or the world, any safer.”Most of those companies have no shares traded in the United States but many sell stocks, bonds and other securities in markets outside mainland China that are accessible to American investors.Sales made to divest securities of those companies will be allowed until one year from now on Nov. 11, 2021.___White House order: https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-securities-investments-finance-communist-chinese-military-companies/Load-Date: November 13, 2020End of Document

China's slur on Australian soldiers is just the latest step in a long campaign by BeijingCNN WireDecember 2, 2020 Wednesday 1:38 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1297 wordsDateline: SYDNEY, Australia (CNN) BodySYDNEY, Australia (CNN) --  An Australian soldier appears to hold an Afghan child's head against a backdrop of their two national flags, threatening to slit the youngster's throat with a bloody knife. The child's face is horrified. The soldier has a cruel grin.The illustration, which the Australian government has called "repugnant," first received global attention Monday when it was posted on the verified Twitter account of Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian. When Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison demanded an apology, the Chinese government refused.It comes after a long-awaited official report released on November 19 alleged that elite Australian forces killed 39 civilians and prisoners during the war in Afghanistan.At first glance, the image appears to be part of a growing diplomatic clash between the two countries.Relations have been frosty for years but deteriorated further this year after Morrison in April called for an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. The Chinese government dubbed Morrison's proposal "political manipulation."But it isn't just about Australia. Experts say it bears the hallmarks of a long campaign by Beijing to distract from its own human rights abuses and polish a narrative that, unlike the US and its allies, the Chinese government is interested only in peace and non-intervention with the international community."It's certainly aimed at Australia ... but it is also aimed at telling the world the terrible things that the US and its allies do around the world," said Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.It's a message, experts say China hopes will appeal to some developing nations -- especially those critical of Western military intervention in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq. In the image, the Australian soldier holding the bloody knife appears to say: "Don't be afraid. We are coming to bring you peace."Publicly, Beijing's messages to the world is that it will avoid using its military to interfere in another nation's domestic affairs -- unlike Washington. Rather than telling them how to run their country, the Chinese government offers "win-win" economic cooperation and trade.This has been China's stated policy for decades -- Beijing has long pledged that two of the central pillars in its foreign policy are international peace and non-intervention in domestic affairs.In a 2019 white paper released by China's State Council, the country's top administrative government body, Beijing stated that China would "never interfere in the domestic affairs of others.""China stands for the equality of all countries, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, and opposes the law of the jungle that leaves the weak at the mercy of the strong," the paper said.This diplomatic stance hopes to both protect China's ruling Communist Party from any international attempts at interference while also trying to differentiate it from its main competitor, the United States."This is a theme which has been repeated over the past couple of years that is being told to a global audience. (Beijing says) China is a good partner, the US is not. China's reliable and the US is not. China wants to help build a world which will benefit everyone, and the US is just selfish and interested in serving its own interest," Glaser said.While many countries will take a dim view of this, experts say Beijing is clearly hoping it will act as a lure for developing nations which might find the trade and large loans that China offers attractive -- especially when it comes without the rhetoric of human rights usually pushed by the US.As an example, China has become one of Africa's largest creditors in recent years, lending hundreds of billions of dollars to governments to build roads, railways and ports. It's also been promising to write off a small part of that debt as countries on the continent battle the Covid-19 pandemic.The Chinese government also has a long history of highlighting human rights abuses committed by the United States and other Western powers to distract from its own record of human and civil rights abuses.Since 2003, China has regularly released a human rights report specifically targeted at the US, focused on racial discrimination, gun violence and the gap between the rich and poor in America. In November, amid a growing feud with Australia, a Chinese embassy official told local media he would raise Australia's record on indigenous peoples' rights and aged care at international bodies.Elaine Pearson, Australia director for Human Rights Watch, said the only time her organization heard Chinese officials quoting their reports was when they related to the US."Now we're seeing that pattern of selectively calling out human rights violations also applying to Australia," she said.While Pearson said the allegations against Australian SAS soldiers in Afghanistan were very serious, she added it was "quite a surprise" to see China calling for action on the subject. In the past year alone, the Chinese government has faced international criticism over allegations of mass imprisonment and re-education of Muslim minorities in the western region of Xinjiang and an ongoing crackdown on civil rights in the financial hub of Hong Kong.Beijing has defended its actions in both cases. The Xinjiang government has repeatedly denied allegations that it is holding up to two million Muslim majority citizens in re-education centers, saying instead that it is providing vocational training as part of a deradicalization program.In Hong Kong, Beijing holds that the city is part of China and how it handles it is their own domestic affairs."It's breathtakingly hypocritical for China to be talking about accountability and the need for perpetrators to be held to account," Pearson said.It is unlikely that this particular image was part of a specific disinformation campaign or a considered strategy. China does not have a sophisticated internet propaganda presence like its political ally Russia, which also called out Australia in the past week for its alleged actions in Afghanistan.Australia's trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said on ABC News Australia that the government had shown "degree of accountability and transparency through the review we have undertaken ... that is sorely lacking in a number of other countries."But the post follows broad themes which the Chinese government has encouraged and promoted particularly in recent years through "Wolf Warrior" diplomats like the original poster Zhao, a new breed of foreign policy official who regularly hit back hard on social media and any perceived criticism of China or the Communist Party.What's more, the virulent reaction to the image and the widespread coverage of the controversy may have drawn even more attention to allegations of Australian war crimes in Afghanistan, a result which will likely be welcomed by the Chinese government."How many people knew about the report before? Well many more people know about it now because of this image," Glaser said.In a press conference on Monday, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying bluntly rejected Australian PM Morrison's call for an apology."The Australian side has been reacting so strongly to my colleague's tweet. Why is that? Do they think that their merciless killing of Afghan civilians is justified but the condemnation of such ruthless brutality is not?" she said.Hua then combined her refusal to apologize with a callback to the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States, which Beijing has often referenced in its reports on human rights in America."Afghan lives matter," she said.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

China Dairy Market & Forecast Report 2020-2026: Product, Production & Consumption Volume, Import, Export Volume, & Company Analysis - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireNovember 13, 2020 Friday 3:28 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 626 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "China Dairy Market & Forecast by Type (Liquid Milk, Milk Powder, Other), Product, Production & Consumption Volume, Import, Export Volume, & Company Analysis" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.China Dairy Market will reach US$ 176 Billion by 2026.China is one of the world's largest dairy consumers for the last few decades. Dairy consumption has increased in China with the growth in per capita income annually. Past decades have seen a soar in China dairy production and consumption. The government of China has been issuing new plans, policies, and regulations to modernize production, improve food safety and quality. China is not self-sufficient in dairy production, and their productivity is also declining from the past few years, so imports fulfill the majority of dairy demands.In China, leading dairy products are yogurt, liquid milk, and infant milk formula. In 2019, yogurt and milk powder showed the fastest growth of these major categories. Food safety issues have significantly changed Chinese consumer choices. The Upper and middle class prefer to pay higher prices for imported dairy products which they consider safer and better. Europe leads in dairy export to China, followed by the United States and New Zealand. Since the majority of imports of dairy products are from foreign companies, the government has put regulations that whichever companies that are not registered in China are not allowed to sell the products anywhere within the Chinese boundaries.The three Chinese dairy companies Yili, Mengniu, and Bright make a significant market in sales for liquid milk in 2019. Global companies have also entered the Chinese market by exporting dairy products and selling through online grocery services such as Tesco Plc, and large retailers like Yihaodian. COVID-19 pandemic has raised people's health awareness and deepened consumers' understanding of the nutritional value of milk and dairy products in China.Key Topics Covered:1. Introduction2.

Alibaba developed a facial recognition program to identify Uighurs, the Muslim minority persecuted in ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 17, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 737 wordsBodyChinese e-commerce giant Alibaba developed a facial recognition program capable of identifying Uighurs, a Muslim minority persecuted by communist rule in the Xinjiang region of northwest China, as the New York Times revealed wednesday.The Chinese authorities have been implementing a maximum security policy in this region for years, citing sporadic acts of terrorism as justification for a harsh crackdown that began in 2015 and led to the conviction of the United States and other Western nations. Academics estimate that more than one million Uighurs have been arrested in re-education camps, with several allegations of torture. The U.S. government has banned the importation of certain products from China on the basis that they could have been manufactured through forced labour in Xinjiang.According to The New York Times, an Alibaba website for its cloud computing business explained how to use facial recognition software to detect Uighurs or other ethnic minorities in photos and videos. The feature was incorporated into Alibaba software that helps platforms monitor digital content for material related to terrorism, pornography, and other alert categories.The texts in question were deleted by the Chinese group but were consulted by the US research cabinet IPVM, which forwarded them to the newspaper, the newspaper said.Alibaba said the facial recognition function was only used as a test. However, the company edited its website to remove references to Uighurs and minorities.The Alibaba company, a leader in online commerce and founded by Jack Ma, one of China's richest men, has diversified in recent years into sectors such as cloud computing, supermarkets and film. The disclosures could be a blow to the credibility of the company, whose shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and are owned by major international investors.Huawei's antecedentIn recent years, surveillance in Xinjiang has intensified, with identity checks, porch at the entrances of buildings, facial recognition cameras, passport confiscation, DNA sample collection and police checks on the roads.In particular, facial recognition technology has in recent years gained an increasingly important role among China's police departments, human rights activists say.Last week, Chinese phone and telecommunications company Huawei was also accused by IPVM of testing powerful software to recognize Uighurs.The telecommunications company, in the sights of several Western countries for its ties to the Chinese regime, worked with facial recognition company Megvii to test an artificial intelligence camera system that could scan faces in a crowd and estimate each person's age, gender and ethnicity.If the system detected the face of a member of the Muslim minority group - according to the test report - it could trigger a "Uighur alarm," which could mark them for police in China. The document, which was removed from the company's website, shed new light on how Huawei, the world's largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment, has also contributed to its development, providing servers, cameras, cloud computing infrastructure and other tools that underpin the technological power of systems.The company denied these accusations, which led French Barcelona footballer Antoine Griezmann to break his sponsorship contract.Now, Alibaba seems to have adopted a systemsimilarly, in a new example of how the Chinese regime uses its most important companies for its political purposes and the repression of the population.That's why the Trump administration began looking at Chinese tech companies with growing suspicion.Last year, the U.S. government added 28 Chinese entities, including surveillance equipment manufacturers and new artificial intelligence companies, to a commercial blacklist for concerns about their role in cracking down on Uighurs. Last month, the White House banned Americans from investing in a list of companies linked to the Chinese military, a step to cut off Chinese companies' access to U.S. capital markets.MORE ON THIS TOPIC:Slavery 21st Century: Chinese regime forces more than half a million Muslims to harvest cotton by hand in XinjiangDocuments prove Huawei helped Chinese regime pursue minorities with powerful softwareUN denounced an "alarming" hit-and-run against HRD defenders in China and its crackdownA security expert reported china monitoring U.S. cell phones through Caribbean networksLoad-Date: December 18, 2020End of Document

Chinese state surveillance supercomputer uses U.S. chipsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 25, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1875 wordsBodyAt the end of a desolate road bordered by prisons, amid a complex filled with surveillance cameras, technology developed in the United States triggers one of the most invasive parts of China's state surveillance apparatus.The computers inside the complex, known as the Urumqi Cloud Computing Center, are among the most powerful on the planet. They can track more surveillance footage in a day than a person could watch in a year. They look for faces and patterns of human behavior. They track cars. They monitor phones.The Chinese government uses these computers to observe an immense number of people in Xinjiang, a region in the west of the country where Beijing has launched a surveillance and crackdown campaign in the name of fighting terrorism.Chips produced by Intel and Nvidia, two U.S. semiconductor manufacturers, have been driving the complex since it opened in 2016. In 2019, at a time when reports accused Beijing of using high technology to imprison and track Xinjiang's primarily Muslim minorities, new chips produced in the United States helped the center's computers enter the list of the world's fastest supercomputers. Both Intel and Nvidia claim that they were not aware of what they define as misuse of their technology.                                               Cameras observing a street in Hotan, city in the Western Chinese region of Xinjiang; poster warns that 'criminal forces' will be severely treated; type of surveillance is common in the region - Giulia Marchi - 11.Dec.2019/The New York Times                    Powerful technology and its potential abuse will take a central position in decisions the Biden administration will have to make. The Trump administration has banned the sale of advanced semiconductors and other technologies to Chinese companies implicated in national security or human rights issues. A crucial issue for President-elect JoeBiden will be determining whether these restrictions will be hardened, loosened or rethought.Some figures in the technology industry argue that the ban was an exaggeration, blocking valuable sales of American technology products that have a profusion of harmless uses, and encouraging China to create advanced semiconductors on its own. And China is in fact investing billions of dollars in the development of cutting-edge chips.In contrast, critics of the use of U.S. technology in repressive systems say buyers explore alternative paths to avoid restrictions and that industry and authorities need to more closely monitor the sale and use of this type of equipment.Companies often point out that they have little influence on the final destination of their products. The chips from the Urumqi complex, for example, were sold by Intel and Nvidia to Sugon, the Chinese company that keeps the center in operation. Sugon is an important supplier of China's military and security forces, but it also manufactures computers for ordinary companies.That argument is no longer enough, said Jason Matheny, director and founder of Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, and a former U.S. intelligence official."Government and industry need to think more now that technologies are advancing to the point where it is potentially possible to conduct real-time surveillance on millions of people using a single supercomputer," he said.There is no evidence that the sale of chips from Nvidia or Intel, which predates Trump's order, violated any law. Intel said it no longer sells semiconductors for use on Sugon supercomputers. But the two companies continue to sell chips to the Chinese company.                                               The Urumqi Cloud Computing Center in Xinjiang helps feed the mostComputing-intensive surveillance system in the region - Paul Mozur - 15.Aug.2019/The New York Times                    The existence of the installation and the use of American chips in the Urumqi complex are no secret, and there is no shortage of indications that Beijing uses it for surveillance purposes. Since 2015, when the complex began to be developed, state media and Sugon have been touting the links between the company and the police.In promotional materials distributed in China five years ago, Nvidia disclosed the capabilities of the Urumqi complex and boasted that "its high-capacity video surveillance application" had generated customer satisfaction.Nvidia said the disclosure material referred to earlier versions of its products, and that video surveillance was a normal part of the discussion about "Smart Cities," an effort by the Chinese government to use the technology to address urban issues such as pollution, traffic and crime. An Nvidia spokesperson said the company had no reason to believe that its products could be used for "any improper purpose."The spokesperson added that Sugon "is no longer an important customer" of Nvidia since last year's ban. He also stated that Nvidia had not provided technical assistance to Sugon after that.A spokesperson for Intel, which still sells simpler chips to Sugon, said it would restrict or suspend its business with any customer it finds used its products in order to violate human rights.The delivery of information about Intel's business in China seems to have had an impact within the company. One of its business units last year set ethics rules for its artificial intelligence applications, according to three people briefed on the matter who asked that their names not be revealed because Intel did not publicly disclose the guidelines.Sugon said in a statement that the complex was intended to track vehicle license plates originally and to manage other tasks related to the "Smart Cities" project, but that its systems proved ineffective and started to be used for other purposes. But in September, an official Chinese government media vehicle described the complex as a video processing and image processing center for city management.Advances in technology have given authorities around the world substantial power to observe and track people. In China, the country's leaders have taken technology to even greater extremes. Artificial intelligence and genetic testing are used to assess people and determine whether they are Uighurs, one of the minorities in the Xinjiang region. Chinese companies and authorities claim that their systems are capable of detecting religious extremism or opposition to the Communist Party.The Urumqi Cloud Computing Center – sometimes also called the Xinjiang Supercomputing Center – made the list of the fastest supercomputers on the planet in 2018, in 221st position. In November 2019, new chips helped elevate it to 135th place.Two data processing centers operated by Chinese security forces are right next to the complex, a way to potentially reduce data transmission delay, according to experts. In the immediate vicinity there are also six prisons and re-education centers.                                               Chipset Nvidia; equipped with Nvidia and Intel chips, the Urumqi computing complex has been recognized as one of the fastest in the world - Christie Hemm Klok - Aug. 29,2017/The New York Times                    When a reporter for The New York Times tried to visit the center in 2019, he was followed by plain-room police officers. A security guard prevented you from entering.Chinese official media and previous statements by Sugon portray the complex as a surveillance center. In August 2017, local officials said the center would support a Chinese police surveillance project called Sharp Eyes and that the center's processing capacity was 100 million photos per second. In 2018, according to company revelations, its computers had the ability to connect to 10,000 video feeds and analyze up to 1,000 of them simultaneously through artificial intelligence."With the help of cloud computing, 'big data', deep learning and other technologies, the intelligent video analytics engine is able to integrate police data and video image applications, Wi-Fi hot spots, surveillance station information and facial recognition analysis to support the operations of different departments" within the Chinese police, Sugon said in an article posted to one of its official social media accounts in 2018.On the occasion of a visit by local Communist Party leaders to the complex that year, the company wrote on its website that computers "updated our thinking, from tracking after the fact to previous predictive policing."                  Read also                                                                                                                                           Artificial Intelligence changes everyone's life, for better and for worse                                                                                                              In Xinjiang, the term predictive policing often serves as a euphemism for preventative detentions of people whose behavior is classified as disloyal to the party. These behaviors caninclude demonstrations of Islamic faith, ties with relatives living abroad, possession of two phones or having no phone, according to statements from Uighurs and official Chinese government documents.The technology helps select vast volumes of data that humans would be unable to process, said Jackson Poulson, a former Google engineer and founder of the activist organization Tech Inquiry."When you have something that approaches a surveillance state, the primary limitation becomes the ability to identify events that interest you, among your feeds," he said. "And the way to expand surveillance is through machine learning and large-scale artificial intelligence."The Urumqi complex went into development before information on abuses in Xinjiang began circulating widely. In 2019, governments around the world were protesting china's conduct in Xinjiang. That year, Sugon's computer appeared in the international supercomputer rankings, using Intel Xeon Gold 5118 processors and advanced Nvidia Tesla V100 artificial intelligence chips.It is unclear how or if Sugon will get enough chips to keep Sugon's supercomputer in the rankings. But less developed technology typically used for harmless tasks can also be used for surveillance and repression. Customers can also turn to resellers in other countries or chips manufactured by U.S. companies outside the country.Last year, police in two Xinjiang counties, Yanqi and Qitai, acquired surveillance systems powered by less powerful Intel chips, according to official procurement documents. The autonomous government's public security service in the Kizilsu Kyrgyz region acquired a computing platform in April that uses servers backed by less powerful Intel chips, according to documents. However, the agency was blacklisted by the Trump administration last year for its involvement in surveillance operations.China's dependence on American chips for now has helped the world pressure the country's government, said Maya Wang, who researches Chinese issues at the human rights organization Human Rights Watch."I fear that in a few years, companies and the Chinese government will find ways to develop their own chips and capabilities," Wang said. "And then there will be no way to try to stop these abuses."Load-Date: November 26, 2020End of Document

Beijing just yanked Ant Group's IPO to show Jack Ma who's really in chargeCNN WireNovember 4, 2020 Wednesday 10:12 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1156 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Beijing just showed tech titan Jack Ma and the rest of China's billionaire tycoons who's really in charge. Chinese regulators stunned financial markets on Tuesday when they slammed the brakes on Ant Group's highly anticipated initial public offering just days before its shares were scheduled to start trading in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Ma's financial tech firm was set to raise $37 billion and become the biggest share sale in history.The Shanghai Stock Exchange said in a late night statement that it had postponed the Ant Group IPO because of "major issues" that might cause the company "not to meet the listing conditions or disclosure requirements." That came after the Chinese central bank and other Chinese government officials called in Ma and Ant Group executives for talks Monday. The Shanghai bourse is "fulfilling its responsibility of self regulation," Wang Wenbin, spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters on Wednesday. "It is a decision made to better safeguard the capital market stability and protect investors' rights and interests."It's not yet clear if or when the IPO will resume. Ant Group said in a statement that it would stay in "close communications" with regulators and the Shanghai exchange. But the unprecedented intervention serves as a cautionary tale for Chinese entrepreneurs with lofty ambitions, even Communist Party members such as Ma. It also means that even if Ant satisfies new regulatory requirements, its massive business will only move forward under the watchful eye of China's strict regulators.'The tallest nail gets hammered down'Investors are already wary about what it could mean. Shares in Alibaba, the e-commerce giant that Ma co-founded, plunged 8% in New York on Tuesday.The plunge wiped more than $68 billion off Alibaba's market value, based on the value of shares in New York."There's a saying in China: 'The tallest nail gets hammered down,'" said Duncan Clark, author of "Alibaba: The House that Jack Ma Built" and founder of investment advisory firm BDA China. And it would seem Ma just got hammered by the Chinese government, he said. The Shanghai Stock Exchange's announcement comes just over a week after Ma said avoiding systemic risk is important, but publicly criticized Chinese regulators for stifling innovation by being too risk averse. "What we need is to build a healthy financial system, not systematic financial risks," the Ant Group co-founder said at a conference in Shanghai. "To innovate without risks is to kill innovation. There's no innovation without risks in the world."On Monday, Chinese regulators summoned Ma and other Ant executives to conduct what authorities called "regulatory interviews." Ant Group said that the two sides exchanged "views regarding the health and stability of the financial sector."Ma's comments "clearly didn't resonate in the halls of power in Beijing," wrote Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at Oanda, in a note on Wednesday. "There's only one big boss in China, and it's not Jack Ma."For the last few years, entrepreneurs like Ma were valued for helping China and the Chinese Communist Party achieve their greater goals by stimulating consumption and driving efficiency, according to Clark.But lately, Chinese President Xi Jinping and the party has made it clear that private companies are on a tighter leash. In September, the party published an unusually frank set of guidelines that emphasized the need for "politically sensible people" in the private sector who will "firmly listen to the party and follow the party."With the Ant announcement,"it seems that Xi's emphasis on state-owned enterprises isn't just talk," Clark said."The regulator is keen to reassert itself," he added. Ant, an affiliate of e-commerce giant Alibaba, has inserted itself into every aspect of financial life for hundreds of millions of Chinese. It offers an array of products, such as digital payments through its popular app Alipay, instant credit and small loans, wealth management products and insurance products. China's financial technology industry has "outpaced the ability of the regulators in being able to provide guidelines especially in the online co-lending business and pure loan facilitation," Jefferies analysts wrote in a Wednesday research note.But it now looks like Beijing is taking steps to correct that.What remains unclear is whether Beijing is trying to tilt the balance of power back to state-owned banks, or if regulators are genuinely concerned and uncomfortable about Ant's lending practices, Clark said. Rise of the Chinese regulatorOne issue "is exactly which regulator, if any, has oversight" on Ant and other Chinese financial tech companies, according to the analysts at Jefferies. China's Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission --- one of the regulators that summoned Ma and his team --- proposed new rules on Monday for online lenders. The rules mean that Ant would have to set aside more cash for the loans it facilitates and would place more credit risk on its balance sheet, according to several analysts.China's state-run media on Wednesday pointed to the tougher regulatory stance as a sign that authorities want to keep the country's largest tech companies in check. "Financial Big Techs --- increasingly seen as rivals to traditional banks --- will inevitably be subject to more supervising curbs," reported state-run tabloid The Global Times reported, citing experts. State-run news agency Xinhua was definitive in its assessment: "Each participant in the market must respect the rules, and no one can make exceptions."Clark, of BDA China, said that Ant may have also been "a victim of its own success."The IPO would have valued the company at more than $310 billion, more than major US investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. And there was huge demand for shares in Shanghai and Hong Kong, with the Shanghai leg of the IPO more than 870 times oversubscribed. That likely made Chinese regulators nervous, according to Clark. "Once this company was public, would they be able to control it, and the lending that it would be making?" he said. Will Ant's IPO eventually get the green light?It is "unfortunate timing" that Ant got caught up in China's regulatory changes, said Hao Hong, managing director and head of research at investment bank Bocom International. But he still expected Ant to revive its plans to go public."Ant will need to regroup and [retry] the IPO in about six months," Hong said. "In the end, the IPO will go through." David Erickson, finance lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Business School and former co-head of global equity capital markets at Barclays, agreed. "There will likely be some resolution that involves an amended filing that ultimately leads to an IPO," he predicted. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

PORTMAN DELIVERS RESULTS FOR OHIO IN SECOND YEAR OF THE 116TH CONGRESSStates News ServiceDecember 31, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 10132 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Ohio Senator Rob Portman:During the second year of the 116th Congress, Senator Portman continued to deliver results for Ohio, just as he did in the previous Congress. He worked tirelessly to help Ohioans who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic; create economic opportunity and retirement security for Ohio families; combat the addiction epidemic; honor our nation's veterans and strengthen our military; promote responsible use of artificial intelligence and technology; stand up against police brutality and the unnecessary violence in our country; protect and preserve our national parks; improve transparency and accountability within the federal government; fight for better and more affordable health care; and help all Ohioans achieve their God-given potential.During the 116th Congress, Portman has authored or co-authored 45 legislative priorities in total that have been signed into law. Under President Trump, in total 82 of Senator Portman's bills have been signed into law. Under President Obama, 68 of Portman's bill were signed into law. In total, during his 10 years in the Senate, Portman has successfully enacted 175 legislative priorities into law, including 129 bills as well as 46 amendments.Helping Ohioans Impacted By COVID-19The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic impacted the lives of every American in 2020, and Senator Portman played a leadership role in crafting solutions to help families and small businesses leading to the passage of the COVID-19 Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.Since the beginning of the pandemic, Senator Portman has consistently called for bipartisan action to provide the health care and economic relief the American need and deserve. Since March, Portman has delivered 21 speeches on the Senate floor calling for bipartisan action to provide Americans the COVID-19 relief. Portman has urged Congress to provide additional relief to bolster our health care response, help our economy and small businesses recover, provide funding for schools and state and local governments, permanently expand telehealth options for addiction treatment, and provide enhanced federal unemployment benefits to help people who lost their jobs through no fault of their own.In November, in an effort to encourage all Americans to get vaccinated against COVID-19, Portman announced his participation in the ENSEMBLE phase 3 trial for the COVID-19 vaccine candidate being developed by Johnson and Johnson and managed by CTI Clinical Trial and Consulting Services (CTI) at its research center in Cincinnati, Ohio. Portman furthered this work by introducing his COVID-19 Vaccine Awareness Support Act to fund a national campaign to raise awareness of the safety and efficacy of FDA-authorized vaccines.In September, Portman introduced legislation to replenish FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) to continue the enhanced federal unemployment insurance benefit of $300 per week authorized by President Trump's executive action and provide additional resources to support the federal government's response to historic wildfires in the West and other natural disasters such as Hurricane Sally.Securing Resources for Ohio: At the start of the pandemic, Portman worked closely with the administration and with Ohio companies to secure additional supplies for the strategic national stockpile including testing machines, ventilators, PPE, and food resources.- In March, Portman successfully helped UC Health secure vital equipment to increase diagnostic testing for COVID-19. Portman helped UC Health secure a cobas 6800 machine which they will use to conduct nearly one thousand diagnostic tests every day, exponentially increasing COVID-19 testing capacity in southwest Ohio.- Earlier this year, Portman worked with the White House and HHS and FDA to successfully facilitate the donation of approximately 2.2 million new gowns from Ohio-based Cardinal Health to the Strategic National Stockpile. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has authorized the distribution and use of these gowns as non-surgical isolation apparel.- When Ohio-based company Gojo, which produces Purell, alerted Portman to the issue of tariffs restricting the access of components used in the distribution of hand sanitizer - specifically pumphouses, and e-collars he reached out to U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer and facilitated a tariff relief. This helps companies like Gojo increase production and distribution to accommodate the increased demand.- In July, Portman visited GOJO Industries and met with the company's leadership and team members to discuss Portman's work to facilitate tariff relief for hand hygiene products including hand sanitizer and soap dispensers and components to allow for increased distribution during COVID-19 pandemic.- In April, Portman sent a letter to USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue urging swift approval of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services' (ODJFS) request to operate the Disaster Household Distribution Program. The request was approved the next week allowing foodbanks throughout Ohio to distribute more food across the state by removing administrative burdens, making it easier for staff and volunteers at foodbanks to maintain social distancing protocols, keeping themselves and their clients safe.- Portman also worked with Ohio company Battelle in April to secure a new federal contract to help fund the rapid deployment of Battelle's decontamination systems to return to use previously worn N95 respirator masks and training to operate these systems to 60 sites across the country.- In April, Portman facilitated Cleveland-based SecondBreath's request to produce ventilators for deployment around Ohio and the country. The ventilators were developed by Ohioans and tested in Ohio at a number of northeast Ohio hospitals, including the Cleveland Clinic, Akron Children's Hospital, and Akron City Hospital. The administration approved their production and SecondBreath was able to increase production for shipment across Ohio and the country.- In August, Portman visited Honda Heritage Center and toured the ventilator compressor parts production facility. While on the tour, Portman, Honda leadership, and employees discussed Honda's efforts to help support the COVID-19 response, including production of face shields and compressor parts for ventilators.- Portman also volunteered with the Ohio National Guard and met with leaders at foodbanks in the Mahoning Valley, at the Mid-Ohio Food Collective, and the Greater Cleveland Food Bank to see firsthand how the CARES Act funding helped with food access and distribution across Ohio.Listening to Ohio Groups Stakeholders: Senator Portman made it a priority to communicate with constituents throughout the pandemic through tele town halls and Facebook Live town halls about the work he has done with the state and federal government. He also spoke with companies and stakeholders throughout the state to ensure Ohio has the resources it needs to respond to this unprecedented health crisis and can contribute to the national effort to slow the spread of the virus.- Portman hosted multiples calls with Ohio business groups and leaders to discuss the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and how Congress and the administration could take further action to address their concerns. He spoke with business leaders of sizes in Central Ohio, Dayton, Toledo, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Warren County, and Butler County.- In addition to business groups, Portman also hosted a wide-range of conference calls with the Ohio Restaurant Association, Ohio foodbanks, nonprofit organizations, manufacturers, bio science employers, higher education leaders, farmers, veterans, county commissioners, and mayors from all over the state.- Portman also hosted conference calls with Ohio hospital leaders and with the Ohio Association of County Behavioral Health Authorities (OACBHA) to discuss the impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on health services, and mental health and addiction services around Ohio.- Finally, Portman participated in a conference call with Ohio Jewish Communities to discuss the efforts the Jewish community made during the pandemic to help Ohio communities.- Portman continued his push on the Senate Floor this year for swift bipartisan action to respond to the increasing number of drug overdoses as a result of the pandemic.Providing Resources for Ohioans Suffering with Addiction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing guidelines have disrupted traditional addiction treatment services and necessitated the use of telehealth services to help individuals with recovery. To meet this need, the CARES Act took unprecedented steps to expand access to telehealth through the waiving of federal restrictions to pay for telehealth and expanding grants to build out the nation's telehealth infrastructure. That's why Senator Portman has introduced legislation entitled the Telehealth Response for E-Prescribing Addiction Treatment Services (TREATS) Act to make permanent a number of temporary waivers for telehealth services that were authorized under the Public Health Emergency and to bolster telehealth options for addiction treatment services. Specifically, it will allow for a patient to be prescribed lower scheduled drugs like through telehealth on their first visit. Current law requires an in-person visit to receive any controlled substance, but this is a deterrent to patients in crisis and in urgent need of treatments from Schedule III or IV drugs.- In July, Portman published a column highlighting the importance of Congress passing the TREATS Act to ensure that addiction health services have the resources they need to adapt to this new reality. He emphasized that doing so will help to preserve the progress made in combating the addiction crisis and ensure that more Americans can reach their God-given potential. He then participated in a drug addiction roundtable discussion with members of the Hancock County Board of Alcohol, Drug Addiction and Mental Health Services (ADAMHS) to discuss COVID-19's impact on addiction treatment.Securing Grant Funding: The COVID-19 Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided unprecedented economic and health care relief to Americans during the ongoing pandemic. Portman worked closely with the administration to ensure Ohioans received the support they needed.- Housing : Portman worked with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to ensure communities in Ohio received funding to help promote economic development in urban communities, address the needs of homeless people in emergency or transitional shelters, and provide housing assistance and related supportive services for low-income persons. This includes:- Agriculture : Senator Portman applauded the U.S. Department of Agriculture for awarding more than $1.4 million in grants to communities in Ohio for rural development. These grants will help these Ohio communities build and improve critical facilities. According to the USDA, the Ohio grant recipients can use the funding to build or upgrade a wide-range of rural community facilities such as schools, libraries, clinics and public safety facilities.- FEMA: In March, Senator Portman sent a letter urging President Trump to act swiftly on Governor Mike DeWine's request for approval of a major disaster declaration for the state of Ohio in response to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. The president approved the disaster declaration the following day. As a result, Ohio received nearly $4.1 million in grant funding from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as well as the following funding;- Businesses: Portman worked with the Trump administration to ensure that businesses of all sizes in Ohio had the resources they needed to help retain employees and keep their doors open.- Education: The historic CARES Act provided a higher education emergency relief fund to assist higher education institutions across the nation. Senator Portman worked with the U.S. Department of Education to ensure Ohio higher education institutions received the resources needed to meet the demands of the pandemic.- Health Care: This year, thousands of Ohioans had to rely on telehealth in order to have access to their primary care providers. Thanks to the bipartisan CARES Act, which Portman strongly supported, Ohio received multiple telehealth grants to assist health care facilities, testing centers, and hospitals serving children and low-income, vulnerable populations across the state.Portman led legislation to provide certainty to hospitals participating in the 340B drug discount program during the COVID-19 public health emergency. In normal years, the 340B program provides needed flexible funds to meet the needs of a hospital's community, but during the ongoing pandemic, the 340B program has become a vital lifeline for hospitals as they've see precipitous drop offs in revenue and an inability to pay for the essential COVID services that patients continue to need. Early days of the pandemic forced many hospitals to reduce inpatient hospital admissions of low-income Medicare and Medicaid patients, a critical metric in determining eligibility for the 340B program. Though hospitals have resumed elective procedures, and patients have begun returning to seek care, there is concern that as a result of this year's slowdown and threats to suspend elective care again as hospital beds fill up, some hospitals may not meet the required inpatient admission threshold to remain in the program for the following year. This legislation would ensure that any previously eligible hospital will be deemed eligible for any cost reporting period during which the public health emergency occurred to meet the needs of hospitals now during this crisis and to preserve the vital program for years to come.- Transportation : The transportation industry has been hit hard by the pandemic, and Senator Portman worked closely with the U.S. Department of Transportation to ensure Ohio companies have the financial resources they need during the pandemic.Helping Businesses Stay Afloat. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Portman has stayed in constant contact with business leaders of all sizes and worked to help deliver the results they need to stay afloat during this economic crisis. He visited business in Tipp City, Cincinnati, Russells Point, Sidney, and Hamilton and heard from company leaders about how, thanks to the Paycheck Protection Program loan that Portman supported, they were able to keep workers on payroll and continue operations.During the second year of the 116th Congress, Senator Portman continued to deliver results for Ohio, just as he did in the previous Congress. He worked tirelessly to help Ohioans who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic; create economic opportunity and retirement security for Ohio families; combat the addiction epidemic; honor our nation's veterans and strengthen our military; promote responsible use of artificial intelligence and technology; stand up against police brutality and the unnecessary violence in our country; protect and preserve our national parks; improve transparency and accountability within the federal government; fight for better and more affordable health care; and help all Ohioans achieve their God-given potential.During the 116th Congress, Portman has authored or co-authored 42 legislative priorities in total that have been signed into law. Under President Trump, in total 79 of Senator Portman's bills have been signed into law. Under President Obama, 68 of Portman's bill were signed into law. In total, during his 10 years in the Senate, Portman has successfully enacted 172 legislative priorities into law, including 126 bills as well as 46 amendments.Helping Ohioans Impacted By COVID-19The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic impacted the lives of every American in 2020, and Senator Portman played a leadership role in crafting solutions to help families and small businesses leading to the passage of the COVID-19 Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.Since the beginning of the pandemic, Senator Portman has consistently called for bipartisan action to provide the health care and economic relief the American need and deserve.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Portman has stayed in constant contact with business leaders of all sizes and worked to help deliver the results they need to stay afloat during this economic crisis. He visited business in Tipp City, Cincinnati, Russells Point, Sidney, and Hamilton and heard from company leaders about how, thanks to the Paycheck Protection Program loan that Portman supported, they were able to keep workers on payroll and continue operations.- In July, Portman introduced the Healthy Workplaces Tax Credit Act to help businesses continue to safely reopen while ensuring the safety of employees and consumers through a refundable tax credit against payroll taxes for 50 percent of the costs incurred by a business for increased testing, personal protective equipment (PPE), disinfecting, extra cleaning and reconfiguring work spaces to adhere to social distancing guidelines. He hopes to have it included in any additional COVID-19 relief package that passes from the Senate.- In September, in an effort to remove unnecessary regulations that undermined our nation's ability to rapidly respond to the pandemic, Portman introduced the Pandemic Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Act. The legislation establishes an accountable, expert-led, commission to identify ineffective, unnecessary, or overly burdensome regulations that should be modified, consolidated, harmonized, or repealed to promote jobs and higher wages; reduce household expenses; improve economic performance and competitiveness; reduce compliance costs; encourage growth and innovation; improve competitiveness; and protect public health, safety, and welfare.Assisting Second Chance Business Owners. In June 2020, Portman introduced the bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program Second Chance Act, which would remove barriers to PPP for owners with unrelated felony records while preserving the presumption of innocence and keeping in place the five year timeframe for felony crimes related to financial fraud. This legislation follows Senator Portman's letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Jovita Carranza urging that the SBA allow small business owners with criminal records to apply for the PPP. National and Ohioan reentry and second chance coalition leaders, law enforcement, and local officials have voiced their support of the initiative.Reshoring PPE: Portman believes that the American people should not have to rely so heavily on foreign countries for personal protective equipment and that we should bring personal protection equipment production back to the United States. In August, he introduced bipartisan legislation that will strengthen efforts to onshore production of PPE in the United States by requiring the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to issue long-term contracts for American-made PPE.In June, Portman and Senator Sherrod Brown sent a letter urging the COVID-19 Joint Acquisition Task Force (JATF) to prioritize the procurement of American-made PPE, and to consider comprehensive measures to incentivize the reshoring of additional PPE production back to the United States. JATF was created to synchronize and support execution of the Department of Defense's COVID-19 response to interagency requests for medical resources involving the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of Health and Human Services, and other agencies.Meeting with Ohio Hospitals: As a result of the bipartisan CARES Act , which Senator Portman supported and President Trump signed into law, health facilities around Ohio were able to receive much needed resources to care for patients with COVID-19, to expand testing, and to work to address the disproportionate impact the virus had on minority communities. This year, Portman visited the Columbus Public Health Department, the Health Collaborative in Cincinnati, Adena Health System in Chillicothe, and Premier Health's Miami Valley Hospital to see firsthand how the CARES Act was working to help Ohio hospitals.Advocating for Additional Testing at Elkton: In April, Portman sent a letter urging Attorney General William Barr and Bureau of Prisons Director Michael Carvajal to increase COVID-19 testing at Federal Correctional Institution Elkton in Lisbon, Ohio. Elkton had the highest number of deaths of any federal prison, with nine fatalities.Creating Economic Opportunity and Retirement Security for Ohio FamiliesSince his election in 2010, Senator Portman has focused on strengthening the economy, reforming our tax code and providing relief to families and small businesses. In the 115th Congress, he delivered on this commitment with the enactment of comprehensive tax cuts and tax reform, and Portman saw firsthand how Ohio companies are responding by creating more jobs, increasing wages, paying bonuses, making additional investments in plants and equipment, and expanding health care and retirement benefits. In addition to tax reform, Portman worked on a number of measures to help create jobs, level the playing field for Ohio workers, and make Ohio businesses more competitive.Strengthening Skills Training and Workforce Development . Portman, who is the co-founder of the Senate Career and Technical Education (CTE) Caucus, continued to help lead efforts in the Senate to expand skills training to close the skills gap and ensure that Ohioans are ready for the jobs available today. As part of his efforts, Portman joined Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) in introducing the bipartisan JOBS Act which will make high-quality and rigorous short-term job training programs more affordable by expanding access to Pell Grants for low-income students. Portman has toured Ohio meeting with community colleges, educators, workforce development officials and others to receive input and highlight the importance of this bill, which is supported by the Trump administration and was included in its budget request. As we work to rebuild the economy, and as manufacturers continue to look to hire more workers, this bill is needed now more than ever.Ensuring a Secure Retirement for Hard Working Americans. Portman is widely regarded as the leading Senate voice for common-sense pension reform. Portman believes that every American should have the opportunity to save for a safe, secure retirement. In February 2019, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) selected Portman to lead the committee's Subcommittee on Social Security, Pensions and Family Policy. Portman has leveraged this perch to spearhead passage of the SECURE Act at the end of 2019 and help lead bipartisan efforts to reform multiemployer pension funds and ensure hard working American's receive the benefits they have earned.Encouraging Broadband and Infrastructure Development in Rural Areas. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced countless functions of everyday life to go virtual. As such, it is vital that every American have access to reliable, high-speed internet. That is why Portman introduced legislation in July to bolster efforts to expand access to rural broadband nationwide and speed up the distribution of the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF). The Rural Broadband Acceleration Act also directs the FCC to adhere to the Universal Service requirement in federal law, which is a joint responsibility for the federal and state governments. The Universal Service requirement states that all people in rural areas must have access to telecommunications and information services that are reasonably comparable, in both speed and price, to the services in urban areas. Thus, this legislation will allow rural America to have the same level of broadband service enjoyed by cities and suburbs across the country.Expanding Markets for Ohio Farmers and Small Businesses . As a former U.S. Trade Representative, Portman continues to be a leading voice in the Senate on trade policy, working to ensure a level playing field for American workers and create more jobs for Ohio farmers and small businesses. This year, he worked to advance those priorities in a number of ways, including:Protecting American Taxpayers . Portman has a long history of working to reform the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). For instance, on July 1, 2019, President Trump signed the Taxpayer First Act into law - bipartisan legislation that included a number of Portman's legislative priorities. Over the course of this year, Portman built on his past success with two significant efforts:Securing Funding for Key Ohio Economic Priorities . Senator Portman has worked with the Trump administration to ensure that Ohio has access to competitive grant opportunities in order to strengthen efforts to improve the economy and job creation around the state.Combating America's Opioid EpidemicNo one in the Senate has been more active in the fight against drug addiction than Senator Portman. He continues to lead the national effort to combat the opioid crisis that is devastating communities. As part of his efforts to help Ohio, Portman has worked to help stop the influx of synthetic drugs like fentanyl, expand access to treatment programs that are so critical to an effective recovery, and secure additional funding for evidenced-based Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) programs focused on prevention, treatment, recovery, and first responders. In addition, Portman worked to secure $1 billion in new funding for state grants to fight opioid abuse in the 21st Century CURES Act. He's also fought for more overall opioid funding, and helped secure more than $4 billion in new opioid funding over the last few years between CARA, CURES and other opioid programs.Portman has also been at the forefront of addressing the changes faces of addiction in Ohio and around the country. In response to increasing reports of overdose deaths in Ohio due to psychostimulants like methamphetamine and cocaine both often laced with fentanyl Senator Portman introduced and successfully fought for passage of the bipartisan Combating Meth and Cocaine Act, which gives states the flexibility to use the $1.5 billion in federal grant funds allocated to combat opioid addiction to also be used for treatment and recovery services for these resurgent threats.These resources and new approaches have helped to begin to turn the tide of addiction overdoses. Nationwide, drug overdose deaths fell from 70,699 in 2017 to 67,744 in 2018 a decrease of four percent, and the first time since 1990 that nationwide drug overdoses decreased in a calendar year. In Ohio, there was a 22.4 percent drop in overdose deaths over that time period, one of the highest in the nation. In all, overdose rates dropped in 33 states nationwide.Portman continues his work to fight addiction even during the unprecedented health care challenges caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The isolation, stress, and uncertainty of this period have led some people to turn to drug use, and the results have been tragic, with a sharp increase in overdoses nationwide compared to 2019. In response to social distancing measures that have kept addiction patients from meeting in person with their recovery supervisors, he worked with the Trump Administration to expand telehealth and delivery options for opioid treatment, which in some instances, has even allowed addiction specialists to reach new patients. Senator Portman is now looking to pass the bipartisan TREATS Act that would make these expanded telehealth options permanent for treatment and recovery services.Securing Federal Resources to Combat the Opioid Crisis: Portman has repeatedly discussed the impact the ongoing COVID-19 crisis is having on the addiction epidemic and called for a redoubling of efforts to save lives. Thanks to the 21st Century CURES Act, which Portman supported. Ohio received $96 million of the $1.5 billion announced by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to help states and tribes combat the ongoing addiction crisis. In addition, in September, Portman announced that the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has awarded more than $1 million in grant funding for Drug-Free Community (DFC) Programs throughout Ohio.Meeting with Ohioans Working to Combat the Addiction Crisis: Senator Portman is proud of organizations across Ohio that work hard every day to help individuals who are struggling to combat their addiction. Portman continuously works with community leaders to ensure they have the support and funding they need to continue their workd to fight this addiction epidemic.Ensuring Federal Agencies Fully Implement STOP Act Law: In December, as Chair of PSI, Portman pressed the federal agencies in charge of implementing the STOP Act on why they were unable to comply with the requirements as established in the law. Senator Portman's bipartisan Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention (STOP) Act became law in 2018 and is working to help reduce the supply of fentanyl shipped into the United States through the U.S. Postal Service. The hearing focused on how well federal agencies are implementing the requirements.Permanently Scheduling Fentanyl - Related Substances: In October 2019, Portman introduced the bipartisan Federal Initiative to Guarantee Health by Targeting (FIGHT) Fentanyl Act, which will codify Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) precedent and permanently schedule illicitly manufactured and deadly fentanyl-related substances. In February 2018, the DEA issued a temporary scheduling order to schedule fentanyl-related substances, which has allowed federal law enforcement authorities to bring criminal actions against individuals who manufacture, distribute, or handle fentanyl-related substances. Portman's legislation was endorsed by all of the state and territorial Attorneys General, including Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and in February, President Trump signed into law compromise legislation to temporarily extend the order until May 6, 2021.Protecting Ohioans, Honoring Veterans and Making America StrongerSenator Portman is committed to keeping Ohioans safe and giving our men and women in uniform the resources they need to protect themselves and best complete their mission. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Portman has consistently advocated for rebuilding our military and a more robust and comprehensive American strategy to protect our allies and deter our adversaries.Supporting Ohio's Defense Installations . Portman has worked to increase the range of capabilities for military installations throughout Ohio, and create jobs and opportunity for Ohio's servicemembers.Supporting America's Veterans . Portman has worked in a bipartisan way to honor the service and sacrifice of our veterans. This includes the following:Promoting Ohio's First in Flight and Space Exploration History . Ohio has a long and rich history of leadership and innovation in the aviation space. Over the past year, Portman worked to support this legacy by:Standing Up for Ukraine . No elected official in the United States has been a stronger, more reliable friend of Ukraine than Senator Rob Portman. As co-founder and co-chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, Portman continued to fervently advocate on behalf of Ukraine in the halls of Congress. In May 2019, Portman visited Ukraine to meet with newly-elected Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces Ruslan Khomchak, Minister of Finance Oksana Markarova, and other Ukrainian leaders. During his meetings, Portman congratulated the new government on their peaceful, free, and fair elections, pledged continued support from the U.S. Senate, and encouraged them to continue the anti-corruption efforts and structural reforms of the economy and the military.Defending Israel . Over the course of his many years in public service, Portman has distinguished himself as one of Israel's most fervent and reliable backers. This past year, Portman led two legislative initiatives supporting the Jewish state:Holding North Korea Accountable. Portman introduced a bipartisan resolution to remember and celebrate the life of Cincinnati-native Otto Warmbier who was wrongfully imprisoned and horribly mistreated by the North Korean regime which ultimately led to his death on June 19, 2017. The resolution also condemns the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and calls for the United States Government to continue to use its voice and vote in the United Nations to condemn systematic human rights violations in North Korea. The Senate unanimously passed the legislation in June of this year.Keeping America Competitive in the Artificial Intelligence Race with China. In 2019, Senator Portman co-founded the Senate Artificial Intelligence Caucus to give Congress a role in setting the rules for emerging technology. The FY 21 NDAA includes six of Senator Portman's bills that will help make America more competitive with respect to China by strengthening research and developing in AI, and by ensuring AI is created and used according to American values. These bills are:Promoting Responsible Use of AI and Emerging TechnologyAs co-founder and co-chair of the Senate Artificial Intelligence Caucus, Senator Portman has worked in a bipartisan manner on several key measures to set high-quality standards around emerging technology, including cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. Portman is now helping lead federal efforts to promote the responsible use of artificial intelligence both inside and outside the federal government.Below is a brief summary of Portman's legislative efforts to counter cybersecurity threats and attacks:Bolstering Cybersecurity at All Levels of Government . In July 2020, the Senate passed Senators Portman, Maggie Hassan (D-NH), John Cornyn (R-TX), and Gary Peters (D-MI) bipartisan NDAA amendment to require the Department of Homeland Security to establish a Cybersecurity State Coordinator position in every state. Under the legislation, each state would have its own federally funded Cybersecurity Coordinator, who would be responsible for helping to prevent and respond to cybersecurity threats by working with federal, state, and local governments, as well as schools, hospitals, and other entities. This amendment mirrors the Cybersecurity State Coordinator Act that the Senators introduced earlier this year, and in March, the Homeland Security Committee voted on a bipartisan basis to approve this legislation.Assessing and Addressing the Rising Issue of Deepfakes. Portman and Senator Schatz's bipartisan Deepfake Report Act was included in the final FY 2021 National Defense Authorization Act. The measure directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct an annual study of deepfakes and other types of similar content. Deepfakes are hyper-realistic, digital manipulations of real content that depict events that did not actually occur. The legislation requires DHS to assess the technology used to generate deepfakes, the uses of deepfakes by foreign and domestic entities, and available countermeasures to deepfakes. The report will also help policymakers and the public better understand the threats deepfakes pose to our national security and election security. The Deepfake Report Act passed the Senate in October 2019 as a stand-alone bill.Modernizing the Federal Government's Use of Latest Technology. Senators Portman and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) introduced the bipartisan Information Technology Modernization Centers of Excellence Program Act to accelerate the adoption of the latest technologies by government agencies. The bill codifies the Centers of Excellence (CoE) program at the General Services Administration (GSA) to ensure the federal government has expertise specific to different technologies, such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence. President Trump signed the bill into law this December.Ensuring Accountable Government Use of Artificial Intelligence. Portman and Senator Schatz (D-HI) introduced the Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Government Act which regulates the government's internal use of AI to ensure that the government uses AI safely, transparency, and ethically in order to derive efficiencies for the American people. The bill also codifies the AI Center of Excellence (CoE) within the General Services Administration to provide technical expertise to relevant government agencies and advise agencies on the procurement of AI technology. Inspired by Senator Portman's legislation, GSA created the AI CoE last year. The AI in Government Act was included in the FY 2021 spending bill.Developing a National Cloud Computer for AI Research. In June 2020, Senators Portman and Martin Heinrich (D-NM) introduced the bipartisan National AI Research Resource Task Force Act to establish a task force to develop a detailed roadmap for the development of a national cloud computer for Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. This legislation will convene a group of technical experts across academia, government, and industry to develop a detailed roadmap for how the United States can build, deploy, govern, and sustain a national research cloud. The National AI Research Resource Task Force Act was included in the FY 2021 NDAA.Strengthening the Department of Defense's AI Workforce. In an effort to strengthen the Department of Defense's artificial intelligence (AI) capacity by increasing the number of AI and cyber professionals in the department, Portman introduced the bipartisan Artificial Intelligence for the Armed Forces Act in June. The AI for the Armed Forces Act included in the FY 2021 NDAA.Promoting Stronger Cybersecurity Coordination Between DOD and U.S. Academic Institutions. In July 2020, the Senate passed the FY 2021 NDAA, which includes his bipartisan amendment to support cybersecurity initiatives between the Department of Defense (DOD) and U.S. academic institutions. Specifically, this amendment would require DOD to report on their efforts to work with consortia of academic researchers in the development of cybersecurity capabilities for DOD systems. The University of Cincinnati (UC) is a member of one such consortium.Strengthening the U.S. Military's AI Capabilities. In June 2020, Portman and Senator Bennet (D-CO) introduced the Artificial Intelligence Standards and National Security Act. This legislation would require the DoD to report to Congress on the Department's development of AI standards in the defense industrial base and on opportunities to increase effective AI adoption throughout the Department by strengthening the relationship between the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center and the military services. The Artificial Intelligence Standards and National Security Act was included in FY 2021 NDAA.Creating a National AI Strategy and Investing in Bold Research. In 2019, Portman and Senator Heinrich (D-NM) introduced the Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act (AIIA) to require the United States to develop a national strategy for AI, and to invest $2.2 billion in new AI research. The AIIA was included in FY 2021 NDAA.Protecting Technology Standards from Chinese Interference. In November, Portman and Senator Cortez-Masto (D-NV) introduced the Ensuring American Leadership over International Standards Act to study the impact of the Chinese government's influence in setting global standards for emerging technologies. The would direct the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to commission a study on the impact of the Chinese government's influence in setting global standards for emerging technologies and would provide feedback on how the United States and our global allies can continue to ensure that international standards setting continues in a transparent and democratic manner. This legislation was included in FY 2021 NDAA.Combating Hate and Racial DisparitiesProtecting Faith-Based on Nonprofit Organizations. Senator Portman has actively worked to combat the hate and unnecessary violence that has tragically become more common throughout the United States. In January, Senator Portman and Senator Gary Peters (D-MI) announced that President Trump signed their bipartisan Protecting Faith-Based and Nonprofit Organizations From Terrorism Act into law. This legislation authorizes $75 million annually for five years, from FYs 2020-2024, for the Department of Homeland Security's Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP). Under the legislation, funding may be used for target-hardening activities, training for personnel, and any other appropriate activity, as defined by the FEMA Administrator. While the bill authorizes $75 million annually for the program for the next five years, Congress can appropriate more. Portman joined his bipartisan colleagues in December 2019 in requesting that the appropriators fund the program at $90 million. That request was approved and included in the final FY 2020 appropriations agreement.Combating Racism and Hate. In June, Portman spoke on the Senate floor and addressed the hurt and anger being felt across the country in response to egregious examples of injustice and violence against African-Americans. He highlighted the need to work together to address the long-standing racial disparities and injustices that continue to occur in our country. In addition, he hosted a conference call with African-American leaders from across Ohio to discuss the pain being felt in the community, the need to address racial injustice and disparities, and how the COVID-19 health care and economic crisis is disproportionately impacting communities of color.Improving School Safety . On June 3, 2020, Portman wrote a letter in support of the Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Division's grant for the STOP School Violence Program for Cleveland schools. Congress enacted the bipartisan Students, Teachers, and Officers Preventing (STOP) School Violence Act in 2018 with Portman's support after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida. The measure is designed to help schools improve security by (1) authorizing the Department of Justice to make grants for the purposes of training students, school personnel, and law enforcement to identify signs of violence and intervene to prevent people from hurting themselves or others; and (2) funding evidence-based technology and equipment to improve school security and prevent school violence. DOJ approved the funding of $750,000 for the program in October.Protecting the Great LakesPortman, who serves as co-chair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, has consistently worked to protect Lake Erie. He has led the effort in the Senate to reauthorize and fully fund the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI), a results-driven program to address the most serious issues that threaten the ecological and economic well-being of the Great Lakes basin, including invasive species, pollution, and toxic contamination. By fighting to keep the lake clean, protect the lake from dangerous invasive species and harmful algal blooms, strengthen fish and wildlife restoration efforts, ensure that Ohioans have safe drinking water, and much more, Portman has demonstrated his commitment to improving the health of Lake Erie and supporting the tourism, fishing, and recreation industries that depend on it.Protecting our National Parks and Ohio's National Heritage AreasIn August 2020, President Trump signed into law Senator Portman's bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act to help address the nearly $12 billion backlog in long-delayed maintenance projects at the National Park Service (NPS). The law, which was praised by key Ohio and national stakeholders, established the "National Park Service Legacy Restoration Fund" from existing unobligated revenues the government receives from on and offshore energy development to fund deferred maintenance projects at NPS sites across the country. Notably, the law will help tackle the more than $100 million maintenance backlog at Ohio's eight national park sites.Leading in Recycling EffortsSenator Portman has taken the lead in the Senate to introduce legislation to help educate and promote recycling in communities in Ohio and across the country, which will help increase recycling rates and reduce contamination in the recycling stream.Promoting Conservation and Protecting WildlifeAs co-chair of the International Conservation Caucus, Portman has worked to protect our natural resources and wildlife both at home and abroad.Leading in Energy InitiativesSenator Portman has been a strong advocate for a comprehensive energy strategy while also protecting our environment. He has continually worked to keep Ohio's energy sector competitive while promoting energy efficiency.In the 116th Congress, Portman made various visits across Ohio to see his work to preserve and protect the environment in action. He saw federally-funded research at Ohio State's Stone Laboratory at Gibraltar Island, hosted a tourism roundtable in Sandusky, visited ports in Cleveland, Ashtabula, and Toledo to highlight economic development, and held his annual fishing trip and Lake Erie roundtable in Lake County with federal, state, and local water quality experts, and visited the Coast Guard's Ninth District HQ at Station Cleveland Harbor. He will continue his efforts to make a difference for Ohio and be a leader in Washington in preserving and protecting our environment.Increasing Transparency and Accountability Within the Federal GovernmentAs Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Senator Portman has worked hard to ensure that American taxpayers receive the transparency and accountability they deserve from the federal government.Detailing Lack of Federal Government Oversight of Chinese State-Owned Telecommunications Carriers. In June 2020, Portman released a bipartisan report detailing how the federal government provided little-to-no oversight of Chinese state-owned telecommunications carriers operating in the United States for nearly twenty years. As demonstrated in recent PSI investigations, China routinely exploits the American education and scientific research sectors to further its national interest and engages in cyber-attacks against U.S. companies, like Equifax and Marriott. This report reveals how the telecommunications industry has been similarly targeted.Revealing Russian Oligarchs Use of Art Industry to Evade U.S. Sanctions. In July 2020, Portman released a new bipartisan report detailing how Russian oligarchs have used the secrecy of the art industry to evade U.S. sanctions. Following a two-year investigation, which included the major auction houses, private New York art dealers, and seven financial institutions, the report shows how a lack of regulation allows the art industry to avoid the same anti-money laundering requirements that apply to financial institutions. The Subcommittee found that the art industry's secretive nature allowed art intermediaries to purchase more than $18 million in high-value art in the United States through shell companies linked to Russian oligarchs after they were sanctioned by the United States in March 2014. The Subcommittee also found the shell companies linked to the Russian oligarchs were not limited to just art and engaged in a total of $91 million in post-sanctions transactions.Reducing Excessive Unfunded Government Mandates. In an effort to reduce excessive unfunded government mandates on job creators, giving them greater freedom to invest in their companies and hire new workers, Portman introduced the Unfunded Mandates Accountability and Transparency Act (UMATA). When the federal government imposes unnecessary and burdensome regulations, it undermines employers' ability to hire more workers, and makes it harder for American workers to find jobs. This legislation will free employers from stifling government mandates and help them create more jobs and compete globally.Requiring Federal Agencies to Publish Easily Accessible Annual Budget Justifications Online . In September, Portman applauded the House passage of his bipartisan bill, the Congressional Budget Justification Transparency Act of 2019, to help make information about how the federal government is spending taxpayer dollars more accessible to taxpayers. The legislation will improve government transparency by requiring federal agencies to publish easily understandable justifications for their budget requests on a single, central website each year. Congressional budget justifications are plain-language explanations of how agencies propose to spend money that they request from Congressional appropriators. The materials would also be posted on each agency's website. The legislation was approved by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on November 6th, 2019 and now awaits action on the Senate floor.Fighting for Better, More Affordable Health CareSenator Portman continued his efforts to reform America's health care system in order to lower the cost of coverage, promote access to quality care, and protect the most vulnerable in our society. Health care costs are still too high, and as a result, Ohio families and small businesses continue to see their premiums and deductibles increase.Working to Lower Drug Prices and Health Care Costs. Portman has helped lead efforts to lower the costs of health care and the prices of drugs at the pharmacy counter for the American people. In 2019 , Portman introduced his REFUND Act, which would claw back funds from pharmaceutical manufacturers for wasting excess amounts of drugs on seniors. His proposal would save tax payers over $9 billion. In July of that year, hejoined members of both parties on the Senate Finance Committee in approving the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act, bipartisan legislation to crack down on high prescription drug prices through efforts like his REFUND Act, establishing an out of pocket cap on drug spending for seniors, and by establishing a penalty for drugs that have price increases that grow faster than the rate of inflation.The Senate Finance Committee's work was coupled by efforts from the Senate HELP Committee to increase health care transparency and end the practice of surprise billing. Portman joined these efforts by cosponsoring the STOP Surprise Billing Act in 2019, and was pleased that the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 incorporated these proposals.Portman encourages his colleagues to resume the bipartisan work of lowering prescription drug prices and to pass his bipartisan REFUND Act in 2021.Improving Maternal Health Outcomes for High-Risk Pregnant Women. Portman introduced the bipartisan Harnessing Effective and Appropriate Long Term Health for Moms on Medicaid (HEALTH for MOM) Act legislation designed to improve maternal health outcomes among high-risk pregnant women enrolled in Medicaid by providing a state option for providers to enroll in a "pregnancy medical home", in order to facilitate greater care coordination for a pregnant woman among her care team and available social services. Pregnancy medical homes have a track record of improving access to care for pregnant women throughout pregnancy and of reducing adverse events like hospitalizations for pregnant women and neonatal complications, and the HEALTH for MOM Act would help standardize the means for Medicaid to pay for and support such models.Supporting People with Chronic Conditions and Disabilities. Portman achieved a number of accomplishments to support the most vulnerable. The CARES Act incorporated his Ensuring Access to DSPs Act, which expands access to direct support professionals services for seniors and people with disabilities with Medicaid while hospitalized. Additionally, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 included his EMPOWER Care Act, which would extend the Money Follows the Person Program and expand and reform the program, and an extension of his Independence At Home Demonstration.Visiting Ohio Health Care Providers. In February 2020, Portman traveled to Springfield to visit with leadership from The Abilities Connection (TAC), a nonprofit in Springfield that employs, partners, and cares for people with developmental and physical disabilities, and learned about the services that they provide for the community. On February 28, 2020, Portman visited Brown County to tour the site of the future Ripley Union Lewis Huntington Local School District (RULH) School District health center. The RULH School District, in conjunction with non-profit partner PrimaryPlus, will be providing a full-range of comprehensive primary care services at this new health center and will staff the facility with an experienced family health nurse practitioner and nurse. This center will expand health care to a large part of Brown County that was previously unserved.Helping All Ohioans Reach Their God-Given PotentialThis year, Portman continued his work to ensure that all Ohioans can succeed in life by removing barriers that would have impeded those with a criminal record from becoming productive members of society and helping to address the national housing crisis.Helping Former Incarcerated Individuals Rebuild Their Lives. In June 2020, Portman introduced the bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program Second Chance Act, which would remove barriers to PPP for owners with unrelated felony records while preserving the presumption of innocence and keeping in place the five year timeframe for felony crimes related to financial fraud. This legislation follows Senator Portman's letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Jovita Carranza urging that the SBA allow small business owners with criminal records to apply for the PPP. National and Ohioan reentry and second chance coalition leaders, law enforcement, and local officials have voiced their support of the initiative.Stopping Preventable Evictions . Portman and Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO) teamed up to introduce the Eviction Crisis Act to address the national housing crisis crippling millions of Americans who are struggling to rise into the middle class. The bipartisan legislation will shed light on the root causes of the eviction crisis, reduce preventable evictions, and limit the devastation to families when eviction is unavoidable. Stable housing is a vital part of getting people back on their feet. This legislation will help prevent avoidable evictions, reduce homelessness, and make it easier for people to escape poverty by keeping a roof over their heads.Other Portman AccomplishmentsIn addition to helping lead efforts to create more jobs and opportunity, strengthen retirement security, close the skills gap, combat addiction, end human and sex trafficking, bolster the national defense, and protect our environment, Portman has also been a leader on other issues. Here is a look at some of his other accomplishments over the past year:Senator Portman has fought for all Ohioans and continued to deliver results for them. He helped lead the effort to reform the broken tax code to create more jobs and boost wages. He has led the effort to combat America's drug epidemic. He has led the effort to help stop online sex trafficking. He has consistently stood up for American global leadership and Ohio's servicemembers, and much, much more. Senator Portman will continue to deliver results for Ohio in the 117th Congress.###Load-Date: January 8, 2021End of Document

China Allegedly Spying on Americans Through Caribbean Phone NetworksStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeDecember 17, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 570 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyMiller told the paper that China allegedly conducted more attacks on US mobile phones than anyone else in 2018 - the majority of them routed throughChina Unicom, a state-owned operator."China reduced attack volumes in 2019, favoring more targeted espionage and likely using proxy networks in the Caribbean to conduct its attacks, having close ties in both trade and technology investment", Miller told the Guardian. That's why he told The Guardian of his concerns that Beijing is tracking, monitoring, and intercepting USA phone communications, usually while the user is traveling abroad.Miller has spent years analyzing mobile intelligence reports and observations of signaling traffic between foreign and US mobile operators. That's when he said he noticed a pattern - users getting pinged byChina Unicom were also getting signaled by operators in theCaribbean at the same time. "I want the public to know about it", he said. China has exploited old vulnerabilities in the global telecommunications network to conduct active surveillance attacks through telecoms operators. the attacks seem to be allowing China to intercept and track communications of United States phone customers.But China, working through a state-controlled mobile phone operator, is using the commands to track, monitor or intercept communications.A former mobile network security executive, Gary Miller from Washington, has claimed that China has been allegedly exploiting vulnerabilities in the telephone network to route communications, allowing it to track, intercept and target communications of American mobile phone users.A cluster of attacks was discovered targeting a group of USA phones from networks includingChina Unicom, Cable & Wireless, Barbados and Bahamas Telecom.Govt talks with farmers bound to fail: SCAdvocate Rahul Mehra, for Delhi government, submitted that the farmers were suffering largely in the interest of the country. He was quick to add that agriculture is on the priority list of the government and resolution will be done at the earliest.Miller said that waves of signaling messages were sent to tens of thousands of American cell phone users in a campaign of indiscriminate "mass surveillance" between 2018 and 2020. They allow operators to locate mobile phones, connect mobile phone users to one another, and assess roaming charges. Mobile operators could block such spoofing attempts but the analyst said that the American operators were not aware of how insecure their networks were.The Federal Communications Commission issued a warning in April that it might shut down the United States operations ofChina Unicom, and the agency's chairman, Ajit Pai, said the agency was concerned about the company's vulnerability to the Chinese Communist Party.A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington said: "The Chinese government's position on cybersecurity is consistent and clear"."Government agencies and Congress have been aware of public mobile network vulnerabilities for years. Security recommendations made by our government have not been followed and are not sufficient to stop attackers", Miller said.China's spying efforts have led to explosive national headlines in recent days - with attacks on education, tech and even sitting members of Congress prompting calls for an overhaul of how the US deals with the country's Communist-controlled government. "China is a staunch defender of cybersecurity".Load-Date: December 18, 2020End of Document

Media, Big Tech Track Record On China Comes Into Focus As Disney CEO's Name Emerges For AmbassadorThe Daily CallerDecember 17, 2020 Thursday 02:23 AM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc.

(RELATED: 'A Regime That Fears Religion': New Report Details China's Crackdown On Religion)While filming the movie, Disney shared the script with Chinese authorities to avoid controversy, including over a past Chinese dynasty. Disney had previously displeased the Chinese government in 2018, when the movie “Christopher Robin” was denied release in the country over the Winnie the Pooh character, a symbol of the resistance against the Chinese Communinst Party. The character was blocked on social media after it was used to criticize Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The Chinese government has censored American films in an effort to prevent global audiences from viewing the Chinese Communist Party as a major threat, according to Axios. The last time Hollywood cast characters as victims of the Chinese government was in 1997 in “Seven Years in Tibet.”Marvel, purchased by Disney in 2009, has also been accused of censoring films for China, and reportedly replaced a Tibetan character from a movie with a Celtic woman in order to avoid drifting into forbidden territory with China: the dispute over Tibetan sovereignty. Link to ImageHONG KONG - JULY 19: In this previously unreleased handout photo Bob Iger, president, chief operating officer and chief executive officer-elect of The Walt Disney Company, joins Mickey Mouse in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle July 19, 2005 at the Hong Kong Disneyland Park.

The company opened a $5.5 billion entertainment resort in Shanghai, China, in 2016, Variety reported. Iger called Shanghai Disney the company's “greatest opportunity since buying land in Florida.” Disney partnered with a state-owned company, Shanghai Shendi Group, for the resort.Disney even opened 'Avenger: Endgame' in China two days before it rolled out in the U.S. Apple has also demonstrated its reluctance to criticize the Chinese government. Eddy Cue, the company's senior vice president of internet software and services, has reportedly told creators for Apple + streaming service to “avoid portraying China in a poor light.” He has also told partners that the two things that are off limits are “hard-core nudity and China.”Iger has a long-time relationship with Apple, and a close bond with Apple Inc. founder Steve Jobs, who died in 2011. There was also speculation about a merger between Apple and Disney, with rumors that the two would form a tech and entertainment giant.

CSIS: 'With U.S. Restrictions on Huawei and ZTE, Where Will Rural America Turn?'Targeted News ServiceDecember 10, 2020 Thursday 8:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3123 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Center for Strategic and International Studies issued the following commentary by William Yuen Yee, intern with the Freeman chair in China studies, entitled "With U.S. Restrictions on Huawei and ZTE, Where Will Rural America Turn?":William Yuen Yee is an intern with the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS).* * *As the U.S. government intensifies its scrutiny of Huawei and ZTE, many challenges now abound for rural Americans and the small wireless carriers that both serve and rely upon equipment from the two Chinese telecom giants. Recent FCC orders, bipartisan congressional legislation, and a slew of Trump administration executive actions require rural American telecom carriers to "rip and replace" existing Huawei equipment. At present, two questions essential to the future of telecommunications access for hundreds of thousands of rural Americans remain unanswered. First, uncertainty lingers over whether Congress will allocate sufficient funds to reimburse rural carriers for the costly process of "ripping out" this extant equipment. Second, an alternative telecom provider has yet to emerge as a clear and viable replacement for both Chinese telecom firms.On June 30, 2020, the FCC designated Huawei and ZTE as national security threats--"covered" companies--under the Communications Act of 1934, which provides for the "regulation of interstate and foreign communication by wire or radio, and for other purposes." The move prohibited the agency's annual $8.3 billion Universal Service Fund (USF) from purchasing equipment made by either company. The June FCC order followed the passage of the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019, which won unanimous support in the Senate and was signed into law by President Trump in March. Not only did the bipartisan legislation prevent the use of federal subsidies to purchase communications equipment from "untrusted suppliers" like Huawei and ZTE, but it also mandated a "rip and replace" program to remove extant equipment from both Chinese firms. The new law additionally required the FCC to establish a $1 billion fund that reimburses small telecommunications companies (defined as those with less than 2 million customers) for this process, which will be expensive, complicated, and disruptive. Both moves come after President Trump signed an Executive Order on Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain in May 2019 that barred U.S. telecommunications firms from using the equipment of "foreign adversaries."The FCC's USF serves a variety of purposes: It provides money to rural telecom operators and enables them to subsidize telephone services in low-income areas, proffers Internet access to eligible schools and libraries, and reduces telecommunications service rates for rural health care providers. Issued by a unanimous 5-0 vote in November 2019, the declaration to prevent use of the USF to purchase Huawei equipment effectively bars U.S. firms--especially small wireless carriers--from using Chinese telecom equipment. The decision was based on FCC findings that both companies share close ties to and can be required under Chinese law to cooperate with China's Communist Party, its military, and the nation's intelligence apparatus.According to testimony before the FCC from the Competitive Carriers Association (CCA), an organization that represents nearly 100 rural and national wireless carriers, this new rule will "devastate" the ability of many rural providers to continue serving customers. Some carriers will go bankrupt, as they simply "cannot afford the hundreds of millions of dollars necessary to replace and rebuild their networks using only equipment and services from a new list of approved providers."A History of SuspicionU.S. lawmakers have long viewed Huawei with suspicion due to its purported links to the Chinese military. Since the firm opened its first U.S. offices in 2001, it has confronted a litany of legal and public relations challenges. A widely circulated 2005 RAND Corporation report commissioned by the U.S. Air Force first linked Huawei to the Chinese military, arguing that Huawei was one of a number of Chinese Communist Party-backed "national champions" that receive lines of credit from state-owned banks, alongside staff members and funding from the Chinese military. In 2012, the U.S. House Intelligence Committee released a 52-page report that warned against the dangers of Huawei equipment, noting, "Huawei did not fully cooperate with the investigation and was unwilling to explain its relationship with the Chinese government or Chinese Communist Party, while credible evidence exists that it fails to comply with U.S. laws." A June 2020 Department of Defense list released to Congress of "Communist Chinese military companies" included Huawei.Impact on Rural American CarriersThe FCC order is particularly significant because of Huawei's eminence among telecommunications networks in rural America. The $65.08 billion Chinese conglomerate has long sought to work with small-town internet companies in the United States to replace old-fashioned landlines with high-speed internet connections. In 2018, an estimated 25% of Rural Wireless Association (RWA) networks used some equipment from either Huawei or ZTE. The RWA is a trade association that represents 55 different small wireless carriers, each serving fewer than 100,000 subscribers. A fraction of the 100 carriers in the Competitive Carriers Association--which range from small, rural providers with fewer than 5,000 customers to nationwide providers with millions of customers--also depend on Huawei for their commercial viability, as mentioned in the CCA's manifold advocacy efforts before the FCC.Both trade associations swiftly criticized the ban on Chinese telecom equipment. In a press release issued shortly, the Rural Wireless Association wrote, "As a result, rural carriers who have deployed Huawei or ZTE equipment or services in their networks will now lack the ability to support their critical networks that are serving hundreds of thousands of rural Americans and those traveling through rural America." Steven Berry, the head of the CCA, said that rural carriers were "essentially attempting to rebuild the airplane in mid-flight" by removing and replacing network equipment.While the exact number of rural Americans that still rely on Huawei equipment for telecom service is unclear, it is not an insignificant amount. Moreover, this proportion of the population remains one of the highest at risk of being left behind by the "digital divide": Statistics show that nearly 40% of the rural American population (23 million people) lack access to "fast" broadband internet service, defined by the FCC as a minimum download speed of 25 megabits per second.Small wireless networks serving hundreds of thousands of rural Americans have long been drawn to Huawei's low-cost, reliable products. FCC filings show that Huawei manufactured 80% of the network equipment of Viaero Wireless in eastern Colorado, which currently serves 110,000 mobile customers. Pine Belt Communications in Alabama built its 4G network exclusively with ZTE. United TelCom, SI Wireless, James Valley Telecommunications (JVT), NE Colorado Cellular, United Telephone Association, Nemont Telephone Cooperative, and Union Telephone Company also count themselves among a number of rural wireless network operators that rely on Huawei equipment. Not only has the Chinese firm mitigated the digital exclusion of rural America, its entry into these communities can also revitalize local economic growth. When Pine Telephone Company in Oklahoma spent $32 million to upgrade its network with Huawei, the investment injected life into the economy of Broken Bow and its town of 4,061 residents. Huawei launched businesses, created new jobs, and revived the local tourism industry.Estimated costs to "rip and replace" Huawei and ZTE vary by network carrier. For example, the CCA said that one mid-sized carrier with 100,000 subscribers has estimated the cost to be approximately $410 million. The RWA noted that Alabama's Pine Belt Communications could incur between $7 to $13 million in direct rip and replacement costs. Montana-based Sagebrush Cellular projected the cost of replacing its network to be around $57 million. In total, the RWA approximated that it would cost between $800 million and $1 billion for its member carriers to replace their equipment. A September FCC report pegged the cost at nearly double that price: $1.837 billion.Insufficient Federal Funds to "Rip and Replace"While the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act stipulated a $1 billion reimbursement fund, this amounts to just half of what FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has requested. Per a September RWA filing, Congress has yet to appropriate the requisite funding for these reimbursements. A July proposal from the Republican-led Senate earmarked $1 billion for the "rip and replace" program, although progress stalled amid coronavirus-related relief negotiations. U.S. Senators Ron Johnson and Gary Peters introduced the bipartisan Ensuring Network Security Act in August, which augments access to federal funding for telecommunications providers to remove and replace Huawei and ZTE; however, the bill currently remains pending deliberation in the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The FCC has also not adopted final rules to assure RWA member carriers that they will receive refunds for the replacement of "unsecure" equipment.On December 7, the FCC allotted $9.2 billion via competitive auction to 180 internet and cable service providers to finance the construction of rural broadband networks over the next decade, a move that Pai called the "single largest step ever taken to bridge the digital divide." This recent allocation is independent of the 2019 Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act's stipulation that the FCC provide $1 billion to reimburse small telecommunications companies that remove and replace Huawei and ZTE. However, Pine Belt Communications and Union Telephone Company--two aforementioned rural carriers that utilize Chinese telecom equipment--received $11.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively, from the FCC's recent allotment. While not explicitly intended to "rip and replace," the money might help alleviate some costs associated with the process. Executives from other rural operators like Windstream Communications expressed concern that firms like Elon Musk's SpaceX, which was awarded $885 million, will use the FCC funds to install novel, experimental technologies like gigabit fixed wireless and low-earth orbit satellites rather than to definitively ensure rural households in underserved locations obtain sufficient broadband access. As recipient companies have ten years to build the networks, the funds provide a possible--if incomplete--long-term solution to resolve the extant dearth of rural broadband access. But short-term challenges for many rural telecom carriers to feasibly "rip and replace" Huawei persist.Inadequate funding has already forced two wireless carriers, SI Wireless and Blue Wireless, to shut down. One new source of potential support lies in the congressional appropriations package intended to avert a December 11 government shutdown, although its internal provisions are unclear. Yet, as the 2020 legislative session on Capitol Hill draws to a close, rural carriers remain anxious. The executives of 14 small telecom carriers recently wrote to lawmakers and warned that a failure to act would "devastate many rural areas and exacerbate the digital divide." As CCA chief Berry described, "It's been a cliffhanger for these small carriers for more than six [to] eight months. The damnedest thing about it is they've sort of been frozen in time since the FCC started implementing restrictions."Lack of Cost-Effective AlternativesThe second question that arises--which constitutes perhaps the most pressing challenge for rural American telecom carriers--is who can serve as a cost-effective replacement. For now, Finland's Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson stand to be early frontrunners. The United Kingdom has faced a similar reckoning with Chinese telecom equipment after Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered Huawei to be entirely removed from Britain's 5G network by the end of 2027. So far, the Scandinavian firms have emerged as primary beneficiaries of the ban. Nokia recently inked an expansive deal to replace Huawei and become the largest supplier to British telecom firm BT Group, the principal provider of broadband services in the UK with over 30 million customers. Ericsson, too, signed a new software contract for BT's 5G core network. Telecom firms in Canada and Singapore have also eschewed Huawei and contracted the European firms to build 5G networks in their countries. In a February speech, U.S. Attorney General William Barr similarly offered Nokia and Ericsson as viable alternatives to replace Huawei in the U.S. He said a feasible partnership might arise through an American company or a "consortium of allied companies" adopting a controlling ownership stake to add "financial muscle" to one of the two European firms, although Barr's proposal lacked specifics.However, Nokia and Ericsson remain too costly and technologically inferior to Huawei; they have thus far struggled to capitalize on America's sanctions against the Chinese firm. In 2019, Reuters reported that over a dozen rural American telecom carriers were actively negotiating with the Scandinavian firms, although affordability remained a lingering issue. At present, both Nokia and Ericsson seem unable to match Huawei's pricing, which charge between 30% to 50% less than its rivals. Not only are both European companies unable to benefit from the economies of scale in the massive Chinese market and its access to cheap financing from state-owned banks, they also remain technologically deficient with subpar 5G offerings. A July article in The Wall Street Journal highlighted Nokia's dilemma: The Finnish firm initially invested too heavily in the flexible and powerful albeit costlier field-programmable gate array (FGPA) chip, while customers turned out to prefer Huawei's cheaper, efficient, less energy-intensive "system-on-chip" (SoC). Nevertheless, the race for 5G dominance appears to be tightening: While Huawei commands a significant lead vis-a-vis spending on research and development, Ericsson and Nokia are amassing a greater portion of 5G patents. Yet, the bottom line remains affordability, an area where Chinese firms retain a competitive advantage.Other potential replacement options include South Korea's Samsung and COMSovereign Holding Corp, an American telecom equipment company headquartered in Dallas. Samsung signed a $6.6-billion contract with Verizon Communications in October to provide 5G network equipment through 2025, making clear its ambitions to join the competition for global 5G dominance. COMSovereign has explicitly stated its desire to become the "American Huawei." CEO Dan Hodges has enthusiastically lobbied U.S. lawmakers for government funding to help COMSovereign accomplish this objective, promising the creation of American jobs and the opportunity to surpass China in the race for 5G. In an FCC filing, the Dallas-based firm touted its ability to become a "trusted" vendor and its competitiveness with both Chinese telecom giants, while emphasizing that its partners develop "much of their own hardware and software in proprietary North American facilities."However, industry analysts remain skeptical of the capacity of COMSovereign (or any American company, for that matter) to become the next Huawei--at least for the time being. Price considerations notwithstanding, COMSovereign was founded in 2014 and remains in its nascent stages. Compared to its rivals, the Dallas-based firm does not command the same share of the mobile infrastructure equipment space and must spend ample time to develop such relationships. For example, it took Samsung ten years to establish itself in the U.S. equipment market; to this day, the Korean conglomerate has yet to become a competitive network infrastructure vendor in Europe. In addition, COMSovereign's current financial situation seems precarious: It bears an extensive debt burden, has defaulted on several loans, and reported a negative $4.5 million operating cash flow, according to its latest quarterly financial statement. Daryl Schoolar, a practice manager at the market research firm Omdia, said, "It will take COMSovereign at least a decade to get closer to its stated goal of competing with Ericsson, Huawei or Nokia."An Uncertain FutureNow, the future of rural wireless operators and the American customers they serve remains unclear. This state of limbo is rapidly proving untenable. An FCC filing from the Rural Wireless Association revealed that individual member carriers turned off 3G services over insufficient funds, eliminating 911 services in some rural areas. Indeed, many rural carriers have repeatedly iterated their willingness to remove equipment from "unsecure" vendors like Huawei, provided they receive sufficient federal assistance to do so. However, Congress has not earmarked the requisite funds. A viable, cost-effective alternative to Chinese equipment has yet to emerge.While it is easy to lambast Huawei and reiterate calls for "rip and replace," an effective solution requires nuance, coordination, and, most importantly, adequate funds. The first step lies in a concerted, bipartisan congressional effort to allocate the $2 billion that FCC Chairman Pai has requested to finance the nationwide removal of such unsecure equipment. To replace this equipment, the U.S. government can, in the short-term, utilize subsidies and issue credit to European firms like Nokia and Ericsson, enabling them to match Huawei's prices. In the long-term, the federal government should aim to create a startup-friendly environment that spurs competition, stimulates innovation, and invests significantly in 5G research, applications, and infrastructure. Indeed, while the U.S. lags behind Huawei, ZTE, Ericsson, and Nokia, the goal of developing a homegrown, American competitor is not entirely out of reach.However, this status quo of uncertainty cannot endure, and congressional inaction will prove dire: The lack of adequate financing and an organized plan for "rip and replace" could result in the ultimate elimination of access to basic communications for thousands of rural, underserved American communities.[Category: Political][Category: ThinkTank1]Copyright Targeted News Services'T40-MgEditor'-7326475 'T40-MgEditor'Load-Date: December 15, 2020End of Document

Taiwan Says China Wants to Spy on Nations, Steal Data Through Undersea Cable NetworksNewsweek.comDecember 18, 2020 Friday 5:30 AM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 957 wordsByline: David BrennanHighlight: Reuters reported this week that the U.S. has warned two Pacific island nations about security threats of doing business with China's Huawei Marine company.BodyTaiwan has claimed that China is backing private investment in Pacific undersea cable networks as a way to spy on foreign nations and steal data from its rivals, following a report this week that the U.S. is warning Pacific nations against awarding cable contracts to Chinese state-linked firms.Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokesperson Joanne Ou told Newsweek Friday that China is planning to "monopolize" Pacific information and communication networks as a means to snoop on other nations and steal valuable information and data.Reuters reported Thursday that the U.S. government is concerned about possible Chinese involvement in the Kiribati Connectivity Project (KCP), which will improve connection to the small island nations of Kiribati, Nauru and the Federated States of Micronesia.The KCP cables are also planned to connect to the HANTRU-1 network that serves Guam, a U.S. Pacific territory that has significant strategic value given its proximity to China, North Korea, and the rest of east Asia, and a significant American military presence.Reuters said the U.S. has sent warnings to the Pacific nations of the Federated States of Micronesia and Nauru about the bid from Huawei Marine, recently divested from the giant Huawei Technologies firm that has been at the heart of the simmering U.S.-China technological confrontation. Huawei Marine is now majority-owned by another Chinese firm.Reuters said the U.S. warned the Pacific nations that Huawei Marine and other Chinese firms are required to co-operate with Beijing's intelligence and security services. U.S. officials have repeatedly framed large Chinese companies as arms of the Chinese Communist Party. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for example, has repeatedly referred to Huawei and others as "Trojan Horses" for Beijing.Huawei Marine hopes to win the $72.6 million project, which is backed by the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, Reuters reported.Newsweek has contacted the Chinese government to request comment on the Reuters report and the Taiwanese assertions. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told Reuters that the United States was smearing Chinese companies.Taiwan is a key element of Beijing's Pacific strategy, by which it seeks to displace the U.S. as the dominant power and secure control of the waters around its coastline. China considers Taiwan a renegade province and has long vowed to take control of the democratic island nation, which is supported by the U.S."China's foreign aid strategy has always been to expand its strategic economic influence, and has never been to promote the welfare of the peoples of recipient countries," Ou told Newsweek in response to the Reuters report."The Chinese government claims to be concerned about the information and communication infrastructure of Pacific nations, and then invests in the construction of undersea cables in the Pacific."China's main aim is to monopolize the information and communication networks of the Pacific region. Its strategic goal is to control the key infrastructure of relevant countries in the region and obtain big data in order to monitor each country and steal information.Reuters reported that Huawei Marine's bid is as much as 20 percent lower than its rivals, putting it in pole position to take the contract, although the project could yet be split up among the bidders. Kiribati is believed to be particularly in favor of the Chinese bid. Its government did not respond to Newsweek's request for comment.Ou said: "Chinese companies violate international market norms by competing for international development bids using cut-rate prices and government subsidies. These are not normal or legitimate trade and investment practices, but an extension of China's wolf warrior diplomatic strategy," a phrase describing Beijing's combative foreign diplomacy.China has sought to leverage its economic, diplomatic and military power to isolate Taiwan and undermine its independence. This includes pressuring nations to drop diplomatic recognition of the diplomatic islands in favor of Beijing. Kiribati did so last year.The region is a diplomatic battleground between Beijing and Taipei. Nauru is one of four Pacific nations—alongside the Marshall Islands, Palau and Tuvalu—that maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Eight other regional nations maintain diplomatic ties with Beijing.Ou dismissed concerns that Nauru might be swayed to switch allegiance to China. "Taiwan and Nauru are both democracy- and freedom-loving countries that uphold human rights," she said."President Lionel Aingimea has strongly supported Taiwan in the United Nations, World Health Organization and other international arenas. Bilateral relations between Taiwan and Nauru are friendly and close, and we are confident in deepening our countries' diplomatic friendship."Ou also warned that the "extremely low quality" of Chinese investment projects could "seriously endanger Nauru's development and the safety of its people, leaving the Nauru government and its people feeling unsafe and dissatisfied."The Nauru government did not respond to Newsweek's request for comment on the KCP and potential Chinese involvement. A spokesperson for the island's government told Reuters that bids were being examined and that stakeholders were addressing "technical and administrative issues" to ensure the project's progress.Ou urged all involved nations and aid agencies "to be vigilant" regarding Chinese involvement and to "re-examine the rationality of the bidding process and the quality of completed projects.""The Chinese government has already used the same method to acquire information and communication projects, including for undersea cables, in many Pacific nations," she said.Link to ImageGraphic Taiwan undersea cables China spy information PacificSAM YEH/AFP via Getty Images/GettyThis file photo shows a map of damaged undersea cables around Taiwan during a press conference in Taipei, 28 December 2006 following a series of earthquakes.Load-Date: December 18, 2020End of Document

China tries to change the origin of the new coronavirus with global campaignCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 30, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 413 wordsBodyIt was on November 17, 2019 that the first patient with viral pneumonia, which the world now knows and identifies as Covid-19, was identified in Wuhan.A year later, China is now trying to change the source of the virus in the eyes of the world by intensifying a global campaign to raise questions about the zero point of the new coronavirus.Recently, several news has been made public that the new coronavirus has been discovered in packages of imported frozen meat and China, through Chinese state media, has been stepping up news in this regard and investigating possible cases of the disease found outside the country before December 2019."Wuhan was where the coronavirus was first detected, but not where it originated," said Zeng Guang, former chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, quoted on Facebook by the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China.Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign minister, also said it was important to distinguish where the first case of Covid-19 was identified from the moment the virus passed from animals to people. Lijian also says that the origin is being identified in "several countries and regions".Chinese scientists even submitted a document for publication in the scientific journal The Lancet, which has not been reviewed by other scientists, which indicates that "Wuhan is not the place where the Sars-CoV-2 transmission from person to person occurred for the first time", suggesting that the first case may have been in the "Indian subcontinent".Despite China's attempts to divert Wuhan's attention, it is certain that the Western scientific community gives little credit to them.WHO wants to investigate in WuhanThe World Health Organization has already unveiled plans to investigate the origin of the Covid-19 outbreak that triggered a global pandemic and the starting point will be Wuhan, China, where it all began.The scientific journal Nature, however, indicates that researchers will face challenges throughout their research given the political situation between China and the United StatesMost researchers believe the outbreak originated in bats, but the way the virus was transmitted from the animal to humans is unknown. It may have been passed directly, or through an intermediate host. That is the link that researchers are trying to determine, and to do so, they will need close collaboration between scientists and the Chinese government.Load-Date: December 1, 2020End of Document

He accuses her of lying about Huawei's ties to Iran, a violation of the US embargo imposed against the Islamic Republic.His arrest caused a major diplomatic crisis between China and Canada.Two Canadian citizens, arrested in China shortly after Meng, remain in detention in the Asian country on charges of espionage.According to the paper, Meng's lawyers have negotiated with the U.S. Department of Justice an agreement that would allow the detainee to return to her country, as long as she admits some of the charges against her.His lawyers and the Justice Department are negotiating this week in hopes of reaching a compromise before the Trump administration leaves on January 20, according to this information.Consulted Friday by AFP, Huawei declined to comment on this information.According to the paper, an agreement between the two sides could facilitate the release of the two Canadians detained in China for just under two years, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.Both the Chinese government and Huawei deny Washington's accusations against Meng, and Beijing claims that the U.S. administration seeks to weaken a leading Chinese company.Huawei is targeted by an arsenal of U.S. sanctions, which accuses the telecommunications group without evidence of spying for the communist regime.Washington banned U.S. companies from selling equipment to Huawei and convinced many of its allies to dispense with China for the installation of its 5G networks, the fifth generation of mobile internet of which the Chinese giant is a world leader.With AFP informationMORE ON THIS TOPIC:Huawei sales plummeted and lost leadership in mobile phone marketJair Bolsonaro mulls banning Huawei from participating in the construction of Brazil's 5G networkBrazil confronts The Chinese regime by Huawei: "We don't want to be spyed on and violated by our freedoms"Load-Date: December 5, 2020End of Document

CSIS: 'Video Conferencing Technology and Risk'Targeted News ServiceDecember 3, 2020 Thursday 1:17 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4448 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Center for Strategic and International Studies issued the following report entitled "Video Conferencing Technology and Risk" by James Lewis:Executive Summary* The Covid-19 pandemic created a massive surge in the use of video conferencing technologies and the number of service offerings. The sudden expansion of these services and our reliance on them has raised understandable concerns about risk and security.* Media reporting on video conferencing (VTC) risk was not always accurate. Suggesting that a competitor has security problems is one technique used to shift markets and customers. However, if these suggestions are provided without attribution, they are not a very good basis for assessing risk.* Since covert entry to a VTC meeting is almost impossible--since interception of communication is expensive for an attacker and defeated by encryption--and if the use of commercial cloud services mitigates many risks, the overall cybersecurity risk of using a major VTC service is no greater and possibly less than anything else done on the internet.* VTC services generally pose a lesser risk to privacy than many apps, websites, or search applications.* Encryption is essential for reducing the risk of using VTC and is provided by major suppliers. End-to-end encryption adds a layer of protection but comes at the cost of reduced services and regulatory concerns.* The leading VTC services have begun to converge in two key metrics: convenience and security. Competition over which VTC service to use is increasingly a matter of price, innovation in new services, interoperability with other programs, and consumer preferences.Video Conferencing Technology and RiskOne effect of the Covid-19 pandemic has been an explosion in the use of video conferencing technologies and the number of service offerings. There are tens of millions of daily users on Zoom, Teams, WebEx, and other platforms. These products offer the ability to have virtual meetings with large numbers of people from any location connected to the internet. The number of platforms has also increased dramatically. Although Zoom, Teams, and WebEx have the largest market shares, they have more than a dozen competitors (both U.S. and foreign) offering similar services. The sudden expansion of reliance on these technologies has raised understandable concerns about risk and security.The surge in the use of video conferencing technology focused attention on the security of these communications. In fact, much of the discussion of security was overblown, but there were issues and the barrage of charges principally aimed at shaping demand for different products.We can divide these concerns over security into six categories: software development risk, loss of personal information, interception of communications, illicit access to stored data, damage to privacy, and use for influence operations. Some problems, such as unintended intruders into meetings who engage in disruptive behavior, have been remedied. It is important to note that media reporting on VTC risk was not always accurate, for reasons that will be discussed later.It's also important to place the risk of using video conferencing technology in the larger context of cyber risk on the internet. There is always risk in using anything that connects to the internet, and there are risks with anything that connects to China. An assessment of risk needs to look at both the risk of using one technology or service compared to others and the risks of video conferencing in the broader digital environment. There are other concerns that drive choices of VTC services--chief among them convenience and cost--but security has dominated much of the initial discussion of their use.The first question to ask is whether using a video conference service is riskier than any other internet app? The answer is no. The second is whether one VTC application is riskier than another, and again, while the risk profile of different services varies given different company practices, the answer is also no.How VTC works is easy to describe (although this does not do justice to the sophisticated software it uses). Video and audio input from a device's camera and microphone are converted from an analog to a digital signal that can be transmitted over the internet. Compression software (known as codec, for compression/decompression) shrinks the data to make it smaller and faster to transfer. When the data arrives at the other end, codec software decompresses it and converts it back to analog signals that can play on speakers or a screen. Most VTC programs use software for noise suppression and sound control. The process requires high speed, high capacity, internet connections, and networks. Users can either install an app or attend a meeting by connecting through their browser.The intent of potential attackers is not an issue. Based on years of observation, we can simply assume hostile intent to gain political, intelligence, or financial benefit. Hostile states--chief among them Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea--and omnipresent cybercrime groups make this a dangerous online environment. Potential attackers are opportunistic, often persistent, and well-financed. Any device that connects to the internet can be a target, and many are vulnerable. Yet that is not the issue; instead, it is whether opponents perceive greater opportunity from attacking VTC or whether they decide their efforts are best spent elsewhere, and whether users are incurring greater risk through the use of video conferencing than they would from using any other internet service.To evaluate this, we can examine broad categories of cyber risk: illicit access for espionage or crime, disruption of services, loss of personal information, and influence operations. All of these risks accompany any online activity. Risk is already omnipresent online, and the issue is not whether there is risk but how that risk is managed. This means that another area for consideration involves assessing company efforts to manage cybersecurity and privacy risks.Cyber risk is not really a differentiator for major VTC. The current leader in market share, Zoom, at first had issues, but these were a reflection of company maturity as much as anything and have largely been addressed. Zoom was also the target of a media campaign intended to discredit it. Microsoft Teams has moved rapidly to improve services, and it benefits from Microsoft's larger commitment to security and effective development practices. WebEx is both secure and convenient. Competition over which VTC service to use is increasingly a matter of price, innovation in new services, and consumer preferences since the leading services have all begun to converge in two key metrics: convenience and security.The leading VTC services have begun to converge in two key metrics: convenience and security. Competition over which VTC service to use is increasingly a matter of price, innovation in new services, interoperability with other programs, and consumer preferences.Risk from Espionage and CybercrimeEspionage is one of the hallmarks of cyberspace. At any moment, numerous intelligence programs are being used by a number of powerful states operating in cyberspace. The issues for video conferencing are whether its use increases the risk of data loss, the value of information obtainable from the app, and how difficult it is to obtain illicitly. Highly valuable information will elicit considerable effort from the attacker; less valuable information will lead them to look elsewhere. This means government and business users are the most likely targets.Video conferencing technologies, by their very nature, limit espionage and cybercrime risk. An espionage effort aimed at a VTC service would need to access either communications during the actual call or access stored data if the call is recorded. This would need to be done surreptitiously, and the targeted data would have to be valuable enough to justify expending resources on VTC rather than some other target.Video conferencing is not an efficient avenue for financial cybercrime since users rarely store financial data and the opportunities for "phishing," the most common criminal technique, are also limited. Returns from the theft of intellectual property are also limited, as people don't usually transmit or store company sensitive information such as blueprints or other intellectual property. There is a benefit, of course, from being able to listen in to business conferences, but this is difficult to do surreptitiously. These limitations make VTC of lower value for cyber espionage or financial crime.The risk of interception for VTC is similar to the risk of using Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) for communications. The digital data of a VOIP call can with some effort be intercepted and if the signal is not encrypted, an eavesdropper will have access to the communications.But it is difficult for an eavesdropper to avoid appearing in a video conference session. Their name will appear even if their image does not, and there is no public discussion as to whether the more advanced intelligence agencies have developed techniques for covert attendance in zoom conferences. It could be possible to listen in on video conferencing as the speech and the video is transmitted over the internet. This would be essentially the equivalent of wiretapping, but video conferencing companies have sought to address this problem through the use of encryption.As a general rule, it is easier to access, copy, and exfiltrate stored data. However, the leading VTC providers use the cloud for storage. Microsoft, for example, uses its Azure cloud network, and Zoom uses Oracle. This means the risk of using VTC is no different than the risk of any other cloud use, as these larger cloud service providers are very secure. The use of commercial cloud services reduces risk to almost zero.Since covert entry to a VTC meeting is very difficult, and since the interception of communication is expensive for an attacker and defeated by encryption, and if the use of cloud services reduce risk to stored data to zero, the risk of using a legitimate VTC service is no greater and probably less than anything else done on the internet.A hacker could discover a "bug" in the VTC code and exploit this for either access to digital traffic or stored data. All software has bugs. Often these are unintentional coding errors that affect functionality or that provide for illicit access. The complexity and size of programs and applications guarantee this. The need for VTC to interface with browsers, such as Internet Explorer, Chrome, or Firefox, also creates opportunities for inadvertent vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit. The best practices to address bugs include development practices that emphasize security, company research on potential vulnerabilities, frequent patching, and updates to address any bugs that are discovered. The best VTC services offer a "bug bounty" where researchers external to the company are rewarded for reporting what they have discovered. One way to assess the risk of individual VTC offerings is to determine if they have these software best practices in place.Encryption and VTCMajor VTC services provide users some level of encryption by default. This reflects standard practice across the industry. Teams, for example, uses the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) key management features of Windows Server and MTLS (Mutual Transport Layer Security), a cryptographic protocol used to protect the transfer of data. Microsoft, Cisco, and others have spent years developing effective encryption for their enterprise applications, and most VTC apps follow in their footsteps.End-to-end encryption provides another level of data protection. Currently, WebEx and Zoom offer end-to-end encryption. Essentially, the user controls the cryptographic key needed to encrypt and decrypt the traffic generated by the VTC meeting rather than the service provider. This means that only the user has access to the encryption keys and (barring heroic and expensive efforts) to the plaintext. End-to-end encryption adds a layer of protection but comes at the cost of reduced services and increased regulatory concerns. The default encryption provided with VTC product is sufficient for thwarting potential attackers, but users who want a higher level of privacy and security may find the trade-offs from using end-to-end encryption acceptable.The use of encryption is a central part of any VTC defense against espionage. China occupies a special category of risk, given its aggressive espionage efforts and its massive domestic surveillance program. Its national practices and laws show that any information is potentially a target for the government to collect. There is a reasonable risk that China will attempt to surveil any video communications as it now does with any Internet communications between Western companies. The issue is what content is available and of interest to the Chinese State that would justify its collection, but business communications have been a principal target in the past. As a general rule, not just for activity in China, sensitive communications should be encrypted.PrivacyThe privacy risks associated with the use of VTC depend on what data the service provider collects and how that data is used. The information collected to open a VTC account does not vary widely from app to app. It can include name, address, email address, phone number, job title, and employer. The risk from this collection of information is low. This personal identifiable information (PII) is often already available from open source sites or black markets. The intelligence value of PII available from VTC accounts is limited, and basic biographic data does not provide useful information, even when cross-referenced with other data. This makes VTC less useful as a source of data for cybercrime or espionage. It is also usual when using the platform, even without an account for the e-service provider, to collect the type of device being used and the IP address.The question for privacy risk, however, is not just what is collected, but rather how it is used. In this, VTC services generally pose a lesser risk to privacy than many apps, websites, or search applications, since the big VTC services do not have an advertising-based revenue model, where personal data is harvested and then used or sold for advertising. What makes this kind of user data valuable is when it is combined with indicators of interest that are provided by search queries, websites viewed, geographic location, or keywords in email. PII is most valuable when these are collected, analyzed, and correlated with other data, and then used or sold for commercial purposes. Well-known examples include Google and Facebook, but there are a number of less well-known data collectors since the practice is the norm online. The major VTC services do not use this kind of data collection model as a way to generate revenue.Zoom, at first, had issues stemming from a relationship with Facebook that have since been rectified. The Zoom app notified Facebook when a user opened the app and provided details on the device, the time zone and location, the network service provider, and, more troubling, a unique identifier which could be used for targeted advertising. This data transfer to Facebook was at first not described specifically in Zoom's privacy policy, although the policy did say that "third-party service providers and advertising partners (e.g., Google Ads and Google Analytics) automatically collect some information about you." When this omission was pointed out, Zoom removed the Facebook "Software Developers Kit," which had collected the data as part of allowing a Zoom user to log in using Facebook credentials.VTC services generally pose a lesser risk to privacy than many apps, websites, or search applications.All of the major VTC services have taken action to make their services compliant with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). WebEx, for example, is accredited under the EU Binding Corporate Rules that require policies that are fully aligned with GDPR. These involve differing mechanisms for consent, options for "cookies," and management of personal data. GDPR's requirements for transparency, accountability, and user control set a global regulatory baseline, although in some instances, the application of these measures is limited to consumers with an IP address in Europe. The measures address the requirements of GDPR for user consent and control of data (and in some cases, the requirements imposed by California state law). There is a real risk to privacy online, especially in countries with weak regulatory regimes, but the use of VTC does not increase this.VTC and ChinaOne potential alleged risk is the development of software for these video conferencing projects in China. In fact, many large software companies have development offices in China--the most obvious being Microsoft, which has been there for years. Microsoft has developed effective controls to mitigate the risk of this software development process to avoid creating security problems in its products.Interviews with a number of companies suggest that the primary reasons for having development offices in China are to customize their products for the Chinese market and to take advantage of the talent pool that exists in China. For video conferencing, customization for the China market is less important because the primary market before Covid-19 was Western enterprises that wanted video conferencing capabilities. Since Covid-19, the market has shifted to include both enterprises and consumers and a range of consumer-facing applications including health and education that do not pose customization issues. None of the major video conferencing platforms rely on Chinese software or make extensive use of Chinese coders for their platforms.Most companies that do software development in China take a number of steps to ensure greater security. These include compartmentalizing the software development process so that Chinese developers do not have access to code for the entire product, ensuring that the "crown jewels" for any program remain under U.S. control and in many cases are developed within the United States, and finally using encryption and other defensive measures to prevent access to code by unauthorized personnel in China. The development of these steps has been driven by the very real risk of espionage and surveillance in China, and this alone motivates companies to protect their software because of the fear that it could be copied and stolen by Chinese employees even if the Chinese state is disinterested--a problem that goes back decades. These measures are fairly well-known within the IT industry and are used by major video conferencing platforms.The concern is that the Chinese developers employed by a Western company could be recruited by the Chinese state to tamper with or surreptitiously insert malicious code into a product that would provide access to communications or data. But there is no evidence that this has occurred with videoconferencing products. While the risk of supply chain poisoning remains important, we need to think of it in terms of the priorities of the opponent. In the cases of these VTC services, where the ability to access software without detection is difficult and might require more effort and investment than other targets, this could lead opponents to look elsewhere for opportunity. An opponent might pursue other avenues for data access, and while we cannot dismiss the risk of supply chain poisoning, it remains a low probability threat for video conferencing platforms.Censorship and Influence OperationsOther security issues raised by China include influence operations and censorship and the application of Chinese laws regarding content. The most famous example might be TikTok, where there was a fear that China would use this short video platform as a means for influence operations. This is a dubious concern since the bulk of the messaging on TikTok does not lend itself to Chinese propaganda. Similarly, use by China of VTC platforms for influence operations will be extremely difficult, given the format and the lack of anonymity.Influence operations are another hallmark of cyberspace and, after espionage, the most common form of malicious activity by nation-states. Russia, China, and Iran are the leading users of influence operations, which move traditional propaganda and disinformation online and make use of both covert and overt social media campaigns--which have immensely increased the reach of influence operations and the ability to spread false or misleading information. None of the VTC platforms are attractive for influence operations. Early problems such as unintended intruders into meetings who engaged in disruptive behavior, or "zoom-bombing," which could be seen as a primitive form of influence operation, have since been remedied. Given that the content is "live," attendance is a matter of choice, and surreptitious participation is difficult, VTC is not a good platform for influence operations.The greater risk is not injecting propaganda or misinformation into video streams but censorship. China has been active in ensuring that any company that operates on its networks observes its national laws regarding the censorship of content that the Chinese government regards politically harmful. In this, the risk is again minimal. Consumers using VTC are not accessing Chinese content, and major video conferencing platforms have been careful to design their platforms are not subject to Chinese controls.Censorship is a problem, but not one that any individual company can address. It arises if someone is using VTC in a country that censors content, and that country demands that the VTC service provider block certain meetings. Most companies deal with this by stating that they observe the laws of the country where the service is being used but do not apply those laws to users outside of that country's jurisdiction. This involves filtering users by probable location (based on the IP address) and not applying censorship request to users outside of the jurisdiction in question.This issue is mainly raised by China, given its government's agitation over anything that deviates from the Party line or seems critical-- concerns that are complicated by China's deep business interconnections with the rest of the world. Zoom was criticized for its mishandling early in the pandemic of censorship vis-a-vis China, but this reflected the company's immature internal processes and appears to have been since rectified. This problem goes back to the Yahoo incident of 2006. While the solutions remain unsatisfactory, it is part of the larger international dispute over China's disregard for fundamental rights and efforts to apply its national restrictions on an extraterritorial basis. However, China's controls do not apply to content created and consumed outside of its jurisdiction. This puts VTC meetings outside of China's reach.Media Coverage Driven by CompetitionIn understanding the public story on the security of VTC service providers, it is worth placing these stories in the context of the hyper-competitive tech market. The House of Representatives provided examples of this kind of competitive behavior. In this environment, suggesting that a competitor has security problems is one technique used to shift markets and customers. Early media reporting on VTC security vulnerabilities seems to have been driven at least in part by these kinds of completive concerns. However, reporting without attribution is not a very good basis for assessing risk.Easy tests for judging the validity of a story include: does it cite sources by name, or does it refer to anonymous "experts?" Does it look at the risk of using technology from all companies in the space, or just one company? A story that only talks about one company and cites anonymous experts or unnamed industry sources should be given extra scrutiny. If a spate of such stories appears at the same time, this may be a sign of a campaign intended to damage a competitor. One example of this is the 2006 Dubai Ports effort to purchase a U.S. port management company. A frustrated competitor contacted media outlets and congressional offices to charge that this purchase by a forewing company created security risks, ultimately killing the deal even though the charge was frivolous.Suggesting that a competitor has security problems is one technique used to shift markets and customers. However, if these suggestions are provided without attribution, they are not a very good basis for assessing risk.Security and Privacy ChecklistThe response to Covid-19 created a major new market for VTC, leading many companies to develop products and services for video conferencing as a replacement for face-to-face engagement. Cybersecurity is a real concern, and in looking at the leading products, it seems safe to say that VTC is no worse, and in many cases, better than other online apps and services. Cybersecurity is not a static activity, and the ability of VTC providers to continue to update and improve the security of their services--and demonstrate this to their customers--is crucial. The following questions can help guide decisions on the risk of using VTC* Does the VTC app and platform use encryption?* Does it have an advertising-based revenue model?* Does it have policies in place for breach notifications?Is it GDPR compliant?* Can it demonstrate that it follows secure development practices?* Does it use industry best practices for patching and updating?* Does it use a reputable cloud service provider?* Are there known incidents of espionage or crime?The answers to these questions provide a framework for assessing risk unique to VTC, and our conclusion is that cybersecurity and privacy risks are no greater than what is generally found on the internet and not significant differentiators among major VTC services. Instead, the leading services have all begun to converge in the security and convenience of their apps. Competition over which VTC service to use is increasingly a matter of price, innovation in new services, and consumer preferences.James Andrew Lewis is a senior vice president and director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.[Category: Political][Category: ThinkTank1]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7347541 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: January 17, 2021End of Document

This season, the only trip planned is the possible return of the Toronto Raptors to Canada and only after March.Traditionally, the NBA plays preseason games in China and some regular season games in Mexico and Europe Plans for this season provided for a game in Paris, but the pandemic forced it to be postponed. "We anticipate that once it is healthy and safe, we will again have an international game schedule during the pre-season and the regular season," Tatum said.NBA games remained available in China through Tencent's platforms last season, and despite tensions between the league and the Chinese government.In October 2019, houston's then executive director Daryl Morey expressed support for the anti-government protests in Hong Kong in a message posted on the social network Twitter, prompting retaliation from China.State television channel CCTV, for example, suspended the broadcast of NBA games for a year. CCTV returned to broadcast the NBA in the last two Finals games, which were played last October.Commissioner Adam Silver admitted last February that China's veto cost the league $400 million (328 million euros) in revenue losses.Load-Date: December 24, 2020End of Document

Sen. Portman Statement on Former Nationwide Children's Researcher, Chinese Talents Program Member Pleading Guilty for Alleged Theft of Scientific Trade Secrets, Wire FraudTargeted News ServiceDecember 16, 2020 Wednesday 8:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 479 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, issued the following statement on Dec. 15:* * *Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) issued the following statement after John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, David M. DeVillers, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, and Chris Hoffman, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that a former Nationwide Children's Hospital's Research Institute researcher pleaded guilty to conspiring to steal scientific trade secrets and commit wire fraud while receiving benefits from the Chinese government. The researcher's wife previously pleaded guilty to the same crimes in July 2020.Senator Portman, as Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), led a year-long investigation into China's talent recruitment programs like the Thousand Talents Program, culminating in a bipartisan report (https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2019-11-18%20PSI%20Staff%20Report%20-%20China's%20Talent%20Recruitment%20Plans.pdf) in November 2019 that detailed how China has recruited U.S.-based scientists and researchers since the late 1990s and incentivized them to transfer U.S. taxpayer-funded research and IP to China for their own military and economic gain. This case follows the string of arrests of academics affiliated with American universities for alleged crimes related to their participation in China's talent recruitment programs while accepting American taxpayer-funded grant funding. Earlier this year, Portman introduced the bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act to protect American research and IP from global competitors. Both FBI Director Wray and Attorney General Barr, have spoken about the threat to American taxpayer-funded research and intellectual property from foreign governments, particularly China, which would be addressed by this legislation."I'm pleased that our committee investigation and resulting report last year continues to spur action by federal law enforcement to hold China accountable. For too long, China has exploited the lack of transparency in our education system to steal our taxpayer-funded research and innovation. I commend U.S. Attorney DeVillers and the DOJ for their work to stop another alleged member of China's talent programs, adding to the string of arrests that have been announced this year."This case further underscores the need for my bipartisan legislation to safeguard American innovation, hold countries like China accountable for their actions, and ensure our world-class research enterprise is protected here in America. I am encouraged by the actions taken by DOJ and the FBI to stop the exploitation of the openness and transparency of our research enterprise. China's ongoing theft of America's research and innovation must stop."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7327328 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 16, 2020End of Document

Edward Snowden Leaked US Secrets To China - Some Republicans Now Want Trump To Pardon HimThe Daily CallerDecember 31, 2020 Thursday 12:02 AM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: ANALYSIS; national-securityLength: 797 wordsByline: Varun Hukeri, Reporter, varun@dailycaller.comBodyLink to ImageFormer National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden has been living in exile in Russia for several years and potentially faces a decades-long prison sentence for espionage after leaking American intelligence secrets in 2013.The impending conclusion of President Donald Trump's term in office has stirred public debate among Republicans over whether Snowden is a traitor deserving punishment or a whistleblower worthy of clemency. Trump has already pardoned 42 people since the Nov. 3 election, according to the Department of Justice.Trump floated the idea of a Snowden pardon earlier this year. “There are a lot of people that think that he is not being treated fairly,” he told The New York Post. “It's certainly something I could look at. Many people are on his side, I will say that. I don't know him, never met him. But many people are on his side.”WATCH:His remarks were notable as Trump has railed against government leakers throughout the course of his presidency, The Wall Street Journal reported. Trump even tweeted in 2013 that Snowden “is a spy who should be executed.”Some Republicans have taken Snowden's side in recent weeks amid speculation that Trump is considering a pardon. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul argued in favor of the move in a Dec. 17 op-ed published in The Federalist. Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz said pardoning Snowden “was the right thing to do” in a Dec. 13 tweet.Other Republicans remain unconvinced. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham suggested Snowden “has American blood on his hands” in a Dec. 15 tweet. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney said pardoning Snowden “would be unconscionable” in a Dec. 13 tweet.One significant consequence of Snowden's intelligence leak was that it boosted Beijing's espionage capabilities - a move that may have allowed China to conduct cyberattacks on the U.S. government and execute CIA informants operating in China.After revealing himself as the NSA leaker in June 2013, Snowden fled to Hong Kong and later revealed intelligence secrets about American cyber operations in Hong Kong and mainland China. These operations targeted Chinese telecom companies, the prestigious Tsinghua University and fibre optic cable company Pacnet, according to the South China Morning Post. (RELATED: China Stole Data For Years, But Learning How To Read It Is What Changed The Global Spy Game)The revelation that American spies infiltrated the Chinese telecom giant Huawei is of particular importance because Snowden publicized a number of secrets regarding the NSA's espionage tactics, according to The New York Times.China took note of how the U.S. was conducting its cyber operations and used that leaked intelligence to its advantage. “Chinese officials were just beginning to learn how the internet and technology has been so thoroughly used against them, in ways they didn't conceptualize until then,” one former senior intelligence analyst told Foreign Policy. “China had also stepped up its hacking efforts targeting biometric and passenger data from transit hubs, former intelligence officials say-including a successful hack by Chinese intelligence of biometric data from Bangkok's international airport.” - Alexa O'Brien (@alexadobrien) December 21, 2020Less than a year after Snowden went public, a group of hackers identified as X1 and reported to be working on behalf of the Chinese government breached the systems of contractors who ran federal background checks and had access to Office of Personnel and Management (OPM) servers.Around 21 million personnel records were targeted in the OPM hack, including information about government employees and background check data. National security officials later compared the potential damage of the OPM breaches to the Snowden leaks, according to a 2015 Congressional Research Service report. (RELATED: Trump Says Things Are 'Under Control' After Latest US Government Hack. Just How Bad Is It?)Chinese intelligence officials also began using American infiltration techniques and flaws in the CIA's communication networks to identify the agency's assets and sources in China. Dozens of CIA informants were either executed or imprisoned by the Chinese government between 2010 and 2012, according to The New York Times.According to Foreign Policy, the Chinese government began using data collected over time and from the intelligence leaks in order to predict the CIA's moves. Mined data could be used to follow behavioral and travel patterns, allowing Chinese intelligence to determine who might become a potential CIA source and why.Top officials in the U.S. military and intelligence community previously lamented after the 2013 leaks were publicized that Snowden's actions had placed American troops and other assets in greater danger, The Wall Street Journal reported.Graphic HONG KONG - 2013: (EDITOR'S NOTE: ONLY AVAILABLE TO NEWS ORGANISATIONS AND NOT FOR ENTERTAINMENT USE) In this handout photo provided by The Guardian, Edward Snowden speaks during an interview in Hong Kong.

Internet Governance Project: Why We Must Push Back Against the FCC's Harassment of China TelecomTargeted News ServiceDecember 18, 2020 Friday 9:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1423 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: ATLANTA, Georgia BodyThe Georgia Institute of Technology School of Public Policy's Internet Governance Project issued the following article:Under Chairman Ajit Pai, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission made itself a tool of the Trump administration's assault on economic relations with China. One part of this was an attempt to expel China Telecom (Americas) from the U.S. market. The FCC issued an order to China Telecom of the Americas (CTA) in April asking the company "to show cause why the Commission should not initiate a proceeding to revoke and terminate China Telecom Americas' domestic and international" authorizations to conduct business in the United States. IGP has filed comments in that proceeding opposing this expulsion.By commenting in this proceeding, we want to call attention to the irrationality of this proceeding. It is not only procedurally unfair, it constitutes a turn away from the policy of a global, open internet and open market competition in telecommunications.After the World Trade Organization (WTO) Basic Telecom Agreement of 1997, the FCC determined in its Foreign Participation Order that it served the public interest to adopt rules to open the U.S. market to competition from foreign companies. In that proceeding the Commission wrote:"The Commission found its new 'open entry' standard, in conjunction with enhanced safeguards and WTO Members' commitments, would produce significant consumer benefits through lower prices for existing services and greater service innovation, as well as one-stop shopping resulting from newly-found efficiencies. In addition, the Commission found that the "open entry" standard would better achieve the original goals of the Foreign Carrier Entry Order: (1) to promote effective competition in the U.S. telecommunications services market; (2) to prevent anticompetitive conduct in the provision of international services or facilities; and (3) to encourage foreign governments to open their telecommunications markets."/1Free trade in services, competition, and the WTO Agreement on Basic Telecommunications, according to FCC reports, have resulted in declining international calling prices, increased competition, privatization and liberalization in the rest of the world, and the opening of foreign countries, including China to some extent, to more foreign participation.Trade liberalization was essential in paving the way for the global development of the internet which, despite barriers and censorship within China, continues to support the growth of U.S. information services firms and make independent sources of information available to Chinese citizens who know how to find it.With the proposed withdrawal of China Telecom America's (CTA) section 214 authorizations and International Signaling Point Codes (ISPCs), the Commission is not just taking a step against China, it also risks reversing the economic and social gains of a free and open internet. Its basic argument is that the presence of a foreign telecom service provider in the U.S. constitutes a threat per se, regardless of any behaviors or actions by the provider. This is a line of argument that throws us back to the late 19th century post, telegraph and telephone monopolies. And it fails to recognize that liberalization and integration of the world's two largest economies actually enhances international security by fostering peaceful trade and mutual dependencies.As an organization with substantial expertise in cybersecurity and its relationship to telecommunications, IGP finds the national security rationale advanced for this action to be completely lacking in merit. The FCC "Order to Show Cause" asks CTA to "provid[e] evidence that it is not subject to the exploitation, influence, and control of the Chinese government, and of its ongoing qualifications to hold domestic and international section 214 authorizations and to hold ISPCs, thereby demonstrating that the public convenience and necessity would be served by its retention of the authorizations and assignments."Whoever wrote this needs to be informed about basic logic, namely that it is not possible to prove a negative. If the FCC or the Executive branch believe that CTA has participated in or contributed to Chinese government espionage or sabotage, it should adduce such evidence and ask CTA to dispute or disprove it. Yet no such evidence is provided in the FCC International Bureau documents. This appears to be a retaliatory action motivated by political and military tensions between the U.S. and China, and unrelated to any behavior or risks associated with CTA's presence in the US market; CTA is just a handy target. But it is the wrong target.IGP understands the threat of Chinese government-sponsored cyber espionage and supports strong measures to defend against it and counter it in targeted ways. We have studied numerous cybersecurity incidents attributed to Chinese actors, including the OPM breach, APT40 intrusions on private industry, the Marriott Hotels breach, Gh0stNet, and others. In none of these cases is there any evidence that Chinese cyber-espionage relied on the presence of China Telecom in the US market. Chinese cyber espionage is not conducted by CTA and does not depend in any way on CTA's section 214 authorizations or on its possession of ISPC assignments. The FCC International Bureau Order does not even attempt to provide evidence of such linkages.One FCC Commissioner has claimed that "China Telecom Americas' operations appear to provide opportunities for Chinese state-sponsored actors to disrupt and misroute U.S. communications traffic." However, due to design flaws in the BGP routing protocol, any globally interconnected operator could, accidentally or deliberately, misroute internet traffic. A section 214 authorization or ISPC in the US would not be necessary for that to happen. Carriers can protect against misrouting by adopting certain procedures in the management of their routing. CTA has actually followed industry-led efforts to adopt norms developed by the Internet Society, known as Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security (MANRS), to prevent such problems. According to our investigation, CTA is fully MANRs compliant whereas not a single US-based ISP is.With these actions singling out a telecom provider solely due to its national origin, the US is backpedaling on its WTO commitments and undermining a highly successful trade policy. These actions could trigger a chain reaction, as similar "national security" arguments could be made against the presence of Apple, U.S. telecom companies, or Microsoft in the China or other BRICS countries markets. It should be noted that in the period leading up to the WTO agreement, the Chinese government sought to insulate its domestic telecommunications market from foreign access based on a belief that it would be a "national security threat."/2 Economists and trade policy analysts rejected these arguments as protectionist, and they were right. With these FCC actions, the United States has come full circle, imitating mercantilist policies of the PRC and repudiating successful liberalization efforts that have produced major benefits for consumers and businesses.While those aching for a power struggle with China will no doubt cheer the FCC on, we fail to see how U.S. citizens or businesses benefit from this action. It will not encourage the further opening of China's markets to US providers - indeed it is not framed as a trade measure but is (falsely) presented as a national security measure. It will have no impact on the threat of cyber-espionage by Chinese state actors, which use generally available internet access and software vulnerabilities to facilitate their work. It will encourage a zero-sum game in which nation-states seek to create nationally-bounded internets elsewhere in the world. It is part of a protectionist, paranoid approach that will only heighten diplomatic and political tensions between the US and China, reduce competition and decrease opportunities for growth and innovation.Communism is best combatted through the promotion of competitive, free markets and the free flow of information. This effort moves us in the opposite direction.Footnotes:1/ In the Matter of Rules and Policies on Foreign Participation in the U.S. Telecommunications Market, IB Docket No. 97-142 Sept 19, 2000.2/ M Mueller, Z Tan, China in the information age: Telecommunications and the dilemmas of reform.

CHINA: REPRESSION THREATENS WINTER OLYMPICSStates News ServiceDecember 22, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 735 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:The Chinese government's heightened repression from Xinjiang to Hong Kong threatens its hosting of the 2022 Winter Olympics, Human Rights Watch said today in a letter to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach. The Beijing Winter Olympics are scheduled to begin on February 4, 2022.Human Rights Watch detailed extensive concerns about the human rights climate for hosting the games in China. These include the lack of media and internet freedom, the incarceration of more than a million Turkic Muslims in "political education" camps in Xinjiang, the lack of transparency in labor supply chains, and increasing free speech restrictions in Hong Kong. The IOC should immediately conduct robust human rights due diligence around the preparations for the 2022 Beijing Olympics and explain its efforts to manage human rights risks connected to the Games by February 2021, one year ahead of the games."The Chinese government's intensifying crackdown undermines the basic rights that are essential to hosting the Olympics," said Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch. "By the start of the one-year clock in February, the IOC needs to explain how human rights protections will be met."Earlier in December 2020, the International Olympic Committee published its expert report "Recommendations for an IOC Human Rights Strategy," an important roadmap for adopting human rights across its operations. Human Rights Watch recommended that the IOC should immediately conduct and publish thorough human rights due diligence around the preparations for the 2022 Beijing Olympics and explain how it plans to address the human rights risks connected to the Games by February 2021, one year ahead of the games. Such action would be consistent with the steps set out in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (the "Guiding Principles"), and with the IOC's ongoing work to build a strategic framework on human rights.Human Rights Watch has extensively documented serious human rights abuses in China, and that the human rights environment has deteriorated significantly since the Beijing Olympics in 2008.China's hosting of the 2008 Summer Games spurred multiple human rights abuses, including forced evictions and silencing of civil society activists. No one succeeded in obtaining a permit to protest in zones the government agreed to establish for the games, and at least one person who tried, Ji Sizun, was imprisoned for trying to get a permit. On July 10, 2019, two months after being released from prison, Ji Sizun died under guard in state custody in a hospital in Fujian province. He was 69 and had been ill-treated in detention.The Chinese government under President Xi Jinping who had his term limits removed in 2018, effectively making him president for life has significantly tightened societal controls and the supremacy of the Chinese Communist Party. The government has imposed increased curbs on religion, civil society, the internet, the media and universities; prosecuted numerous activists and journalists on baseless charges; persecuted Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang and other ethnic minorities; and drastically dismantled freedoms in Hong Kong.The Chinese government has further restricted access to most virtual private networks (VPNs), which many journalists and others in China use to circumvent the country's online censorship, known as the "Great Firewall." Detentions in December of the Bloomberg journalist Haze Fan in Beijing and the publisher Jimmy Lai in Hong Kong spotlight the Chinese authorities' lack of compliance with media freedom and human rights requirements that are crucial to hosting the Games, Human Rights Watch said.Chinese authorities used the 2008 Games to justify a significant expansion of the domestic security apparatus and investment and promotion of surveillance technologies such as facial recognition. This enabled greater repression over the next decade, including of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang and other regions."The IOC was silent on the Chinese government's crackdown prompted by the 2008 Summer Olympics," said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. "Adopting new standards requires meaningful action and tough decisions, or else it's just an insult to all those who suffer from Beijing's massive rights violations."Load-Date: December 23, 2020End of Document

ROB'S RUNDOWN: WEEK OF DECEMBER 14 DECEMBER 18, 2020States News ServiceDecember 18, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 8000 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Ohio Senator Rob Portman:December 18, 2020 | Rob's RundownThis week, Senator Portman delivered his 21st floor speech calling for the Senate to pass an emergency COVID-19 relief package. Earlier this week, Portman joined a group of bipartisan senators in announcing two bipartisan packages to provide as much as $908 billion in relief to American students, families, businesses, workers, and health care providers during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Congressional leadership is using most of the legislation for the basis of the final product they will unveil to create a bridge of support between now and when the COVID-19 vaccine is widely available.Portman also issued a statement with Senator Gary Peters (D-MI) and delivered floor remarks regarding the ongoing cyberattacks against our federal agencies, U.S. companies, and some state governments. Portman and Peters have been leaders in the Senate on legislative efforts to strengthen the federal government cyber response. They will lead the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in the new Congress and plan to hold hearings and work on bipartisan comprehensive cybersecurity legislation in the new year.Portman penned an op-ed for The Cincinnati Enquirer , in which he discussed his efforts to secure additional aid for those facing evictions. Portman has long focused on ensuring Ohioans have affordable housing and is currently championing the bipartisan Evictions Crisis Act, which will help to address the national housing crisis that has been made worse by the economic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The bipartisan legislation, which Portman introduced in December 2019, will shed light on the root causes of the eviction crisis, reduce preventable evictions, and limit the devastation to families when eviction is unavoidable. More than 75 national and Ohio based housing, civil rights, and homelessness groups have announced their strong support for the Eviction Crisis Act.On Thursday, Portman touted the distribution of $77 million in federal State Opioid Response (SOR) grants to help local communities combat Ohio's drug crisis. The SOR program, funded through the 21st Century CURES Act, has been used by states to increase access to naloxone and support access to long-term addiction treatment and recovery services. Portman championed the passage of the CURES law and consistently works to increase the federal funding for the SOR program.In addition, Portman highlighted the widespread support among Ohio stakeholders for his bipartisan Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) 2.0 - legislation to increase the funding authorization levels for the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act programs enacted in 2016 and put in place additional policy reforms to help combat the opioid epidemic that has worsened during the coronavirus pandemic .For a more detailed look at Senator Portman's week, please see the following:Monday, December 14, 2020Widespread Support Across Ohio for Portman's Bipartisan CARA 2.0 to Increase Access to Treatment, Prevention and Bolster Fight Against Addiction EpidemicAddiction treatment, recovery, enforcement, and prevention stakeholders across Ohio support Senator Portman's bipartisan Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) 2.0 to increase the funding authorization levels for the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act ( CARA ) programs enacted in 2016 and put in place additional policy reforms to help combat the opioid epidemic that has worsened during the coronavirus pandemic . Portman introduced the legislation yesterday with Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). CARA was a bipartisan, national effort designed to ensure that federal resources were devoted to evidence-based education, treatment and recovery programs that work. In FY 2020, CARA programs were funded at $658 million. CARA 2.0 builds on this effort by increasing the funding authorization levels and laying out new policy reforms to strengthen the federal government's response to this crisis.The addiction treatment, recovery, enforcement, and prevention stakeholders across Ohio have voiced their support for the legislation can be found here.Portman Statement on the Electoral College VotePortman released the following statement on the Electoral College vote:"In accordance with the Constitution and federal law, the Electoral College cast their votes for President today. The Electors met in their respective state following certification of the results. I think we need to respect this process the Founding Fathers established, and we must respect the will of the voters. As I've said previously, the Trump campaign had every right to pursue recounts and legal challenges. That has now happened over the past six weeks, and although there were instances of fraud and irregularities, it has not been shown to be widespread enough to change the result of the election. States must take seriously the proven examples of fraud and irregularities, prosecute anyone who engaged in it, and review voting systems to maintain the integrity of our elections. The transition process and briefings for the Biden team began three weeks ago at the direction of President Trump, and I commend him for that. The orderly transfer of power is a hallmark of our democracy, and although I supported President Trump, the Electoral College vote today makes clear that Joe Biden is now President-Elect."Portman, Bipartisan, Bicameral Members Share Details of Two Bipartisan COVID-19 Emergency Relief BillsSenators Rob Portman, Joe Manchin (D-WV), Susan Collins (R-ME), Mark Warner (D-VA), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Angus King (I-ME), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), and Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chairs Representatives Tom Reed (R-NY) and Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) shared additional details for the two bipartisan, bicameral COVID-19 emergency relief bills.The Bipartisan COVID-19 Emergency Relief Act of 2020, co-sponsored by Senators Portman, Manchin, Collins, Warner, Cassidy, Shaheen, Murkowski, King, Romney, Hassan, and Durbin, would provide as much as $748 billion in relief to American students, families, businesses, workers, and health care providers during this crisis. The Bipartisan State and Local Support and Small Business Protection Act of 2020 , co-sponsored by Senators Portman, Manchin, Collins, Cassidy, Murkowski, and Romney, would provide $160 billion in funding for state and local governments and liability protections for businesses, schools, health care providers, and other organizations. The Problem Solvers Caucus is working on a version in the House."The Senate should not adjourn until we have passed a new COVID-19 package to provide the relief Americans need, and I'm pleased to announce this bipartisan effort with my colleagues. Together, we have crafted two packages, one that will support our health care response to this pandemic and, just as important, provide a bridge of additional aid to bolster our economy until vaccines are widely available and Americans feel safe returning to normal life. The second package is focused on ensuring that state and local governments have the funding they need to provide essential services while protecting businesses, nonprofits, schools, and faith-based organizations from frivolous lawsuits. I hope all of our colleagues will support these bipartisan products," said Senator Portman.Tuesday, December 15, 2020Portman Statement on Former Nationwide Children's Researcher and Chinese Talents Program Member Pleading Guilty for Alleged Theft of Scientific Trade Secrets and Wire FraudPortman issued the following statement after John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, David M. DeVillers, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, and Chris Hoffman, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that a former Nationwide Children's Hospital's Research Institute researcher pleaded guilty to conspiring to steal scientific trade secrets and commit wire fraud while receiving benefits from the Chinese government. The researcher's wife previously pleaded guilty to the same crimes in July 2020.Senator Portman, as Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), led a year-long investigation into China's talent recruitment programs like the Thousand Talents Program, culminating in a bipartisan report in November 2019 that detailed how China has recruited U.S.-based scientists and researchers since the late 1990s and incentivized them to transfer U.S. taxpayer-funded research and IP to China for their own military and economic gain. This case follows the string of arrests of academics affiliated with American universities for alleged crimes related to their participation in China's talent recruitment programs while accepting American taxpayer-funded grant funding. Earlier this year, Portman introduced the bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act to protect American research and IP from global competitors. Both FBI Director Wray and Attorney General Barr, have spoken about the threat to American taxpayer-funded research and intellectual property from foreign governments, particularly China, which would be addressed by this legislation."I'm pleased that our committee investigation and resulting report last year continues to spur action by federal law enforcement to hold China accountable. For too long, China has exploited the lack of transparency in our education system to steal our taxpayer-funded research and innovation. I commend U.S. Attorney DeVillers and the DOJ for their work to stop another alleged member of China's talent programs, adding to the string of arrests that have been announced this year. This case further underscores the need for my bipartisan legislation to safeguard American innovation, hold countries like China accountable for their actions, and ensure our world-class research enterprise is protected here in America. I am encouraged by the actions taken by DOJ and the FBI to stop the exploitation of the openness and transparency of our research enterprise. China's ongoing theft of America's research and innovation must stop."Portman, Heinrich Secure Groundbreaking Advancements for Artificial Intelligence in FY 2021 NDAASenators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Martin Heinrich (D-NM), the co-founders of the Senate Artificial Intelligence Caucus, have secured the most significant advancements for Artificial Intelligence (AI) ever included in a defense policy bill.The FY 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) authorizes versions of four major pieces of legislation championed by Senators Portman and Heinrich that include: Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act (AI-IA), Artificial Intelligence for the Armed Forces Act, National AI Research Resource Task Force Act, Deepfakes Report Act"We cannot take America's AI leadership for granted. Right now, China is engaging in a full court press to unseat the United States' dominance in AI," said Portman. "I'm pleased the FY 2021 NDAA conference report includes the AI-IA, National AI Research Resource Task Force Act, Artificial Intelligence for the Armed Forces Act, and the Deepfakes Report Act which provide groundbreaking advancements in AI in our nation. By coordinating and synchronizing our country's research and development efforts, these bipartisan bills ensure not just that the United States remains an AI leader, but that it does so by developing AI technology that prioritizes American values."Senate-Passed FY 2021 NDAA Conference Report Includes Wins for Ohio, Increases Troop Pay, Supports Ukraine Security AssistancePortman announced that the Senate-passed FY 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) conference report includes a number of initiatives to support Ohio's military installations, increase troop pay, and provide additional assistance to Ukraine. The report now heads to the president's desk to be signed into law. He released the following statement:" I'm proud that the Senate-passed conference report provides needed resources to continue rebuilding our military, support our troops, and provide upgrades and support to Ohio's defense installations . Our country faces significant security threats around the world, and this bipartisan legislation will help ensure that our soldiers, airmen, sailors, Marines and space professionals have the vital resources they need to accomplish their national security missions. Ohio is home to the best and brightest serving our country and some of our nation's premier defense installations , and this legislation provides for their continued success. This conference report also takes additional steps I've fought for to help Ukraine defend themselves against Russian aggression. This security assistance package sends a clear message that America continues to stand with the Ukrainian people in their struggle to secure a democratic, prosperous, and independent future and I hope the president signs it into law soon."Portman Announces $12.7 Million in FEMA Grants to Ohio Health Care Systems to Help Continue to Provide COVID-19 Treatment, Testing and Protective MeasuresPortman applauded the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for announcing two grants totaling $12.7 million to help health care systems in Ohio with costs associated with COVID-19. FEMA awarded these grants from replenished funds accessible thanks to the bipartisan CARES Act , which Senator Portman supported and was signed into law by President Trump."The $12.7 million in FEMA funding announced today is great news for the Ohio State University and Premier Health because it will help them continue to provide the treatment and health care that Ohio desperately needs during this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic," said Portman. "This pandemic has created significant and unprecedented challenges across Ohio and these grants will provide much-needed additional support for these hard-working health care providers. I will continue to work with my bipartisan colleagues in Congress to ensure that Ohio has the necessary resources during these uncertain times."Wednesday, December 16, 2020Portman Applauds Service of Justin Herdman, U.S. Attorney for the Northern DistrictPortman issued the following statement on the service of Justin Herdman as the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio. The Northern District of Ohio consists of the 40 northern counties in Ohio and has offices in Cleveland, Toledo, Akron and Youngstown. Portman praised the confirmation of Justin Herdman for the position of U.S. Attorney in the Northern District of Ohio in 2017."I want to thank U.S. Attorney Justin Herdman for his outstanding service to northern Ohio and the U.S. Department of Justice. I was proud to recommend him for his role as U.S. Attorney and I enjoyed working with him on issues important to Ohio and the country. Under Justin's leadership, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio has led the charge on nationwide efforts to reduce violent crime and the trafficking of dangerous narcotics like fentanyl and synthetic opioids. I have particularly appreciated working with him on addressing the addiction crisis and stopping the theft of our nation's intellectual property by foreign governments like China. Justin has made a real difference in his office and in his community and I wish him all the best in his future endeavors."At Hearing, Portman Questions Witnesses on Election Security and Cybersecurity Threats Facing United StatesAt a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, Portman questioned witnesses about election security and the cybersecurity threats facing the country. Portman has led efforts to address state and local cybersecurity threats and has worked to combat cyberattacks and ensure elections are free, fair, and secure from foreign interference. Last week, Portman announced that the Senate-passed FY 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) conference report included his bipartisan provision to require the Department of Homeland Security to establish a Cybersecurity State Coordinator position in every state. In 2018, Senator Portman's bipartisan Hack Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Act and Public-Private Cybersecurity Cooperation Act were included in a package of bills that were signed into law.In addition, earlier this year, Senators Portman and Gary Peters (D-MI) introduced the bipartisan Risk-Informed Spending for Cybersecurity (RISC) Act to require the federal government to make better investments in cybersecurity protections to keep Americans' data safe. The legislation would require federal agencies to efficiently allocate limited cybersecurity resources to acquire capabilities that address the most pressing cyber threats. In addition, earlier this month, the senators introduced a bipartisan bill that would increase transparency and modernize how the government responds to cybersecurity incidents on federal information systems. Federal System Incident Response Act will update and add critical new sections to FISMA , increasing transparency by clarifying how and when agencies must notify impacted individuals and Congress when data breaches occur. The bill would also require agencies to share information about cybersecurity incidents with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to ensure that attacks against one agency can be compared to other agency incidents.In June 2019, Senator Portman, as Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, released a bipartisan report that found that the vast majority of federal agencies reviewed by the Subcommittee failed to implement effective and comprehensive cybersecurity frameworks. This included the failure to protect sensitive personally identifiable information and an overreliance on outdated legacy systems.Excerpts of the hearing can be found here and a video can be found here.Portman, Brown Applaud House Passage of Bipartisan Legislation to Rename NASA's Plum Brook Station Test Facility After Neil ArmstrongSenators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) applauded the U.S. House of Representatives for passing their bipartisan legislation to rename NASA's Plum Brook Station, the agency's test facility in Sandusky, Ohio, after Neil Armstrong. Portman and Brown introduced the legislation last year and it was passed by the Senate in June. Plum Brook is part of the NASA Glenn Research Center. It houses unique world-class facilities that conduct critical and innovative ground tests for the international aerospace community. The legislation now heads to the president's desk to be signed into law."From his service as a Navy fighter pilot, to his courageous experiments as a test pilot, to his space exploration and first step on the surface of the Moon, Neil Armstrong left an indelible mark in mankind's history of flight. In all his accomplishments, he considered himself first and foremost a test pilot who pushed the boundaries of what was possible in the air and in space," Senator Portman said . "Neil was a humble and patriotic Ohioan who believed the honor of serving his country was a reward in and of itself. That's why, when I asked him the year before he passed away whether he wanted me to pursue naming Plum Brook after him, he demurred. But he was a strong supporter of Plum Brook Station and the important simulations and testing being done there, and I believe it is precisely because of his humility, coupled with his unparalleled accomplishments, that the renaming is appropriate. In consultation with his family and NASA, Senator Brown and I introduced this legislation last year and I applaud the House for passing it today. I urge the president to sign this legislation into law soon as a fitting tribute to Armstrong's amazing accomplishments in air and in space."On CNBC, Portman Discusses Bipartisan Efforts to Pass COVID-19 Relief PackageOn CNBC's Squawk Box , Portman discussed his bipartisan efforts to pass a COVID-19 relief package.

I'm pleased to see that they have been selected for this grant that will help them to complete their Transformation Plan that will ultimately improve and create housing opportunities," said Portman. "Stable housing is a key factor to keeping people out of poverty, and the COVID-19 pandemic has made this issue more important than ever. I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure Ohioans have the resources they need to address this housing and evictions crisis."Portman: $77 Million in Federal Funds Will Help Combat Addiction in OhioPortman praised the announcement today from Governor Mike DeWine, Recovery Ohio Director Alisha Nelson, and Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (OhioMHAS) Director Lori Criss on how the state will distribute $77 million in federal State Opioid Response (SOR) grants to help local communities combat Ohio's drug crisis. As Portman announced in August, Ohio received $96 million in SOR funding and today's grants represent a portion of that funding. The SOR program, funded through the 21st Century CURES Act, has been used by states to increase access to naloxone and support access to long-term addiction treatment and recovery services. Portman championed the passage of the CURES law and consistently works to increase the federal funding for the SOR program.Today's SOR grant announcement comes at a time when many communities are suffering from an increase in addiction, overdoses, and the need for behavioral health services due to the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Portman has repeatedly discussed the impact the ongoing COVID-19 crisis is having on the addiction epidemic and called for a redoubling of efforts to save lives.OhioMHAS will award $58.8 million in grants directly to local county alcohol, drug addiction and mental health services boards and their community partners. OhioMHAS will make the remaining funding available for organizations utilizing innovative approaches for connecting people to care."State Opioid Response funds are vital for Ohio's continued efforts to combat the addiction epidemic, and I'm pleased to have led efforts to create this federal funding stream through the CURES legislation and to help secure this funding for Ohio," said Portman. " The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges and we are now seeing a heartbreaking surge in overdose deaths. That's why I'm glad this federal funding will make a difference and continue to help save lives throughout Ohio. I will continue to work with my colleagues and Governor DeWine to ensure that our local communities and addiction providers have the resources they need to continue to combat this epidemic."On Former U.S. Trade Representatives Panel, Portman Highlights Importance of Renewing Trade Promotion Authority, Proposes 'Supercharging' American CompetitivenessPortman participated in a Center for Strategic and International Studies virtual event entitled "A Conversation with Former USTRs," and highlighted the importance of renewing the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). He also proposed using TPA, or a similar opportunity, to invest in American workers with new anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws, as well as in American manufacturing and high technology, like artificial intelligence, all in an effort to keep the United States competitive with respect to China. Portman, who was the U.S. Trade Representative during the George W. Bush administration, has been a leading voice in the Senate on U.S. trade policy and serves on the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over trade issues.In addition, Senator Portman discussed his support for President-Elect Biden's nomination of Katherine Tai to be the next U.S. Trade Representative.Excerpts of the event can be found here and a video of Senator Portman's remarks can be found here and here.On Senate Floor, Portman Calls on Senate to Pass Critical Legislation to Respond to Challenges of COVID-19On the Senate floor, Portman gave his 21st speech since March calling on Congress to pass legislation to respond to the health care and economic crises caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Representatives Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) and Garret Graves (R-LA) led the legislation in the House. In 2014, Senator Portman's and Rep. Kennedy's bipartisan Peace Corps Commemorative Act was signed into law to create a commemorative in Washington, D.C.'s National Capital Area to celebrate the mission of the Peace Corps and the ideals on which the Peace Corps was founded. This bipartisan legislation designated the Peace Corps Commemorative Foundation as the lead nonfederal sponsor for the project, and prohibits the use of federal funding. The current authorization for the project is set to expire in January 2021. This legislation would extend the authorization for the project for an additional seven years, to January 2028, in order for the project to secure the necessary design approvals and raise the funding for construction. The legislation now awaits action in the Senate."For more than 50 years, the Peace Corps has served as a powerful vehicle for volunteers who wish to use their talents to carry America's humanitarian values to other parts of the world ," said Portman. "By reauthorizing this project, we can ensure the Peace Corps Commemorative Foundation can finish this important project and honor those Americans who have donated their time and talent to serving others.

Earlier this week, the Senators and the Problem Solvers Caucus announced two bipartisan packages, one of which, the bipartisan COVID-19 Emergency Relief Act of 2020 , is serving as the framework for the final COVID-19 relief package."This pandemic has been devastating for millions of Americans and without Congressional action they will lose the lifelines that are keeping them afloat. We appreciate the ongoing efforts of Leader McConnell, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer and Leader McCarthy to craft an emergency COVID-19 relief package that will help the American people weather the next few months of this pandemic. We know first-hand how hard it can be to find common ground on some of these issues. We encourage the leaders and their staff to continue this important work. By working together, we can and we will deliver immediate assistance to the workers, the families, and the businesses that need it most."Portman, Peters Statement on Widespread Cyberattacks, Plan Hearings and Legislation in Early 2021Senators Rob Portman and Gary Peters (D-MI) issued the following statement on the ongoing cyberattacks against our federal agencies, U.S. companies, and some state governments. Portman and Peters have been leaders in the Senate on legislative efforts to strengthen the federal government cyber response. They will lead the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in the new Congress and plan to hold hearings and work on bipartisan comprehensive cybersecurity legislation in the new year."The recently discovered and ongoing cyberattacks cannot be tolerated and demonstrate the weakness of our cyber defenses and capacity to respond. These attacks were highly complex and they must be unraveled to know the full extent of the exposure to federal and state agencies and the private sector. The immediate effort must be to stop the immediate threat and ensure our systems are secure. We will in the future need to understand the full scope and impact to ensure that we know what damage has been done and to better prepare to respond next time. These types of sophisticated attacks are going to continue and we must work across the federal government, as well as with our private sector and state and local partners, to learn from this and strengthen our cyber defenses moving forward."In June 2019, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released a bipartisan report that extensively documented the cybersecurity vulnerabilities and weaknesses in many of our federal agencies, including the Departments of State and Homeland Security. Next Congress, through the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, we intend to work together to understand the origin, scope, and severity of this breach, and plan to work on bipartisan comprehensive legislation to improve our cyber defenses to ensure this doesn't happen again."Portman, Warner, Blumenthal, Grassley Urge U.S. Trade Rep to Not Include Tech Liability Shield in US-UK Trade AgreementSenators Rob Portman, Mark R. Warner (D-VA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Charles E. Grassley (R-IA) sent a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Robert Lighthizer urging the Trump Administration to refrain from including sweeping liability protection language modeled on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 in a trade agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom."We are optimistic that a new trade agreement with the United Kingdom will ensure fair, balanced, and reciprocal trade. But we want to note that we have concerns with the inclusion of safe harbor language modeled on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 ," wrote the Senators . "Including a safe harbor clause in any future trade agreements will further allocate more power to companies at the expense of individuals."They continued , " Congress can and should debate about Section 230 and how it has enabled platforms to turn a blind eye as their platforms are used to facilitate discrimination, cyber-stalking, terrorism, online frauds, and more. We urge USTR to refrain from including this provision in this and future free trade agreements until that debate has concluded."A copy of the letter is available here.On Senate Floor, Portman Condemns Widespread Cyberattacks, Calls for Bipartisan Efforts to Bolster CybersecurityPortman strongly spoke out against the ongoing cyberattacks on our federal agencies, U.S. companies, and some state governments on the Senate floor. Earlier today, Portman, who will serve as the top Republican on Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in the new Congress, condemned the cyberattacks and announced plans to hold hearings and work on bipartisan comprehensive cybersecurity legislation in the new year.Portman noted that these attacks demonstrate the vulnerabilities of our cyber defenses and the need for bipartisan action in Congress to do more to equip the federal government to defend against and deter future cyberattacks. He highlighted the bipartisan report he issued last year as Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations warning of vulnerabilities at federal agencies to cyberattacks. Portman also spoke about his leadership in legislative efforts to strengthen the federal government cyber response.A transcript of his remarks can be found here and a video can be found here.Portman, Bipartisan, Bicameral Group: Finish What We StartedSenators Rob Portman (R-OH), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Susan Collins (R-ME), Mark Warner (D-VA), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Angus King (I-ME), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), and Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chairs Representatives Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ-5) and Tom Reed (R-NY-23) called on Congress to deliver immediate COVID-19 relief to the American people. Earlier this week, the Senators and the Problem Solvers Caucus announced two bipartisan packages, one of which, the bipartisan COVID-19 Emergency Relief Act of 2020 , is serving as the framework for the final COVID-19 relief package."Today we find ourselves in the middle of a global pandemic that has taken the lives of more than 310,000 Americans, and hours away from a government shutdown that threatens to delay urgent aid to people in need throughout the nation. We must set our differences aside. The American people elected us to govern on their behalf, and at a time when they need us more than ever we must end the partisan games and meet this moment together for the good of the country. On Monday, our bipartisan, bicameral group presented a bill that helps provide for the emergency needs of the millions of families struggling to make ends meet. Once again, we encourage the leaders to finish what we started and deliver immediate assistance to the workers, families and businesses that need it most."On Senate Floor, Portman Urges Colleagues to Pass Short-Term Funding Measure and End Government Shutdowns for GoodOn the Senate floor, hours before the government will shut down if a temporary funding measure isn't passed, Portman discussed the unnecessary costs of government shutdowns and highlighted his End Government Shutdowns Act, which would permanently prevent the federal government from shutting down, ensure that essential government services aren't disrupted, and protect taxpayers from resulting deficits. The measure would create an automatic continuing resolution (CR) in the event of a lapse of appropriations, and incentivize Congress to pass full-year appropriations bills through gradually reducing spending after 120 days .Last year, Portman released the findings of a nine-month investigation by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which he chairs, detailing the real-world costs of the last three government shutdowns. Alongside Ranking Member Tom Carper (D-DE), Portman found that the combined 54 days of partial or full government closures since FY 2014 resulted in at least $4 billion in costs for taxpayers and 56,938 years of missed work by furloughed federal workers.Transcript of his remarks can be found below and a video can be found here .SOCIAL MEDIAPortman: Help is on the way to combat opioid crisisThe refrain I hear across Ohio about the opioid epidemic is clear: People are desperate for hope, and they want solutions.We've made progress recently, and we have much more to do. But I'm proud that Congress took another important step to make the federal government a better partner through new legislation the president just signed into law.The most urgent crisis we face in Ohio is the rise of fentanyl a synthetic opioid 50 times more potent than heroin. Fentanyl overdose deaths in Ohio have increased by nearly 4,000 percent since 2013, and last year fentanyl was responsible for more than 70 percent of Ohio overdose deaths.Newtown Police Chief Tom Synan, co-chair of the Hamilton County Heroin Coalition, told me at a recent meeting that fentanyl continues to be the top killer in Greater Cincinnati and other drugs like cocaine, heroin and meth are being laced with it.In August 2016, Cincinnati experienced 174 overdoses over six days. That spike was caused by a fentanyl analogue called carfentanil. It drew national attention to this crisis and highlighted the need to act.Just days after we learned this spike was caused by synthetic opioids, I introduced bipartisan legislation to combat the rise of these drugs.Based on an 18-month investigation by a congressional subcommittee I chair, we know that fentanyl is mostly shipped into our communities from China through our U.S. Postal Service. Our legislation addressed that.The legislation the STOP Act was included in the new opioid law the president signed last week and closes the loophole in our international mail screening that drug traffickers have exploited. It requires the Postal Service to receive electronic advance data on packages entering the U.S., something private carriers are already required to do.This information allows law enforcement to identify suspicious packages, test them and seize fentanyl.I've seen this process in person, including at the DHL distribution center at the Greater Cincinnati airport, where I met with Customs and Border Protection officers who told me how badly they need this information to keep fentanyl out.Now that it is law, the STOP Act will act as a tourniquet, stemming the flow of fentanyl into Ohio and allowing prevention, treatment, and recovery programs to take hold.The new opioid law also expands access to treatment. When someone is ready to get over their addiction, treatment centers have to be ready to accept them. I've talked with too many families who have lost loved ones from overdoses after they were turned away from a treatment center because there wasn't enough space.A decades-old policy restricts those with Medicaid from seeking care in facilities with more than 16 beds. The new law includes bipartisan legislation I authored to lift this arbitrary restriction.We want to help more people with the disease of addiction get treatment, and this initiative will do that. It will also ensure that all forms of substance abuse are covered and that treatment centers offer multiple forms of medication-assisted treatment to help people get treatment that is right for them.The new opioid law also helps protect pregnant and postpartum moms affected by addiction as well as babies born dependent on drugs. These innocent babies have to be taken through the process of withdrawal as infants and the long-term health effects are uncertain.Earlier this year, I introduced CARA 2.0 to build on the successes of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA), my bipartisan legislation that became law in 2016. A number of provisions from CARA 2.0 are in this new law, including $60 million for a plan of safe care for babies born dependent on drugs.This is welcomed news for Cincinnati organizations like First Step Home, which provides support for expecting mothers, and Cincinnati Children's Hospital, which has an innovative program to help babies born dependent on drugs.The law also includes the CRIB Act, a bipartisan bill I co-authored that will help newborns recover from addiction in the best care setting possible and provide support for their families.I've seen the love and care babies receive through these impressive recovery programs, like Brigid's Path in Dayton. This new law will assist that great program and support more like it.Despite overdose deaths rising to new highs last year, there are some encouraging signs. In Cincinnati, more Narcan is being distributed to save lives, medication-assisted treatment is being expanded at places like Center for Addiction Treatment and Talbert House to help more people get into effective treatment to overcome their addiction. Mercy Health in Cincinnati is partnering with treatment centers to bridge the transition from immediate medical assistance and detox to longer-term treatment and wellness.Through the commitment I have seen at the local level and this new law's renewed partnership from the federal level, I believe we can turn the corner and take back our communities from the grips of addiction.Election 'Political Poison' Needs Bipartisan Fix, Portman SaysA bipartisan commission might be the solution to removing the "partisan poison" from debate over the 2020 election, the next top Republican on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee said"Pulling this out of politics a little bit and having a bipartisan group that is more independent look at the issue is a good idea," Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said during a sometimes tense panel hearing Wednesday.The hearing, "Examining Irregularities in the 2020 Election," included at least one exchange between the current ranking member, Gary Peters (D-Mich.), and outgoing Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). Each senator accused the other of spreading disinformation or lies.The bitter exchange and the hearing come as President Donald Trump refuses to accept the outcome of the 2020 election, which the electoral college this week certified he lost to president-election Joe Biden, and continues to lean on claims of widespread election fraud that his own attorney general and the Department of Homeland Security have found to be untrue.Portman, who will either be chairman or ranking member of the committee next Congress depending on the outcome of two Georgia Senate runoffs Jan. 5, is discussing with at least one Democratic colleague creating such a commission, he said. His remarks and proposal to extract the dispute from the committee's purview suggest how he'd prefer to see the committee operate.Portman proposed something similar to the 2005 Commission on Federal Election Reform, co-chaired by former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James A. Baker III. Baker was a consigliere to George W. Bush, who won the presidency over then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 after the U.S. Supreme Court halted a recount in Florida.Ken Starr, the former independent counsel in the investigation that led to President Bill Clinton's impeachment, lauded the idea of a new commission akin to Carter-Baker during the hearing Wednesday."In light of the acrimony and the division with respect to the 2000 election, bringing together Jimmy Carter and former secretary Baker was, I think, very efficacious. They made thoughtful recommendations. But they bring attention and shed light on what the issues are," he said.However, the Brennan Center for Justice panned much of the report at the time, saying its study was only of a "cursory nature" after two hearings and no public comment opportunities."Although a number of its recommendations could improve our electoral system, several of its suggestions would be damaging and should not be included in any proposal for election reform," the report said. One of the biggest issues voting rights advocates took with the report at the time were recommendations on voter ID, a sore point to this day.Portman wants to establish the 2020 look-back commission quickly so it would be able to offer best practices to states before the next midterm elections, he said.Load-Date: December 19, 2020End of Document

Trump administration charges China-based Zoom executive over disrupting video calls held to commemorate Tiananmen Square crackdownBusiness Insider USDecember 19, 2020 Saturday 12:32 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 471 wordsByline: insider@insider.com,  (Reuters)Body• The Department of Justice on Friday filed charges against Zoom executive Xinjiang Jin, accusing the software engineer of using the company's systems to censor speech.• The DOJ alleged in a complaint that Jin, Zoom's primary liaison with Chinese law enforcement, terminated calls held by users commemorating Beijing's 1989 crackdown on student protesters in Tiananmen Square.• According to the complaint, Jin fabricated terms of service violations, while his accomplices created fake accounts under protesters' names to discredit them.• Zoom said in a blog post that it has fired Jin and placed other employees on leave, and that it is cooperating with law enforcement.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.US prosecutors on Friday charged a former China-based executive at Zoom with disrupting video meetings commemorating the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown at the request of the Chinese government.Xinjiang Jin, 39, faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of conspiring since January 2019 to use his company's systems to censor speech, the US Department of Justice said.In a complaint filed in Brooklyn federal court, prosecutors said the software engineer, Zoom's main liaison with Chinese law enforcement and intelligence, helped terminate at least four video meetings in May and June, including some involving dissidents who survived the June 4, 1989, student protests.Jin allegedly fabricated violations of Zoom's terms of service to justify his actions to his superiors.Prosecutors also said his accomplices created fake email accounts and Zoom accounts, including in dissidents' names, to suggest meeting hosts and participants supported terrorism, violence, and child pornography.In a blog post, Zoom said it fired Jin for violating the San Jose, California-based company's policies, and has placed other employees on leave. It also said there was no indication that enterprise data was shared with China's government.Zoom said it is cooperating with subpoenas from federal prosecutors in Brooklyn and northern California regarding its dealings with China's government, and with a separate U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoena.Jin is not in US custody, and a lawyer for him could not be located.The complaint cited many communications by Jin, including whether an account hosting a meeting with a dissident he called "a lead of such illegal political activities" could be suspended for 24 hours "to prevent subsequent huge influence on us?"Jin's actions helped Chinese authorities "censor and punish U.S. users' core political speech merely for exercising their rights to free expression," Acting US Attorney Seth DuCharme in Brooklyn said in a statement.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien, Jonathan Oatis and Tom Brown)Read the original article on Load-Date: December 18, 2020End of Document

UYGHUR CONVICTED OF TERRORISM IN INDONESIA PLEADS FOR ASYLUM AFTER COMRADES DEPORTED TO CHINAStates News ServiceNovember 24, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1826 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:One of four young Uyghur men convicted in 2015 of terror-related offenses in Indonesia has pled for help from members of his ethnic group and the international community after the other three were forcibly deported to China, saying he fears persecution by authorities if he is returned home.Ahmet Bozoghlan and three othersAhmet Mahmud, Altinci Bayram, and Abdul Basit Tuzerwere sentenced to between six and eight years in prison and fined 100 million rupiah (U.S. $6,800) by a Jakarta court after being found guilty of entering the country by using fake passports and for attempting to join the Islamic State-affiliated Eastern Indonesia Mujahideen (MIT) militant group.Last month, two counter-terrorism experts told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service, that Beijing paid the fines of Mahmud, Bayram, and Tuzerwhose six-year sentences, including time in detention, were completeand repatriated them to China. Authorities in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) are believed to have held up to 1.8 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in a vast network of internment camps since early 2017.Neither the Chinese nor Indonesian government have made any formal statements about the young men, although Uyghur activists told RFA that late last week, Indonesia's Ambassador to Turkey, Lalu Muhammed Iqbal, confirmed their deportation to China. He gave the confirmation during a meeting with the Uyghur activists, according to delegation leader Nurettin Izbasar.When contacted by BenarNews about the deportation, Iqbal responded only that "the government of Indonesia makes decisions in accordance with national laws and taking into account national security interests."RFA's Uyghur Service recently spoke by telephone with Bozoghlan, who is serving out the remaining two years of his sentence and said he fears that he will be sent home next."My friends' six-year sentences were up, but they were going to have to stay an extra six months as a fine for problems with their passports," he said."China paid the six months of fees and then sent the three of them back home."Bozoghlan said that the three had been forced to sign documents by Indonesian authorities acknowledging that their fines had been paid and that, later, they overheard the head of their prison telling guards that the Chinese embassy had footed the bill and "planned to take them to China."When asked whether any independent observers were present while the documents were signed, Bozoghlan said his friends told him the authorities "didn't want any of the 'trouble' that lawyers or journalists would cause.""They said it would be a lot of trouble if anyone were to find out," he said of the authorities.Last month, the counter-terrorism experts told BenarNews Indonesia carried out the deportation of the men in secret because many in the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation are critical of China's treatment of the Uyghurs.When asked by BenarNews whether Chinese officials had pressured Indonesia during the investigation and prosecution of the four Uyghurs, an Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman declined to comment.Seeking passage to TurkeyIn addition to its nearly four-year campaign of extralegal mass incarceration in the XUAR, the Chinese government has subjected those not detained to intense surveillance, religious restrictions, and forced sterilizations, according to a report published in June by the Council on Foreign Relations, a U.S.-based think-tank.Chinese officials have repeatedly denied these allegations, saying the camps are centers for vocational training and that the thousands of Uyghur Muslims arrested had links to extremism. However, reporting by RFA's Uyghur Service and other media outlets shows that detainees are mostly held against their will in cramped and unsanitary conditions, where they are forced to endure inhumane treatment and political indoctrination.According to Bozoghlan, he met the other three men in Malaysia, where the four of them had been trying for several months to make their way to Turkeya nation whose citizens share cultural similarities with the Uyghurs, and which has an estimated population of some 60,000 Uyghurs in exile. Travel to Turkey for Uyghurs in China is prohibited by authorities due to the perceived threat of religious extremism."We ended up having some financial problems," he said."There were also a lot of people [trying to take the same route as us]. For those reasons, we thought and thought about it, and we decided to try going to Indonesia in the hope we might find an easier route [to Turkey] from there."Instead, he said, the group fell in with MIT after members of the militant group offered to help them get to Turkey and arranged to provide them with fake passports in exchange for money."Then at one point [drivers for MIT] were detained" at a roadblock in connection with drug trafficking as they took the Uyghurs to a safehouse where they planned to wait until they could travel to Turkey, he said. At a court hearing, the drivers testified that the trio "were planning to join a terrorist group," Bozoghlan said, adding that he believes "the Indonesian police officers who interrogated the drivers forced them to say this because China was putting so much pressure on them.""[The police] connected us to them in interrogations, and they came to the conclusion that we had a 'relationship.' But there was absolutely nothing we had done connected to terrorism or to hurting other people. We'd only come to Indonesia, and in the process of trying to get to Turkey we met [the group]."Bozoghlan said he and his three comrades "didn't know anything" about MIT and couldn't effectively communicate with them because they didn't speak Indonesian or English."We took a risk on them, and our only aim was asking for their help in getting to Turkey," he said. "We trusted them and went wherever they asked us to."'Asking for help'After being detained in September 2014, Bozoghlan said that Chinese authoritiesincluding Uyghur policemen and embassy officialsshowed up on multiple occasions and accused them of being "black coats," or terrorists.Later, Indonesian authorities subjected the four men to torture, he said, in a bid to get them to sign documents confessing to being involved in terrorism."The police took us somewhere where there were no other people and put black hoods over our heads and tortured us brutally. They obstructed our breathing, squeezed parts of our bodies, tortured us brutally," he said.He said that the four of them never confessed during interrogations or in court, but that they signed a document "that neither we nor our translators fully understood, because we don't know Indonesian.""We asked [the translators] to explain to us what we were signing, and they explained a bit of it to us in what little English we could understand, but we didn't knowingly sign or confess to the charges that we were connected to a terrorist incident," he said.Additionally, Bozoghlan told RFA that he and his compatriots were assigned a lawyer by the Indonesian government who they were unable to speak with privately, due to the language barrier, and suggested that the lawyer was unable to represent them effectively.In the end, Bozoghlan was sentenced to eight years in prison, while the other three were handed six-year terms."I don't even know what 'black coat' means," he said."I'm just someone who ended up getting detained in Indonesia while looking for a way to get to Turkey, and so I'm asking for help to go to Turkey or Europe or another place to seek asylum so that I am not returned to China."Ahmad Nursaleh, a spokesman for Indonesia's immigration department, told BenarNews he did not know what will happen to Bozoghlan after his sentence is complete.Allegations of tortureAsludin Hatjani, the government-appointed lawyer who represented the four Uyghurs, told BenarNews that he was unaware of whether the three Uyghurs had been deported to China because "after they were released, they have had nothing to do with me."But he said that since the identification documents they produced during their trial "showed they were Turkish citizens," they should have been deported to Turkeysomething he said "was acknowledged by Indonesia."Hatjani confirmed to BenarNews that Bozoghlan's sentence had been increased to eight years in prison from six by the country's High Court.He said that while representing the four Uyghurs, they had never made allegations of torture by authorities."There were no complaints and there were no visible signs of violence on their bodies," he said.When asked about the allegations, Indonesian National Police spokesman Awi Setiono told BenarNews he had "no information" and referred further questions to officers assigned to the case.According to Sidney Jones, an expert on Islamic militancy in Indonesia and the director of the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC), Bozoghlan is one of two remaining Uyghurs in Indonesia, the other being Nur Mahmet Abdullah, who he said had been imprisoned on Batam island. Abdullah was sentenced to six years in prison in November 2016 for planning to carry out a suicide bombing targeting Shia Muslims.Jones said that Bozoghlan's sentence had been extended on an appeal by the prosecutor in his trial. In the High Court rulinga copy of which was obtained by BenarNewsBozoghlan is listed as the "leader" of the group and a "Turkish national.""He had an authentic passport. He is from Turkey but is of Uyghur descent," Jones told BenarNews. "If he was to be deported, it would of course not be to China, but to Turkey, because his passport was valid."'The same as killing them'The forced repatriation of three of the Uyghurs comes four years after Indonesia turned down a request from the Chinese government to exchange a fugitive Indonesian banker captured in China for all four of them.Indonesia told China that a prisoner swap wasn't possible because the charges against the four Uyghurs were different from those against the Indonesia banker.Back then, an Indonesian official who requested anonymity said Indonesia would face international pressure if the country agreed to deport the Uyghur prisoners to China."Giving Uyghurs back to China is the same as killing them. Most probably, the Chinese government will execute them instantly," the official told BenarNews in April 2019.The Indonesian government has faced criticism at home and abroad for its silence on the alleged mistreatment of Uyghurs in XUAR.Last December, thousands of people took to the streets in Indonesia and Malaysia to protest China's treatment of the Muslim minority community.Reported by Shohret Hoshur for RFA's Uyghur Service, with additional reporting by Ahmad Syamsudin and Ronna Nirmala for BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service .

REPORT: China Collected Data While US Intelligence Fell BehindThe Daily CallerDecember 31, 2020 Thursday 07:55 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: WORLDLength: 987 wordsByline: Jordan Lancaster, Reporter, jordanlancaster70@gmail.comBodyLink to ImageWhen Chinese Communist Party Secretary Xi Jinping got ready to begin his presidency in 2013, United States intelligence services began struggling to piece together what was going on in China, according to a Dec. 22 report from Foreign Policy. Meanwhile, Chinese intelligence grew more powerful as they collected data from individuals in the United States.A former U.S. national security official told Foreign Policy that “things weren't the same” after the Chinese were able to identify undercover U.S. intelligence officials through the Office of Personnel and Management (OPM) hack and after the CIA's network of Chinese assets was destroyed.According to the 2018 book The Perfect Weapon, written by David Sanger, “dozens of postings” for CIA postings in China were canceled, Foreign Policy reported. Because the data breaches took a toll on the CIA's confidence, the organization “was not willing to do forward facing ops in China,” a former senior intelligence analyst said. (RELATED: Report: Trump Was Briefed On Unconfirmed Intelligence That China Is Paying Bounties To Target US Troops In Afghanistan)After WikiLeaks published U.S. diplomatic cables in 2010 and 2011, U.S. officials found it more difficult to communicate with Chinese sources. A current State Department official with extensive experience in China told Foreign Policy that “Chinese officials became much more reluctant to talk after [the WikiLeaks cables], because they didn't believe we could keep it a secret.”Between 2012 and 2014, China also increased its defenses against U.S. spying, making intelligence collection even more difficult, according to the report. As Xi Jinping began cracking down on government officials and army officers, Chinese sources became increasingly reluctant to talk on many channels, instead insisting on face-to-face meetings.Meanwhile, China stole unprecedented amounts of data through a hacking spree while the U.S. struggled to gain insight into what was going on in the country.Hospitality company Marriott was the target of a massive 2014 hacking operation by Chinese intelligence, who managed to steal passport and credit card data from over 383 million people, Foreign Policy reported. Over 78 million people had their personal information stolen after Chinese intelligence breached health insurance provider Anthem. American Airlines, United Airlines, and travel reservation provider Sabre all had their networks breached by China's travel intelligence program, and the country was able to obtain information about 100,000 naval personnel by hacking into U.S. Navy computer systems.A former senior National Security Agency official told the magazine that the Chinese “were always a Hoover, sucking up mountains of data beyond anything else in the world.” (RELATED: REPORT: WHO Expected To Lead Team Investigating Chinese Origins Of Coronavirus)The Obama administration began to take action against Chinese cyberspying, including the first public indictment of nation-state hackers in 2014 when five Chinese military hackers were charged for targeting U.S. companies with an espionage campaign. At the same time, the administration began emphasizing cooperation between the two nations and extended visas from one year to 10 years for business and tourism and five years for students.Link to ImageUS President Barack Obama (R) listens as Chinese President Xi Jinping answers a question following their bilateral meeting at the Annenberg Retreat at Sunnylands in Rancho Mirage, California, on June 7, 2013. (Photo by Jewel Samad/AFP via Getty Images)“Obama was hellbent on getting some negotiated pact,” a current senior U.S. intelligence official said of the visa extensions, according to Foreign Policy. “And the administration, as much as we argued with it, didn't see the big deal. They saw it as a promulgation for trade and academia-all things that are true, but the entire [intelligence community] and FBI said, 'Whoa whoa whoa, they're going to increase their already excessive nontraditional collection activities.'”In September of 2015, Obama and Jinping announced a bilateral agreement which prohibited either country from obtaining trade secrets through hacking and set up a system where China or the U.S. could voice complaints about violations. U.S. intelligence agencies pushed back on the deal, arguing that China simply wouldn't follow the rules because there was no penalty for non-compliance. The criticisms turned out to be warranted - by 2018 U.S. officials were publicly stating that China was violating the agreement, Foreign Policy reported.Intelligence officials also expressed concerns about the deal because the U.S. engages in hacking. “At one level it's how the game is played,” Michael Daniel, the Obama administration's cybersecurity leader, told Foreign Policy. “It's called espionage.”U.S. officials were seeking to gain more knowledge about the Chinese government. The information that they had was limited in the mid-2010s, according to Foreign Policy. By the end of the Obama administration, intelligence officials had been told to prioritize evaluating counterintelligence threats from the Chinese due to the growing consensus that China had become a bigger threat than Russia.If the Chinese decided to weaponize the data that they've collected over several years, “it has far-reaching consequences,” a former senior National Security Council official told the magazine. China “could be far more damaging than what Russians have done,” the official said. “Because they have vastly larger quantities of data than Russia does.”The intensified focus on China towards the end of the Obama administration helped achieve greater knowledge into the relationship between Chinese companies and Chinese intelligence agencies, Foreign Policy reported. Once President Donald Trump took office, intelligence officials were able to focus on understanding this relationship.Graphic In this file photo taken on August 04, 2020, Prince, a member of the hacking group Red Hacker Alliance who refused to give his real name, uses a website that monitors global cyberattacks on his computer at their office in Dongguan, China's southern Guangdong province. - As the number of online devices surges and super-fast 5G connections roll out, record numbers of companies are offering up to seven-figure rewards to ethical hackers who can successfully attack their cybersecurity systems.

US blacklists Chinese triad boss 'Broken Tooth' in latest round of anti-corruption sanctionsCNN WireDecember 10, 2020 Thursday 5:53 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 866 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN) BodyHONG KONG (CNN) --  The United States government has placed sanctions on Wan Kuok-koi, a notorious gangster and triad boss known as "Broken Tooth." Wan is known as a leader of the 14K Triad, which the US Treasury described as "one of the largest Chinese organized criminal organizations in the world," engaging in "drug trafficking, illegal gambling, racketeering, human trafficking, and a range of other criminal activities." Under the sanctions, any assets held by Wan in the US will be frozen and American citizens are forbidden from doing business with him. Born in the Portuguese colony of Macao, Wan rose through the ranks of the triad to become one of the territory's most powerful crime bosses, waging a bloody war against rival gangs, with bombings, shootings and stabbings a regular occurrence. He was jailed in November 1999 on a host of charges, shortly before the colony was handed over to China. Upon his release in 2012, Wan, who had always maintained his innocence, sought to reinvent himself -- at least publicly -- as a legitimate businessman, reportedly backing ventures in Cambodia and Palau. According to the US Treasury, he also gained membership of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), an advisory body to the ruling Communist Party. In 2018, the Treasury statement said, Wan established the headquarters of the World Hongmen History and Culture Association in Cambodia. Also known as Tiandihui, or the Heaven and Earth Society, the Hongmen is a fraternal organization dating to the mid-1600s, with footholds around the world. In Hong Kong and Macao, it has been closely linked to triad activity, and the US sanctions accuse the 14K of "utilizing Broken Tooth's World Hongmen History and Culture Association as an effort to legitimize itself." "The World Hongmen History and Culture Association has managed to co-opt elite figures in Malaysia and Cambodia. This continues a pattern of overseas Chinese actors trying to paper over illegal criminal activities by framing their actions in terms of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the China Dream, or other major initiatives of the CCP," the Treasury statement said using the acronym for the Chinese Communist Party."The World Hongmen History and Culture Association is spreading across Southeast Asia, establishing a powerful business network involved in the development and launching of crypto currencies, real estate, and most recently a security company specialized in protecting BRI investments," the statement added.CNN could not reach the association for comment on the Treasury accusations. Wan could also not be reached. The sanctions against Wan are part of a wider effort against worldwide corruption, as part of International Anti-Corruption Day. On Wednesday, the US also designated a Liberian lawmaker and one Kyrgyz individual under Executive Order 13818, which targets corruption and serious human rights abuse.Belt and road's alleged crime links The activity ascribed to Wan by the Treasury statement, particularly in Cambodia, resembles that of another alleged Chinese crime boss, Zhao Wei. This week, CNN reported that Zhao -- one of the world's most notorious narcotics traffickers -- was closely linked to a casino development project in Laos, apparently with the imprimatur of the local government. Both Cambodia and Laos are members of the Belt and Road Initiative, a vast trade and infrastructure project that is the signature project of Chinese President Xi Jinping. First announced in 2013, the project promises to build ports, roads and railways to create new trade corridors linking China to Asia, Africa and Europe, with tens of billions of dollars in investments and loans. The project has been dogged by criticism, particularly from Western countries, that have accused China of saddling developing countries with debts that they cannot afford to repay. According to the US Treasury, the BRI also has links to organized crime. "Chinese enterprises behind the BRI projects have several things in common: their leadership has links to criminal networks or actors involved in illicit activities in other parts of Southeast Asia, as well as China; they have pre-existing organizations engaged in casinos and crypto currencies; they advertise themselves online to be associated with Beijing's BRI and flaunt connections with key Chinese government agencies; and all of them have established associations that actively seek to assist Chinese nationals," the statement said. CNN has reached out to the Chinese government for comment on the Treasury's assertions regarding BRI projects.As well as blacklisting Wan personally and the World Hongmen History and Culture Association, the US also sanctioned the Palau China Hung-Mun Cultural Association and the Hong Kong-based Dongmei Group, both of which it said were "owned or controlled" by Wan. Dongmei, which could not be reached for comment, is a key investor in the Saixigang Industrial Zone Project, the Treasury statement said, a development linked to armed rebel groups in eastern Myanmar. CNN's Joshua Berlinger contributed reporting.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

China.- Human Rights Watch urges China to release detained journalistsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 26, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 353 wordsBody    MADRID, 26 (EUROPA PRESS)   Human Rights Watch (HRW) has urged China's authorities to end the "arbitrary detentions" of journalists and activists by making independent coverage and to release those it has arrested.   The organization has noted that since the beginning of December this year, the arrests of journalists have intensified, after China had expelled 12 foreign correspondents before.   Among the cases mentioned are that of activist Ou Biaofeng, arrested in Hunán, based on article 23 of the Chinese penal code: "seeking fights and causing conflict", a crime for which he could have a sentence of up to 5 years in prison. Ou had given voice to Chinese government detractors.   Another case cited is that of Bloomberg Haze Fan journalist who was arrested on December 7 for "endangering national security," while on the 16th the same thing happened to Du Bin, a journalist who had worked as a contributing photographer with 'The New York Times' and who according to his friends worked on a government-critical book.   "The Chinese government does not appear to have learned anything from its information blockade following the outbreak of COVID-19," HRW Chinese researcher Yaqiu Wang said in a statement.   Since the start of the pandemic at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China has arrested several activists trying to report what was happening in 'ground zero' of the origin of the virus and although some have been liberators, others are unaware of its whereabouts.   Next Monday, citizen journalist Zhang Zhan will be tried in Shanghai after she was arrested for attempting to report from Wuhan last February. Zhang's lawyer has reported that she has been foreorized after trying to go on hunger strike and that her health is deteriorating.   One of the detainees unknown to his whereabouts is Fang Bin, a Wuhan businessman who was arrested for posting videos of the city's hospitals in February.   HRW accuses the Chinese government of trying to keep the narrative about the coronavirus under control by silencing independent journalists while using specialized software, internet censors and digital trolls.Load-Date: December 27, 2020End of Document

US approach to China will continue with Biden: expertsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 19, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 324 wordsBodyWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has identified China as the country's biggest enemy, and the Justice Department has reflected that emphasis over the past four years with the filing of court cases against a variety of people, from hackers accused of stealing intellectual property to teachers accused of scholarship fraud.But even with the advent of Democrat Joe Biden's government, the approach to law enforcement against China might not be radically different, partly because of Beijing's departure that to say U.S. authorities, lawyers, and analysts is against international standards. Even if the speech against China drops in the White House, cases against Chinese government agents could continue at an accelerated pace, especially as the approach—even against the theft of trade secrets—predess the Trump administration."I think this is going to continue because it doesn't depend on America. It's the Chinese who are being really aggressive," said James Lewis, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The Department of Justice undertook in 2018 what it described as the China Initiative to Combat What the Authorities considered a multifaceted action by Beijing to steal intellectual property and conduct foreign-influenced operations in the United States. It was part of a broad U.S. government approach to China, which accelerated last year when Trump blamed the country for spreading the coronavirus and at a time when headlines from various agencies, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, lashed out at Beijing.State Department officials are confident that the approach will persist."There is no turning back to a time when free-market democracies turned a blind eye to intellectual property theft, appetite for sensitive personal information, and repression and censorship by the RPCh," John Demers, Deputy Attorney General of Homeland Security in reference to China, said in a statement.Load-Date: November 20, 2020End of Document

Human Rights Activists, in Support of Hong Kong, to Hold Prayer Vigil and Peaceful Civil Disobedience at Chinese Embassy In Washington, D.C.Christian NewswireNovember 19, 2020 Thursday 12:27 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Christian Communication, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 476 wordsByline: By Christian Defense CoalitionBodyNEWS PROVIDED BYChristian Defense CoalitionNov. 19, 2020 WASHINGTON, Nov. 19, 2020 /Christian Newswire/ -- Human rights activists, in support of Hong Kong, to hold prayer vigil and peaceful civil disobedience on Friday, November 20, 12:00 PM at the Chinese Embassy at 3505 International Place N.W., in Washington, DC.Here is a link to the Facebook Event page: www.facebook.com/events/286757832672981The group will be praying for freedom, democracy and human rights in Hong Kong as well as calling for the next Presidential Administration and Congress to stand with Hong Kong as they face oppression and persecution from the Chinese government.To stand in solidarity with the heroic people of Hong Kong, members of the group will be peacefully kneeling in front of the Chinese Embassy blocking the entrance as they pray for human rights and freedom in Hong Kong.Dr. William Devlin, CEO of REDEEM!, states: "This week the Pew Research Center out of Washington DC stated that the People's Republic of China has the highest government rate of restrictions on religion of any government in the world. We pastors saw this firsthand one year ago today in Hong Kong where the draconian restrictive government of Carrie Lam brutally oppressed democracy and freedom loving rallies. Today we stand with Hong Kong and call upon the PRC to allow Freedom, democracy and liberty to flourish in Hong Kong."     Rev. Kristopher Keating, President, Bright Mercy, remarks:     "The Chinese government must be held to a higher and better standard for protecting basic human rights. The treatment of the 'Hong Kong 12' highlights China's failure to ensure fair process for people subject to its rule. Hong Kong was peaceful and prosperous before the Chinese government's over-zealous actions to oppress popular dissent. We are here to stand in solidarity with our oppressed and imprisoned neighbors struggling for freedom. We are here to say to China, "The world is watching."          Rev. Patrick Mahoney, Director of the Christian Defense Coalition, comments:         "For over 40 years, we have been a loud and prophetic voice calling for an end to Chinese brutality and oppression against their own people. As we gather in prayer and public witness, we also call upon the government of the United States to continue their support for freedom and human rights in Hong Kong.  America and the free nations of the world must always stand with Hong Kong and never be silent regarding Chinese tyranny and oppression."             Rev. Mahoney, Rev.

REPORT: China Uses Private Companies To Process Stolen DataThe Daily CallerDecember 31, 2020 Thursday 11:01 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: WORLDLength: 871 wordsByline: Jordan Lancaster, Reporter, jordanlancaster70@gmail.comBodyLink to ImageChina's ability to force private companies to process stolen data gives the country an edge over United States intelligence agencies, a recent report shows.At the beginning of President Donald Trump's term, Chinese and U.S. intelligence agencies were embroiled in conflict over data, Foreign Policy reported. Hackers working for China were able to pull off a massive hack of Equifax, one of the largest credit-reporting firms in the U.S., and steal personal information like Social Security numbers and credit card information from around 145 million Americans.U.S. officials now say that the ties between Chinese businesses and Chinese intelligence services have gotten tighter, according to the report. In 2017, Beijing passed a law that forced Chinese businesses to work with Chinese intelligence and security agencies whenever they are asked. The law codified “what was pretty much what was going on for many years before, though corruption had tempered it,” a former CIA official told the magazine. (RELATED: REPORT: China Collected Data While US Intelligence Fell Behind)During the final years of the Obama administration, U.S. intelligence officials had been instructed to focus on the relationship between Chinese businesses and Chinese intelligence agencies in order to better understand it. They were able to discover the vast amount of cooperation that occurred between the two entities, who communicated on “a daily basis,” a former Trump-era national security official told Foreign Policy.Link to ImageU.S. President Donald Trump takes part in a welcoming ceremony with China's President Xi Jinping on November 9, 2017 in Beijing, China. Trump is on a 10-day trip to Asia. (Photo by Thomas Peter-Pool/Getty Images)“Those commercial entities are the commercial wing of the party,” the national security official said. “They of course cooperate with intelligence services to achieve the party's goals.”According to current and former officials, China orders private companies to process massive amounts of stolen data if it is deemed to have value for intelligence. The ability to process such large amounts of data gives Beijing an edge over U.S. intelligence, Foreign Policy reported.Chinese companies don't necessarily want to cooperate with the Chinese government, although they are forced to. Many firms “probably want to be normal tech companies, and don't want to deal with these ideological expectations, or the national security expectations,” Elsa Kania, a China expert and adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, told Foreign Policy. “Most Chinese tech companies are not that dissimilar to their counterparts in Silicon Valley. The difference is they are trying to operate within a system where there are incentives and expectations to cultivate closer relations with the government, or the potential for retribution should they step out of line on some front.”The companies will publicly deny having links to Beijing's intelligence or military operations, especially in English, according to the report. However, in China, they often speak about their loyalty to the party and willingness to assist with intelligence operations. (RELATED: China Stole Data For Years, But Learning How To Read It Is What Changed The Global Spy Game)American companies became key targets for intellectual property theft from Chinese spy agencies. The agencies steal information and data from the companies and pass it on to Chinese companies in order to give them an economic advantage over their competition. “It's well understood that you've had some flow of information from Chinese intelligence agencies to private sector entities,” Sean Kanuck, who was the U.S. national intelligence officer for cyber issues from 2011 to 2016, told Foreign Policy.Steve Ryan, the former deputy director of the National Security Agency's Threat Operations Center, said that China's spy operations were targeting U.S. defense contractors as far back as 2000, and were doing so “on a regular basis” by 2006. China was “just robbing the defense industrial base blind, in certain areas, in certain technologies,” Ryan said. “And then we would just watch them form a company that would then put that U.S.-side interest out of business. We saw that time and again.”American intelligence operations are at a disadvantage because they can't force American companies to perform expensive data-processing like the Chinese can, according to the magazine. But once U.S. agencies were able to process the data, the results were “sickening to your stomach,” according to a current senior intelligence official.“Look at Equifax. Add Anthem, the financial stuff, Marriott, there's nothing they don't know about us,” the official said, referring to a series of recent hacks by Chinese spies.National security officials believe that China may be attempting to undermine the American economy by using stolen personal information, according to the report. The information can be used to strategically put financial stress on certain areas of business, or give Chinese firms an advantage. The data can be used for market research and industry insights, or be used to create better algorithms for artificial intelligence.Graphic The flag of the People's Republic of China hangs next to an American flag outside the Goldman Sachs headquarters building December 16, 2008 in New York.

Ohio U.S. Attorney: University Researcher Pleads Guilty to Lying on Grant Applications to Develop Scientific Expertise for ChinaTargeted News ServiceNovember 13, 2020 Friday 9:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 885 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: COLUMBUS, Ohio BodyThe U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, David DeVillers, issued the following news release on Nov. 12:A rheumatology professor and researcher with strong ties to China pleaded guilty to making false statements to federal authorities as part of an immunology research fraud scheme.Song Guo Zheng, 58, of Hilliard, appeared in federal today, at which time his guilty plea was accepted by Chief U.S. District Judge Algenon L. Marbley.As part of his plea, Zheng admitted he lied on applications in order to use approximately $4.1 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop China's expertise in the areas of rheumatology and immunology.Zheng was a professor of internal medicine who led a team conducting autoimmune research at The Ohio State University and Pennsylvania State University. According to his plea, Zheng caused materially false and misleading statements on NIH grant applications, seeking to hide his participation in Chinese Talent Plans and his affiliation and collaboration with a Chinese university controlled by the Chinese government. Making false statements to the federal government is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison.Zheng was arrested Friday, May 22, 2020, after he arrived in Anchorage, Alaska, aboard a charter flight and as he prepared to board another charter flight to China. When he was arrested, he was carrying three large bags, one small suitcase and a briefcase containing two laptops, three cell phones, several USB drives, several silver bars, expired Chinese passports for his family, deeds for property in China and other items.He was transported to the Southern District of Ohio and made his first federal court appearance in Columbus on July 7, 2020."Federal research funding is provided by the American tax payers for the benefit of American society--not as a subsidy for the Chinese Government," said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers. "The American people deserve total transparency when federal dollars are being provided for research, and we will continue to hold accountable those who choose to lie about their foreign government affiliations in an attempt to fraudulently gain access to these funds.""The FBI and its partners are a unified front in protecting taxpayer-funded research, so there is no escape for those who break America's laws. Whether it's a midnight flight through Alaska or hiding in plain sight, we will find you and bring you to justice," stated Alan E. Kohler, Jr., Assistant Director of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division."Zheng promised China he would enhance the country's biomedical research. He was preparing to flee the United States after he learned that his American employer had begun an administrative process into whether or not he was complying with American taxpayer-funded grant rules," said David M. DeVillers, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio. "Today's plea reinforces our proven commitment to protect our country's position as a global leader in research and innovation, and to punish those who try to exploit and undermine that position.""The FBI and our law enforcement partners continue to engage with universities to protect sensitive research from being illegally transferred to foreign governments," stated FBI Cincinnati Special Agent in Charge Chris Hoffman. "Today's plea represents an acknowledgement by Zheng not only of his violation of the trust given to him by the U.S. government in the form of federal grant funds, but also of norms for research integrity and an abuse of the openness and transparency in the U.S. academic system.""The purpose of reporting potential conflicts of interest is to protect the integrity of professional judgement and ensure the public's trust in the research being conducted," said Lamont Pugh III, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Office of Inspector General - Chicago Region. "This defendant violated that trust by failing to report his financial interests and affiliations with foreign parties in an effort to improperly obtain research grant funding through the National Institutes of Health. The OIG is committed to identifying and investigating instances where individuals intentionally fail to report or falsify information regarding their sources of research support in order to ensure the proper use of taxpayer dollars."According to court documents, since 2013, Zheng had been participating in a Chinese Talent Plan, a program established by the Chinese government to recruit individuals with knowledge or access to foreign technology intellectual property. Since that time, Zheng used research conducted in the United States to benefit the People's Republic of China. Zheng failed to disclose conflicts of interest or his foreign commitments to his American employers or to the NIH.This case was investigated by the FBI and Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General. Assistant United States Attorneys Douglas W. Squires and S. Courter Shimeall, Special Assistant United States Attorney Christopher N. St. Pierre, and Trial Attorney Matthew J.

Chinese Communist Party infiltrates IBM, PepsiCo and 3MCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 22, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 639 wordsBodyChina's communist regime has no limits when it comes to expanding its tentacles. While there are numerous accusations of espionage outside the country, it adds to this technique that members of the Communist Party of China (PCCh) are part of the main American companies based in that country.A filtered database realizes this. Hundreds of party supporting employees are in the Chinese divisions of corporations such as IBM, PepsiCo and 3M, which have offices in the Asian nation, The Epoch Times says.This is how Xi Jinping seeks to appropriate all possible terrains: technological, military, political and now corporate. For these Chinese employees the premise is to "support the healthy development of companies", but doubt arises as to how much "health" the PCCh can bring to these transnationals.Only the New York-based technology company, IBM, has at least 808 members in China. While 3M, a manufacturer of health care products, including N95 respirators against COVID-19, has 230 PCCh members on its payroll.PepsiCo, the multinational snack and beverage company, has 45 employees who are members of the Chinese Communist Party, political support for Xi Jinping.Dominate the private sectorAccording to the leaked document, the party has managed to add more employees in other U.S. multinationals The Dow Chemical Company, one of the world's largest chemical companies, bringing together 337 CHC members divided into four Communist Party of China committees.The list increases with some companies with fewer employees, all under the leadership of the Chinese government and the "duties" established in the political group.However, the incorporation of these communist employees is a common practice in China. By 2016, the party had joined supporters at around 75,000 foreign companies in China (about 70% of the total), the Epoch Times notes."Xi Jinping, long suspicious of the private sector, is moving firmly to dominate it," reads in research disseminated a few days ago by The Wall Street Journal.The dictator's objective would be for all companies to attach the the most to their policies even though there are no real economic achievements. On the contrary, government ideology would only hinder innovation and development."Transactions involving state-owned enterprises buying private companies exceeded $20 billion last year, more than double the level of 2012," writes Lingling Wei, the journalist author of the investigation.While The Wall Street Journal's policy of intervention encompasses Chinese companies, the latest leaked documents demonstrate China's ambition for foreign firmsChina in america's sightsThe U.S. government is mindful of the Chinese regime's illicit activities, from manipulation from social media and applications, to technological dominance with the 5G network.E.e. e.g., Donald Trump's government significantly reduced the entry into the country of members of the Chinese Communist Party. It limited the duration of their visas and their families to one month, and allowed them only one entry into the country.The measure would affect some 270 million people, 92 million of whom belong to the Chinese Communist Party.During Donald Trump's presidency, visas for some 1000 Chinese students and investigators suspected of espionage in the United States were also revoked, an Infobae note was rewrited.Recently, the FBI accused a Zoom executive of working with the Chinese regime, monitoring users and censoringVideocalls.The research body added that employees of that company in the United States would have a plan to migrate nearly one million data from the US to China. In this way the communist country would submit everything to its jurisdiction.That's how China, under Xi Jinping's regime, is still on track to want to control everything. Without any limit, but with a lot of desire for power.   Load-Date: December 23, 2020End of Document

CHINESE DIPLOMATS' AGGRESSIVE TWITTER STRATEGY ON DISPLAY IN AUSTRALIA DISPUTEStates News ServiceDecember 16, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 863 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):By VOA NewsDecember 16, 2020 07:33 PMChina and Australia have seen tensions rise over the past year, after Canberra demanded an independent investigation into the origin of the coronavirus pandemic and China responded by escalating tariffs on Australian imports.China has imposed tariffs on Australian barley, beef, wine, coal and other products, calling them a response to illegal Australian trade policies. Critics say Beijing's actions are part of a broader diplomatic offensive against an important U.S. ally in the region, which is seen as a key member of an emerging security alliance including India and Japan.The dispute with Canberra has also highlighted how Beijing now wages diplomatic offensives on social media, especially Twitter.Twitter has been blocked in China since 2009, but the government has embraced it as part of its foreign propaganda strategy, using the platform to amplify messages for foreign audiences.A doctored tweetLast month, a four-year Australian government probe recommended 19 former and current Australian soldiers face criminal investigations for killing 39 Afghans in 23 separate incidents during the course of the war.On November 29, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian posted on Twitter a doctored photo depicting a grinning Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to the throat of an Afghan child.The graphic post brought condemnation from Australian lawmakers and Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who demanded China delete the image and formally apologize.That demand was ignored and may have emboldened Chinese officials to do more. A new report by the Washington-based German Marshall Fund (GMF) shows that between November 27 and December 3, Australia was the third most mentioned country by Chinese government and state media Twitter accounts.By way of comparison, Australia was only the 10th most referred to country over the previous two months. "China's propaganda apparatus has focused intensely on Australia over the past couple of days," the report said.Zhao's controversial tweet, with nearly 73,000 likes and 20,000 retweets, appears to have expanded his account following by 10%. Analysts say it also appears to have promoted more nationalist sentiment inside China, where state media have covered the dispute from Beijing's perspective."This disinformation push in the Australia example has caused real blowback from international audiences," said GMF China analyst Bryce Barros, co-author of the report. "I think this is a social media strategy that Chinese diplomats and state media journalists will continue to push to promote nationalism at home and abroad."By lashing out on Twitter and other platforms banned within China, Barros added, diplomats like Zhao are seeking to send the message to the international community, specifically the West, that China will not be pushed around.An illusion of popular backingWhile Zhao's tweet seemed to find a huge audience, a deeper dive by researchers revealed that not all of those accounts retweeting the diplomat are active followers.According to Tim Graham, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Australian National University, 8% of the accounts that retweeted Zhao's post were created on November 30, a day after Zhao's controversial post.Albert Zhang, a research intern at Australian Strategic Policy Institute, noted that by the institute's calculation, 35% of the accounts that liked Zhao's post had zero followers.Researchers from GMF's Alliance for Securing Democracy Initiative in October reported an increase in Chinese "wolf warrior" diplomats on Twitter who emulate Russian disinformation tactics while adding several unique strategies."In this case, the spike in new Twitter accounts retweeting Zhao's divisive content shows that Chinese diplomats have used 'highly suspicious personas to create an illusion of popular backing,' the researchers wrote.Chinese officials appear to have publicly embraced the confrontational strategy. Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng dismissed criticisms of "wolf warrior" diplomacy earlier this month, saying that "China's friend circle has not shrunk, but has become larger."Yet most Western experts disagree. A new 14-country Pew Research Center survey shows that public views of China have grown more negative in recent years across many advanced economies, and unfavorable opinion has soared over the past year. Negative views of China increased most in Australia, where 81% now say they view the country unfavorably."The very aggressive Chinese 'wolf warrior' diplomacy in recent months was very badly received, and there is the increasing perception of China as a strategic rival," Niclas Frederic Poitiers, a research fellow at Brussels-based think tank Bruegel, told VOA.Last week, European Union Ambassador to China Nicolas Chapuis said the bloc would seek common ground with the United States to stand up to Beijing's online bullying and intimidation, adding that China's image in Europe was worsening and Beijing must do its part to change the "extremely worrying erosion of goodwill that had taken place over the past year."Load-Date: December 17, 2020End of Document

US blacklists top Chinese chipmaker, alleging military tiesAssociated Press Financial WireDecember 18, 2020 Friday 4:46 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 263 wordsByline: PAUL WISEMAN, AP Economics WriterDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration blacklisted China’s top chipmaker Friday, limiting the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.’s access to advanced U.S. technology because of its alleged ties to the Chinese military.“We will not allow advanced U.S. technology to help build the military of an increasingly belligerent adversary,’’ Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement explaining the decision to put SMIC on the U.S. government’s so-called Entity List.SMIC has previously said it has no ties to the Chinese government.Commerce is putting more than 60 other firms on the list for such things as allegedly supporting the Chinese military, assisting the Chinese government’s crackdown on dissent, being involved in the theft of trade secrets and helping Beijing’s aggressive efforts to claim territory in the South China Sea. Among them is Chinese dronemaker DJI, sanctioned for allegedly helping the Chinese government conduct surveillance on its own citizens.But SMIC is the most high-profile target.The move means that U.S. companies will need to get a license to sell sophisticated technology to SMIC. Technology that helps with the production of the most-advanced chips -- those 10 nanometers or smaller -- face the “presumption of denial,’’ Commerce said. Other items will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.The decision comes barely a month before President-elect Joe Biden takes office. A senior Commerce Department official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said the move had not been coordinated with the Biden transition team.Load-Date: December 18, 2020End of Document

LAOS TAKES DOWN CHINESE DECORATIONS IN THE CAPITAL FOLLOWING CITIZEN COMPLAINTSStates News ServiceNovember 6, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 515 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in the Lao capital Vientiane have removed Chinese decorations hung on lampposts across the city, following a storm of complaints on social media from Lao citizens concerned over China's growing influence in the country, sources in Laos say.The decorations made to look like traditional Chinese lanterns were put up as part of a city improvement project funded by a Chinese government loan in 2018, with the work completed this year, an official of the Energy and Mines Department in Vientiane told RFA."We had a plan to beautify the streets of the city but had no money to carry it out," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity."So we proposed our plan to the Chinese government, which approved a grant for the installation of the lamps, posts, and decorations, and the installation was finished this year," he said.The decorations were removable, though, an official in the city's Office for Management and Service said, adding, "They can be put up and taken down. They don't come as part of the posts."All 300 sets of posts and the Chinese-style art were set up by a private Chinese firm along seven main roads in Vientiane in advance of an upcoming celebration of the Lao PDR [People's Democratic Republic] Day on Dec. 2, sources said.On Nov. 3, members of the Lao National Assembly Cultural Commission and other officials inspected the lampposts on one city street along the bank of the Mekong River and confirmed that their decorations had been taken down.'Laos is almost China now'The display of Chinese cultural art on the city's streets had angered many in Vientiane, with one capital resident concerned about China's growing economic influence over its smaller southern neighbor telling RFA the installations had "symbolized the control of our country by the Chinese.""I want to see decorations made from Lao art, not Chinese," another Vientiane resident said, adding, "Our culture and our arts have almost disappeared, and in the near future we won't have anything left for our children to look up to.""Our cities and streets are going to look more like Chinese towns before very much longer," he said."Laos is almost China now," another city resident said in a posting on his Facebook page.A Buddhist monk in Vientiane's Ong Teu temple said that city authorities should have tried to explain the decorations' purpose and told the public they were going up, saying for example that they could have been described as a symbol of cultural exchange."Or they could have installed Lao symbols on one post and Chinese symbols on the next, alternately."Laos, with ambitions to become "The Battery of Asia," has drawn billions of dollars in Chinese investment in hydropower dams and other big-ticket projects under Beijing's $1.3 trillion Belt and Road Initiative to build infrastructure and support trade.China is Laos' largest foreign investor and aid provider, and its second-largest trade partner after Thailand.Reported by RFA's Lao Service.

Twitter Refuses To Say Why It's Promoting A Chinese Tech Group That Allegedly Tracks UighersThe Daily CallerDecember 22, 2020 Tuesday 10:18 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc.

A confidential Huawei “interoperability report” obtained by IPVM allegedly found that the Chinese technology companies Huawei and Megvii worked together to test software that would recognize Uigher Muslims and then alert the police.The report was formerly public on Huawei's website, though it was marked confidential, and the company deleted it after IPVM reached out for comment, according to IPVM.Twitter declined to explain to the DCNF why it allowed the promotion of the Huawei tweet. (RELATED: 'Spy Wei': Trump Gives Huawei New Nickname As Commerce Dept Cracks Down On Chinese Tech Giant)Multiple publications have reported that the Chinese government targets and commits “demographic genocide” against Uighur Muslims through forced abortions, birth control, mass detentions, and imprisonment - though the Chinese government denies this and says that such stories are “fabricated” and “fake news.”Link to ImageScreenshot of Huawei Twitter promotion.Huawei said it is opposed to discrimination in a December statement to the BBC. “We provide general-purpose connectivity products based on recognised industry standards, and we comply with ethics and governance systems around emerging technology,” Huawei said in the statement.

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the DCNF.Huawei has previously come under fire for its surveillance technologies, prompting Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to accuse the company of harnessing “U.S. technology in a manner that undermines U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.” Huawei has denied that it spies on behalf of the Chinese government.“Huawei is a disaster,” President Donald Trump said on Fox News this summer, suggesting that the company spies on American citizens. “They used to have free reign over our country. They knew everything we were doing. Huawei is a way of really I call it the 'spywei'.

Swalwell Spoke At Same 2013 Event As Alleged Chinese Spy Who Worked For Dianne FeinsteinThe Daily CallerDecember 11, 2020 Friday 12:21 AM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc.

Eric Swalwell spoke at an event in 2013 along with a former staffer for Sen. Dianne Feinstein who is alleged to have spied for the Chinese government. • The group that hosted Swalwell and Russell Lowe, the Feinstein staffer, was led by Christine Fang, who herself is alleged to have worked as a Chinese secret agent from 2011 to 2015. • Fang developed close ties to Swalwell, Axios reported this week. She raised money for his political campaigns and planted an intern in his office. California Rep. Eric Swalwell, whose contacts with a Chinese spy were revealed this week, spoke at a same event in 2013 as another alleged Chinese agent who worked for decades for California Sen. Dianne Feinstein.The event was hosted by the group led by Christine Fang, a Chinese national whose relationship with Swalwell was the subject of a report published this week by Axios. There is no indication of wrongdoing on Swalwell's part.The California State University, East Bay Chinese Student Association hosted both Swalwell and Russell Lowe, who then worked for Feinstein, at an event to commemorate the Chinese Lunar New Year on Feb. 9, 2013, according to the group's Facebook page.Photos from the event show Swalwell and Lowe speaking to a group of dozens of students at the event. The photo of Lowe shows him holding what appears to be a letter that Feinstein wrote to the student group for its celebration.The association posted a photo of the letter from Feinstein on its Facebook page.Swalwell posted a photo of himself at the event on his Twitter account.Swalwell's office did not respond to a request for comment on whether he knows Lowe.Politico reported in 2018 that a staffer for Feinstein had for years provided political intelligence to Chinese officials. He operated at the direction of officials in the Chinese consulate in San Francisco, according to Politico.Feinstein, who is a longtime member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, issued a statement at the time saying that the FBI had briefed her about the staffer. She said that the employee did not have access to any classified information, and that he left her employ after the FBI briefing.Lowe was described as a driver for Feinstein, but he was also a liaison between her office and the Asian-American community in the Bay area. He attended functions at the Chinese consulate in San Francisco, which has long been known as a hotbed of Chinese spy activity.The Daily Caller News Foundation identified Lowe in 2018 as the likely Chinese agent working in Feinstein's office. (RELATED: All Signs Point To One Man As Chinese Spy On Feinstein's Staff)A photo in the DCNF story shows Lowe at an event hosted by the Chinese Student Association on Sept. 22, 2011, along with an unidentified woman and an official seemingly affiliated with the Chinese consulate.Lowe attended a farewell party for Consul General Gao Zhansheng on March 12, 2013, according to the consulate's website.It is unclear whether Lowe and Fang were aware of the others' alleged work for the Chinese government.U.S. intelligence officials told Axios that Fang worked covertly for China's Ministry of State Security, its main spy service, from 2011 to 2015. Feinstein's staffer worked on behalf of the same spy service, Politico reported.Fang cozied up to multiple California politicos, including Swalwell, Rep. Ro Khanna and Rep. Judy Chu, according to Axios.Fang first met Swalwell when he served on the city council in Dublin, California.According to Axios, she raised money for Swalwell's congressional reelection campaign in 2014 and placed an intern in his congressional office.Swalwell was briefed by the FBI about Fang's undercover activity in 2015. He said he cut off all contact with her after the briefing. Fang skipped the country in mid-2015.Swalwell has refused to discuss the extent of his relationship with Fang, who Axios reported had romantic affairs with the mayors of two cities in the Midwest.Swalwell initially said he could not talk about the matter because some of the details remain classified. In interviews with Politico and CNN, he accused the Trump administration of leaking derogatory information about him because he is a vocal critic of President Donald Trump.Feinstein's office did not respond to request for comment. A non-profit group that Lowe co-founded in San Francisco after leaving Feinstein's office also did not respond to an email seeking comment.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

China wants to weaponize its currency. A digital version could helpCNN WireDecember 5, 2020 Saturday 00:08Invalid date found for VDI: 1598864720 XCEDOCID: 0 LNI: 61FH-77C1-JBSS-S0BK-00000-00. Date output 'as-is'.GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1529 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  China wants to break the US dollar's stranglehold on the global financial system and gain greater control over how people spend their money. It's hoping a digital currency could deliver both.After years of preparation, the country began rolling out an ambitious test of a digital version of the yuan earlier this year. Pilots exist now in four Chinese cities, where transactions totaling more than 2 billion yuan ($300 million) have already taken place. If the program is expanded nationwide, China would become the most powerful economy yet to offer a national digital currency, beating a forthcoming digital version of the euro from the European Central Bank.Beijing has touted the digital yuan as a futuristic currency that will make buying things more convenient and secure. Officials also say that it could help those who don't have access to bank accounts and other traditional financial services.While China is already nearly cashless and a lot of transactions happen digitally, they do so beyond the purview of the state on privately-owned apps and platforms.An official digital yuan would change that, as it would give Beijing an unprecedented amount of information about how and where people are, and what they're spending their money on --- an approach that runs counter to the original intent of digital money in the first place. Bitcoin and other digital currencies rely on a decentralized blockchain system that prevents any one person or organization from having control."In essence, the digital yuan can help strengthen the state's surveillance and control over the economy and society," said Frank Xie, a professor in business at University of South Carolina Aiken. "It enhances the centralization of authority. That may be the fundamental reason why it has been strongly pushed and rushed by the state."Chinese regulators have also suggested that the widespread adoption of a digital yuan could help them realize a much grander plan: breaking the US dollar monopoly and growing the influence of the yuan on the international stage. Just last month, for example, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam revealed that US sanctions have blocked her from having a bank account.There are still plenty of hurdles for China's program to overcome before the new form of currency is entrenched in everyday life, though. And analysts are skeptical about whether the digital yuan can pick up the traction that Beijing hopes it can, much less pose a real threat to the US dollar. The ruling Chinese Communist Party's desire to control its financial system remains the ultimate obstacle to creating any currency that could truly become global.Keeping the digital economy in line The push to develop a digital currency began in 2014, according to the People's Bank of China. Authorities spent six years researching the project before launching pilot programs this year in Shenzhen, Suzhou, Chengdu and Xiong'an.Like cryptocurrency, the digital yuan incorporates some elements of blockchain technology: Every transaction is recorded and traceable in a digital ledger. It would replace some of the cash that is already in circulation, according to Fan Yifei, deputy governor of the central bank. The development of a digital currency serves other purposes, too. A more easily traceable yuan would allow the government to better manage the country's monetary supply. It also satisfies Beijing's desire to curtail growing influence that private tech firms and their digital payment services have on the country's financial system.The Chinese central bank didn't articulate its reason for developing a digital currency at the time. The existence of the program has only come to light in recent years as the central bank has acknowledged that it feels threatened by how rapidly digital technology is evolving.Online payment services run by Ant Group's Alipay and Tencent's WeChat Pay have been growing rapidly over the last decade, raising concerns about whether private companies hold too much sway over digital transactions in China.In 2013, for example, Alipay launched a money market fund called Yu'e Bao, or "Leftover Treasure," that became so popular that Chinese regulators stepped in and forced the program to reduce its size. They were concerned about systemic risk: If the massive fund failed for some reason, it could wreak havoc on China's economy."Beijing has long been concerned about the digital currency monopoly by tech giants, and their impact on the financial system beyond central bank supervision," wrote Anthony Chan, chief Asia investment strategist for Swiss bank UBP, in a research report published earlier this year. Recent events have served to highlight those concerns. Last month, for example, the Chinese government slammed the brakes on Ant Group's highly anticipated initial public offering just days before its shares were scheduled to start trading in Shanghai and Hong Kong.That decision confirmed that "no one entity will be allowed too much power or control over one market without express approval or collaboration with the government," said James Gillingham, CEO and co-founder of Finxflo, a Singapore-based crypto brokerage firm.The 'last piece' of the surveillance stateChina is also concerned about money being moved out of the country, according to Gillingham. The Chinese Communist Party has long believed that maintaining vast amounts of control over its economic, financial and social systems is best for maintaining stability and political control, and has attributed those policies to shielding the country from recent, major financial crises in Asia and across the globe."The authorities are aware of the challenges posed by sudden monetary outflows," Gillingham said. "The introduction of the digital yuan would allow them to implement better levels of capital control."Money left China at a record clip last year through unauthorized channels as the country grappled with economic woes and its trade war with the United States. Xie, the University of South Carolina business professor, called the digital currency the "last piece" of the surveillance state. China already uses a wide array of technology, including facial recognition and cameras, to collect vast amounts of information on its citizens.The People's Bank of China says its digital yuan features "controllable anonymity." In other words, while either party involved in a transaction might not be known to each other or to the general public, their private information is still known to the central bank.Central bank digital currencies "are unlikely to have the same degree of anonymity as cash," wrote Andrew Tilton, chief Asia economist for Goldman Sachs, in a recent research report. He pointed out a key feature of this type of money is that the central banks can "directly monitor their usage."The Chinese digital currency isn't the only one that will be forced to confront this issue. The European Central Bank has acknowledged that the infrastructure supporting its digital euro should be "ultimately controlled" by the institution, with one option that "all transactions" are "recorded in the central bank's ledger."ECB President Christine Lagarde, though, said this week that she doesn't want Europe to move "too fast," and pointed out that protecting user privacy is key.More ambitious plans, but challenges aheadThe creation of a digital currency can also help China mitigate other economic risks, particularly as tensions with the United States continue to simmer.If the US government were to ban Chinese banks from using SWIFT --- the messaging service that moves money around the global banking system --- individuals and companies could use the digital yuan in cross-border transactions, according to Chan from UBP.Analysts caution, though, that it will take a lot for Beijing's biggest ambitions to be fully realized.The yuan accounts for slightly over 4% of international transactions, according to the Bank for International Settlements, an international financial institution. The US dollar comprises 88%."China is not anywhere close to getting people to use the [renminbi] internationally," said Scott Kennedy, senior adviser at Center for Strategic and International Studies.It's also not clear that Chinese consumers will actually flock to the digital yuan in the first place. More than 800 million people in China, or 86% of mobile internet users, already use mobile payment services like Alipay and WeChat Pay, according to estimates published by the China Internet Network Information Center. While not entirely the same as digital currency --- which would be fully guaranteed by the central bank --- such programs offer similar levels of convenience.The loss of privacy surrounding transactions probably doesn't help the government's case. Xie said that people might be hesitant to use the currency, particularly for large transactions or for assets they want to move overseas."Ordinary people might be cautious," he added. "They risk losing more privacy while not gaining additional convenience."--- Selina Wang contributed to this report.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Professor pleads guilty to research-sharing fraud scheme for ChinaUPINovember 13, 2020 Friday GENERAL_EDIT_CORRECTION ERROR Document ID 0 Has error Validate old format failed - Input Date Invalid - 0015: Unparseable date: "0015"ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 482 wordsByline: DARRYL COOTEDateline: Nov. 13 BodyA university professor and medical researcher pleaded guilty on Thursday to charges linked to a fraud scheme to develop China's scientific expertise through the use of U.S. taxpayer-funded research, prosecutors said.Song Guy Zheng, 58, of Hilliard, Ohio, pleaded guilty before Chief U.S. District Judge Algenon L. Marbley on Thursday to having lied about his connections to the Chinese government and a Beijing-controlled university on National Institutes of Health grant applications, prosecutors said in a release.Prosecutors said Zheng intended to transfer the research that the $4.1 million grants bought to China, where it would be used to improve the Asian nation's rheumatology and immunology expertise.Zheng's guilty plea is the latest to come from the Justice Department's so-called China Initiative crackdown on academics and professionals who are engaged in trade secret theft, hacking and economic espionage for the Asian nation.Prosecutors said Zheng has been a participant in a Chinese government program to recruit those with knowledge and access to foreign technology and intellectual property since 2013 and has used his U.S. research for China's benefit."Federal research funding is provided by the American tax payers for the benefit of American society -- not as a subsidy for the Chinese government," Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers said in a statement. "The American people deserve total transparency when federal dollars are being provided for research, and we will continue to hold accountable those who choose to lie about their foreign government affiliations in an attempt to fraudulently gain access to these funds."Agents arrested the former Ohio State University and Pennsylvania State University professor on May 22 in Alaska prior to boarding a flight for China as he was attempting to flee the United States with three large bags, one small suitcase, a briefcase with two laptops, several USB drives, several silver bars, expired Chinese passports for his family, deeds to property in China and other items, prosecutors said."Zheng promised China he would enhance the country's biomedical research," David M. DeVillers, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, said in a statement. "He was preparing to flee the United States after he learned that his American employer had begun an administrative process into whether or not he was complying with American taxpayer-funded grant rules."Making false statements to the federal government is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison.Since the Justice Department launched the China Initiative in 2018, dozens of people, mostly academics, have been charged with trying to steal intellectual property for China.According to the Justice Department, about 80% of all economic espionage prosecutions it has brought before the courts involved theft for the Chinese government.Load-Date: November 13, 2020End of Document

Rep. Steube Introduces Legislation to Prevent CCP Intellectual Property Theft by Reforming Student Visa Application ProcessTargeted News ServiceNovember 19, 2020 Thursday 8:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 386 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. W. Greg Steube, R-Florida, issued the following news release on Nov. 18:U.S. Representative Greg Steube (R-Fla.) today introduced the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Visa Disclosure Act of 2020, which would require aliens applying for certain United States visas to disclose if they receive funds from the Government of the People's Republic of China or the Chinese Communist Party."From using apps like TikTok to bankrolling Communist agents' visa applications, it is clear that the Chinese Communist Party poses a dire threat to our intellectual property, personal information, and national security," Steube said. "While my Democrat colleagues fail to address the national security risk from those entering our country with malicious intentions, I am committed to holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable and blocking their espionage tactics."Steube's legislation is part of a greater push from the Republican Study Committee (RSC) and its membership to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for their long list of crimes towards the United States, including violating intellectual property laws.This week, Steube cosponsored U.S. Representative Debbie Lesko's (R-Ariz.) legislation which would prevent China from stealing U.S. intellectual property by prohibiting the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from issuing U.S. visas to Chinese Communist Party officials, cabinet members of the Chinese government, and active duty members of the People's Liberation Army.Recent reports have suggested that the Chinese Communist Party is encouraging citizens to take advantage of certain immigration visas to spy on the United States and engage in intellectual property theft. In July, President Trump ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston, citing a dramatic uptick in Chinese espionage and IP theft against the United States.This follows reports that the Chinese Communist Party was using the App, TikTok, to collect data and personal information from U.S. Citizens: https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/us-senators-seek-to-ban-tiktok-on-government-phones-over-spying-concernsThe full text of the legislation can be found here: https://steube.house.gov/sites/steube.house.gov/files/CCP%20Visa%20Disclosure%20Act%20of%202020.pdfCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7300597 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 19, 2020End of Document

CHINA-BASED EXECUTIVE AT U.S. TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY CHARGED WITH DISRUPTING VIDEO MEETINGS COMMEMORATING TIANANMEN SQUARE MASSACREUS Fed NewsDecember 24, 2020 Thursday 4:22 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 1383 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, Dec. 24 -- The U.S. Department of Justice issued the following press release:A complaint and arrest warrant were unsealed today in federal court in Brooklyn charging Xinjiang Jin, also known as "Julien Jin," with conspiracy to commit interstate harassment and unlawful conspiracy to transfer a means of identification. Jin, an employee of a U.S.-based telecommunications company (Company-1) who was based in the People's Republic of China (PRC), allegedly participated in a scheme to disrupt a series of meetings in May and June 2020 held to commemorate the June 4, 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in the PRC. The meetings were conducted using a videoconferencing program provided by Company-1, and were organized and hosted by U.S-based individuals, including individuals residing in the Eastern District of New York. Jin is not in U.S. custody."No company with significant business interests in China is immune from the coercive power of the Chinese Communist Party," said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers. "The Chinese Communist Party will use those within its reach to sap the tree of liberty, stifling free speech in China, the United States and elsewhere about the Party's repression of the Chinese people. For companies with operations in China, like that here, this reality may mean executives being coopted to further repressive activity at odds with the values that have allowed that company to flourish here.""The FBI remains committed to protecting the exercise of free speech for all Americans. As this complaint alleges, that freedom was directly infringed upon by the pernicious activities of Communist China's Intelligence Services, in support of a regime that neither reflects nor upholds our democratic values," said FBI Director Christopher Wray. "Americans should understand that the Chinese Government will not hesitate to exploit companies operating in China to further their international agenda, including repression of free speech.""The allegations in the complaint lay bare the Faustian bargain that the PRC government demands of U.S. technology companies doing business within the PRC's borders, and the insider threat that those companies face from their own employees in the PRC," said Acting United States Attorney Seth D. DuCharme. "As alleged, Jin worked closely with the PRC government and members of PRC intelligence services to help the PRC government silence the political and religious speech of users of the platform of a U.S. technology company. Jin willingly committed crimes, and sought to mislead others at the company, to help PRC authorities censor and punish U.S. users' core political speech merely for exercising their rights to free expression. The charges announced today make clear that employees working in the PRC for U.S. technology companies make those companies-and their users-vulnerable to the malign influence of the PRC government. This Office will continue working tirelessly to protect against threats to the free expression of political views and religious beliefs, regardless whether those threats come from inside or outside the United States."Mr. DuCharme and Mr. Demers also extended their thanks and appreciation to Company-1 for its cooperation in the government's ongoing investigation.According to the complaint, Jin served as Company-1's primary liaison with PRC law enforcement and intelligence services. In that capacity, he regularly responded to requests from the PRC government for information and to terminate video meetings hosted on Company-1's video communications platform. Part of Jin's duties included providing information to the PRC government about Company-1's users and meetings, and in some cases he provided information - such as Internet Protocol addresses, names and email addresses - of users located outside of the PRC. Jin was also responsible for proactively monitoring Company-1's video communications platform for what the PRC government considers to be "illegal" meetings to discuss political and religious subjects unacceptable to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the PRC government.As alleged in the complaint, between January 2019 to the present, Jin and others conspired to use Company-1's systems in the United States to censor the political and religious speech of individuals located in the United States and around the world at the direction and under the control of officials of the PRC government. Among other actions taken at the direction of the PRC government, Jin and others terminated at least four video meetings hosted on Company-1's networks commemorating the thirty-first anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, most of which were organized and attended by U.S.-based participants, such as dissidents who had participated in and survived the 1989 protests. Some of the participants who were unable to attend these meetings were Company-1 customers in Queens and Long Island, New York who had purchased subscriptions to Company-1's services, and therefore entered into service agreements with Company-1 governed by its Terms of Service (TOS).Jin, officials from the PRC government and others allegedly collaborated to identify meeting participants and to disrupt meetings hosted on Company-1's U.S. servers, at times creating pretextual reasons to justify their actions to other employees and executives of Company-1, as well as Company-1's users themselves. In particular, in May and June 2020, Jin and others acted to disrupt meetings held on the Company-1 platform to discuss politically sensitive topics unacceptable to the PRC government by infiltrating the meetings to gather evidence about purported misconduct occurring in those meetings. In fact, there was no misconduct; Jin and his co-conspirators fabricated evidence of TOS violations to provide justification for terminating the meetings, as well as certain participants' accounts. Jin then tasked a high-ranking employee of Company-1 in the United States to effect the termination of meetings and the suspension and cancellation of user accounts.As detailed in the complaint, Jin's co-conspirators created fake email accounts and Company-1 accounts in the names of others, including PRC political dissidents, to fabricate evidence that the hosts of and participants in the meetings to commemorate the Tiananmen Square massacre were supporting terrorist organizations, inciting violence or distributing child pornography. The fabricated evidence falsely asserted that the meetings included discussions of child abuse or exploitation, terrorism, racism or incitements to violence, and sometimes included screenshots of the purported participants' user profiles featuring, for example, a masked person holding a flag resembling that of the Islamic State terrorist group. Jin used the complaints as evidence to persuade Company-1 executives based in the United States to terminate meetings and suspend or terminate the user accounts of the meeting hosts.PRC authorities took advantage of information provided by Jin to retaliate against and intimidate participants residing in the PRC, or PRC-based family members of meeting participants. PRC authorities temporarily detained at least one person who planned to speak during a commemoration meeting. In another case, PRC authorities visited family members of a participant in the meetings and directed them to tell the participant to cease speaking out against the PRC government and rather to support socialism and the CCP.The charges in the complaint are allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. If convicted of both charged conspiracies, Jin faces a maximum sentence of ten years in prison.The investigation into this matter was conducted by the FBI's Washington Field Office. The government's case is being handled by the Office's National Security and Cybercrime Section. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Alexander A. Solomon, Richard M. Tucker, David K. Kessler and Ian C. Richardson are in charge of the prosecution, with assistance from Trial Attorney Scott A. Claffee of the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.

HOW ZOOM VIOLATED ITS OWN TERMS OF SERVICE FOR ACCESS TO CHINA'S MARKETStates News ServiceDecember 22, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 878 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:On Dec. 18, prosecutors from the U.S. Justice Department charged a China-based Zoom executive with conspiring to terminate Zoom meetings this year that commemorated the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre at the Chinese government's behest. The 47-page complaint contains detailed exchanges between the executive and employees at Zoom's California headquarters this year.It was a fascinating read, not least because few global tech companies that do business in China have ever made public the details of their communications with Chinese authorities on censorship issues, despite repeated calls to do so from human rights organizations and United Nations experts.What the complaint reveals is Beijing's aggressive pursuit of global censorship of topics deemed sensitive or critical of Beijing, and Zoom's failure to adequately protect its users' rights to free expression and privacy.In May, the China-based Zoom executive, Xinjiang Jin, who served as a government affairs liaison, contacted employees at Zoom's headquarters about the massacre's anniversary on June 4. The anniversary is one of the most censored events in China, and Jin told his colleagues in the U.S. that the "internet police" in China had increased pressure on Zoom to censor politically sensitive content of Chinese users no matter where they were.According to the document, Jin said that China "has implemented real-name registration/verification, so there are not many that do bad things anymore. All are from the U.S., if we don't handle them well, net security will ban all overseas servers, so I respectfully ask you to take this seriously."A U.S.-based colleague obliged: "We will hurry and ban all the free accounts from US04," referring to the name of a Zoom server.Beijing has long leveraged market access to compel foreign tech companies to meet its censorship demands, whether in China or abroad. Apple has removed hundreds of virtual private network (VPN) apps from China's App Store. In 2019, it also removed a mapping app widely used by pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong from the App Store.LinkedIn blocked content critical of Chinese authorities for users in China. From the complaint, one can see Zoom's fear that if it didn't terminate meetings or suspend accounts upon request, it risked having its China operation shut down at any time, which loomed large in all of its decisions.Companies understandably want access to China's huge market, but they also have a responsibility to respect human rights under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Zoom said publicly that it is "dedicated to the free and open exchange of ideas," but when Jin repeatedly framed speech critical of the Chinese government as something that could "do bad things" or "illegal activities," and demanded they be censored, he met no resistance or got any questions from his colleagues at headquarters.Besides conveying Chinese authorities' demands and threats to Zoom's headquarters, Jin was also shutting down meetings on behalf of Beijing in a more deceitful way.When a private June 3 Tiananmen commemoration meeting was in motion, some emails were sent to Zoom's public, generic U.S.-based complaint email account, alleging that the meeting contained content supporting terrorism, inciting violence or distributing child pornography. (An FBI investigation later found that no user accounts associated with the email addresses from which the complaint was filed actually participated in the meeting.)Jin, who had no access to that generic complaint account, concurrently alerted his U.S.-based colleague of the complaints. The colleague quickly terminated the meeting and suspended the host account without any investigation into the matter.For a public meeting on June 4, Jin suggested to his U.S.-based colleague, "It's a public meeting, so we could join and report to Zoom [U.S.] as [an] abus[ive] meeting, then you [in the] U.S. may have evidence to suspend it." Upon receiving Jin's message, the colleague terminated the account used to host the meeting. Soon after the organizer of the meeting restarted the meeting in another room using a different account, some Zoom accounts with avatars of naked women and the flag of the Islamic State group joined the meeting.Around the same time, emails were sent to Jin reporting these accounts for "inciting violence" or "pornography." Jin relayed those emails to his U.S.-based colleague who then terminated the meeting again and suspended the new account.So in order to justify shutting down legitimate meetings hosted in the U.S., a China-based Zoom executive was running schemes to trigger a violation of Zoom's terms of service, and a U.S.-based Zoom employee, knowing they were schemes, facilitated it.Earlier in the chat between Jin and the U.S. employee, Jin suggested that, instead of suspending the host account, they could put the account in "quarantine" for 24 hours, as if Zoom was having technical issues. It therefore seems reasonable to say that the U.S. employee was aware of the schemes. Second, the schemes have so many other holes (detailed in the complaint), it's hard to imagine the U.S. side wouldn't detect them if they actually wanted to.Load-Date: December 23, 2020End of Document

MALAYSIAN STATE TERMINATES $10.5B CHINA-BACKED HARBOR PROJECTStates News ServiceNovember 18, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 830 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Updated at 4:30 p.m. ET on 2020-11-18The Malaysian state of Malacca has terminated a $10.5 billion Chinese-supported harbor development project because the developer had failed to complete the undertaking, a statement from the chief minister's office said.The Malaysian company, KAJ Development Sdn. Bhd., which was backed by state-owned PowerChina, immediately has to return the 609-acre site where it had agreed to build economic parks and tourist attractions on artificially constructed islands.The statement from the chief minister's office noted that the Melaka Gateway project agreement, which was signed on Oct. 4, 2017, expired at the end of three years on Oct. 3."The company, KAJ Development Sdn. Bhd., was found to have failed in completing the project. Therefore, a notice of termination of agreement was filed to the company on Nov. 16," the office said in a news release.The chief minister's office declined to comment when contacted later by BenarNews. In addition, KAJ and Chinese Embassy officials did not immediately respond to email and text-message queries from BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.A locally registered company, KAJ was awarded a contract to revitalize Pulau Melaka, another artificial island on the Malacca Strait in 2011, which was to form part of the Melaka Gateway project.On May 13, 2017, KAJ signed a collaboration agreement with three Chinese companies PowerChina International Group Ltd., Shenzhen Yantian Port Group and Rizhao Port Group to develop three other islands to create the gateway.At the time a development contract was signed in October 2017, then-Prime Minister Najib Razak announced his support for the gateway, noting it was backed by PowerChina, which is under the Chinese government-owned State Power Investment Corp.Then there was a change of government in Malaysia in May 2018.On July 2 of that year, Malacca State Executive Councilor Mohd Rafiq Naizamohideen told journalists that the project had been delayed over issues involving the agreement with Chinese investors. He did not give other details except to note that the first of the project's four islands was 60 percent complete.Ten days later, then-Transport Minister Anthony Loke acknowledged concerns."We notice there are a few issues with the project. There have not been any signs of development at all," he said in a July 12, 2018, news conference in Klang, according to local media.Planned to be Southeast Asia's largest private marina containing facilities to berth four cruise ships at a time, a commercial and tourist park and a free-trade zone, the Melaka Gateway project saw its license to operate a port revoked on Oct. 5, 2018, by the government of then-Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. The reason for the revocation was not made public.Mahathir's government collapsed in February 2020.In response, the developers filed an appeal on March 13, 2019, seeking a declaration that the revocation announcement was null and void along with damages totaling 139 billion ringgit ($34 billion) because of delays caused by the decision.Two months later, the Transport Ministry allowed the license, prompting KAJ to drop its appeal.Not part of One Belt, One RoadContradicting reporting that the gateway was part of China's One Belt, One Road (OBOR) project, Oh Ei Sun, a senior fellow with the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, noted that it was a private endeavor outside of the Chinese government's oversight."Apparently from the very beginning this was a private China-Malaysia project which tried hard to wedge its way into one of those so-called affiliates to the OBOR, but was never recognized," Oh told BenarNews on Wednesday. "So it followed its natural course and withered away."Oh said existing OBOR projects, including the East Coast Rail Link, likely would continue.OBOR is Beijing's ambitious program to build a global network of ports, highways, railways, bridges and power plants to connect China to markets abroad and countries that can supply the world's most populous nation with resources.A 2019 report by Francis E. Hutchinson, senior fellow and coordinator of the Malaysia Studies Program at the Yusof Ishak Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS) in Singapore, said there had been economic concerns about the gateway project. He noted its proximity to other Malaysian ports."At present, there is over-capacity in Malaysia's port sector and the growth of containerized traffic through the region has plateaued," he said.Hutchinson noted that Mahathir had said the country did not need another harbor.China, along with the United States, is one of Malaysia's largest trading partners. In 2019, the Malaysian government approved investments valued at $3.74 billion (15.28 billion ringgit) from China, according to the data issued following Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit in October.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: November 19, 2020End of Document

China increases control over the private sector: "We have no choice but to follow the party"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 10, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 2282 wordsBodyXi Jinping, who long distrusted the private sector, is moving firmly to dominate it.China's most powerful leader in a generation wants even greater state control in the world's second-largest economy, and private firms of all sizes are expected to align. The government is installing more Communist Party officials within private companies, depriving some of credit and requiring executives to adapt their businesses to achieve state goals.In some cases, it takes full care of companies it considers undisciplined and absorbs them into state-owned enterprises.The momentum is led by a growing conviction within the country's leadership that private markets and entrepreneurs, while important to China's rise, are unpredictable and cannot be fully trusted. The view that state planners better manage a complex economy has become more popular this year, and Beijing relies heavily on state directives to design a V-shaped recovery of the Covid-19's impact.Xi has made his priorities especially clear in recent months. In September, the party issued new guidelines for private companies, reminding them to serve the state and promising to use education and other tools to "continually improve the political consensus of private entrepreneurs under party leadership."Just weeks later, Xi intervened personally to block China's initial $34 billion public offering from one of China's largest private firms, Ant Group, in part because of concerns that it was too focused on its own profits rather than the state's goal of controlling financial risk.The message goes unnoticed by entrepreneurs, who are reorienting their businesses to appease the state or completely relinunting private enterprise."For us small businesses, we have no choice but to follow the party," says Li Jun, a 50-year-old owner of a fish farming company in eastern Jiangsu Province. "Still, we don't benefit at all from government policies."Mr. Li recently closed a seafood processing plant because he could not obtain bank loans, a persistent problem for private companies, despite Beijing's repeated promises to make credit more available to them.The risk to China is that Xi's vigorous assertion of steritist prerogatives will hinder the kind of innovation, competitive spirit, and unbridled energy that drove China's explosive growth in recent decades. Economic policies that helped nurture e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., tech conglomerate Tencent Holdings Ltd. and other global success stories seem to be coming to an end, economists say inside and outside China. As a result, they say, Chinese companies are becoming less like American companies, which are driven by market forces and rely on private innovation and consumption.The State Council information office, China's cabinet, did not respond to the written questions for this article.The percentage of Chinese investment in manufacturing and infrastructure from private companies, after growing in recent decades, peaked in 2015 with more than half of total investments in fixed assets andhas been shrinking ever since.As a result, China's economy has become less efficient. The amount of capital needed to generate a unit of economic growth has almost doubled since 2012, when Xi came to power, according to China Dashboard, a data project between research firm Rhodium Group and the Asia Society Policy Institute. This is partly because China's largest state-owned enterprises are often less productive than private companies, official data show.Party officials, for their part, see an opportunity to curb the excessive risk-taking, debt and corruption that accompanied the rapid rise of private companies. Xi's kind of state capitalism, which mixes markets with intensified state intervention, has survived a trade war with the United States and recently outperighed free-market economies, based on economic growth rates.In one of the clearest signs of China's leadership, more state-owned enterprises are devouring private companies, redefining a government initiative called "mixed ownership reform." The original idea, which dates back to the late 1990s, was to encourage private capital to invest in state-owned enterprises, which brought more private sector acumen to China's often inflated state-owned enterprises.Now, with Xi, the process often works the other way around, with large state-owned enterprises absorbing smaller ones to keep them going and reconfiguring the strategies of smaller companies to serve the state.Transactions involving state-owned enterprises buying private companies exceeded $20 billion last year, more than double the 2012 level, in industries including financial services, pharmaceuticals, and technology, the revelations of publicly traded companies show."State-owned enterprises must play a leading role and important influence in the healthy development of private enterprises," says a new central government action plan for the next three years, requiring more mergers between state and private enterprises.Beijing OriginWater Technology Co., a wastewater treatment service provider that competes with companies such as General Electric Co., was one of the target companies. It was started in 2001 by Wen Jianping, an engineer who had studied in Australia. He was eager to help clean Up China's contaminated water supply and take advantage of the country's increasingly open business environment.As demand for water purification grew, Mr. Wen's business prospered. An initial public offering in 2010 helped make him a billionaire. In 2018, he made Forbes magazine's list of the richest people in China, with a reported net worth of more than US$1.1 billion.Over time, Wen took more risks, committing his actions to get more loans and finance larger projects. A government "deleveraging" campaign launched under Xi's government to curb excessive risk-taking forced companies to reduce debt and caused stock markets to fade, bringing down the value of Wen's stock. Your lenders started applying for loans.In addition to Wen's problems, the government in 2018 began reversing an initiative that united private investors with local governments to build costly infrastructure projects, citing fears of spendingExcessive. Companies like Wen's were left with unfinished projects and a debt that was maturing quickly.A subsidiary of China Communications Construction Co., a large state contractor for Beijing-led infrastructure projects abroad, slapped and bought a control stake in Beijing OriginWater for more than $440 million. Mr. Wen's share fell to around 10%, from 23%.Now, instead of focusing on the domestic market, Beijing OriginWater says it plans to help facilitate the Belt and Road Initiative of party leadership, a huge infrastructure program promoted by Xi to bring Asian, European and African nations into Beijing's orbit.Several long-standing board members were replaced by designated persons approved by the State-owned Asset Management and Supervision Commission, which regulates and owns majority stakes in large state-owned enterprises, including China Communications Construction.A notice posted on the company's regulator's website late last year, when The China Communications Construction subsidiary began acquiring shares in OriginWater, sets the ratings for project managers. Among them: candidates must reveal their political affiliations and must have an "unwavering fighting spirit."In response to questions, China Communications Construction described the acquisition of Mr. Wen's company as an "alliance of the strong." Wen declined to comment.In an interview with a Chinese weekly, China Times last year, Wen compared state-owned enterprises to trees and private companies to shrubs. "In the future, trees can get bigger and bigger, absorbing more land, water and sunlight," he said. "The shrubs will transform, become a branch of the tree or an grass, and the grass will die."Zhuji Water Group Co., a city government-run water services company in Zhejiang Coastal Province, spent 147 million yuan last year for a 28% stake in Zhejiang Great Southeast Co., a publicly traded plastic packaging company, after that company got into debt trouble.Zhuji's government has been trying to make Zhuji Water a kind of conglomerate by having the company take over hotels, real estate and other assets. His acquisition of the Greater Southeast is also a way for Zhuji Water to be listed, says a company official.Most of the time, however, government officials only want to make sure that large private companies adhere to the state's objectives and policies. To that end, the state is installing more Communist Party committees in corporate offices and encouraging them to play more assertive roles in decision-making.Sanyue Industrial Co, a private electronics manufacturer in the southern city of Dongguan, formed the first party committee in October in the company's 11-year history. He did so after the government told the company he needed it, says company executive Huang Shengying.The committee, which is made up of five party members already working at the company, including two from management, plans to meet often to "study the spirit" of Xi's government policies and speeches, Huang says. "We need to better understand politics to survive. The construction of theparty, we are told, is good for corporate development."Three other private companies in Dongguan also recently established party cells, including an electronics manufacturer, an auto parts manufacturer and a chemical company. A Dongguan official, Zhao Zhijia, calls party committees "red charging stations" and says that "these companies will integrate party construction into their corporate culture. It's a win-win."These party committees often succeed over the decision-making of management and corporate directories. A party cell at Baowu Steel Group, a state-owned company that is China's largest steel producer, held 55 meetings over the past two years and reviewed some 137 commercial and other proposals submitted by management, according to company documents. He reviewed 16 of the proposals before sending them to Baowu's board of directors.He also rejected some, including one related to a fundraising proposal for a subsidiary of the company, saying that the need for more capital was unclear, according to an article published on Baowu's website.The party committee has ordered the company to reserve more funds to help the poor even though profits from Baowu's listed branch declined by 42% the previous year. Eliminating poverty is one of Mr Xi's main policy objectives.Chinese officials say That Xi does not intend to crush entrepreneurship or eliminate market forces. He promised to support the private sector, which contributes half of the government's tax revenue and employs 80% of urban workers.Unlike its predecessors, which constantly expanded the private economy, Xi focuses on attracting entrepreneurs to the party's fold.Chinese officials close to the leadership say Xi's thinking has been influenced by the excesses that arose under predecessors Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, when corruption and environmental degradation were rampant, and by market disruptions that shook Xi in the early years of his rule.Initially, Xi had been open to pushing for market reforms that began in China under Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s. In late 2013, Xi's leadership promised to give market forces a "decisive role." He blessed market-minded regulators who talked about stock investment and relaxed government control over the Chinese currency. His administration even considered a proposal to have professional managers rather than party representatives running state-owned enterprises.One after the other, these reform plans led to chaos. In the summer of 2015, a large wave of stock market sales hit markets and embarrassed Xi. The central bank's decision to release the Chinese yuan further frightened the public.In closed-door meetings with his subordinates, Xi made clear his displeasure, according to officials close to leadership, and unleashed state forces to solve what he saw as market problems.Senior state-sector officials successfully pressured Xi's leadership to eliminate plans to bring more market-oriented managers to state-owned enterprises.Beijing now directly oversees 128 state-owned enterprises. Although that is less than around 140 in 2012, companies have become larger, further invading the private sector, amid consolidationsgovernment-led aimed at creating national corporations. Local governments run thousands more businesses.Until last year, Xu Zhong was head of the research department of China's central bank. It publicly blamed China's poor governance and market distortions at the state's hand in credit allocation, causing private companies to be deprived of financing."The first institutional problem leading to financial chaos is the unclear boundaries between government and the market," he wrote in an article published in December 2017. At a high-level economic forum in February 2019, he called on the government to be held accountable when it reached market reforms.A short time later, he was transferred to a new position outside the central bank at a market trader's association."The field of market reform is practically gone," says an economist advising the government. "By now, it's pretty clear what kind of reform the leader really wants."There was no doubt about the changing winds of September, when Liu He, the leading economic adviser to leadership with a reputation for supporting market reforms, summed up Beijing's plans for the state sector for the next three years."State-owned enterprises," he said, "must become the competitive core of the market."Load-Date: December 11, 2020End of Document

The United States published a list of Chinese and Russian companies with military tiesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 22, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 524 wordsBodyThe Trump administration last Monday published a list of Chinese and Russian companies with alleged military ties banned from buying a wide range of American products and technology.The Reuters agency first reported last month that the U.S. Department of Commerce drew up a list of companies linked to the Chinese and Russian military, leading to Beijing's anger.The document does not include Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), and Arrow Electronics' Hong Kong subsidiaries of Colorado and TTI Inc, based in Texas, a Distributor of Electronic Products of Berkshire Hathaway. These companies were part of the preliminary list to which Reuters had access.The Shanghai Aircraft Research and Design Institute, which designs COMAC aircraft, and Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Co, which in turn manufactures COMAC aircraft, are on the payroll.The final list mentions 103 companies, 14 less than in the preliminary hearing by Reuters last November. Some 58 are associated with China, while 45 are linked to Russia.U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said last Monday that the drafting of the document establishes a new process "to help exporters evaluate their customers for military end-users."The final list was disclosed on the Department of Commerce website and is scheduled to be published for public inspection in the Federal Register on Tuesday.China urged the United States to stop what it considers to be wrong actions and to treat all companies in the same way, the regime's Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a press conference in Beijing.The Trump administration's late-day list publication takes place after dozens of Chinese companies were added to another U.S. commercial blacklist, including the country's leading chip manufacturer, SMIC, and drone developer SZ DJI Technology Co Ltd.Tensions between the United States and China have intensified this year. Trump blamed the regime for the coronavirus pandemic and Asians imposed a national security law in Hong Kong, while a dispute involving the South China Sea intensified.The U.S. government was also increasingly concerned about China's "military-civilian merger," a policy aimed at building its military power and technological development as a whole.The publication of the list may not fall well in China. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in November rated the preliminary list as "un provocative suppression of Chinese companies by the United States."Although COMAC was removed, seven subordinate entities of the Chinese Aviation Industry Corporation (AVIC) remain on the list.General Electric Co and Honeywell International have joint ventures with AVIC and supply COMAC, which leads Chinese efforts to compete with Boeing Co and Airbus.This month, Arrow and TTI denied that their subsidiaries had ties to the Chinese army and ensured that they were working to be removed from any final list.WITH REUTERS INFORMATIONMORE ON THIS TOPIC:U.S. blacklisted Chinese microchip manufacturer SMICUS prosecutors accused Zoom executive of working for Chinese governmentU.S. restricted Chinese officials accused of human rights violations entering the countryLoad-Date: December 23, 2020End of Document

Chinese embassy reacts to Eduardo Bolsonaro and speaks of 'negative consequences'CE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 24, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 722 wordsBodyThe Chinese embassy in Brazil said on Tuesday (24) that Congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro (PSL-SP) follows the United States to slander China and called for the American rhetoric to be abandoned to avoid "negative consequences".The statement, posted on social networks, is a response to publications made on Monday (23) by the deputy, who is chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations and National Defense of the House.                                               Congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro at the Itamaraty Palace in Brasilia - Pedro Ladeira - 20.oct.20/Folhapress                    On Twitter, Eduardo said the Clean Network program, to which Brazil has declared support, aims to protect its participants from intrusions and violations of private information. According to him, the initiative removes technology from China and prevents espionage from the Asian country."This occurs with repudiation of entities classified as aggressive and enemies of freedom, like the Communist Party of China," added the congressman, who later deleted part of the publications.In response, also by Twitter, the asian country's embassy said the deputy accused China of doing cyber espionage and stressed that he defended an initiative that discriminates against Chinese 5G technology."Such unfounded statements are not worthy of the position of chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the House of Representatives. The u.S. dictates on the abusive use of the concept of national security to slander China and shut down the activities of Chinese companies are below. This is totally unacceptable to the Chinese side and we express strong dissatisfaction and vehement repudiation of this behavior," he said.The diplomatic representation also said that China is Brazil's largest trading partner, accounting for 33% of Brazilian exports.According to the embassy, the deputy has produced infamous statements that "undermine the friendly atmosphere between the two countries" and harm the image of Brazil."We urge these personalities to stop following the rhetoric of the American far right, cease misinformation and slander on China and Sino-Brazilian friendship, and avoid going too far on the wrong path in view of the interests of both peoples and the general trend of bilateral partnership. Otherwise, they will bear the negative consequences and bear the historical responsibility of disrupting the normality of the China-Brazil partnership," he said.The embassy said the U.S. has an "indecent track record" on data security. According to the representation, U.S. politicians interfere in the construction of the 5G network in other countries and build lies, in addition to blocking the Chinese giant Huawei.This month, in a gesture against Huawei's participation in the future 5G market, the Government Jair Bolsonaro declared support for the principles of the Clean Network, an American initiative on network security that aims to limit The Chinese presence in the sector.Clean Network is the name of the U.S. plan to exclude the Chinese giant from 5G technology infrastructure in several countries —the auction in Brazil is scheduled for next year.According to industry interlocutors, the principles of the Clean Network are commitments that countries promise to follow in the area of network security. Thus, Brazil's support does not mean huawei's ban, but is a relevant signal that the government intends to follow this path in the future.The U.S. State Department does not use half words to define the goals of the initiative. On its website, U.S. diplomacy says the Clean Network is an approach to protecting citizens' privacy and sensitive information from companies from "aggressive intrusions of evil actors like the Chinese Communist Party."The main u.S. goal is to ban or at least limit the Chinese company's participation in the auction of frequency in Brazil on the grounds that Huawei passes on sensitive information to the Chinese government, which threatens Brazil's data security and cooperation with the U.S.The Minister of Communications, Fábio Faria (PSD), said on Tuesday (24) that 5G networks are a topic of national security, which is why the GSI (Office of Institutional Security) has participated in the talks in the government about the auction of frequency of new technology that should be held next year.Load-Date: November 25, 2020End of Document

In letter, Itamaraty rebukes Chinese embassy in response to Eduardo BolsonaroCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 26, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 654 wordsBodyThe Itamaraty rebuked the Embassy of China for the criticism against Congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro (PSL-SP) and said, in a letter, that the response of the diplomatic mission to the parliamentarian brings content "offensive and disrespectful"."It is not appropriate for diplomatic agents of the People's Republic of China in Brazil to deal with the issues of the Brazil-China relationship through social networks. The diplomatic channels are open and should be used," the foreign ministry said in a letter sent to representatives of the Chinese government in Brazil on Wednesday (25).                                           The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ernesto Araújo, in Brasilia - Marcos Corrêa - 21.nov.20/Presidency of the Republic                    "The treatment of topics of common interest by diplomatic agents of the People's Republic of China in Brazil through social networks is not constructive, creates completely unnecessary frictions and only serves the interests of those who may not wish to promote good relations between Brazil and China. The tone and offensive and disrespectful content of said 'Declaration' harms the image of China with the Brazilian public", follows the message of the Brazilian chancellery.The correspondence was revealed by cnn Brazil.With the letter, Itamaraty responds to the Chinese demonstration against a publication by Eduardo —son of Jair Bolsonaro (no party) and chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee- which linked the Beijing government to data espionage. The congressman highlighted on his social networks on Monday night (23) that Brazil endorsed initiative of the United States to maintain the security of 5G technology "without spying from China"."The Jair Bolsonaro government has declared support for the Clean Network alliance, launched by the Donald Trump administration, creating a global alliance for a secure 5G without spying on China," he wrote."This occurs with repudiation of entities classified as aggressive and enemies of freedom, like the PartyCommunist Of China," he added.The next day, the parliamentarian deleted the post. Still, the Chinese embassy in Brazil responded and argued that Eduardo and other critics of the Asian country should abandon the rhetoric of the American far right, to avoid "negative consequences."The embassy said the deputy accused China of doing cyber espionage and stressed that he defended initiative that discriminates against Chinese 5G technology. "Such unfounded statements are not worthy of the position of chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the House of Representatives," the diplomatic representation said.In correspondence to the embassy, Itamaraty called it "highly inappropriate" for the diplomatic mission to "rule on Brazil's relations with third countries, bearing in mind that the Brazilian Embassy in Beijing does not comment on the people's republic of China's relations with third countries."The Brazilian chancellery also told the Chinese that the government makes sovereign decisions on topics of Brazil's strategic interest. "Mutual respect for their sovereignties is fundamental to the optimal relationships we have developed," the letter concludes.After Eduardo's publication on social media, the Chinese embassy sent a complaint to Itamaraty. This first document was not made public, but the fact that the diplomatic mission published a later statement caused discomfort in the team of Minister Ernesto Araújo.It is not the first time Eduardo has been in a clash with the Chinese embassy in Brasilia. In March, Eduardo compared the coronavirus pandemic to the Chernobyl nuclear accident in Ukraine in 1986. The authorities, then subjected to Moscow, concealed the scale of the damage and adopted emergency measures that cost thousands of lives.?The association made by the parliamentarian in March generated harsh criticism from China's ambassador to Brazil, Yang Wanming.Load-Date: November 27, 2020End of Document

Congressional Research Service Report: 'TikTok: Technology Overview & Issues'Targeted News ServiceNovember 9, 2020 Monday 11:17 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3379 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Congressional Research Service issued the following report (No. R46543) entitled "TikTok: Technology Overview and Issues". Here are excerpts of the report issued on Nov. 2 and written by Patricia Moloney Figliola, specialist in internet and telecommunications policy:TikTok is a globally popular video-sharing smartphone application (app) owned by ByteDance Ltd., a privately held company headquartered in Beijing, China. It is under increasing scrutiny by the U.S. government as a potential privacy and security risk to U.S. citizens. This is because ByteDance, like all technology companies doing business in China, is subject to Chinese laws that require companies operating in the country to turn over user data when asked by the government. Researchers differ over how TikTok data collection compares with other social media apps and whether TikTok poses a threat to the privacy and security of its U.S. users.TikTok launched in the United States in August 2018. The app is available in over 155 countries in 39 languages and has approximately 800 million monthly active users. In the United States, the app has approximately 49 million monthly active users. TikTok's appeal lies heavily on what has been called its "addictive" video feed, For You. The app builds this feed through a "recommendation engine" algorithm built on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and data mining practices. According to the company, the recommendation engine relies on a complex set of weighted factors to recommend content, including hashtags and videos watched previously, as well as the kind of device a person is using.TikTok critics cite problems with how much data TikTok collects from and about its users and with how that data is stored-- and could be shared.On August 6, 2020, President Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at stopping TikTok from doing business in the United States. Once in effect on September 27, 2020 (an extension from the original date of September 20), the order will prohibit any U.S. company or person from "transacting" with ByteDance. On August 14, 2020, the President issued a second Executive Order stating that ByteDance, its subsidiaries, and partners must divest from all assets that support TikTok's operations in the United States and destroy all previously collected U.S. user data. Divestiture may be accomplished by finding a U.S. buyer for TikTok. The requirements are designed to limit the Chinese government's access to current and future data from U.S. TikTok users. ByteDance does not want to divest from TikTok and has sued the Trump Administration.On September 14, 2020, Oracle announced that it had reached an agreement with ByteDance to "serve as [the company's] trusted technology provider" in the United States. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that he had received the proposal. From the terminology used, it appears that the deal may involve a partnership between the two companies rather than a sale. This arrangement would keep the source code of the For You recommendation engine in the hands of ByteDance.It is unclear if this deal satisfies the conditions in President Trump's Executive Orders. Secretary Mnuchin said that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States will review the proposal and present President Trump with its opinion.On September 19, 2020, Oracle announced that Walmart would be joining the TikTok acquisition.On September 27, 2020, Judge Carl J. Nichols of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration order. He stated that while President Trump has broad authority to prohibit business transactions with foreign entities that are deemed to pose a national security risk, TikTok appears to be exempt from such a prohibition because it is a personal communication service, which is protected by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.On October 30, 2020, a federal judge in Pennsylvania granted a preliminary injunction against a series of bans by the U.S.Department of Commerce that were set to go into effect on November 12, 2020. Although TikTok is suing to block its app from being banned, this ruling is from a lawsuit brought by three TikTok creators who worried the ban would prevent them from earning a living. The judge agreed that the videos constitute "informational materials," which are protected by law.Some believe TikTok and other Chinese-owned apps pose a serious security risk to the United States because Chinese companies are subject to China's laws that require compliance with government requests for data. Others believe that TikTok has fallen into "the crosshairs of a global technology battle" based on technology trade protectionism (this concept, also called "techno-nationalism," refers to a country's refusal or reluctance to import other countries' advanced technology, as well as to export, or to allow other nations to benefit from, its own advanced technology).Similar situations may arise in the future with other apps created by foreign companies. Options that Congress may consider include (1) developing an overarching legal and regulatory framework to protect the security and privacy of U.S. citizens' data and communications, and (2) developing a uniform, transparent process to assess and mediate risks posed by foreign apps.* * *Contents:Background ... 1What Is TikTok? ... 1* TikTok's Recommendation Engine ... 2* Data Collection, Storage, and Sharing by TikTok ... 3- Data Collection ... 3- Data Storage ... 4- Data Sharing ... 4White House TikTok Executive Orders ... 4* Prohibiting Transactions with ByteDance ... 5- TikTok Creators Lawsuit ... 5* Requiring Divestiture of ByteDance from TikTok ... 5- ByteDance Lawsuit Against Order to Divest ... 5China's Cybersecurity Law and Export Rules ... 6Status of Potential Oracle and Walmart Partnership with TikTok ... 7Discussion ... 8* Threat to Security ... 8* Technology Trade Protectionism ... 9Related Congressional Activity ... 10* Hearings ... 10* Legislation ... 11Conclusion ... 11Tables:Table 1.

The app is under intense scrutiny by the U.S. government as a potential privacy and security risk to U.S. users. A major concern is that ByteDance is subject to Chinese laws that require companies operating in China to turn over user data when asked to by the national government. On August 6 and August 14, 2020, President Trump signed Executive Orders aimed at stopping U.S. persons and entities from doing business with ByteDance/1 and requiring ByteDance to divest from any holding used to support the operation of TikTok in the United States./2Researchers differ over how TikTok's collection of user data compares with other social media apps and whether TikTok poses a unique threat to the privacy and security of its U.S. users, including many minors.WeChat, another Chinese-owned app, is often mentioned in conjunction with TikTok, but the two apps are quite different. TikTok has a single function--short video--while WeChat has multiple--voice and data messaging, social media, and digital payment. WeChat is used in the United States primarily by the Chinese language community, whereas TikTok is used more widely. On the same day as the TikTok order, President Trump also signed an Executive Order prohibiting any U.S. individual or entity from engaging in any transaction related to WeChat and its owner, Tencent Holdings Ltd./3While issues with the two apps are often conflated, their functions, technical capabilities, and the data collected from their users are different. Only TikTok is discussed in this report. Background information about WeChat is in Appendix.* * *What Is TikTok?On August 2, 2018, U.S. users of the Musical.ly app, a short video service headquartered in Shanghai, China, with a U.S. office in Santa Monica, CA, found that it had been merged into TikTok. Musical.ly had been acquired by ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, in November 2017 for $1 billion as a means to enter the U.S. market. The TikTok app is available in over 155 countries in 39 languages, and has approximately 800 million monthly active users./4In the United States, TikTok has approximately 49 million monthly active users/5 and the company maintains offices in Los Angeles and New York. When ByteDance first released the TikTok app in September 2016, videos could be no longer than 15 seconds, but now users are allowed to link together four 15second segments./6Longer videos recorded outside the app can also be uploaded to the platform. ByteDance is currently estimated to be worth over $100 billion./7The company's core product in China is Toutiao, which means "Headlines." Toutiao began as a mobile news recommendation engine, but has evolved into a platform to deliver content and targeted advertising in other formats as well (e.g., text messages, images, question-and-answer posts, microblogs, videos).TikTok's Recommendation EngineTikTok's appeal relies on what has been called its "addictive" video feed, For You./8The app builds this feed through a "recommendation engine" using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and data mining practices. How each user's feed is constructed had been a tightly held secret until recently. On June 18, 2020, TikTok published a blog post, "How TikTok Recommends Videos #ForYou."/9The company says its algorithm relies on a complex set of weighted factors to recommend content based on user preferences, including hashtags and videos watched; videos "liked," shared, and commented on; as well as the kind of device a person is using. Each user's feed is unique.Table 1 lists the specific factors the company says it uses.Table 1. "For You" Feed Factors and ElementsTable omitted.According to TikTok,[a]ll these factors are processed by our recommendation system and weighted based on their value to a user. A strong indicator of interest, such as whether a user finishes watching a longer video from beginning to end, would receive greater weight than a weak indicator, such as whether the video's viewer and creator are both in the same country. Videos are then ranked to determine the likelihood of a user's interest in a piece of content, and delivered to each unique For You feed.The blog post was seen by most as an effort to provide more transparency to the public as the U.S. government was increasing its scrutiny of the company's practices./10Data Collection, Storage, and Sharing by TikTokCritics, as well as some members of Congress, cite as problematic the amount of data that TikTok collects from and about its users, how that data is stored, and how it could potentially be shared with the Chinese government and used in influence campaigns/11 or against U.S. citizens./12Based on these concerns, both the Democratic and Republican national committees, the Department of Defense, and some private firms, such as Wells Fargo Inc., have banned or discouraged the use of the TikTok app./13Data CollectionAccording to its privacy policy,/14 TikTok collects a range of user information, including location data and internet address, keystroke patterns, and the type of device being used to access the app.The app also collects and stores a user's browsing and search history within the app, as well as the content of any messages exchanged using the app. Additional information can be collected based on user permission: phone number, phone book, and social-network contacts; GPS data; user age; user-generated content (e.g., photos and videos); store payment information; and the videos "liked," shared, watched all the way through, and re-watched. TikTok states that the app collects less personal data than many other apps, such as Facebook and Google, both of which track user activity across devices (TikTok claims that it does not)./15The data that TikTok collects from users appears in many regards to be comparable to what other social media companies gather and use./16Some critics have described TikTok's approach to data mining as aggressive/17 and that its ability to track user behavior while using the app, as well as access to a user's photos, videos, and phone book and geolocation tracking (based on user permissions), means that it can build extremely detailed behavioral profiles of its users that could potentially be shared with the Chinese government./18On August 11, 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported that TikTok avoided privacy safeguards in Google's Android operating system to collect users' mobile device MAC addresses, unique identifiers that allow "the app to track users online," and concealed this activity with an additional layer of encryption before ending the practice after 15 months in November 2019./19Data StorageTikTok claims to store all content created by U.S. users--as well as data about those users--only on servers located within the United States and backed up in Singapore. Those servers are owned or controlled by TikTok, but the company denies that it shares or would share this data with the Chinese government,/20 stating that:The key personnel responsible for TikTok ... are all Americans based in the United States--and therefore are not subject to Chinese law. U.S. content moderation is likewise led by a U.S.-based team and operates independently from China, and, as noted above, the TikTok application stores U.S. user data on servers located in the United States and Singapore./21Data SharingDespite these assertions, TikTok's website says that information can be shared with its parent company in China or other affiliates (usually advertisers), which operate under Chinese law./22Further, a lawsuit filed in federal court in December 2019 asserted that user data was harvested and sent to servers in China./23* * *White House TikTok Executive OrdersPresident Trump has issued two Executive Orders affecting the future of TikTok in the United States, one on August 6, 2020 (E.O. 13942), and another on August 14, 2020 (No number assigned).Prohibiting Transactions with ByteDanceThe August 6, 2020, E.O. 13942 had been set to take effect on September 20, 2020, but that date was extended. The order does not state which specific transactions would be prohibited, but it would likely result in the removal of the TikTok app from Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store in the United States. It could also make it illegal for U.S. companies to purchase advertising on TikTok. Some U.S. TikTok employees have speculated that they would no longer be able to be paid.TikTok Creators LawsuitOn September 18, 2020, TikTok creators Douglas Marland, Cosette Rinab, and Alec Chambers ("plaintiffs") filed a motion to prevent implementation of E.O. 13942. TikTok is suing separately to block its app from being banned, but this lawsuit is based on plaintiffs' assertion that the ban would prevent them from earning a living. The motion was amended by plaintiffs on October 1, 2020. On October 30, 2020, a federal judge in Pennsylvania granted a preliminary injunction in favor of the plaintiffs, stopping the ban that was set to go into effect on November 12, 2020. The judge agreed that the videos constitute "informational materials," which are protected by law.Requiring Divestiture of ByteDance from TikTokOn August 14, 2020, President Trump issued an additional Executive Order, "Regarding the Acquisition of Musical.ly by ByteDance Ltd.,"/24 that imposed additional conditions on the ability of ByteDance to operate TikTok in the United States. The order requires ByteDance and its "subsidiaries, affiliates, and Chinese shareholders" to divest from "any tangible or intangible assets or property, wherever located, used to enable or support ByteDance's operation of the TikTok application in the United States" as determined by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)./25The order also requires ByteDance to destroy all data obtained or derived from either the TikTok or Music.ly apps from U.S. users upon divestiture and certify in writing to CFIUS that it has done so. The order requires these actions within 90 days (November 12, 2020), rather than the 45 days included in the first order, giving ByteDance additional time to find a buyer./26A transfer of ownership and operation of TikTok to a U.S. entity not subject to Chinese laws, including management of collected user data, appears designed to limit the ability of the Chinese government to acquire access to future U.S. user data.ByteDance Lawsuit Against Order to DivestByteDance opposed divestiture from TikTok and, on August 24, 2020, sued the Trump Administration./27In a blog post, TikTok stated that it was "shocked by the recent Executive Order, which was issued without any due process."/28On September 27, 2020, Judge Carl J. Nichols of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration order. He stated that while President Trump has broad authority to prohibit business transactions with foreign entities that are deemed to pose a national security risk, TikTok appears to be exempt from such a prohibition because it is a personal communication service, which is protected by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The ruling did not affect the November 12, 2020, deadline that ByteDance divest from TikTok in the United States./29* * *Content omitted.* * *Related Congressional ActivityCongress began taking an interest in TikTok as early as October 2019, when Senator Marco Rubio reportedly called for a formal investigation into whether TikTok posed a national security risk./58Later that month, Senators Charles Schumer and Tom Cotton sent a letter/59 to the Acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, expressing their concerns about TikTok and the national security risks they believe it poses. More formally, Congress has scrutinized TikTok in two hearings, and Members have introduced three related bills.HearingsThe Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism has held two hearings on, among other topics, the impact of Chinese smartphone apps on U.S. citizens' privacy:* "How Corporations and Big Tech Leave Our Data Exposed to Criminals, China, and Other Bad Actors" was held on November 5, 2019./60* "Dangerous Partners: Big Tech and Beijing" was held on March 4, 2020./61TikTok was invited to testify at these hearings, but declined to appear./62LegislationThree bills have been introduced that would prohibit the use of TikTok and WeChat on U.S. government devices:* S. 4452,/63 is a bill to prohibit federal employees from downloading or using WeChat on government devices. It was introduced on August 5, 2020, by Senator John Kennedy and referred to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs the same day.* S. 3455,/64 the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, was introduced on March 12, 2020, by Senator Josh Hawley. This bill was passed by the Senate on August 6, 2020, and received in the House the following day. (See S.Rept. 116-250./65)* H.R. 6896,/66 also called the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, is the House companion bill to S. 3455. It was introduced on May 15, 2020, by Representative Ken Buck and referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform and the House Committee on Administration the same day.ConclusionThe variety of apps available to U.S. users is enormous. Situations similar to the case of TikTok may arise in the future with other apps created by foreign companies. Congress may consider taking one or both of two parallel approaches to address such situations: (1) developing an overarching legal and regulatory framework to protect the security and privacy of U.S. citizens' data and communications, and (2) establishing a uniform, transparent process to assess the risks posed by foreign apps and establish mechanisms to mediate those risks.* * *REPORT, TABLES and FOOTNOTES: https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46543Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7291052 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: November 10, 2020End of Document

CARDINAL HITS OUT AT GERMAN BROADCASTER AMID ROW OVER CHINESE CATHOLICSStates News ServiceNovember 10, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 908 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Outspoken Hong Kong Cardinal Joseph Zen has hit out at Germany's international broadcaster, Deutsche Welle, after it packaged with his interview an account by DW's religious correspondent of the Vatican's conflicting view of a controversial deal between Beijing and the Vatican over the running of the Catholic Church in China.Zen, who has long been an outspoken critic of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), took issue with the framing of an interview that was aired on the Deutsche Welle website on Oct. 28.He said the organization had invited its religious affairs correspondent to counter his criticism of the deal without informing him that this would happen."After watching it, I was disappointed and angry - the interview turned out to be the first half of the item, and the second half was an interview with 'our religious affairs correspondent'," Zen wrote on his blog on Monday."You ask to interview me ... then you arrange for someone else (who merely parrots the Vatican's words) to counter what I said ... and then you end the item with this, without allowing me to defend myself or explain my views again," Zen wrote."Curious: Is your organization actually funded by the German or Chinese government?" he wrote.Deustsche Welle responded by saying its religious affairs correspondent Martin Gak had been brought in to give "background and context.""His allegations are baseless," Deutsche Welle spokesman Christoph Jumpelt said in comments emailed to RFA. "He was given the opportunity to voice his unedited opinion in the interview.""The fact that we had a journalist give background and context for the benefit of our viewers was absolutely called for in regard of the complexity of the story," the spokesman said.Zen has repeatedly lambasted the Vatican's controversial deal with Beijing on the appointment of bishops, which was struck in 2018 and extended last month.He told Deutsche Welle in the Oct. 28 interview that doing deals with Beijing is "immoral," and that the 2018 deal had left millions of underground Chinese Catholics with no support from Rome, and at the mercy of persecution at the hands of the CCP."[In] the two years since the agreement, things went very wrong, because the underground [church in China] received no support from the Vatican," Zen said."The Holy See doesn't give new bishops to the underground [church]. They give many bishops to the official church ... [they] made them legitimate," he said."And so the underground feels abandoned. Betrayed. Because they [were the ones who stayed] faithful to the authority of the Pope."'Understandable position'His interview was followed by an interview with religious affairs correspondent Martin Gak, who said that the Vatican's position "is actually ... fairly understandable.""They concentrate on engagement because they think that [no agreement] ... leaves the Catholic communities in China at a very serious disadvantage," Gak said."How is the Vatican to calculate how to protect these communities other than to some degree engaging the Chinese Communist Party?" he said."Letting the Chinese government do as they please ... it's no solution at all," Gak said. "It leaves all of those people ... in a very precarious situation."Zen addressed that argument -- which has also been made by the Vatican -- in comments made during his interview."How can they say that a bad agreement is better than no agreement?" he said."A bad agreement is an agreement which is immoral, which is against our faith," Zen told the station."I suspect that [the Vatican] wants to have diplomatic relations re-established, but that's very bad because that's a political thing, not religious," he said.Pope Francis silent on abusesThe controversial deal struck in November 2018 eliminated the division between bishops and churches recognized by the CCP-backed Catholic Patriotic Association and those appointed by Rome.Under the agreement, Rome recognized seven bishops appointed by the Chinese state, and the agreement also saw the founding of a new Catholic diocese in Chengde, in the northern province of Hebei.However, Pope Francis has since remained silent on the mass incarceration of Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in the northwestern Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China and other human rights abuses.The renewal of the deal comes amid a nationwide crackdown on religious worship under CCP general secretary Xi Jinping, who regards Christianity as a dangerous foreign import, with CCP documents warning against the "infiltration of Western hostile forces" in the form of religion.China's ruling party embraces atheism, yet exercises tight controls over any form of religious practice among its citizens, frequently raiding churches, seizing or demolishing their property, and detaining their members and leaders, often because they refuse to join state-sponsored bodies, or because they are becoming too large and prominent.Religious beliefs are increasingly seen by Chinese officials as something that must not be allowed to assume greater importance than CCP rule or Xi's personal brand of political ideology.China is home to an estimated 68 million Protestants, of whom an estimated 23 million worship in state-affiliated churches, and some nine million Catholics, 5.7 million of whom are in state-sponsored organizations.Reported by RFA's Cantonese Service.

While China tracked down Muslims, Alibaba showed customers how they too could do itCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 29, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 600 wordsBodyWhile the Chinese government tracked and persecuted members of predominantly Muslim minority groups, tech giant Alibaba taught his corporate clients how they could play a role.Alibaba's website for its cloud computing business showed how customers could use their software to detect the faces of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in images and videos, according to pages of the site that were discovered by the IPVM publication of the surveillance industry and shared with The New York Times.The feature was incorporated into Alibaba software that helps web platforms monitor digital content for material related to terrorism, pornography and other alert categories, the website explained.The discovery could plunge the Internet giant into the storm of international condemnation surrounding China's treatment of its Muslim minorities.The Chinese government has confined hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and others to indoctrination camps as part of what it calls an anti-terrorism campaign. It has also deployed an extensive surveillance network, using facial recognition and genetic testing,to monitor them. The U.S. government, among others, has denounced the program.It could not be determined whether or how Alibaba customers had used the minority detection tool. But the potential for problematic use is high. For example, a social media platform could automatically mark videos for additional scrutiny, or even alert authorities, if they contain faces that the software predicts to be Uighur.After The Times recently asked Alibaba about the tool, the company edited its website to remove references to the faces of Uighurs and minorities."The mention of ethnicity refers to a feature/function that was used within a test environment during an exploration of our technical ability," an Alibaba Cloud representative said in a written statement. "It was never used outside the test environment."The company refused to say why feature information had been included in the official documentation of its software. He also declined to comment on why he had been testing tools to detect faces of ethnic minorities.In a statement issued after the publication of this article, Alibaba said that he had removed "any ethnic label" from his product offering and that he had felt "dismayed to know" that his cloud division had developed the minority detection feature."We do not allow or allow our technology to be used to target or identify specific ethnic groups," the statement read.Alibaba is a Chinese corporate giant with global reach. It is perhaps Amazon'sonly global peer, a digital commerce giant that has spread to logistics, groceries, retail, and cloud services. Alibaba shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and are owned by large international investors. Global brands such as Nike, Starbucks and Ralph Lauren use their platforms to sell to Chinese buyers. Alibaba is the official cloud services partner for the Olympics. But the Trump administration has seen Chinese tech companies with growing suspicion, particularly those seen as participants in human rights abuses in Xinjiang, thewestern region of China that is home to many Uighurs. Last year theadministration added 28 Chinese entities, including surveillance equipment manufacturers and artificial intelligence companies, to a trade blacklist about concerns about their role in the crackdown. Last month, the White House banned Americans from investing in a list of companies with ties to the Chinese military, a step to cut off Chinese companies' access to U.S. capital markets.© 2020 The New York Times Look too       Load-Date: December 30, 2020End of Document

China threatened Brazil with "negative consequences" over Eduardo Bolsonaro's sayingsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 25, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 772 wordsBodyChina warned Brazil that it could suffer "negative consequences" by calling the statements of MP Eduardo Bolsonaro, who accused the Asian giant of espionage using 5G technology as "infamous". The statement released by the Chinese embassy in Brasilia is a shift in tone towards the South American country, a declared ally of outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump and his rhetoric against Beijing.The son of President Jair Bolsonaro and current chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, meanwhile, deleted the post that sowed discord on Twitter after holding a meeting with the Minister of Communications, Fabio Faría, and advisors of the state-owned National Telecommunications Agency. There the central theme was precisely that of fifth-generation Internet tenders in 2021."We believe that Brazilian society does not adhere to or accept this kind of stance. We urge these personalities to stop following the rhetoric of the American right, to cease misinformation and slander against China and Sino-Brazilian friendship, and to avoid going too far down the wrong path," says the Chinese embassy's statement in Brazil. He adds that "otherwise they will pay with negative consequences and bear historical responsibility for disturbing the normality of the China-Brazil alliance."  https://twitter.com/EmbaixadaChina/status/1331359272450596870  The government of Jair Bolsonaro is reluctant to disclose whether or not it will accept the Chinese company Huawei, installed in the country since 1999, in the 5G tender scheduled for next year. The furious Chinese reaction was due to a social media message from Eduardo Bolsonaro, who said Brazil symbolically adheres to the US "Clean Network" initiative to slow the advance of Huawei, a world leader in the domain of fifth-generation Internet technology."Jair Bolsonaro's government declared support for the Clean Network, launched by the Trump administration, creating a global alliance for a safe, non-espionage 5G from China," said Eduardo Bolsonaro, who added that the Communist Party of China "is an aggressive and enemy entity of freedom."After the Chinese embassy's statement was released, the Brazilian MP deleted his Twitter message. However, Eduardo Bolsonaro kept another part of the message accusing Huawei of "dangerous behavior", without delving into detail.The Chinese embassy warns that "the statement of the MP and other personalities affect relations" between the two countries. Brazil's first trading partner considers that "unfounded" statements lend themselves to opinions from a United States that, among other things, seeks to "slander" its country and harm Chinese companies such as Huawei, which aspires to enter the Brazilian 5G market."That is totally unacceptable to the Chinese side and we express strong dissatisfaction and vehement repudiation of that behavior," the Chinese embassy said, adding that it has already done the "formal management" of the situation through the corresponding diplomatic channels.This is the second time the embassy has reacted against Deputy Bolsonaro. This year he had linked the Chinese government to the coronavirus pandemic. "China's fault is and freedom would be the solution," the son of the far-right president said at the time. In another of his tweets he called the covid-19 "a Chinese virus," echoing Trump's sayings, with whom Jair Bolsonaro always sought to weave alliances.The Chinese ambassador to Brasilia, Yang Wanming, went so far as to say that the MP had a "mental virus", a statement by which Chancellor Ernesto Araújo reacted against China, who in his writings considers Trump the "savior of the planet". Currentchairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, Eduardo Bolsonaro came to be considered as Brazil's possible ambassador to the United States.The statement of the president's son was also repudiated by the sector of the Brazilian right linked to agribusiness. "You can't give more wings to this irresponsible, and the worst thing is that the father doesn't tell him anything. They are putting the country at risk with this insane ideology about 5G and the Chinese vaccine," said Fausto Pinato, president of the Brazil-China Parliamentary Front.

The price the press pays for covering the pandemic in ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 30, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 806 wordsBodyJournalist Zhang Zhan was sentenced to four years in prison for having covered the worst time of the pandemic in Wuhan. The Chinese government thus radicalizes its stance on the press. The signs to China during the coVID-19 health crisis are numerous and diverse. Beyond ethical responsibility when reporting on the virus, Xi Jinping's government has maneuvered at the social, political, economic and technological levels in a way that is at least questionable, taking into account the rights and freedoms that could be compromised. Press repression is a good example. Although not an exclusive problem, efforts to silence voices trying to give a different point of view to the officer are of concern, especially as technological advances seem to have reached a checkpoint over the irreversible population.The last major case is that of Zhang Zhan, one of the freelance journalists who covered the pandemic in Wuhan and who was sentenced to four years in prison this week for allegedly spreading false information on the internet. The contrast of the positions is alarming, for while the Chinese government boasted of its neat and hard work during and after the crisis, Zhan responded silently by listening to the judge. His videos, which he broadcast on social media, revealed chaos in the city's hospitals of 11 million inhabitants, isolated from the world from January 23, 2020 and for 76 days.See more: So is Wuhan Market where covid-19 emergedZhan's drama began in May, when she was arrested and then prosecuted for causing riots. Since June she has been on hunger strike and is forced by force through a nasal probe, according to her lawyers. "Zhan wanted to come and help the people of Wuhan," says one of his lawyers, Zhang Keke, whom the authorities pressured to leave his client. The woman is a harsh critic of Xi Jinping's government. In fact, in a video released a few months ago he said: "The main method of managing the city is threat and intimidation. It's the tragedy of China and Wuhan."The international upheaval has been huge. The United States was one of those who reacted through its secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. "We urge you to release it immediately and unconditionally. The Chinese Communist Party again showed that it will do anything to silence anyone who questions the party's official line, including crucial public health information," he said in a statement. "The EU calls for the immediate release of Mrs Zhang Zhan," said the spokesman for the EU's senior representative for Foreign Policy, Josep Borrell, who extended this demand for a dozen lawyers and human rights defenders who are also in prison in China.The Asian country has been responsible for imposing a surveillance system through complex technological systems that include the use of artificial intelligence and facial recognition. One of the most widely used is the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP), which manages to catalog citizens according to their personal information, including their nationality. Even recent reports published by and, claim that the government is developing systems together with Huawei that identify even the ethnicity of people."The use of facial recognition, both by the police and private agents, has a seismic impact on the way our society is monitored or monitored. The deployment of such intrusive technology not only raises important questions ofprivacy and data protection, but also ethical questions about whether modern democracies should ever allow their use," says british organization Privacy International.See more: Zhang Zhan, the reporter China condemned for its coverage of the pandemicNor can we ignore the strong pressure on journalists and activists in semi-autonomous territories such as Hong Kong. Just last November, Hong Kong's dissident leader Joshua Wong and two other activists were sentenced to prison terms for participating last year in the massive pro-democracy protests and against China's growing influence in former British coloniality. Another prominent name is that of Jimmy Lai, owner of the tabloid, known for his commitment to the pro-democracy movement and for his criticism of the Hong Kong executive, who was arrested earlier this month in a fraud investigation. Finally, there is the case of 12 Hong Kong activists who tried to flee the territory by boat a day after learning of a conviction against them. The European Union (EU) last Tuesday called on China to release them through the High Representative (head of EU diplomacy), Josep Borrell, who called for the "immediate release of these 12 people and their rapid return to Hong Kong". According to the note, the right of these persons to "a fair trial and due process, in accordance with international human rights law and as provided for by The Chinese Criminal Procedure Act, has not been respected".Load-Date: December 31, 2020End of Document

US strikes at the heart of China's bid to become a tech superpowerCNN WireDecember 22, 2020 Tuesday 9:47 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 908 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  China had been counting on its biggest chipmaker to help the country eventually reduce its reliance on the likes of Intel and Samsung. The United States just put those ambitions in jeopardy.Washington announced Friday that it will require US exporters to apply for a license before they can sell to Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC). The US government claims that the chipmaker can use its tech to help China modernize its armed forces. SMIC says it has no relationship with the Chinese military. But in a statement on Sunday, the company acknowledged that while the restrictions are unlikely to hurt its short-term operations, its loftier goals are in doubt. The new US rules will have "a material adverse effect" on its ability to develop highly advanced chips, it said. That's because Washington has said that any request to export tech needed to produce super advanced chips "will be subject to a presumption of denial" --- a major problem for SMIC, which uses American-made software and equipment to create its chips. (The US Department of Commerce defined "super advanced" as any semiconductor smaller than 10 nanometer.)Existing hurdles for SMICSMIC was already facing huge hurdles as it tried to catch up to global competitors. The company remains three to five years behind industry leaders Intel, Samsung and TSMC, which are all capable of producing chips in 7-, 5- and 3- nanometer sizes."We think this is one of many blows to China, limiting its rise as a tech superpower," said Phelix Lee, an equity analyst for Morningstar, in a research note published earlier this month that anticipated US export restrictions. "Although Chinese substitutes have emerged in parts of the supply chain, their specifications are typically two to three generations behind," he pointed out in a separate report published in September.For example, Lee wrote that he thinks it will be hard for SMIC to fully localize production of semiconductors in the 40-nanometer range, let alone ones in the 5-nanometer range that TSMC and Samsung have already commercialized.It's clear that investors are worried about the company's future. SMIC's Hong Kong-listed shares were down 0.9% to close at 18.96 Hong Kong dollars ($2.50) on Tuesday, their lowest value in more than two months. They've lost 4.5% since the US ban was announced.Bailing out SMIC?The pressure from Washington also highlights how important --- and challenging --- it will be for China to find a solution to SMIC's woes. The Global Times, a state-run tabloid, reported Monday that the latest restrictions have "given the Chinese semiconductor sector a sober reminder of the urgency of building a self-controlled industry chain."Lee of Morningstar said he expects China could create more policies supportive of the chipmaking sector. He suggested the government could provide grants for chip research or offer tax breaks for semiconductor equipment.China is already starting to do that: Earlier this month, the government unveiled rules that will allow the country's chipmakers to be exempt from corporate income taxes for several years if they meet certain requirements. And Chinese President Xi Jinping recently said at an economic conference that the country needs to "strengthen China's strategic tech power" so it can break a "foreign stranglehold" on key tech, according to state news agency Xinhua.And analysts at Bernstein wrote in a Sunday research note that they expect China to bail out SMIC, if necessary. More money may not solve the problem created by US tensions, though. SMIC, for example, has already raised billions of dollars this year from state-backed development funds and through a big secondary listing of its shares in Shanghai. But it is still far from being able to manufacture advanced chips without a reliable way to source US equipment. Analysts at the Beijing-based China Securities Corp pointed out Sunday that SMIC's next-generation technology still relies on equipment that it needs to source from a European firm bound by the US export ban.There's also the fact that Washington's pressure on Chinese companies isn't going away. On Monday, the US Department of Commerce added dozens more Chinese firms to a list that will restrict them from buying US goods and technology. Several aviation companies were on the list, suggesting that those supply chains could now face problems, tooChina's Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticized that move on Tuesday, calling it a "serious threat to the security of global industrial chains and supply chains." The United States has "constantly abused export controls and other measures to suppress and contain specific enterprises in other countries," ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters at a regular press briefing.Beijing will have an opportunity to reset relations next month, when President-elect Joe Biden takes office. Observers have said they expect Biden to strike a more diplomatic tone than President Donald Trump, though tensions likely won't evaporate completely. The Bernstein analysts said that ultimately, the Chinese government may need to make other concessions if it wants to ease the pressure on chipmakers."The dire situation that SMIC is in may not be totally reversed, but possibly partially alleviated," they added.--- Jill Disis contributed to this report.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

China Not Sorry for Doctored Pic of Australian Soldier Killing Afghan ChildNewsweek.comDecember 1, 2020 Tuesday 6:06 AM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 890 wordsByline: John FengHighlight: China has doubled down on its position after a controversial tweet by "Wolf Warrior" diplomat Zhao Lijian caused a row between Canberra and its largest trading partner on Monday.BodyChina has refused to apologize after a diplomat in its foreign ministry tweeted a Photoshopped image depicting an Australian soldier killing an Afghan child.Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian pinned the viral tweet after its publication on Monday. It remains live on Twitter with more than 45,000 likes despite an admission from the artist himself that the illustration was "not factual."Beijing doubled down on its position later the same day when foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying rejected Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison's call for an apology."You cited the Australian side's words that the Chinese government should be ashamed. Shouldn't the Australian government feel ashamed that some of its soldiers on official duty in Afghanistan committed such cruelties?" Hua told a Bloomberg reporter, according to a read-out on the Chinese foreign ministry's website.The controversial image, which shows a smiling Australian soldier covering a young Afghan goatherd's face with an Australian flag while slitting the child's throat, was "repugnant," Morrison said.The doctored illustration is underscored by an English caption reading: "Don't be afraid, we are coming to bring you peace!"Morrison described the Chinese diplomat's tweet as "deeply offensive to every Australian," adding that it "diminishes [China] in the world's eyes."His government had contacted Twitter in a bid to have the post removed, he said.Chinese state media publication Global Times, which operates under Communist Party newspaper People's Daily, has run a series of editorials defending the Beijing diplomat and criticizing Canberra for its reaction, in light of last month's damning report by the Australian military into crimes during the war in Afghanistan.Australian special forces unlawfully killed 39 Afghan prisoners of war and civilians, including farmers, according to the Australian Defence Force report, the findings of which were made public. The ADF recommended further criminal inquiries into 19 members of the country's elite troops.Among the recent articles on Global Times' social media pages is a 1,000-word essay by the image's creator, Wuhe Qilin, who admitted he made the picture in Photoshop.The Beijing-based illustrator, who the newspaper had described previously as a "Wolf Warrior artist," also published critical works about the death of George Floyd and the wider Black Lives Matter protests in the United States.Wuhe Qilin, whose real name is unknown, said he found it "hard to believe" that Prime Minister Morrison would take issue with his work, given the Australian military's recent report into alleged human rights abuses in Afghanistan."Of course, the elements and the scene depicted in the illustration were not factual," he wrote in the piece. "In reality, an Australian solder did not stand on an Australian flag and use it to cover the head of a young Afghan holding a lamb."However, Wuhe Qilin insisted the illustration was created "based on facts." He said audiences should not focus on whether the image was real, but instead look at its content.On Weibo, China's Twitter-like microblogging service where Wuhe Qilin has just over 700,000 followers, the artist posted images of Morrison's criticism on Monday and wrote: "I hear Morrison has some opinions about my illustration?"He praised Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao for using his image, which was created on November 23, calling his tweet "mighty."Cautious defenseOn Tuesday, New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern backed Australia, calling the Chinese diplomat's tweet "not factually correct."Ardern said she had "raised concerns with Chinese authorities" but stopped short of further condemnation of China, which is the largest trading partner of both New Zealand and Australia.The row over Zhao's tweet comes amid rising economic tensions between Canberra and Beijing, which began with Australia's call for an independent investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic earlier this year.The Chinese leadership has since taken punitive measures against Canberra, including all but banning coal imports and choking Australia's wine industry by raising tariffs up to 200 percent.In recent months, Beijing has accused Australia and other western nations of following the lead of the U.S. in being tough on China—unfairly, it claims.In separate op-eds this week, Global Times described the Australian prime minister as a "warhound of the U.S.," while calling China a "peace-loving country."Since coming under attack by President Donald Trump over its handling of COVID-19 and its ongoing trade war with Washington, China has embraced social media platforms such as Twitter for its public diplomacy efforts, especially in its attempts to promote Chinese culture, despite its own citizens having no access to the website without the use of government-approved virtual private networks, or VPNs.However, its recent sharp and aggressive stance on issues such as its policies in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, as well as its claim over the self-ruled island of Taiwan, has signaled a shift away from its soft power approach in favor of so-called "Wolf Warrior" diplomacy.The phrase has origins in two nationalist movies titled Wolf Warrior and Wolf Warrior 2. It now describes a diplomatic style defined by confrontational rhetoric.Link to ImageGraphic Zhao LijianGREG BAKER/AFP via Getty ImagesFile photo: Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian, who started a diplomatic row with a tweet featuring a doctored image of an Australian special forces soldier killing an Afghan child.Load-Date: December 1, 2020End of Document

China criticizes Trump suggestion it is behind cyber spyingAssociated Press InternationalDecember 21, 2020 Monday 10:46 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 221 wordsDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) — China’s government on Monday criticized President Donald Trump’s suggestion that Chinese hackers, not Russia, might be behind a cyber espionage campaign against the United States.Trump on Saturday scoffed at assertions by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other officials that the Kremlin was behind attempts to spy on federal agencies. Trump, without offering evidence, said “it may” be China.The foreign ministry said China opposes cyber spying and has crackdown on cyber crime.“The United States has politicized the issue of cybersecurity without conclusive evidence and continuously spread false information and thrown mud at China in an attempt to tarnish China’s image,” said a ministry spokesman, Wang Wenbin.“We hope the United States will take a more responsible attitude on cyber security,” Wang said.China is widely regarded as, along with the United States and Russia, one of the most advanced governments in developing cyber warfare capabilities.The U.S. government charged two Chinese citizens in July with carrying out long-running cyber spying since 2009 aimed at stealing information about coronavirus vaccines, weapons and human rights activists.Chinese military officers and others also have been indicted since 2014 on U.S. charges of carrying out hacking attacks to steal commercial secrets.Load-Date: December 21, 2020End of Document

Chinese regime to judge journalist over reporting on covid-19 in WuhanCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 28, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 636 wordsBodyA "citizen journalist", arrested after completing the establishment of quarantine in Wuhan earlier this year, was to be tried on Monday in Shanghai, a year after the covid-19 epidemic broke out in that city in central China.Zhang Zhan, 37, could be sentenced to five years in prison, while the communist regime tries to make it forget that the new coronavirus appeared on its territory in late 2019.The defendant has been on hunger strike since June and has been forced by nasal intubation, according to her lawyers.A dozen foreign diplomats and supporters of this former lawyer hoped to enter the Shanghai courthouse, where the process was due to begin at 09H30 local (01H30 GMT), but police prevented them from passing through, as well as journalists.Zhang, a native of Shanghai, traveled in February to Wuhan, at the time prey to the epidemic, and disseminated on social media reports, most of them about the chaotic situation that hospitals were going through.According to the official balance sheet, nearly 4,000 covid-19 deaths were recorded in the metropolis of 11 million inhabitants, or nearly all of the 4,634 deaths counted across China between January and May.China's initial response to the epidemic has been criticized, as Beijing did not quarantine Wuhan and its region until 23 January, even though there had been cases since early December 2019.At the same time, doctors who mentioned the appearance of a mysterious virus were interrogated by police, who accused them of "spreading rumors."Zhang was arrested in May, accused of "provocation of riots," a terminology often used against opponents of President Xi Jinping's regime, according to a court note to which the AFP had access.In the articles he disseminated online, Zhang denounced the confinement imposed in Wuhan and referred to a "serious violation of human rights". Three other citizen journalists, Chen Qiushi, Fang Bin and Li Zehua, were also arrested after completing these events. The AFP failed to contact its lawyers.On the other hand, human rights watch (HRW) told the Chinese authorities this Saturday to intensify the arrests of journalists and activists reporting "on the covid-19 pandemic or other issues or criticize the government." According to an HRW statement issued in New York, Chinese authorities have carried out further arrests of journalists and activists "without providing credible information suggesting that these individuals have committed legally recognizable crimes""Stopping journalists and activists won't make China's real problems go away," HRW's asia researcher Yaqiu Wang said in the note. For Wang, "the Chinese government seems to have learned nothing from its crackdown on information after the covid-19 outbreak."In this regard, the human rights organization states that "the Chinese authorities have sought to control the narrative of the coronavirus pandemic by silencing independent reporters, along with the use of specialized software, 'trolls' and Internet censors."HRW collects in his note the detention of three people, activist Ou Biaofeng and journalists Hze Fan, who works for Bloomberg agency, and Du Bin, a contributing photographer for The New York TImes newspaper. "Since the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan in late 2019, Chinese authorities have also arrested a number of activists and citizen journalists for independently reporting on the pandemic," said the NGO, which said that while some have been released, othersremain under arrest or their situation has not been made public.With AFP informationMORE ON THIS TOPIC:A journalist missing for reporting the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan could be under strict surveillance by the Chinese regimeBloomberg journalist was arrested by Chinese regime in BeijingHuman Rights Watch reported that China increased arrests of covid-19 reportersLoad-Date: December 29, 2020End of Document

Campaign for Accountability: TTP Investigation - Apple is Censoring Political Apps in Its China App StoreTargeted News ServiceDecember 24, 2020 Thursday 9:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 680 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON Body(TNSRes) -- Campaign for Accountability issued the following news release on Dec. 23:Campaign for Accountability (CfA), a nonprofit watchdog group that runs the Tech Transparency Project (TTP), released a report questioning Apple's role in the censorship of politically sensitive apps on its China App Store. Although the company claims that the majority of apps removals in the Chinese market were related to apps deemed illegal under Chinese law, including porn and gambling apps, a review by TTP found that nearly a third of all apps missing from the China App Store relate to hot button topics blocked by China's censors, including privacy tools, Tibetan Buddhism, Falun Gong, and the Hong Kong protests.Read the report: https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/apple-censoring-its-app-store-chinaCfA Executive Director Michelle Kuppersmith said, "The number of apps that Apple says it removes from China each year doesn't line up with the much longer list of apps that are missing in China but commonly found in other markets. This inconsistency shows that a large number of politically sensitive apps are being pulled back from the China App Store. Apple should answer for this discrepancy."TTP's analysis of censorship on Apple's China App Store is based on data made available by Great Fire, an advocacy group that monitors censorship in China by comparing the availability of certain apps in Apple's app stores around the world. TTP independently verified Great Fire's raw data and determined that 964 of the 3,257 apps identified as missing from the China App Store relate to politically sensitive topics of religion, LGBTQ issues, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet, secure communications, cryptocurrencies, VPNs, social media platforms, and foreign media. Just 5% of apps unavailable on the China App Store, but accessible on others, related to porn or gambling.Apple often justifies its censorship in different markets across the world by saying it is simply complying with local laws. While some politically sensitive apps were removed at Beijing's request, it remains unclear why other apps were removed.Apple releases bi-annual transparency reports, which disclose data and takedown requests from various countries. But Apple does not disclose if it has removed any apps voluntarily before a government intervenes. The public disclosures appear to omit thousands of apps that are missing from the company's China App Store, suggesting Apple may have taken them down proactively to protect its relationship with China.From July 2018 to June 2019, Apple disclosed that it had removed 805 applications at the request of the Chinese government. It is rare for countries other than China to ask Apple for the mass removals of applications. The United States did not request for any apps to be removed during that time period. Of the 96 countries included in Apple transparency reports, 10 other governments requested app removals--none to the extent of China. The next closest country was United Arab Emirates with 275 requests and one removal.While other major tech companies have withdrawn their business operations from China after refusing to comply with the country' authoritarian rules, Apple has not. The company has embraced China as its third largest market and relies on China for much of its supply chain - while claiming publicly to champion free speech and human rights. Ironically, Apple recently expressed public opposition to the United States government's efforts to ban Chinese-owned apps WeChat and TikTok from the U.S., despite the fact that it routinely carries out this same type of app censorship on behalf of China.Ms. Kuppersmith continued, "If Apple is choosing to soften its opposition to censorship in order to compete in the Chinese market, it should be transparent about that decision. Espousing positive corporate values only in areas where those values are accepted is simply opportunism."[Category: Political]Contact: Michael Clauw, 202/780-5750, mclauw@campaignforaccountability.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7337232 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 24, 2020End of Document

Australian PM says China coal ban would breach WTO rulesAssociated Press InternationalDecember 15, 2020 Tuesday 9:34 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; INTERNATIONAL NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 518 wordsByline: ROD McGUIRK, Associated PressDateline: CANBERRA, Australia BodyCANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australia’s prime minister said Tuesday that China would be violating World Trade Organization rules and a bilateral free trade agreement if it banned Australian coal.Prime Minister Scott Morrison was replying to a report in China’s state-owned Global Times newspaper that said Beijing's main planning agency had given power plants approval to import coal without restrictions, except for Australian coal.Morrison said he was treating the report as “media speculation” because the Chinese government had yet to clarify its position.“If that were the case, then that would obviously be in breach of WTO rules,” Morrison told reporters. “It would be obviously in breach of our free trade agreement and so we would hope that’s certainly not the case.”China has targeted various Australian exports as relations with the country have deteriorated after Australia called for an independent inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic.Asked about the report, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin gave no specifics but said China had “recently taken measures against some imported Australian products in accordance with law and regulations."China has consistently said Australia is entirely responsible for disruptions in economic and political ties motivated by what it sees as anti-Chinese bias among Australian politicians, civic leaders and media outlets.Wang said China would “never accept" accusations of unfair trade practices, and accused Australia of having politicized bilateral exchanges in trade, investment, science and technology, while targeting Chinese companies with increased security checks on investments.“We hope that the Australian side will reflect on itself, be consistent with its words and actions, and effectively provide good conditions and atmosphere for China-Australia practical cooperation in various fields, rather than the other way around," Wang told reporters at a daily briefing.China's pique has pitted Australia’s most important trading relationship against its alliance with the U.S., which has rolled out increasingly harsh measures against Beijing over trade, technology and human rights.Beijing's grievances against Australia range from accusations of Chinese meddling in Australian politics to the barring of tech giant Huawei and the government's push for an independent investigation into the pandemic that is believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.Coal and iron ore, Australia’s most lucrative exports, appear to have suffered due to Chinese barriers, while wine, lumber and other products have also seen their Chinese markets reduced.Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said Australia was close to finalizing a complaint to the World Trade Organization over Chinese tariffs imposed on barley.“We see these reports and obviously are deeply troubled by them,” Birmingham told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. referring to the reported coal import ban.“They, if true, would indicate discriminatory trade practices being deployed by Chinese authorities and we would urge them to rule that out swiftly,” he added.Load-Date: December 15, 2020End of Document

And on 5 January, WHO continued to say that there was "no evidence of significant human-to-human transmission" of the virus. In January it was first confirmed that the virus had spread outside China, when a 61-year-old woman was found to be infected in Thailand. China has always denied accusations of cover-up.Since the beginning of the pandemic, China has denied access to independent international researchers to determine what happened in Wuhan and above all to know why it took time to report on the lethality of the virus. WHO has been left in the spotlight for being pressured by the Chinese regime when COVID-19 emerged.At the beginning of the epidemic, the regime even wanted to hold the United States accountable for the transmission of the virus. In fact, in recent days Beijing has tried to install a new narrative about the origin of the virus: it has said that the disease did not - was not born in Wuhan, Hubei Province, butoriginated in other latitudes and other countries that exported it to that region. More precisely, they ensured that the virus that causes COVID-19 disease was transported by packets of frozen food that were exported there.MORE ON THIS TOPIC:Now China wants to impose a new version of the origin of the coronavirus: what are the countries designated by Xi Jinping's regimeChina wants to erase Wuhan as epicenter of coronavirus and has already started doing soLoad-Date: December 28, 2020End of Document

Chinese court jails journalist for COVID-19 reportsStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeDecember 28, 2020 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 456 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyNearly a year after the world first heard of the novel coronavirus which has been the defining event of the year, Chinese authorities have jailed a Chinese citizen-journalist who traveled to Wuhan last February tolive stream videos from the city where the pandemic first broke out.Zhang Zhan, 37, was convicted at theShanghai Pudong New Area People's Court on Monday of "picking quarrels and provoking trouble", the South China Morning Post reported, citing one of her lawyers. She had faced up to five years on the charge, which authorities regularly use to detain activists and other dissidents.Police attempt to stop journalists from recording footage outside theShanghai Pudong New District People's Court, where Chinese citizen journalistZhang Zhan - who reported on Wuhan's Covid-19 outbreak and placed under detention since May - is set for trial.Zhang is the first to face trial of a group of four citizen journalists detained by authorities earlier this year after reporting from Wuhan.Zhang, a former lawyer, had travelled to Wuhan in early February to chronicle the chaotic early stages and residents' experiences of the coronavirus outbreak.Her livestreaming and reports were widely shared on social media in February, bringing her to the attention of the Chinese authorities.Zhang Zhan was arrested last May after her videos and reports from Wuhan attracted millions of viewers who had been looking for authentic reports on what was going on in the city amid very limited information provided by the Chinese government back then.

Mourão criticizes China embassy for using social networks to hit Eduardo BolsonaroCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 27, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 509 wordsBodyVice President Hamilton Mourão criticized on Friday (27) the Embassy of China for having used social networks to rebut the speeches of Congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro (PSL-SP), arguing that "diplomatically is wrong" and that exchange of accusations in the networks can turn into a "carnival".Mourão also said that it would not be up to him to comment on the posture of the parliamentarian, son of President Jair Bolsonaro (no party). However, he stated that because he deleted the post in which he accused the Chinese government of espionage, he probably received some recommendation from the government.                                               Vice President Hamilton Mourão, next to President Jair Bolsonaro, during an event at the Planalto Palace in Brasilia - Evaristo Sá - 9.nov.20/AFP                        "This is the second time the Chinese ambassador has reacted in this way. Within the conventions of diplomacy, the comrade feeling uncomfortable with anything that has happened in the country, he writes a letter to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and goes to Itamaraty and presents his considerations, not via social networks or else turns into a carnival", he added.Mourão was then asked if the Presidency gave any guidance to the president's son to reduce the tone of criticism, to avoid escalating the crisis. "I think the deputy, when he posted and then deleted it, I think he must have received some recommendation to remove that."The incident involving the president's son and the Chinese diplomatic representation in Brazil began on Monday, following a social media post by Eduardo Bolsonaro.The deputy, chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations and National Defense of the House, wrote on his social networks that Brazil would ally itself with the StatesUnited to maintain the security of 5G technology —whose auction in Brazil is expected to be at the beginning of the year—"without spying on China.""This occurs with repudiation of entities classified as aggressive and enemies of freedom, like the Communist Party of China," he added.The next day, the parliamentarian deleted the post. Still, the Chinese embassy in Brazil responded and suggested to Eduardo and other critics of the Asian country to abandon the rhetoric "of the American far right" to avoid "negative consequences.""Such unfounded statements are not worthy of the position of chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the House of Representatives," the diplomatic representation said.Itamaraty later rebuked the Chinese embassy for its criticism of the president's son and said in a statement that the diplomatic mission's response to the parliamentarian brings "offensive and disrespectful" content."It is not appropriate for diplomatic agents of the People's Republic of China in Brazil to deal with the affairs of the Brazil-China relationship through social networks," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a letter sent to representatives of the Chinese government in Brazil on Wednesday (25)."Diplomatic channels are open and should be used."Load-Date: November 28, 2020End of Document

Chinese tech companies fall fear for research to AlibabaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 28, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 532 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a second day of frantic sales among China's largest technology companies, driven by fears that antitrust scrutiny will extend beyond Jack Ma's empire, and impact the country's most powerful companies.Alibaba and its three biggest rivals - Tencent Holdings Ltd., food delivery giant Meituan and JD.com Inc. - have lost nearly $200 billion in two sessions since Thursday, when regulators revealed an investigation into alleged monopolistic practices at Ma's firm. This marked the formal beginning of the Communist Party's repression not only against Alibaba but possibly also against the broader and increasingly influential technology sector."It is very difficult to predict the outcome of the Chinese government's ongoing investigation of Alibaba and other large consumer internet platforms," Colin Sebastian, Baird's analyst, wrote in a note, which lowered its indicative price for Alibaba shares listed in the United States from US$325 to US$285, on the basis of "uncertainty around government oversight and the possibility of direct regulatory action next year."China's central bank on Sunday ordered Ma's other online titan, Ant Group Co., to return to its payment service roots and restructure adjacent companies, ranging from insurance to money funds, which led to the possibility of eventual division.Having been hailed as the icons of China's economic and technological supremacy, Alibaba and his compatriots now face increasing pressure from speed-conscious regulators with which they are accumulating influence in sensitive areas such as media and education and gaining influence on the daily lives of hundreds of millions of people. These concerns materialized in November, when regulators canceled Ant's initial $35 billion public offering before revealing a draft standards enshrining broad powers to suppress anti-competitive practices in sectors such as e-commerce and social media."The Chinese government is exerting more pressure or wants more control over technology companies," Jackson Wong, director of asset management at Amber Hill Capital Ltd., said in a telephone interview. "There is still a lot of sales pressure in companies like Alibaba, Tencent or Meituan. These companies have been growing at a rate that Beijing considers too fast and have too significant scales."It is unclear what concessions Alibaba's regulators might try to obtain. Under existing antitrust law - which is now being revised to include the internet industry for the first time - Beijing can sanction offenders on up to 10% of their income. In Alibaba's case, that could mean a tax of up to $7.8 billion.China's e-commerce leader on Monday raised a proposed stock repurchase program by US$4 billion to $10 billion, in force for two years until the end of 2022. But the repurchase program was overwhelmed by fears that the measures taken against Ant will be just the tip of the iceberg. While the central bank did not ask for the company's division, the financial services giant must now submit specific measures and a timetable for reviewing its business.Original Note:Alibaba Probe Stirs Global Worry, $200 Billion China Tech Rout©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: December 29, 2020End of Document

SMIC ban by the USA will affect advanced chip developmentStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeDecember 23, 2020 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 449 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyWith the trade list of some companies coming to other countries in the U.S., especially those of which are from China being restricted in the nation, most of the companies listed are seeing a ban of their products being shipped and sold to the US.The US minimum wage ban is a blow to the Chinese government which is working to make the country self-sufficient in semiconductor manufacturing and the company is leading the campaign. Its products were banned, and the companies that utilize U.S. technology were prohibited from selling their products to Huawei.The ban primarily focuses on blocking the export of USA technology to the drone-maker. It is not news that the company which suffered the most in this Trade War is the Chinese tech giant Huawei."China's corrupt and bullying behavior both inside and outside its borders harms USA national security interests, undermines the sovereignty of our allies and partners, and violates the human rights and dignity of ethnic and religious minority groups, Commerce will act to ensure that America's technology-developed and produced according to open and free-market principles-is not used for malign or abusive purposes". Since the supply chain is disrupted, it will be nearly impossible to sell DJI drones in the US stores, especially if China retaliates similarly. The US commerce department stated that DJI "enabled wide-scale human rights abuses within China through abusive genetic collection and analysis or high-technology surveillance".Brentford beat Newcastle to record another EFL Cup upsetCanos pulled his cross back into the path of Dasilva and his volley flashed past Newcastle keeper Karl Darlow. Access exclusive podcasts, interviews and analysis with a monthly or annual membership.DJI's name came into the entity list because the other Chinese company that manufactures semiconductors - Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation has specifically been scrutinized for its alleged ties with the Chinese military.From the development, it appears that the United States is determined to thwart any efforts by China or Chinese companies to procure components for advanced technologies. While Trump's executive order cited a national security risk, no evidence to support this claim has been produced. He then took similar measures to block TikTok and WeChat from being hosted in USA app stores.Phantom, although being an entry-level drone model was greatly received by the consumers due to its user-friendly characteristic compared to the other available drones in the market during the time span of its release. And as we all know, European nations still use Huawei technology in their telecommunication infrastructure.Load-Date: December 24, 2020End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 29 of 370China Home Appliances Markets, 2020-2026: Subsidy by the Chinese Government, Initiatives of Chinese Companies, COVID-19 Impact  Page 34 of 370Justice Department: China Initiative - Year-in-Review for 2019-2020  Page 38 of 370US prosecutors accused Zoom executive of working for Chinese government  Page 42 of 370CSIS: 'Assessing the Impact of U.S.-China Technology Competition and Decoupling - Focusing on 5G'  Page 44 of 370Chinese authorities detain Bloomberg news assistant  Page 49 of 370China looms as Biden's biggest foreign policy challenge.
