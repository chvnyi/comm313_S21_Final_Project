Bel Reports First Quarter 2020 ResultsGlobeNewswireMay 1, 2020 Friday 4:30 AM PTCopyright 2020 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: EARNINGS RELEASES AND OPERATING RESULTSLength: 3098 wordsBodyJERSEY CITY, N.J., May  01, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bel Fuse Inc. (Nasdaq: BELFA and BELFB), a designer, manufacturer and provider of products that power, protect and connect electronic circuits, today announced preliminary financial results for the first quarter of 2020.First Quarter 2020 Highlights• Net sales of $104.0 million, down 17.1% from Q1-19• Gross profit margin of 24.2%, down from 24.5% in Q1-19• Net loss of $3.8 million, as compared with net earnings of $1.1 million in Q1-19• CUI acquisition in December 2019 contributed $8.2 million to Q1-20 sales at a gross profit margin of 36.8%• Backlog of $191.2 million at March 31, 2020, up 19% from year-end• Cash flow provided by operating activities of $8.1 millionNon-GAAP financial measures, such as Non-GAAP net earnings, Non-GAAP EPS, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, exclude the impact of acquisition-related costs and restructuring charges. Please refer to the financial information included with this press release for reconciliations of GAAP financial measures to Non-GAAP financial measures and our explanation of why we present Non-GAAP financial measures.CEO CommentsDaniel Bernstein, President and CEO, said, "Our focus during much of the first quarter has been on the continued safety and well-being of our associates around the world in light of COVID-19.  The majority of the products manufactured by Bel are utilized in military, medical and networking applications, and are therefore deemed essential by the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We have implemented significant protective measures throughout our facilities, including travel and visitor restrictions, work from home policies, employee screenings, social distancing and use of face coverings as we continue to service our customers.  While this remains a fluid situation that evolves daily, as of today, we are pleased to report that all of our manufacturing sites are operating, with the majority of them at or near normal production rates.  I want to extend a sincere thank you to the manufacturing associates in each of Bel's factories around the world who continue to come to work each day with courage and dedication to our Company and our customers.  "Our first quarter financial results reflect the extended closure of our facilities in China earlier in the quarter due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the related impact to our supply chain.  This led to a portion of scheduled shipments being deferred to the second quarter, and cost approximately $14-$17 million in first quarter sales.  In addition to the effects from such deferred shipments, the Company also incurred additional indirect COVID-19 related costs, including operational inefficiencies and employee retention programs in the quarter.  These costs were partially offset by COVID-19 relief funding received from the Chinese government during the quarter."We've seen positive signs in Bel's underlying business as we enter the second quarter.  Orders received in the first quarter of 2020 were the highest since the third quarter of 2018, indicating that the excess inventory in the supply channel from 2019 has been worked through, and our customers and distribution partners are starting to place replenishment orders again.  Further, our acquisition of CUI in late 2019 was accretive to Bel's earnings during the first quarter, generating $8.2 million in sales and contributing $865,000 of operating income.  CUI bookings during the first quarter were over $11 million, one of their highest booking quarters in history, which was a contributing factor to Bel's consolidated book-to-bill ratio of 1.3 for the first quarter. Based on the above factors, we currently anticipate an improvement in sales and financial results in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter.  However, beyond the second quarter, we have limited visibility due to the evolving COVID-19 environment." concluded Mr. Bernstein.Financial SummaryAll comparative percentages are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted.First Quarter 2020 ResultsNet SalesNet sales were $104.0 million, down $21.4 million, or 17.1%, from last year's first quarter.• By geographic area: Europe sales were down by 22.3%, North America sales declined by 7.8% and Asia sales were lower by 29.8%.  • By product segment: Connectivity Solutions sales declined by 11.9%, Magnetic Solutions sales were lower by 24.8% and Power Solutions and Protection sales were down by 15.6%.Gross ProfitGross profit margin decreased to 24.2%, from 24.5% in the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to the lower sales base in the first quarter of 2020, resulting in lower fixed cost absorption within cost of sales.  The financial impact of the extended Lunar New Year holiday and other operational inefficiencies at our facilities in Asia related to COVID-19 was largely offset by $2.2 million of stimulus funding received from the Chinese government during the first quarter of 2020 associated with COVID-19 relief programs.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A)SG&A expenses were $22.1 million, up $2.8 million from the first quarter of 2019. Included within SG&A expenses is a loss on the cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance (COLI) policies of $2.0 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to a gain on these policies of $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2019.  Excluding the effects of market fluctuations of our COLI policies, SG&A expense was largely the same in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019, as incremental SG&A expense from the recently acquired CUI business were offset by lower travel expense and other cost containment efforts.Operating (Loss) IncomeOperating (loss) income was $(3.1) million, down from $3.4 million in the first quarter of 2019, with an operating margin of -3.0% compared to 2.7% in the first quarter of 2019.Income TaxesThe provision (benefit) for income taxes was $(0.8) million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to less than $0.1 million in the same period of 2019.  This resulted in an effective tax rate of 16.9% during the first quarter of 2020, compared to an effective tax rate of 3.3% during the same quarter last year.  The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 reflects a reduction in GILTI tax as compared to the same quarter of 2019, as well as tax benefits recognized from federal legislation (the CARES Act) and adjustments to valuation allowances in the first quarter of 2020.   Net (Loss) EarningsThe above factors resulted in net loss of $(3.8) million in the first quarter of 2020 as compared with net earnings of $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2019.Balance Sheet DataAs of March 31, 2020, working capital was $188.2 million, including $68.4 million of cash and cash equivalents with a current ratio of 3.5-to-1.  In comparison, as of December 31, 2019, working capital was $193.0 million, including $72.3 million of cash and cash equivalents with a current ratio of 3.1-to-1.  Total debt at March 31, 2020, net of deferred financing costs, declined to $135.1 million as compared to $143.7 million at December 31, 2019, primarily due to a voluntary prepayment of $8.2 million made in connection with the amendment to the Company's credit agreement in February 2020.Conference CallBel has scheduled a conference call at 11:00 a.m. ET today.  To participate in the conference call, investors should dial 888-394-8218, or 323-794-2590 if dialing internationally.

Actual results could differ materially from Bel's projections. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements are: the market concerns facing our customers; the continuing viability of sectors that rely on our products; the impact of public health crises (such as the governmental, social and economic effects of COVID-19); the effects of business and economic conditions; difficulties associated with integrating previously acquired companies; capacity and supply constraints or difficulties; product development, commercialization or technological difficulties; the regulatory and trade environment; risks associated with foreign currencies; uncertainties associated with legal proceedings; the market's acceptance of the Company's new products and competitive responses to those new products; the impact of changes to U.S. trade and tariff policies; and the risk factors detailed from time to time in the Company's SEC reports. In light of the risks and uncertainties impacting our business, there can be no assurance that any forward-looking statement will in fact prove to be correct. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Non-GAAP measures identified in this press release as well as in the supplementary information to this press release (Non-GAAP net earnings, Non-GAAP EPS, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA) are not measures of performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").  These measures should not be considered a substitute for, and the reader should also consider, income from operations, net earnings, earnings per share and other measures of performance as defined by GAAP as indicators of our performance or profitability. Our Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly-titled captions of other companies due to differences in the method of calculation.  We present results adjusted to exclude the effects of certain unusual or special items and their related tax impact that would otherwise be included under U.S. GAAP, to aid in comparisons with other periods.  We may use Non-GAAP financial measures to determine performance-based compensation and management believes that this information may be useful to investors.Website InformationWe routinely post important information for investors on our website, www.belfuse.com, in the "Investor Relations" section. We use our website as a means of disclosing material, otherwise non-public information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.

Hong Kong pro democrats mobilize against Beijing and Stock Exchange falls by 5.5%CE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 22, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 646 wordsBodyHong Kong, 22 May (EFE).- Several pro-democracy associations in Hong Kong today showed their rejection of Beijing's intentions to establish a number of legal mechanisms that could result in the limitation of its freedoms, which has not sat well on the Stock Exchange, with a 5.56% drop at the close.The Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), which has organized the largest demonstrations in Hong Kong, described as "an atomic bomb" on the semi-autonomous city the proposed National Security Act submitted to the National People's Assembly (ANP, Parliament), which today began its annual meeting in Beijing.This proposed law would seek - according to the chairman of the ANP Standing Committee, Wang Chen - to prohibit "any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People's Government, theft of state secrets, prohibition of the organization of activities in Hong Kong by foreign political organizations, and prohibition of the establishment of ties with foreign political organizations by Hong Kong political organizations."All this with the aim of "safeguarding national security" after almost a year of pro-democracy mobilizations that have staggered into the Hong Kong economy and left harsh images of clashes between the police and some violent protesters.NEW MANIFESTATIONS IN THE FUTUREThrough its profile on the social network Facebook, the CHRF asked its followers to take to the streets to oppose this law and showed their intention to bring together "more than two million people" in a demonstration dated to be defined.Safety clearance measures to prevent sarS-CoV-2 coronavirus contagions are prevailing in Hong Kong, although small-scale protests have continued to occur.Today, for example, there was a small pro-democracy demonstration of the Chinese Government Liaison Office in Hong Kong that was intercepted and dispersed by the local police.From another pro-democracy organization, Demosisto, they called for "the greatest of wills" to oppose this "shocking law.""We don't have to give up," they urged their supporters.For Amnesty International, the proposal poses "an almost existential threat to the rule of law in Hong Kong" and an attack on human rights in the semi-autonomous city.In addition, news from Beijing cast even more uncertainty about the Hong Kong parquet, which was a dire day, with a 5.56% drop at the close.THE HONG KONG GOVERNMENT, ACCORDING TO PEKINFor her part, the controversial head of the Hong Kong Executive, Carrie Lam, showed her full support for Beijing's decision."Once the draft is approved, the Hong Kong Administration will cooperate fully with the ANP Standing Committee to complete the legislative process, comply with our obligation to protect national security and ensure Hong Kong's long-term prosperity under (the principle of) 'One country, two systems'," she said.Article 23 of the Basic Law (Hong Kong's mini-constitution) stipulates that the city must be provided with security legislation in line with what Beijing outlined, but it has always been extremely controversial among the Hong Kong population, an important segment of which it has even resisted its debate for fear of a reduction in freedoms.Among the seven proposed articles is a provision proposing a legal mechanism that allows the ANP Standing Committee to articulate legislation to prevent and punish a number of cases, including "subversion against state power", an accusation frequently used against human rights defenders in China.The 1984 Sino-British Declaration, which servedto agree to the retreat of Hong Kong from British hands to Chinese in 1997, it established maintenance for 50 years from that date of a number of freedoms in this unimaginable territory in mainland China.However, since China's Foreign Ministry, its spokespersons have said on numerous occasions that this document was already fulfilled at the time.Load-Date: May 23, 2020End of Document

Thoughts on COVID-19 from a student living in an authoritarian regimeThe Columbia Spectator: Columbia UniversityApril 30, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 914 wordsByline: Senem YurdakulBodyAfter I read about signs saying "Live Free Or Die", or "Isolation of the Healthy is Tyranny" held by the U.S. protestors, my naïve belief that the world was harmoniously united in this fight against the pandemic quickly dissipated. In Dubai, where I currently live, residents were forced to go into a three-week complete lockdown. During this time, we weren't allowed to go outside without permission at all-we had to request permits to go outside for grocery shopping, hospital appointments, and even emergency situations. There was a fine of 2,000 dirhams-around $544-for being outside without a permit, and residents faced deportation or imprisonment for breaking the quarantine rules.Yet, it didn't seem like anyone felt that they were living under tyranny. Most residents considered these strict policies enforced by the government proof of its trustworthiness and ability to contain the outbreak. Instead of fearing the authoritarian regime I live under, I now find myself trusting it. And although I don't find authoritarianism right under any circumstances, I asked myself whether living under such a regime was actually safer than living under a democratic one, such as the United States, in facing a threat like a global pandemic. The answer I've come to is complicated.In our classrooms at Columbia, we discuss democracy and authoritarianism as conceptual issues, as theories, as principles, which we may or may not agree with. But when it comes to the tangible realities of these systems during crises like the pandemic, we see that both regimes come with their own set of advantages and disadvantages that have an unprecedented and perhaps unimaginable impact on our lives. This pandemic teaches us that a regime itself may not be a determining factor in how well countries have been able to contain the virus, but rather policy implementation and public trust.It seems that authoritarian governments have the advantage of implementing and enforcing policies more quickly and forcefully. As dangerous and tyrannical as this attribute can be in times of regularity, the level of control that comes with the dynamics of authoritarian governments has allowed a firm establishment of policies necessary for containing the outbreak. Vietnam has been quick to respond, suffering only 270 recorded cases and no deaths. Despite the lack of economic resources for testing, the government implemented low-cost precautions that made use of a strict two-week quarantine and social contact limits. China was also able to put cities under lockdown; suspend travel, business, and schools; and impose restrictions in social interactions in just a few days-all actions praised as setting a "new standard" by the World Health Organization.China has also been able to implement extensive surveillance systems through health code apps and cameras outside of people's houses. Although these surveillance systems, unconstrained by privacy legislation, breach individuals' rights to privacy in extensive measures, they help the government contain the spread of the virus by isolating the citizens who seem to be infected or vulnerable to infection. However, we also have to acknowledge that the aspects of authoritarian regimes that limit freedom of speech and expression can endanger their battles against the virus. For example, Li Wenliang, a doctor from Wuhan, tried to warn the Chinese government about the spread of the virus in December, but was ultimately silenced.At the end of the day, the governments that have best been able to regulate the outbreak could be determined by how well the citizens have followed the policies put forward. This is evident by both democratic and authoritarian governments across the globe having had varied successes in reducing the effects of the pandemic. For example, New Zealand has been able to almost completely eliminate the virus outbreak and is now loosening some restrictions. Its progress hasn't depended on the government's ability to strictly enforce regulations, but the people's compliance with the regulations imposed and their trust in the government to make the right policies for the containment of the outbreak.Some authoritarian governments have been able to ensure that citizens follow their policies by force, while some democratic governments have been able to rely on the trust they have fostered with their residents prior to the pandemic. In a democracy, the government needs to build this trust in order to work efficiently in times of crisis. Yet the American protesters' lack of compliance or trust seems more reliant upon political party lines than anything else. There seems to be a disconnect between the protestors, who disregard professional opinions in favor of the current administration's information, and medical experts, whom other Americans support. The United States appears to suffer more so from a lack of trust than from a lack of authoritarianism in swiftly combating this pandemic.Regardless, we should all remember that in the end, whether it's because our governments force us or because we trust their policies, what matters most is that we stay home.Senem Yurdakul is a first-year at Columbia College studying sociology and creative writing.

A pro-Trump super PAC is stepping up its advertising campaign against Joe Biden in PennsylvaniaPhilly.comMay 17, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Distributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength: 529 wordsByline: Andrew Seidman, The Philadelphia InquirerBodyMay 18--A super-PAC supporting President Donald Trump’s reelection started airing new TV commercials in Pennsylvania last week portraying Joe Biden as weak on China -- part of an effort to damage the presumptive Democratic nominee’s standing in key battleground states.The commercials are part of America First Action’s $10 million advertising blitz in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin -- three traditionally blue states that elevated Trump to the White House in 2016 and that are crucial to his prospects in November.America First started airing similar ads last month, and the new spots will run through May. The group has booked about $3.5 million in airtime in the Keystone State to date, with the commercials running in every media market but Philadelphia, according to the ad-tracking firm Advertising Analytics.Trump has said the Chinese government should have done a better job containing the coronavirus, and his allies believe Biden’s record on China offers a potent line of attack. Local Republicans in Pennsylvania have also embraced a tough-on-China message.Trump, Biden, and their allies are spending millions on Pennsylvania airwaves, but not in Philly“For five decades in Washington, Joe Biden’s been wrong on China,” the narrator says in the 30-second ad, pointing to his votes in favor of “job-killing trade deals.”The ad plays a clip of Biden describing the Chinese as “not bad folks” and shows a photo of the former vice president clinking glasses with Chinese President Xi Jinping.“After 47 years in Washington, Joe Biden just doesn’t make sense,” the narrator says.Biden’s campaign has aired its own ads saying Trump “rolled over for the Chinese” and showing clips of the president praising Beijing’s response to the pandemic.The pro-Trump media offensive comes as the president grapples with twin crises: a public health emergency caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 89,000  lives in the U.S., and an economy that has seen 36 million people file for unemployment benefits as states ordered most businesses to shut down.Trump has urged states to ease those restrictions. The president visited a facility that makes personal protective equipment in Allentown on Thursday and called for Gov. Tom Wolf to reopen more parts of the state.The Trump campaign has also been airing ads this month in Pennsylvania.The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee raised $61.7 million in April, a slight edge over the $60.5 million haul by Biden’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee.But Trump had a big head start on fund-raising and holds a significant cash advantage over Biden.Biden’s campaign has not yet bought advertising in the state, but he’s been getting reinforcements from Democratic outside groups such as Priorities USA Action. The super-PAC has been airing anti-Trump TV commercials since late February.Priorities USA has booked $15.2 million worth of airtime in various Pennsylvania media markets through the November election, according to Advertising Analytics.___ (c)2020 The Philadelphia Inquirer Visit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.inquirer.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.Load-Date: June 7, 2020End of Document

Continue reading How the  Plandemic  video hoax went viralIllustration by Grayson Blackmon and Alex Castro / The VergeSince the COVID-19 pandemic began, the big social platforms have generally been quicker than usual to intervene in the spread of misinformation. We ve seen Facebook, Google, and Twitter add various labels, warnings, and links to high-quality news sources and public health organizations. And for the most part, the dumbest theories about the novel coronavirus have not reached huge scale   unless the theory was suggested by the president of the United States, in which case, well.But some cracks are beginning to show. In February, a set of bizarre and almost incomprehensible theories began to spread on YouTube and Facebook alleging that 5G cellular networks had played a role in spreading the virus. And last week, we saw the emergence of the first true hit conspiracy video of the COVID-19 era. It s called  Plandemic,  and like many conspiracy videos it asserts that a shadowy cabal of elites is using a global crisis as a cover to profiteer and entrench their power. Here s Davey Alba in the New York Times:In the 26-minute video, the woman asserted how Dr. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a leading voice on the coronavirus, had buried her research about how vaccines can damage people s immune systems. It is those weakened immune systems, she declared, that have made people susceptible to illnesses like Covid-19.The video, a scene from a longer dubious documentary called  Plandemic,  was quickly seized upon by anti-vaccinators, the conspiracy group QAnon and activists from the Reopen America movement, generating more than eight million views. And it has turned the woman   Dr. Judy Mikovits, 62, a discredited scientist   into a new star of virus disinformation.Uploads of  Plandemic  have more than 8 million views across social platforms, with one YouTube version hitting 7.1 million views before it was removed. That would be more than enough to place it near the top of the YouTube trending page  about as many views as this video where influencers practice apologizing (8.6 million), but still way below the three-day-old official music video for 6ix9ine s  Gooba  (103 million).Still, the video seems well on its way to becoming something akin to this generation s Loose Change. That video, which wrongly depicted 9/11 as an elaborate false flag operation, generated millions of views after being distributed for free on YouTube and local Fox TV affiliates   and went on to become one of the foundational texts of the 9/11 truther movement.I accept that on a free and open internet, some people are going to post extremely dumb and harmful things. And  Plandemic  is undoubtedly harmful: among other things, it falsely tells people that wearing a mask will  activate  the virus. But we ve seen in the past that extremely dumb and harmful things often benefit from algorithmic promotion. They appear high up in search results, on trending pages, and in recommendation widgets. Platforms are used to recruit followers for terrible causes without even being aware that they re doing so.After years of pressure, though, platforms have gotten better at detecting bad posts and videos as they begin bubbling up. They re now able to catch more bad stuff before it hits the trending page. YouTube has a whole team that monitors this stuff in real time. And so  Plandemic  left me scratching my head. How did this thing go viral?The ground was seeded by a book that Mikovits, the star of  Plandemic,  published last month. Plague of Corruption  frames Dr. Mikovits as a truth-teller fighting deception in science,  Alba writes, and it won approving coverage from far-right outlets including the Epoch Times, Gateway Pundit, and Next News Network.But it was the  Plandemic  clip that turned Mikovits into a star (she s gained more than 130,000 Twitter followers in a month.) And the two have benefited each other: searches for Mikovits drove views of  Plandemic,  and viewings of  Plandemic  drove searches for Mikovits.Erin Gallagher, a social media researcher who specializes in data visualizations, offers some clues. Gallagher used CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned tool for analyzing public posts, to investigate when  Plandemic  began to surge on the network. She found that posts referencing it appeared most often in Facebook groups devoted to QAnon, anti-vaccine misinformation, and conspiracy theories in general. The video spread from YouTube to Facebook thanks to highly active QAnon and conspiracy-related Facebook groups with tens of thousands of members which caused a massive cascade,  Gallagher writes.  Both platforms were instrumental in spreading viral medical misinformation. YouTube and Facebook both ultimately removed the video, but their responses differed in notable ways. I spoke to representatives at both companies today, and here s what I learned.At Facebook,  Plandemic  was demoted before it was removed. Demotion is a step that Facebook often takes with posts that seem bad for one reason or another but are not considered actively harmful. Maybe you posted an image in which someone is almost but not quite naked; maybe you suggested that people commit violence without coming right out and saying it. Since 2018 Facebook has intervened in an effort to prevent these types of posts from spreading, as part of an initiative to make it less appealing to post so-called  borderline content. I don t know exactly what qualified  Plandemic  as borderline content initially, but a spokesman noted that the video s length   26 minutes   along with the large number of claims made within it, created a lot of work for fact-checking teams. (A lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can tie its shoes, etc.) Facebook eventually decided that  Plandemic  had to go over its false assertion that people can  reinfect themselves  by wearing masks, but given the truly unfortunate confusion over mask wearing   some of it generated by public health organizations   the company was cautious.At YouTube, the company saw several videos related to  Plandemic  and flagged and removed them before the 26-minute clip that became famous. That clip was uploaded on May 4th and removed May 6th. In the meantime, it generated 7.1 million views. According to the company, the vast majority of those views came from external sites   people linking to it directly, rather than seeing it somewhere on YouTube. Gallagher s analysis suggests a significant number of those clicks came directly from Facebook. (YouTube wouldn t comment on that.)For its part, YouTube said, it did not recommend  Plandemic  or surface it  prominently  in search results   so, not on the first page. Search for it now and you ll see a pop-up from an independent fact checker and many videos of doctors debunking its claims.Facebook continues to see people upload other clips from  Plandemic,  and told me that it is sharing fact-checking information from its partners with people who share them. It s temporarily reducing the distribution of these other clips   the ones that don t include the mask bit   as fact checkers continue to evaluate other parts of  Plandemic.  People also continue to post modified versions of the original   recording it on their phones or adding commentary to it   and Facebook is hunting those down too.There s a view of all this that is heartening. Both companies saw a bad thing, put teams of fact checkers on it, and removed it from their networks with relative haste. (That s more than Amazon can say: Plague of Corruption is a top-10 best seller there today.) Facebook and YouTube could have acted faster, or more completely, but it isn t as if  Plandemic  caught them unawares. YouTube has more than 2 billion monthly users, and Facebook has 1.73 billion users per day across its suite of apps; at that scale, 8 million people seeing something in 48 hours just doesn t look like all that much. (And if you re thinking well huh, maybe the problem with these companies is their size, you may have been interested in Elizabeth Warren s presidential campaign.)But there s a darker view to consider, too. When Facebook announced it would shift its attention to building services for smaller, more private groups, critics pointed out that this was likely going to make it harder to police misinformation. This is particularly true of WhatsApp chats, which are encrypted end-to-end. But it s also true of private Facebook groups, where it seems likely that  Plandemic  was shared actively.It likely won t be the last piece of harmful misinformation about COVID-19 that becomes a blockbuster. And when the next one comes, I wouldn t be surprised to see that the pathway to virality leads straight through Facebook groups.Formal apology to the people of the United KingdomOn Thursday, in reference to an app being developed by the digital division of the United Kingdom s National Health Service, I repeatedly used  England  when I should have referred to the entire kingdom.

Business HighlightsAssociated Press InternationalMay 11, 2020 Monday 9:32 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; Business HighlightsLength: 912 wordsByline: By The Associated PressBody___Risk of reopening US economy too fast: A W-shaped recoveryWASHINGTON (AP) - When the coronavirus erupted in the United States, it triggered quarantines, travel curbs and business shutdowns. Many economists predicted a V-shaped journey for the economy: A sharp drop, then a quick bounce-back as the virus faded and the economy regained health. Others envisioned a slower, U-shaped course. Now, as President Donald Trump and many Republicans press to reopen the economy, some experts see an ominous risk: That a too-hasty relaxation of social distancing could ignite a resurgence of COVID-19 cases by fall, sending the economy back into lockdown. The result: a W-shaped disaster in which a tentative recovery would sink back into a "double-dip" recession before rebounding eventually.___As countries restart, WHO warns about lack of virus tracingNEW YORK (AP) - A top world health official is warning that countries are essentially driving blind in reopening their economies without setting up strong contact tracing to beat back flareups of the coronavirus. The World Health Organization's Dr. Michael Ryan said Monday that some countries that are now reopening don't have strong enough contact-tracing systems to detect and stop virus flareups early on.___Chinese investment in US drops to lowest level since 2009WASHINGTON (AP) - China's direct investments in the United States fell last year to the lowest level since the Great Recession -- even before the coronavirus pandemic shut down much of global commerce. The drop reflected tensions between the world's two biggest economies and Chinese government restrictions on overseas investment. A report out Monday found that China's direct investment in the United States dropped from $5.4 billion in 2018 to $5 billion last year, the lowest level since the recession year of 2009. U.S. investment in China blipped up last year -- to $14 billion from $13 billion in 2018.___Tesla CEO Elon Musk says he has restarted California factoryFREMONT, Calif. (AP) - Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed on Twitter Monday that the company has restarted its California factory in violation of local government orders. Musk asked in the afternoon tweet that he be arrested if authorities take anyone into custody. The plant in Fremont, California, south of San Francisco had been closed since March 23 under orders to prevent the spread of coronavirus.___Becoming 'King of Ventilators' may result in unexpected glutWASHINGTON (AP) - President Trump pledged in late March to ensure production of 100,000 additional ventilators within 100 days to address a shortage during the coronavirus pandemic. Since then, his administration has rushed to spend nearly $3 billion to spur U.S. manufacturers to crank them out at an unprecedented pace. An Associated Press analysis shows that the federal government is expected to take delivery of nearly 200,000 new ventilators by the end of 2020. But after noting unusually high death rates for coronavirus victims put on the machines, many doctors are shifting away from using them. That's raising the unexpected prospect that the United States could soon be awash in surplus ventilators. ___Pandemic shows contrasts between US, European safety netsNEW YORK (AP) - The coronavirus pandemic is straining social safety nets all over the world and showing how sharply the U.S. and Europe differ in their approach. Europe's more generous jobless benefits kick in automatically during a downturn, and that's happening now. But U.S. workers get less and face the risks of losing health insurance and even possibly their homes through foreclosures when they lose their jobs. The typical U.S. response to trouble is a stimulus package, like the one passed under President Donald Trump and previous one under President Barack Obama during the Great Recession. Either way, the U.S. typically ranks near the bottom in social spending among rich countries.___Twitter to label disputed COVID-19 tweetsCHICAGO (AP) - Twitter announced Monday it will warn users with a label when a tweet contains disputed or misleading information about the coronavirus. The company will take a case-by-case approach to how it decides which tweets are labeled, company leaders said Monday. Some tweets will run with a label underneath that directs users to links with additional information about COVID-19. Other tweets will be covered entirely by alerts that tell users the information is in "conflict with guidance from public health experts." The new rule is just the latest in a string of stricter policies that tech companies are rolling out to confront virus misinformation on their sites.___Tech stocks keep rallying, help keep Wall Street steadyWall Street was split on Monday, as continued gains for technology and health care stocks helped cover up for more prevalent losses elsewhere. The S&P 500 ended the day at a virtual standstill after rallying back from an earlier loss of 0.9% in the morning. The Dow was down modestly, while the Nasdaq was up. Even though losers outnumbered winners in the S&P 500 by more than two to one, gains for Apple and other big winners of the year so far helped the index eke out its fifth gain in the last six days. ___The S&P 500 rose 0.52 of a point at 2,930.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 109.33 points, or 0.4%, to 24,221.99, while the Nasdaq composite added 71.02, or 0.8%, to 9,192.34. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 8.40 points, or 0.6%, to 1,321.24.Load-Date: May 12, 2020End of Document

OPINION: Trump, conservative news outlets are racist in handling of the coronavirusIndiana Daily Student: Indiana UniversityMarch 26, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 745 wordsByline: Kailyn HilycordBodyPresident Donald Trump listens to White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx during a press briefing March 19 on the coronavirus pandemic at the White House.Tribune News ServiceSince President Donald Trump began referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus" on March 16, which he also tweeted March 18, global citizens have criticized this reference, and rightfully so. The president even made a point to cross out "corona" in his notes for a conference March 20 and replaced it with "Chinese."Meanwhile, right-wing news outlets have stood by him, as well as his constituents. If Americans do not denounce such bigotry now, it will only continue and fuel the power of the far-right by normalizing such chauvinistic behavior.Since news broke of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, anti-Asian bigots have emphasized its origin. The first known cases originated in China and have since spread across the globe. The virus has incited a global pandemic, the likes of which have not been seen since the Spanish influenza in 1918.The Trump administration and conservative news outlets, such as Fox News, have not helped the social climate during this pandemic.Fox News representatives Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham only pointed fingers at the Chinese government, further diverting from the faults of other governments during this time, and solely focusing on a country where the virus originated. "President Trump's allies on Fox News, with the exception of Carlson, were inclined to take the same stance that the president himself promoted," Allyson Chiu of The Washington Post said in an article discussing the "blame-shifting" of Trump and Fox News. "The novel coronavirus, which had sickened and killed thousands of people worldwide, was no worse a threat than the seasonal flu."While there is a point of origin, China is not to blame. It continues to send supplies to other countries to fight the pandemic, and has flattened the curve of infection rates.Currently, Americans are struggling to even get tested and failing to listen to federal guidance or learn from the inactivity of other countries by practicing extreme social-distancing, cleanliness and less travel. The current administration is responsible for this. Trump, along with his media allies, downplayed the severity of the virus until the point of inevitability.Trump's comments continue to support racist beliefs, giving bigots across the country the opportunity to openly display their distaste for members of the Asian community.Vox reporters have been shedding light onto the effects of Trump's racist rhetoric on the Asian American community. They, along with others such as The New York Times, continue to interview Asian Americans about their experiences with racially-motivated verbal and physical assaults. A video posted on Twitter on Feb. 24 went viral, showing a 68-year-old Asian man being robbed and verbally and physically assaulted. This has only escalated one month later.The Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council of San Francisco State University launched a website for people to report such hate crimes, and tracks news reported on the connection between the coronavirus and hate crimes. Between Feb. 9 and March 7 alone, the council found a 50% increase in reports.In addition, the controversy surrounding the coronavirus adds to the conversation on the treatment of past links between communities and other viruses.The flu is not referred to as the European or American virus, though its first cases were in Europe and America. Yet, other viruses that are connected to marginalized communities are given negative associations. The viruses that happen to affect or originate from marginalized populations, such as how AIDS was to the gay community and Ebola is to Africans, are forever connected to these peoples simply because they do not adhere to global societal norms and were widely affected by such pandemics.Global citizens from countries outside of Asia must evaluate how western media is portraying the Asian community amid the virus and denounce such behavior. It is our civic duty to stand alongside one another, no matter our identity, to combat the flames of hate amid the current pandemic.Kailyn Hilycord (she/her) is a senior studying journalism, English and music.

The 'infodemic' that spreads more than the pandemicCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 24, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1511 wordsBodyWith the daily increase in contagion and death due to the new coronavirus (COVID-19), the media run into the marathon of giving truthful and thorough research to the population of the various countries in the face of an unprecedented situation in the modern era. However, the proliferation of fake and disruptive messages, as well as the 'bulos' that are sent via instant messaging to create confusion, have unleashed an even more dangerous environment than the virus.The Director of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, defined in a publication in the middle of El País 'infodemia' as: "The obstruction of information, spreading panic and confusion unnecessarily and generating division" amid a time when coronavirus has wreaked havoc on the economy, health and society, the division of opinions and the embezzlement of information must be eradicated to preserve the peace of mind of populations.The fight against this misinformation disease has brought the forces of companies such as Google and social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, TikTok and Youtube, where different digital banners and information options direct interested parties to the official WHO website and various verified media so that they can learn the latest news about coronavirus without risk to receive fake news or holos.This neologism refers to even deeper concepts than misinformation, but also to a risk of discrimination against ethnic groups, racism, political dilemmas and social protests that seek to gain ground through confusing or threatening messages that can attract vulnerable people on the internet."Hate, and with it, phobia and discrimination are grounded in a toxic combination of ignorance and fear. These two human pulsations can lead us to confuse and see the other as strange and want to lock ourselves in rejecting everything else," explained the undersecretary for Prevention and Health Promotion of the Government of Mexico, Hugo López-Gatell in the Infobae environment.In a statement that the European Union (EU) issued on Friday, the organization accuses the governments of Russia and China of allowing the expansion of confusing and disinformation messages affecting the people of Europe and those countries. "A high proliferation of these messages was detected in April," the report cited by the Guardian."Despite their potentially serious impact on public health, official and state-backed sources of several governments, including Russia and, to a lesser extent, China, have continued to broadly attack conspiracy narratives and misinformation in public hearings in the EU and around the world," reads the Eu's External Action statement.A study by the Reuters Institute in Oxford found that observing the spread of 225 false or misleading claims about coronavirus, it was found that 88% of claims had appeared on social media platforms, compared to 9% on television or 8% in the media."The risk of not recognizing the diversity in the landscape of disinformation about the coronavirus assumes that there could be a single solution to this set of problems. Instead, our findings suggest that there will be no"cure" for misinformation about the new coronavirus. Instead, addressing the spread of misinformation about COVID-19 will require a sustained and coordinated effort by independent fact-checkers, independent news outlets, platform companies and public authorities to help the public understand and navigate the pandemic," the study explains.Some theories that have been created and spread on social media and media around the world highlight that COVID-19: it was created in a laboratory (accidentally or on purpose; in the face of this the Pew Research Center found in a survey that 3 out of 10 Americans think was on purpose); that the towers of the 5G network had caused the virus to be spread (which has led to real consequences leading corporations and civilians to attack telecommunications engineering companies and long-range moving signal towers); among others."It's a three-ring disinformation circus. It is almost impossible to choose a strain and isolate it, because simultaneously Russia, China and Trump are taking action and imitating each other more and more. Paul BarnettProfessor at New York UniversitySome experts have expressed that the role of traditional and digital media has become more sharp during the pandemic, although their efforts to promote real information may be greater. "Platforms feel they can be much more aggressive with coronavirus misinformation than with political misinformation," Claire Wardle, director of the nonprofit First Draft, told the Guardian."There are no two sides with coronavirus, so they don't have people on the other side who say, "We want this," as they do with anti-vaxxers or political misinformation," Wardle said, "they're freer to act."The ignorance and fear caused by fake news may be the reason for some people's lack of solidarity or the demands of civil groups in the face of confinement for lack of credibility of the official governments and ministries of each country. The El Universal medium reported a chlorine attack on a nurse in Sinaloa, who was leaving work caring for coronavirus patients at the Mexican Institute of Social Security (Imss).In Mexico, the entity's Inter-Agency Committee of Nurses denounced physical and verbal assaults on the street, as well as on public transport by citizens fearful of coronavirus contagions, as reported by the medium. Such affectations have occurred in other countries, as well as discrimination and stigmatization through social media, causing Facebook and Twitter to delete messages with dangerous background or disinformation about the pandemic, from both ordinary people and popular politicians like Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro.The need to address the spread of more uncertain information and the fact that scientists and official authorities do not know much details about the progress of the virus also causes a sense of insecurity and little protection in citizens. The internet has also been manipulated for pirate plans and malicious signatures, as in the last week WHO and the U.S. National Institutes of Health have reported five attempts at security breaches in their technologies.These activities have been criminal orlinked to "dark public relations" companies working with governments and the far right. The Guardian noted that other attempts to sow discord have been presented at the door of governments, including disruptive messages to US mobile phones, and the signs accuse the Chinese government.While Russia and China remain the focus of cyberespionage investigations, fake news text messages, and uncertain statements on government decisions, the US has joined the list with incidents leading to social panic. People's growing concern is not unfounded, as the manipulation of social media, the internet and websites has taken over the day-to-day lives of boaters, and high cases of confinement anxiety make it appealing to those affected to click on news that seems malicious rather than positive."It's a three-ring disinformation circus," said Paul Barrett, a new York University disinformation expert in the Middle English. "It's almost impossible to choose a strain and isolate it, because simultaneously Russia, China and Trump are taking action and moving each other more and more. It is incredibly difficult for an ordinary citizen to navigate what is true."For the university of Washington's professor of biology—and writer of the book on disinformation Calling Bullsh*t: The Art of Scepticism in a Data-driven World—thefight against coronavirus has been divided into two artists: "One against the pandemic and one against all the misinformation, hatred and fear that political opportunists are spreading and angering."And messages, tweets, posts and videos continue to grow on social media, creating a virtual snowball cycle that can't be stopped. "On social media, there are more than 3 billion messages and more than 100 billion interactions in trends #covid19,#coronavirus and other similar tags," media specialist Deniz Unay told the Agency, "perhaps for the first time in history, we see that humanity has been exposed to strong interaction on a single topic in dozens of different languages and on many platforms."The writer of the last century, T. S. Eliot, warned that "knowledge does not imply wisdom, just as information does not imply knowledge". Knowing how to choose verified and highly credible media is vital at times where the infodemic strengthens more than the pandemic itself, since new articles and news are born every second, almost like the number of infected per week in the countries most affected by the virus on various continents."The course of the coronavirus outbreak will depend on the extent to which the right information is reached to the people who need it," Ghebreyesus explained in an article in El País,"Be cautious in disclosing information, be careful with the entries you access on the Internet and do not give wings to the trolls."Load-Date: April 25, 2020End of Document

Beijing mayor tightens quarantine for travelers from abroadCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 16, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 646 wordsBodyBeijingAlcdía tightens quarantine for travelers from abroad By Laurie CHEN et Jingxuan TENG (Video+Photos) Beijing, 16 Mar 2020 (AFP) - The Beijing mayoralty on Monday reinforced quarantine measures for people from the avoid cases of new imported coronaviruses, which currently outweigh locally sourced contagions. This ad coincides with a wave of virulent criticism on social media against Westerners accused of laxity in the fight against the epidemic. China, the cradle of the coronavirus pandemic, said last week that the epidemic was "practically contained" and that it recorded more imported than local cases. Therefore, from Monday the municipality imposed a 14-day quarantine on people arriving in the capital from abroad in hotels designated by the authorities. Until now, only one quarantine was imposed on their home. Upon arrival in Beijing, passengers are transferred to a gigantic exhibition park transformed into a medical examination center and then directed to quarantine hotels. Travelers will have to pay for the costs of quarantine.- "Private Cases" - Jacob Gunter, an American resident in Beijing, said he spent more than six hours between he got off the plane and arrived at the quarantine hotel, where he will have to reside for two weeks. The passage through the exhibition park "was by far" the most chaotic moment of his "odyssey", but the vast majority of passengers had "patience," he said. An AFP team saw officers in uniform and others on Monday with protective combinations on guard duty in front of the medical examination center with several ambulances. Only a few people, considered as "particular cases", are allowed to pass quarantine at home, the mayor's office of Pekín.Se treats women over 70 years of age, pregnant women, people with chronic diseases, isolated minors and people who live alone. Since the World Health Organization (WHO) said the epidemic had become a pandemic, some 20,000 people, 10% foreign, arrive every day in China, an immigration service officer said. Uneasy about the virus's advance in the rest of the world, many Chinese chose to return to their country.          - Trump criticized - On Monday, China recorded 12 cases of imported infection against only four local cases. Over the more than 80,000 cases in China, 123 were infected outside the country. In this context, Chinese netizens hold Europe and the United States accountable for the rapid progression of the virus in their territories. Many say they want US President Donald Trump to catch, others call for tighter border controls to prevent imported cases from reactiveting the epidemic in China." We cannot let our efforts be wasted," says one user of the social network Weibo.A sog or keyword on Twitter, viewed 820 million times, condemns the concept of "collective immunity," evoked by experts from the UK and France, which would be to let the virus spread slowly in the population. The communist regime defends the radical policy it adopted at the end of January when it in fact instituted quarantine in almost all of Hubei province (centre), the cradle of the new coronavirus, isolating 50 million inhabitants from the world. But the Chinese government was criticized for the slowness with which it reacted when the virus appeared, to the point that in late December, when the first cases arose, the doctors who alerted the authorities were questioned by the police. Hubei Province gradually resumes a normal pace of life. On Monday four cities chartered1,600 migrant workers to return to work in factories outside the province. From the beginning of the epidemic, China recorded 3,213 deaths across the country as of Monday. Currently fewer than 10,000 people are considered infected in China.A figure that has to be compared to the total of 24,747 cases announced on Sunday in Italy, most affected country after China.lxc-tjx/lth/bar/sbr/mig/zm/afLoad-Date: March 17, 2020End of Document

EXCLUSIVE: House Republicans Open Inquiry Into Mysterious Drone Program Officials Use To Police Americans Who Aren't Social DistancingThe Daily CallerMay 13, 2020 Wednesday 09:56 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; usLength: 859 wordsByline: Chris White, Tech Reporter, chris@dailycallernewsfoundation.orgChris is a Missourian trying to find news angles in the blank spaces of life. Also go Chiefs!Author ImageBodyLink to Image• House Republicans want answers from the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security about a Chinese-based company supplying cities with drones to policy citizens who are not abiding by social distancing guidelines. • Reps. Jim Jordan and Matt Gaetz want to know if local and state officials are using federal grant money to obtain the drones, and they are concerned the company, DJI, could pose a risk to national security. • DJI's website notes that the drone program has donated 100 drones to more than 40 agencies, but the company does not specify which cities are receiving the technology or what they are doing with the drones.Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are opening a congressional inquiry into a drone company that provides city mayors and other officials with drone technology to help monitor and fine American citizens who fail to employ social distancing guidelines, the Daily Caller News Foundation has learned.Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida and Jim Jordan of Ohio requested information from the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security Wednesday into Da Jiang Innovations (DJI), a Chinese-based company dolling out drones to city officials. Past reports suggest DJI could pose a security threat to U.S. infrastructure.“Although federal law enforcement agencies have warned of potential information security concerns with DJI drones, it is not clear whether state and local law enforcement agencies are fully aware of these issues,” Jordon and Gaetz and other Republican lawmakers noted in            separate letters to the DHS and DOJ obtained by the DCNF.They are referring to reports warning that DJI poses a risk to the country's national security. (RELATED: One US City Is Deploying A Chinese Firm's Drones To Police Americans Who Are Not Social Distancing)DJI donated drones to 43 agencies in 22 states to help enforce social distancing, MSNBC reported in April. The donations are part of the company's “COVID-19 US Disaster Relief Program,” which provides cities access to the drones for the purpose of surveilling populations during the pandemic.Jordan, Gaetz and other Republicans on the committee want a list of the state and local enforcement agencies that are receiving federal tax dollars to purchase DJI drones dating back to 2017. They also want to know if the departments are monitoring the supply of drones to these municipalities, and whether any concerns have sprung up internally since 2017 about DJI.A 2017 memo from the Los Angeles office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said officials had “moderate confidence” that DJI's commercial drones are giving critical U.S. “infrastructure and law enforcement data to the Chinese government.”Link to ImageDrones fly above a city at night. (Shutterstock/Volodymyr Goinyk)The memo cited first- and second-hand anonymous sources inside the drone industry. ICE, an agency under the DHS, has not responded to the DCNF's request for comment about the memo, which was initially reported in November 2017 by The New York Times.The memo also stated that officials had “high confidence the company is selectively targeting government and privately owned entities within these sectors to expand its ability to collect and exploit sensitive U.S. data.” The U.S. Army banned the use of all DJI drones in 2017, citing “cyber vulnerabilities.”DJI previously disputed the thrust of the Times article and now disputes the insinuation that the company is a threat.“With more front-line workers testing positive for COVID-19, our focus is giving our public safety professionals every tool possible to fight the virus and protect citizens. That is our goal,” Adam Lisberg, corporate communications director for DJI, told the DCNF DJI has not provided the DCNF with a list of the cities that have received drones.Some cities are making use of the company's drones.Elizabeth, New Jersey Mayor J. Christian Bollwage, for instance, has no issue using the drones as a means of social control. His city's drones blare sirens and issue this warning: “Stop gathering, disperse and go home.”“If these drones save one life, it is clearly worth the activity and the information that the drones are sending,” the mayor said in an April interview with MSNBC.New Jersey is considered a coronavirus hotspot - more than 9,000 people in the state have died from the virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, before            skipping across the globe and landing in the United States, where it has killed more than 30,000 people.The Elizabeth Policy Department announced in an April 8 Facebook post how the drones will work.“These drones will be around the City with an automated message from the Mayor telling you to STOP gathering, disperse and go home,” the post noted before issuing a warning that violating the policies subjects them to potential $1,000 fines. “You have been advised.”Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Duke and relative diplomacyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 4, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 595 wordsBodyThe Government's rifirrafe with the United Nations, following the report presented last week by Alberto Brunori, the representative in Colombia of the high commissioner for human rights, is just another - not the first and will not be the last - incident in the extensive list of misadventures of this administration's overt-run, full of irregularities and inconsistencies. In this year and a half, Ivan Duque has been characterized by using diplomacy in a discretionary manner to pose as impetuous and gallant with the weak and to act complacent and submissive to the powerful. For example, Venezuela and Cuba have done nothing but show their teeth, arguing - rightly, it must be said - that these are governments that do not respect human rights, neither the right to dissent nor freedom of the press and where, moreover, elections are fraudulent or manipulated by each regime. But, paradoxically, all of this stuff that Duke and his chancellors and ambassadors detest and criticize these Latin American nations is perfectly tolerated, or ignored, when it comes to a colossus like China, a totalitarian country, where democracy shines through its absence. Where are the allegations against Xi Jinping over the persecution of independent journalists or hundreds of political prisoners? When are they going to promote a diplomatic wall against that country that allows its workers to be treated like slaves? What do you expect to demand free and supervised elections from the Chinese government? Of course, as this is one of the two richest powers on the planet, our government not only dares not speak to the Chinese authorities, but the President travels to give them pleitism and make floral offerings to the mausoleum of a tyrant as Mao Zedong was. And, not content with that, it celebrates the Asian giant's multibillion-dollar investments in our country, which is increasing every day in more and more sectors of our economy, such as infrastructure, mining, communications and e-commerce, among other lines. In short, this contrast between Colombia's benevolent diplomacy in the case of China and arrogance, and even the highness, with which Venezuela and Cuba are treated is very striking. And, although this attitude seems absurd and somewhat grotesque, it doesn't stay there. One of the reasons why the Duke himself went in charge of Brunori's report was the alleged intrusion into our internal affairs, for suggesting that the police become dependent on the Ministry of the Interior rather than the Ministry of Defense or for recommending that the Esmad be reengineered. However, instead of discussing or calmly reviewing these proposals, the President preferred to go out and disqualify the report while his bishops put the cry in the sky and proposed the expulsion of the UN from the country. However, a couple of days later, it seemed as normal to all of them that Donald Trump practically ordered Duke - at their meeting in Washington - to begin aerial spraying of coca crops as soon as possible; demand that our representative took note carefully. There was no President or Chancellor or Congressman or anyone who spoke of external interference; nor remembered national sovereignty or anything like that. Again, the highest exponents of Duke's precarious diplomacy bow their heads, undeterred, in the face of a foreign power. What about dignity? That's the least of it, there will already be an international cooperation entity or a small Caribbean country with which to take the nail off. There they are painted. puntoyaparte@vladdo.comPoint and apartVladdoLoad-Date: March 5, 2020End of Document

Lopez Obrador's coronavirus challenge: hand out hugs, kisses and discards stylingCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 16, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1310 wordsBodyThe World Health Organization 's recommendations for no kissing or hugging, as well as maintaining a cautious distance to prevent the spread of covid-19 coronavirus, appears to be taking the care of Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.Although Mexico is already weighing all 60 cases of the disease that started in China at the end of December 2019, this weekend, the representative toured in the state of Guerrero, where he let himself be embraced by the people and handed out kisses , mainly children.On Saturday, as he left the hotel where he stayed in Ometepec, he met the requests of the people waiting for him outside the premises.In a video posted on his social media, he observes how the president receives and kisses, as well as holding hands with the people who approached to greet him in the midst of a tumult.(video capture)Some health experts and social media users expressed alarm at the president's hands, hugging and kissing his followers, arguing that he was setting a bad example for the population."In the midst of a pandemic, @lopezobrador_ continues to hand out and receive kisses and hugs when all governments ask their fellow citizens to take social estrangement measures, ban mass acts and order quarantines. What if she gets sick?" wrote the Twitter user @audelinomacario.Since the arrival of Covid-19 was announced in Mexico, the Mexican president has insisted that "you have to embrace one.""There are those who say that because of coronavirus you don't have to hug. But you have to hug, nothing happens" (sic).The president's strength is moral, it's not a force for contagion: Hugo López-GattelPHOTO: ANDREA MURCIA/FOURTHCURO (Andrea Murcia/)This Monday, March 16, during the press conference at The National Palace and at the question of the representatives of the media whether the president's work tours will be suspended to avoid possible contagion, the Undersecretary of Prevention and Health Promotion, Hugo López-Gatell, in charge of addressing the issue of coronavirus in Mexico, explained that the president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, "is not a force of contagion" of coronavirus.The official said the representative is in good health and although it is 60 years old it is not a case of "special risk", as "the strength of the president is moral."Fortunately (Lopez Obrador) is in good health. Even if it's 60, it doesn't mean it's a special-risk staff. It would almost be better if he had coronavirus because he, individually, is going to spontaneously recover and become immune," he said.Lopez-Gatell assured that the belief that the president should be tested by COVID-19 part of an misplaced idea."It is devoid of technical sense; it doesn't make sense, that's not how epidemiological surveillance or health care works," he said.For his part, López Obrador said that if necessary he will be tested for coronavirus."I do what the doctors, the responsible, tell me. We made the decision to leave this public health issue in the hands of technicians, experts, scientists," he said.He noted that leaving this COVID-19 issue in the hands of politicians would alter everything, so he asked not to politicize the issue."I'm going to act very responsibly. I'm going to follow the recommendationsdoctors and specialists. If necessary, i'll take the test in time. What I want is for the matter not to be politicised," he added."I wish with all my soul that it doesn't affect us in coronavirus (...) they're going to say That I'm idealistic, dreamy, irresponsible (...) I want, dream that our people are not going to suffer, it's not going to suffer. I want our people to be happy, happy, happy," López Obrador said on Monday.The president insisted that as soon as the undersecretary of health tells him he should suspend his tours, he will, but in the meantime, he will continue to approach people.Undersecretary López-Gatell stated that appropriate health measures are being taken, and is not comparable to what is experienced in other countries as coronavirus affects them differently, so he reiterated, the cancellation of mass acts is ruled out.Lopez-Gatell said the authorities' strategy for now was focused on reducing the rate of contagion in the country to prevent the saturation of health care units. "It's not all about cancelling events," he said.What has the government of López Obrador done to stop the advance of coronavirus?(video capture)The picture in Mexico looks very complicated: the economy is in technical recession, the weight faces a sharp fall as well as oil prices and if that were not enough, the Mexican public health system is in crisis and with the Para Health Institute Welfare (Insabi) not working.Although federal health authorities report on the progression of the disease every day, the reality is that essential data such as how people suspected of the disease are screened for screening, which is Key.The situation in the United States began because, according to journalistic versions, not enough tests were being done to detect the disease. That's why the alarms among the Mexican population are on.The government insists that the country is in phase one of the scenarios of the import disease (where contagions occurred abroad and there is still no contagion between locals) scientists such as UNAM anticipate that this will change soon and disease spreads quickly.Although the undersecretary of health assured that since the onset of the disease, tests have been implemented at Mexican airports to detect potential sick Chinese travelers and controls such as temperature monitoring and implementation of a questionnaire to detect symptoms, some testimonials on social networks and in some media claim that at Mexico City International Airport, the necessary screenings are not being implemented all international travelers.A woman uses a mouth cover to protect herself from the COVID-19 coronavirus at Abraham González International Airport in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. (Photo: REUTERS / José Luis González) (JOSE LUIS GONZALEZ/)One of the measures implemented by the Chinese government to prevent the spread of the virus included random testing of people who did nothad symptoms. That's how many sick people were spotted and then put in solitary confinement. But nothing like this is being done in Mexico.On Thursday, March 12, the Undersecretary for Health Prevention and Promotion of the Ministry of Health, Hugo López-Gatell, said that Mexico does not plan to restrict flights, or close borders or seaports, nor cancel mass events due to the Coronavirus Covid-19 because there is no scientific demonstration that these measures help to reduce the risk of transmission.However, on Thursday, the Secretary of Tourism, Miguel Torruco, announced that the 45th edition of the Tourist Tianguis to be held in Merida from 22 to 25 March will be postponed, so it will now take place from 19 to 22 September.Through the Ministry of Finance, the federal government said it will allocate "a few hundred million pesos" for the purchase of medicines, medical equipment and healing equipment to treat the outbreak of the disease in the country, but the truth is that so far , it is not known if it has already occurred.There is also no certainty that particular states and hospitals have enough infrastructure to deal with massive contagion.On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) decreed the Covid-19 coronavirus as a pandemic. As of Monday, March 16, there are 53 confirmed cases in Mexico and 176 suspects under study.MORE THAN THIS THEME:Map of coronavirus in Mexico: up to 53 cases and spread across the countryJalisco, Guanajuato and Yucatan overtake of coronavirus classesWhat is the "National Day of Healthy Distance" proposed by the government to prevent coronavirusLópez Obrador on the coronavirus: "We are not going to do anything the misfortunes, the pandemics"Load-Date: March 17, 2020End of Document

XINJIANG AUTHORITIES CONSTRUCT PARKING LOT ATOP HISTORIC UYGHUR CEMETERYStates News ServiceMay 1, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 713 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A cemetery considered sacred by Uyghurs that was razed by authorities last year in northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) has been paved over and turned into a car park, according to an expert on Uyghur history."Last year, the Chinese government destroyed the central Uyghur graveyard and sacred shrine in [Hotan]," Rian Thum, a professor of history at the University of Nottingham in Britain, said in a post to Twitter on April 28."We can now see part of what they have put in its place: a parking lot."Thum posted a time lapse view of the Sultanim Cemetery, in central Hotan (in Chinese, Hetian) city, based on satellite imagery from Google Earth, which shows grave plots being gradually being plowed over with dirt beginning in 2019 and a parking lot being erected in the western portion of the site."This is not just a run-of-the mill graveyard," Thum tweeted, including coordinates for others to use to find the site on Google Earth."It is a well-known sacred site, the only major one inside the city. People would go there to pray for healing, fertility, forgiveness, etc."Thum also posted a photo taken by a photographer from Agence France-Presse last year showing a notice from local officials, informing residents that the cemetery was being destroyed "on the basis of the needs of our city's development," and to "promote a spacious, beautiful environment for all of the city's people.""The graveyard and shrine destructions are part of a larger cultural cleansing campaign involving mass internment camps, forced labor, and child separation for Turkic minorities in China," he said.In particular, Thum said, authorities have focused on "eliminating or desecrating Uyghur sacred shrines," including one to a well-known Muslim imam named Jafar Sadiq, which he described as "one of the five most important Uyghur holy places."He said that the parking lot in Hotan is one of the first cases in which outside observers have been able to see what was built over a graveyard, or "mazar," that included an important religious shrine, although he noted that an AFP investigation last year revealed that a park had been constructed atop a cemetery that held the grave of renowned Uyghur poet Lutpulla Mutellip.According to that investigation, which AFP conducted with Earthrise Alliance and published the findings from in October, at least 45 cemeteries had been destroyed since 201430 of which were razed since 2017.Many of the sites were transformed into parks or parking lots, while others had remained empty lots, AFP said. Reporters said they had seen human remains left at several sites.Targeting the deadSpeaking to RFA's Uyghur Service, Thum said that by razing cemeteries, China's ruling Communist Party is "literally targeting Uyghurs who have already died," in addition to the estimated 1.8 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities authorities are believed to have been detained in the XUAR's vast network of internment camps since April 2017.But he said that destroying graveyards is also part of a bid to control the wider Uyghur population, which views the sites as "a part of the historical landscape of the Uyghur region," regardless of their religious significance."For a long time, [Chinese authorities] have been nervous about the shrinesparticularly those shrines where large numbers of people gatherand so a lot of the most important shrines were already closed but were not being destroyed or damaged," Thum said."And that's what's really different here, is that they're nowin several placescompletely removing and destroying these mazars."Thum suggested that actions such as destroying graveyards are tactics authorities use to "eliminate Uyghur culture or to transform it into something that is more like Han Chinese people's culture.""Some of these shrines are just a collection of flags in the desert, and yet, by people going there frequently and engaging in the memorialization of the person who is supposed to be buried there, they keep them up, and they keep the memory alive," he said."But also, these physical markers on the landscape help remind Uyghurs of their own traditions."Reported by Kurban Niyaz for RFA's Uyghur Service.

Jewher Ilham, daughter of Uyghur scholar Ilham Tohti who has been jailed in China since 2014, gave remarks during the event."The Chinese Communist Party's systematic campaign of repression against Muslim minorities in China is intolerable," said Risch . "I commend Jewher Tohti for bravely sharing her father's story and for her continued advocacy on behalf of the Uyghur people. Congress has made its position on this issue very clear, and I look forward to the passage of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act very soon.""Ilham Tohti is a profoundly courageous and brilliant scholar with a remarkable love for the Uyghur community, culture, and unique history," said Menendez . "Despite the Chinese government's inhumane oppression of the Uyghur population, Mr. Tohti has long stood up for Uyghur rights, a heroism that was reflected in the documentary 'China Change.' The United States must not stand idly by and instead stand up for the rights and freedom of the Uyghur people, just as Ilham and Jewher Tohti have done.""I was proud to join SFRC Chairman Risch, Ranking Member Menendez, and the European Parliament in honoring Professor Ilham Tohti, a prominent Uyghur scholar who was unjustly sentenced to life in prison by a Chinese court," Rubio said . "I will continue to press for his freedom as well as the other over one million Uyghur and other Turkic Muslim minorities who are systematically repressed and their most fundamental rights violated by the Chinese Communist Party in Xinjiang."###Load-Date: March 5, 2020End of Document

The UK is reviewing Huawei's role in its 5G network again, and it's a new sign it could still cave to US pressureBusiness Insider USMay 26, 2020 Tuesday 05:20 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 558 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Isobel Asher Hamilton)Highlight: The UK defied pressure from the Trump administration in January by announcing it would allow Huawei to build "non-core" parts of its 5G network.BodyDan Kitwood/Getty Images• The UK will again review Huawei's role in building out its 5G mobile infrastructure after new US sanctions were announced earlier in May.• Huawei had been given a limited role in providing kit for the UK's networks, in defiance of US pressure. • Reports also emerged this weekend that UK prime minister Boris Johnson will announce he will cut Huawei's role in the UK's network to zero by 2023.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.The UK looks like it might cave to US pressure to ditch Huawei.Britain's cybersecurity center the NCSC announced on Sunday it would conduct a new review into Huawei's role in the UK's 5G network."Following the US announcement of additional sanctions against Huawei, the NCSC is looking carefully at any impact they could have to the UK's networks," an NCSC spokesman told the BBC on Sunday.The new US sanctions announced earlier this month make it harder for chip manufacturers using US-made parts to sell to Huawei. The sanctions were brought in to close loopholes left after the US placed Huawei on a trade blacklist last year.In theory, Huawei's inability to access chip software as a result of the sanctions might undermine its promise to the UK and other markets of a speedy 5G rollout.Reports also emerged on Sunday that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is planning to announce he will reduce Huawei's presence in the UK's 5G network to zero by 2023.In January 2020, the UK appeared to reject US pressure to exclude Huawei from its 5G networks entirely, saying it would allow Huawei to build "non-core" parts of its infrastructure and cap its presence in the network at 35%. This reportedly led to a furious phone call between President Trump and Johnson which ended in Trump slamming the phone down.The US and Huawei have been locked in a firefight for over a year now, with the US claiming Huawei acts as a proxy for the Chinese government to spy - which Huawei denies. The tension seems to have ramped back up in recent weeks, with the US announcing its new sanctions.Johnson has also faced discontent within his party with his decision to allow Huawei, and in March fended off a rebellion from Conservative MPs by just 24 votes.Responding to the announcement of the new UK review, Huawei Vice President Victor Zhang told the BBC: "Our priority remains to continue the rollout of a reliable and secure 5G networks across Britain.""We are happy to discuss with NCSC any concerns they may have and hope to continue the close working relationship we have enjoyed for the last ten years," said Zhang.Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chair of the foreign affairs select committee and a constant Huawei critic, praised the UK review. "I've been asking for this for 3 years," he wrote on Twitter. "The US sanctions make it even more necessary. We need to rethink our dependence on countries that don't share our values and seek to undermine our interests."NOW WATCH: Why Pikes Peak is the most dangerous racetrack in AmericaSee Also:• A Chinese tech company slammed the US government for 'politicizing business' after it imposed export sanctions on 33 more Chinese companies and government institutions• Cybersecurity experts found seven flaws in the UK's contact-tracing app• China's possible countermeasures against Apple and Qualcomm would interrupt smartphone vendor supply chainsLoad-Date: May 26, 2020End of Document

Andrés Rodriguez demonstrates his leadership in BeijingCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 15, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 688 wordsBody       His childhood dream was to know the world. He could spend hours in his home library looking at the world map, says 30-year-old Andrés Rodriguez.That interest in traveling and knowing other cultures prompted him to study English from an early age and has taken him to remote places. At the age of 21, he worked for a summer for a salmon company in Alaska, with 16-hour daily days, which tested his mental limits. It comes from Ambato. However, over the past seven and a half years it has lived in one of the world's most populous cities, Beijing, with more than 22 million inhabitants today. His family nucleus is small, he grew up with his parents and a sister 10 years his senior, but his extended family is numerous; most lived in Quito.Rodríguez studied at the Catholic school Pío X, in Ambato, from where he graduated as a bachelor's degree in Chemistry-Biology. From the age of 13 he studied English at the Catholic University of Ambato. Another of his interests in adolescence was speed racing in athletics, a sport he practiced for about four years. Years later, he would put into practice what he learned as a triathlon competitor in China, specializing in Half Ironman races and Olympic distances. Last year he qualified for the Middle Ironman World Cup, which is scheduled for November, in New Zealand. Maintaining good physical condition motivated him five years ago to make the decision to be a vegetarian.He studied Business Administration at the Universidad San Francisco de Quito. From the second year he took advantage of the summer vacation to go to the United States to work and practice English. He worked for an amusement park in Ohio, a salmon packer in Alaska, and a home decorating company in Los Angeles, owned by an uncle. At the end of 2011 he ran for a postgraduate fellowship from the Chinese government and was elected. In August of the following year he arrived in Beijing to study a Master's degree in International Business, at the University of Language and Culture in Beijing. From the first month in China began to travel. He toured the center and south of the country. Also Burma, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines and Laos. Shortly after arriving in China he met Italy's Giada Esposito, his current wife and with whom he has a 6-year-old son. His plan was to settle in the Asian country. After graduating, in 2014, he began studying a PhD in Marketing and International Trade, at the University of Economics and International Business in Beijing, and quickly got a job at The China Guide, an online travel agency, where he began as an intern and ended up as a General Manager. One of his achievements for more than three years at the firm was to have helped develop the market in Spanish.Since 2018 he has worked as Marketing Manager for Bespoke Travel, a luxury and corporate tourism company in China. Its clients are diplomats, film and music artists, multinationals such as Google, Nike, Apple, among others. He also volunteers for the Startup Grind community of entrepreneurs in the Chinese capital, where he was in charge of marketing for a year and is currently Co-Director. An experience that has allowed him to train as a speaker and moderator of events. Sarah Keenlyside, CEO of Bespoke, highlights Andrew's energy and passion in her work. Jelte Ansgar, director of Startup Grind in China, looks forward to his determination to get what he wants. The connection with the start-ups community led him to develop together with Brazil's André Queme, in 2018, the LatAm-China platform, which connects entrepreneurs from Latin America and China, who are looking to grow in technology. Kaha Gogiashvili, one of his partners in the project, considers him an inspiring leader and a person with a sense of humor. "China trained me as a professional, leader, athlete and father.He taught me that despite being thousands of miles away, we have a lot in common when there is an interest in forming bridges," he says over the phone from Ambato, where he is currently conducting consultancies for Ecuadorian start-ups. His future in China is uncertain by the covid-19 emergency.       Load-Date: April 17, 2020End of Document

However, Apple users spend the most money on the app: $435.3 million out of a total of $456 million.The countries that downloaded the video viralization platform the most were India,with 611 million, representing more than 30% of the total; then China,with 197 million, and the United States with 165 million.Thus, TikTok achieves in 2020 the best quarter ever for an application with more than 315,000 installations on the App Store and Google Play, just five months after it exceeded 1.5 billion downloads."TikTok's continued rise gives it a growing foundation, not only to enjoy short-term success, but also to develop in the long run and keep competitors,both existing and emerging," SensorTower says.America's suspicions of espionageTikTok's growth remains despite U.S. suspicions. because of the enforcement ties with the Chinese government.In that sense, U.S. senators seek to pass legislationprohibiting federal employees from using TikTok on their devices."As many of our federal agencies have already acknowledged, TikTok is a big security risk in the United States,and has no place in government devices," said Republican Josh Hawley.TikTok, however, contends thatU.S. user data is stored in the United States and that China has no jurisdiction over content that is not in China.Load-Date: May 2, 2020End of Document

U.S. grants Huawei new moratorium until mid-AugustCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 15, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 317 wordsBodyWashington, 15 May (EFE).- The U.S. government extended the moratorium on Friday for the fifth time so that companies in the country can continue to do business with Huawei for 90 more days. However, pressure on China's telecommunications giant increased by restricting its access to semiconductors with U.S. technology. Commerce noted that this new extension could be the final. The new restriction announced points "strategically to the acquisition of semiconductors that are the direct product of certain U.S. technology and software." U.S. President Donald Trump's government thus gives a further twist to its pressure on Huawei.No however, it also renewed for another 90 days margin, until August 13, licensing companies that maintain commercial ties with Huawei.The U.S. executive is wary of the company's ties to the Chinese government and claims to have suspicions that Huawei could use its mobile phones and other technology equipment to spy abroad and provide the information to the leaders of the Asian country. Although the market share of Huawei mobile phones in the United States is very small (less than 1%, according to the latest data from Statcounter), the Chinese company does have a strong presence as a provider of telecommunications equipment in rural areas of the country. Its products, substantially cheaper than those of the competition, have allowed the deployment of wireless networks in large areas of the country sparsely populated where, had it not been for Huawei, these infrastructures would have been virtually unviable from a financial point of view. Of all Huawei's US suppliers, Google has a higher profile, as phones sold by the Chinese manufacturer worldwide (and which are especially popular in markets such as Latin America and Europe) have pre-installed Android operating system and services such as Chrome, Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube and the Google Play app store.Load-Date: May 16, 2020End of Document

The Latest: South Korea vice health minister urges alertnessAssociated Press InternationalApril 13, 2020 Monday 5:36 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 3186 wordsByline: By The Associated PressBodyThe Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.TOP OF THE HOUR:- South Korea vice health minister urges alertness amid slowing spread of virus- China reports 108 new cases of coronavirus, including 98 from people returning from other countries- Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe criticized on social media for 'stay home' message- New Zealand reports fifth death, 19 new cases of coronavirus- Chinese mask producer rushing to meet demands from overseas amid stricter inspections- Death toll in France nearly 14,400. But for the fourth day in a row, slightly fewer people were admitted into intensive care.___SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea's vice health minister has pleaded people to maintain alertness amid a slowing coronavirus spread, saying a quick return to pre-COVID-19 normalcy is "virtually impossible" considering a constant threat of new transmissions.Kim Gang-lip's comments during a government briefing on Monday came as officials discuss converting the country's weeks-long social distancing campaign into a more sustainable guideline that Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said would allow people to engage in "certain levels of economic and social activity."Kim stressed that the new guideline, which will be announced as early as this week, doesn't necessarily mean the end of social distancing and that a premature easing of distancing could possibly come at the "irrevocable cost" of triggering a new round of massive transmissions.South Korea on Monday reported 25 fresh cases of the new coronavirus, its 12th day in a row of below 100 cases, as infections continue to wane in the worst-hit city of Daegu.While Kim said the slowing caseload was a positive sign, he said the country will have to monitor the affect of Easter weekend and the national parliamentary election that takes place on Wednesday. There has also been concern over transmissions at leisure venues and increased crowds at parks and mass transit, which possibly indicate loosened attitudes toward distancing."When the outbreak hit Daegu, it took just one day for daily jumps in fresh cases to increase from 50 to 100 and just about a week until the numbers hit 800 to 900," Kim said."A premature easing (of social distancing) would come at an irrevocable cost, so we should approach the issue very carefully, and invest deep thought into when and how to transition (into a new guideline)."Government officials have yet to share specific details about the new guideline, but have revealed some basic principles, such as people taking three or four days off from work when sick. Critics say such recommendations would be meaningless unless enforced by law.___BEIJING - China on Monday reported 108 new cases of coronavirus infection, 98 of them imported.Of the new domestic cases, seven were recorded in the province of Heilongjiang bordering on Russia and three in the southern business bub of Guangzhou. Two more deaths were reported in the former epicenter city of Wuhan, bringing China's totals since the illness emerged in December to 3,341 deaths among 82,160 official cases.Most patients in China have recovered and the final travel restrictions in Wuhan were lifted last week. But China has continued to see new cases in travelers arriving from abroad.Social distancing, temperature checks and other measures remain in effect while businesses are reopening and people resume work and other activities.___TOKYO - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's "stay home" message he tweeted Sunday has drawn angry reactions on social networks from those calling him insensitive to people who cannot rest at home because of the government's social distancing measures that do not come with compensation.Some tweets said he acted as if "an aristocrat," and others said "What does he think he is!"A one-minute video shows Abe sitting at home, expressionless, cuddling his dog, reading a book, sipping from a cup and clicking on a remote control. The video, on a split screen, features a popular singer and actor Gen Hoshino strumming on a guitar at home, but later posted on his Instagram that his clip was used without his permission.Abe declared a state of emergency in Tokyo and six other prefectures last Tuesday, asking the people to stay home and reduce human interactions by as much as 80%, but many Japanese companies are slow to switch to remote-working and many people were seen commuting even after the declaration.As of Sunday, Japan had 7,255 confirmed cases, as well as 712 other cases from a cruise ship quarantined earlier this year.___WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand recorded its fifth death from COVID-19 but only 19 new cases Monday as the rate of fresh infections continues to show signs of diminishing.The latest death, of a man in his 80s, was the third connected with a rest home in Christchurch where several residents and staff are infected.Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said 546 people in New Zealand have recovered from the viral illness as the number of people recovering outstrips the number of new infections.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters that New Zealanders cannot expect an early end to the lockdown that includes a ban on public gatherings.Ardern said people who broke social distancing rules over the Easter holiday weekend put lives at risk."It could take one case amongst you to lead to dozens of infections and possibly death," she said.___TOKYO - Japan had 507 new confirmed cases of the virus for a national total of 7,255, plus 712 others from a cruise ship quarantined earlier this year near Tokyo, with 114 deaths. Tokyo alone had 166 cases, with a prefectural total at 2,068 cases, or about a quarter of the nation's total. Tokyo is under a state of emergency declared by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last week, along with six other prefectures.Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike went ahead and asked non-essential businesses such as hostess bars, movie theaters and schools to close until May 6, with some exceptions, beginning Saturday, but most other prefectures have fallen behind. Saitama, north of Tokyo, started non-essential business closures Monday, and its Gov. Motohiro Ono said he planned to ask the central government financial support for the prefecture's planned compensation for the business closures. Abe's government initially issued a stay at home request in the seven prefectures, and broadened it to nationwide on Saturday, but wants non-business closures to wait until effects of the stay home request are evaluated.___SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea has reported 25 new cases of the coronavirus and three more virus-related deaths, bringing its totals to 10,537 infections and 217 fatalities.South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday said at least 929 cases were linked to passengers arriving from abroad, with most of them detected over the past three weeks.South Korea's caseload has slowed from early March, when it was reporting around 500 new cases a day, but officials have raised concerns over a broader "quiet spread," pointing to transmissions at bars and other leisure facilities that supposedly indicate eased attitudes toward social distancing.South Korean Prime Minster Chung Sye-kyun during a meeting on anti-virus strategies on Monday said officials are discussing new public guidelines that would allow for people to engage in "certain levels of economic and social activity" while also maintaining distance to slow the spread of the virus.___BEIJING -- China's foreign ministry says it is working with authorities in the southern province of Guangdong to prevent discriminatory treatment toward people of African heritage amid the coronavirus outbreak.The statement issued Sunday followed a letter of caution from the U.S. Embassy that police in the province have ordered bars and restaurants not to serve clients who appear to be of African origin and that some hotels and companies have refused to do business with them."Moreover, local officials launched a round of mandatory tests for COVID-19, followed by mandatory self-quarantine, for anyone with 'African contacts,' regardless of recent travel history or previous quarantine completion," the notice from the Embassy said. It urged those with African backgrounds to especially avoid the provincial capital of Guangzhou, which has a large African population of migrant traders.In its statement, the foreign ministry said all foreigners were treated equally during the outbreak and the government had "zero tolerance for discrimination."Authorities in Guangdong were "working promptly to improve their working method," the ministry said."African friends can count on getting fair, just, cordial and friendly reception in China. The foreign ministry will stay in close communication with the Guangdong authorities and continue responding to the African side's reasonable concerns and legitimate appeals," the statement said.___WUHAN, China - One mask producer in China says it is rushing to fill orders from overseas while facing stricter quality inspections from Chinese regulators.Wuhan Zonsen, which makes masks and disinfection wipes, says $50 million in orders from European countries and the United States will keep them at full production capacity until June."Now the major demand of masks comes from European countries and the US where the epidemic is severe ... their demand now has increased to 10 times than before because of the epidemic," said Cynthia Ye, global marketing manager of Zonsen.Zonsen plans to add another five production lines to increase their daily production from 200,000 to 700,000 masks, Zonsen's production managers told reporters during a media tour organized by Wuhan government.Chinese customs have announced that ventilators, masks and other supplies being exported to fight the coronavirus will be subject to quality inspections following complaints that substandard goods were being sold abroad. Regulators in Australia, the Netherlands and other countries have complained that masks, virus test kits and other products were faulty or failed to meet quality standards.Ye denied there are any quality issues with the masks they had shipped to Netherlands.Wuhan on Wednesday ended its 76-day lockdown, allowing residents to again travel in and out of the city. Wuhan and China are expected to suffer severe economic costs and tens of millions of job losses from the city closure.Ye said the government of Xinzhou district, where Zonsen is located, offered aid to meet the company's demand for workers. Now more than 60 employees are back to work and live together in a designated hotel to avoid infection."We have to provide hotel rooms for the workers so we have more cost, which is about five to 10 times of our normal cost. The salary for workers is about three or five times of their normal one," said Ye.___PARIS - The overall death toll in France from the coronavirus has risen to nearly 14,400, but for the fourth day in a row, slightly fewer people were admitted into intensive care - 35 fewer - giving health officials a reason to grasp for good news.Sunday's statistics issued by the Health Ministry confirm the country is reaching a "very high plateau" and reflect initial signs that nearly four weeks of confinement and the "drastic reduction in contacts" are producing an effect, a statement said.Strict confinement measures began March 17, were renewed once and are expected to be extended again, with a likely announcement to the nation Monday by President Emmanuel Macron.Since March 1, hospitals and nursing homes have counted 14,393 deaths.Of the 31,836 people currently hospitalized for COVID-19, more than 1,600 were admitted in the past 24 hours, the Health Ministry said.Still, with more than 6,800 patients being treated in intensive care Sunday, that was 35 people fewer than a day earlier, a ray of hope for overworked health workers and authorities looking for small signs of change.Since the start of the epidemic in France, more than 95,400 people have been infected.___ROME - Italy recorded the lowest number of new coronavirus deaths in three weeks, saying 431 people died in the past day to bring its total to 19,899.It was the lowest day-to-day toll since March 19.For the ninth day running, intensive care admissions were down and hospitalizations overall were down, relieving pressure on Italy's over-stressed health care system.More than 4,000 people tested positive as Italy began its fifth week under nationwide lockdown, continuing a general flattening in its infection curve.But officials have noted that Italy has also increased its testing capacity in recent days, yielding more positive cases but allowing for more effective quarantine measures for people once they know they are infected.Italy crossed the 1 million virus test mark on Sunday, doubling the number of tests since the end of March. Overall, 156,363 people have been confirmed as positive, though officials note that the true number of infected could be as much as 10 times that, particularly in hard-hit Lombardy.Officials have also warned that the true number of dead from the virus pandemic is higher, given the hundreds of elderly who have died in nursing homes but were never tested.___JERUSALEM - Hospital officials say Rabbi Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron, a former chief rabbi of Israel, has died from COVID-19.Jerusalem's Shaare Zedek Medical Center said Bakshi-Doron died late Sunday, several days after he was admitted to the hospital with the coronavirus. It said he had suffered from underlying health problems. Israeli media said Bakshi-Doron was 79.Bakshi-Doron served as Israel's chief Sephardic rabbi, representing Jews of Middle Eastern ancestry, from 1993 to 2003. He held a number of other key roles, including the head of Israel's rabbinic court system, and was active in interfaith causes.In 2017, he was fined and sentenced to probation for his role in a scheme that allowed policemen to receive fraudulent educational credentials that enabled them to obtain pay raises. He remained a popular and respected figure with much of the public.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remembered Bakshi-Doron as a warm person and a gifted religious scholar. "His essence was wisdom, tolerance and love for the people and the country," he said.Israel has reported more than 11,000 cases of the coronavirus, and 104 deaths. Israel's ultra-Orthodox religious community has been especially hard hit.___NEW ORLEANS - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says an influx of tourists for Mardi Gras may be a reason why Louisiana experienced a higher rate of COVID-19 cases than other Southern states.In a report posted Friday, the CDC says population density might play "a significant role in the acceleration of transmission" of the coronavirus. It said Louisiana experienced a "temporarily high" population density because of Carnival season visitors.It also noted the season ended Feb. 25 - well before federal calls to discourage mass gatherings in mid-March.Louisiana reported 34 newly recorded coronavirus-related deaths Sunday, bringing the death toll in the state to 840.___ATHENS, Greece - There were five more fatalities from COVID-19 in the past 24 hours in Greece, all men, raising the total to 98, authorities say.There are now a total of 2,114 confirmed cases of the disease, 33 added since Saturday afternoon.There are 76 people hooked to ventilator machines, while 15 patients that had been in intensive care have recovered, authorities in a statement.The main concern of authorities remains individuals' attempts to flout strict quarantine measures, during the Orthodox Easter, which is celebrated next Sunday.It is usually a time of mass exodus to the countryside and, just over 9 hours on Sunday, 38 people were stopped trying to leave cities and fined 300 euros each.A related concern is church gatherings, now banned; on Sunday, Palm Sunday, the government asked for a prosecutor to indict two priests who provided communion to the faithful despite the ban.One of them, in an Athens neighborhood, was photographed from a nearby building secretly giving communion to faithful through the back door.___SALEM, Oregon - The coronavirus has had a devastating impact on nine long-term care facilities in Oregon, killing at least 24 people among 171 who have tested positive.The fatalities represent almost half the total number of people in Oregon known to have died of COVID-19, according to data from state officials released late Saturday.In one facility alone, Healthcare at Foster Creek in Portland, nine of 35 people who became infected died, according to an announcement from the state coronavirus Joint Information Center.___Though the United States federal government has not been releasing a count of its own, an Associated Press tally from media reports and state health departments indicate at least 2,755 deaths have been linked to coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities nationwide.___LONDON - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has posted a video on Twitter in which he hails the staff in the National Health Service for saving his life when it could have "gone either way."Johnson was dressed in a suit and looked and sounded assured in the video made after his discharge from St. Thomas' Hospital in London. He said he did not have the words to properly thank the staff at NHS for"saving my life."He listed a number of the frontline staff who cared for him over a week at St. Thomas' Hospital in London but singled out two nurses who stood by his bedside for 48 hours "when things could have gone either way."He said Jenny from New Zealand and Luis from Portugal were the reason "in the end my body did start to get enough oxygen."Johnson said there are "hundreds of thousands of NHS staff who are acting with the same care and thought and precision as Jenny and Luis."Johnson spent a week at St. Thomas', three days of which were in intensive care. He was given oxygen but was not put on a ventilator.___WASHINGTON - The United States' top infectious disease expert says the economy in parts of the country could be allowed to reopen as early as next month.Dr. Anthony Fauci says there's no light switch that will be clicked to turn everything back on. He says a "rolling re-entry" will be required based on the status of the new coronavirus pandemic in various parts of the country.Fauci says those factors include the region of the country, the nature of the outbreak it already has experienced and the possible threat of an outbreak to come.Social distancing guidelines imposed by President Donald Trump are set to expire April 30.Trump is eager to restart the economy, which has stalled because most Americans are under orders to "stay at home" to help slow the virus' spread.Fauci spoke Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union."___Follow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and            https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreakLoad-Date: April 14, 2020End of Document

The Latest: South Korea vice health minister urges alertnessAssociated Press Financial WireApril 13, 2020 Monday 5:36 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 3186 wordsByline: By The Associated PressBodyThe Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.TOP OF THE HOUR:- South Korea vice health minister urges alertness amid slowing spread of virus- China reports 108 new cases of coronavirus, including 98 from people returning from other countries- Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe criticized on social media for 'stay home' message- New Zealand reports fifth death, 19 new cases of coronavirus- Chinese mask producer rushing to meet demands from overseas amid stricter inspections- Death toll in France nearly 14,400. But for the fourth day in a row, slightly fewer people were admitted into intensive care.___SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea's vice health minister has pleaded people to maintain alertness amid a slowing coronavirus spread, saying a quick return to pre-COVID-19 normalcy is "virtually impossible" considering a constant threat of new transmissions.Kim Gang-lip's comments during a government briefing on Monday came as officials discuss converting the country's weeks-long social distancing campaign into a more sustainable guideline that Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said would allow people to engage in "certain levels of economic and social activity."Kim stressed that the new guideline, which will be announced as early as this week, doesn't necessarily mean the end of social distancing and that a premature easing of distancing could possibly come at the "irrevocable cost" of triggering a new round of massive transmissions.South Korea on Monday reported 25 fresh cases of the new coronavirus, its 12th day in a row of below 100 cases, as infections continue to wane in the worst-hit city of Daegu.While Kim said the slowing caseload was a positive sign, he said the country will have to monitor the affect of Easter weekend and the national parliamentary election that takes place on Wednesday. There has also been concern over transmissions at leisure venues and increased crowds at parks and mass transit, which possibly indicate loosened attitudes toward distancing."When the outbreak hit Daegu, it took just one day for daily jumps in fresh cases to increase from 50 to 100 and just about a week until the numbers hit 800 to 900," Kim said."A premature easing (of social distancing) would come at an irrevocable cost, so we should approach the issue very carefully, and invest deep thought into when and how to transition (into a new guideline)."Government officials have yet to share specific details about the new guideline, but have revealed some basic principles, such as people taking three or four days off from work when sick. Critics say such recommendations would be meaningless unless enforced by law.___BEIJING - China on Monday reported 108 new cases of coronavirus infection, 98 of them imported.Of the new domestic cases, seven were recorded in the province of Heilongjiang bordering on Russia and three in the southern business bub of Guangzhou. Two more deaths were reported in the former epicenter city of Wuhan, bringing China's totals since the illness emerged in December to 3,341 deaths among 82,160 official cases.Most patients in China have recovered and the final travel restrictions in Wuhan were lifted last week. But China has continued to see new cases in travelers arriving from abroad.Social distancing, temperature checks and other measures remain in effect while businesses are reopening and people resume work and other activities.___TOKYO - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's "stay home" message he tweeted Sunday has drawn angry reactions on social networks from those calling him insensitive to people who cannot rest at home because of the government's social distancing measures that do not come with compensation.Some tweets said he acted as if "an aristocrat," and others said "What does he think he is!"A one-minute video shows Abe sitting at home, expressionless, cuddling his dog, reading a book, sipping from a cup and clicking on a remote control. The video, on a split screen, features a popular singer and actor Gen Hoshino strumming on a guitar at home, but later posted on his Instagram that his clip was used without his permission.Abe declared a state of emergency in Tokyo and six other prefectures last Tuesday, asking the people to stay home and reduce human interactions by as much as 80%, but many Japanese companies are slow to switch to remote-working and many people were seen commuting even after the declaration.As of Sunday, Japan had 7,255 confirmed cases, as well as 712 other cases from a cruise ship quarantined earlier this year.___WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand recorded its fifth death from COVID-19 but only 19 new cases Monday as the rate of fresh infections continues to show signs of diminishing.The latest death, of a man in his 80s, was the third connected with a rest home in Christchurch where several residents and staff are infected.Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said 546 people in New Zealand have recovered from the viral illness as the number of people recovering outstrips the number of new infections.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters that New Zealanders cannot expect an early end to the lockdown that includes a ban on public gatherings.Ardern said people who broke social distancing rules over the Easter holiday weekend put lives at risk."It could take one case amongst you to lead to dozens of infections and possibly death," she said.___TOKYO - Japan had 507 new confirmed cases of the virus for a national total of 7,255, plus 712 others from a cruise ship quarantined earlier this year near Tokyo, with 114 deaths. Tokyo alone had 166 cases, with a prefectural total at 2,068 cases, or about a quarter of the nation's total. Tokyo is under a state of emergency declared by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last week, along with six other prefectures.Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike went ahead and asked non-essential businesses such as hostess bars, movie theaters and schools to close until May 6, with some exceptions, beginning Saturday, but most other prefectures have fallen behind. Saitama, north of Tokyo, started non-essential business closures Monday, and its Gov.

Abe's government initially issued a stay at home request in the seven prefectures, and broadened it to nationwide on Saturday, but wants non-business closures to wait until effects of the stay home request are evaluated.___SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea has reported 25 new cases of the coronavirus and three more virus-related deaths, bringing its totals to 10,537 infections and 217 fatalities.South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday said at least 929 cases were linked to passengers arriving from abroad, with most of them detected over the past three weeks.South Korea's caseload has slowed from early March, when it was reporting around 500 new cases a day, but officials have raised concerns over a broader "quiet spread," pointing to transmissions at bars and other leisure facilities that supposedly indicate eased attitudes toward social distancing.South Korean Prime Minster Chung Sye-kyun during a meeting on anti-virus strategies on Monday said officials are discussing new public guidelines that would allow for people to engage in "certain levels of economic and social activity" while also maintaining distance to slow the spread of the virus.___BEIJING -- China's foreign ministry says it is working with authorities in the southern province of Guangdong to prevent discriminatory treatment toward people of African heritage amid the coronavirus outbreak.The statement issued Sunday followed a letter of caution from the U.S. Embassy that police in the province have ordered bars and restaurants not to serve clients who appear to be of African origin and that some hotels and companies have refused to do business with them."Moreover, local officials launched a round of mandatory tests for COVID-19, followed by mandatory self-quarantine, for anyone with 'African contacts,' regardless of recent travel history or previous quarantine completion," the notice from the Embassy said.

The head of the US Army spoke about the origin of the coronavirus: "The weight of the evidence seems to indicate that it is natural"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 15, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 397 wordsBodyU.S. intelligence indicated that coronavirus probably appeared naturally, and was not created in a lab in China, but there is no certainty, the U.S. top general said Tuesday.Statements by Army General Mark Milley, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, could stoke speculation about the origin of the coronavirus, which China has dismissed as conspiracy theories that do not help the fight against the pandemic.When asked at a press conference if he had any evidence that the virus may have started in a Chinese lab and was accidentally released, Milley was evasive."There are a lot of rumors and speculations on a wide variety of media, blogging sites and others. It should come as no surprise that we've been very interested and that there's a lot of intelligence paying attention," Milley said at a press conference.A Chinese government protocol worker adjusts the flags of China and the US before a press conference at the Great Hall of people in Beijing, China.

But we don't know for sure," he added.As early as February, the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), backed by the Chinese state, rejected rumors that the virus could have been artificially synthesized in one of its laboratories or left.The coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan, China.A Washington Post opinion column published Tuesday said the U.S. State Department had warned in 2018 of diplomatic cables of the security and management weaknesses of a WIV lab.A woman is taken to an ambulance by paramedics at a health center in Brooklyn during the coronavirus outbreak (COVID19) in New York.

RUBIO, RISCH, GARDNER: CCP EFFORTS TO ERODE HONG KONG'S AUTONOMY ARE OF GRAVE CONCERN TO THE U.S.States News ServiceMay 21, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 304 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Jim Risch, Chairman of the Senate Committee of Foreign Relations, and Cory Gardner (R-CO) released the following statement regarding reports that the National People's Congress will introduce legislation this week to implement Article 23 of the Hong Kong Basic Law, and other concerns about recent steps by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to undermine Hong Kong's autonomy:"Reports that the CCP will introduce legislation implementing Article 23 of the Hong Kong Basic Law at this week's National People's Congress indicate Beijing will begin an unprecedented assault against Hong Kong's autonomy. The Basic Law states clearly that the authority to advance Article 23 legislation rests with the executive and legislative branches of the Hong Kong government, and not with Beijing. The Chinese government is once again breaking its promises to the people of Hong Kong and the international community."This comes on the heels of a series of other serious blows to Hong Kong's self-rule in recent weeks, including the advocacy of a law criminalizing disrespect of the national anthem of the People's Republic of China and pressure on Hong Kong's legislature that led to the sidelining of pro-democracy legislators."The United States will stand resolute in its support of the Hong Kong people. These developments are of grave concern to the United States, and could lead to a significant reassessment on U.S. policy towards Hong Kong."Rubio is Cochair of the bipartisan and bicameral Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations' Subcommittee that oversees human rights, and is a member of the Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy.Load-Date: May 22, 2020End of Document

New U.S. Commerce Dept. rule to further hamper HuaweiUPIMay 15, 2020 Friday 2:58 PM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 331 wordsByline: DANIELLE HAYNESDateline: May 15 BodyThe U.S. Commerce Department on Friday implemented plans to block China's Huawei Technologies from obtaining foreign-made semiconductors built using U.S. technology.It's the latest effort by the Trump administration to prevent the company from doing business in the United States amid a battle for technological dominance with China.In 2019, the Bureau of Industry and Security added Huawei to a list of foreign entities required to obtain a license to import U.S. items. The agency said Friday that the company has undermined that rule by importing non-U.S.-made items that are made using U.S. software and technology, such as semiconductors."This is not how a responsible global corporate citizen behaves," Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said. "We must amend our rules exploited by Huawei and HiSilicon and prevent U.S. technologies from enabling malign activities contrary to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests."CNBC reported that the rule will hit chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., a key Huawei supplier.TSMC announced plans Friday to build an Arizona-based plant. The company already has a manufacturing plant in Washington, and design centers in Texas and California.In February 2018, U.S. intelligence officials advised Americans against using cellphones by Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese telecom company, warning that they may pose security risks, including allowing spying by the Chinese government.In May of the same year, the Pentagon announced it would ban the sale of all smartphones made by Huawei and ZTE from all U.S. military bases worldwide.The 2019 National Defense Authorization Act then included a provision that prevented federal agencies and contractors from buying certain products from the companies.Huawei has repeatedly denied any risks and in a lawsuit said the ban is based on "numerous false, unproven and untested propositions" and that the U.S. government failed to provide evidence Huawei products pose a security risk.Load-Date: May 15, 2020End of Document

'No Company Is Perfect': Huawei Execs Respond To Allegations Employees Are Helping Surveil DissidentsThe Daily CallerMarch 5, 2020 Thursday 04:59 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; techLength: 632 wordsByline: Chris White, Tech Reporter, chris@dailycallernewsfoundation.orgChris is a Missourian trying to find news angles in the blank spaces of life. Also go Chiefs!Author ImageBodyLink to ImageHuawei executives said in a report Wednesday that they are unable to ensure that their company's employees are not assisting countries surveil political dissidents in foreign countries.“No company is perfect,” Chief Security Officer Andy Purdy said in a CyberScoop report after being asked whether Huawei can ensure that its employees refrain from helping countries surveil opponents.He did say the company has made improvements in boosting its ethics.“It's a major challenge within companies,” Purdy said. “I think in the last years I've been there we've dramatically improved our ability to have strong ethics and compliance.” (RELATED: Report Reveals Role Huawei Had In Transporting US Tech To Iran)Purdy and vice president of Risk Management and Partner Relations Tim Danks addressed other issues as well. Purdy, for instance, suggested Huawei doesn't keep tabs on how companies use the Chinese tech giant's products.“Generally around the world, we sell our products ... we don't know where this stuff is going to be used ... I just don't know,” he said. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2019 that Huawei employees assisted Uganda and Zambia in their attempts to surveil dissidents. The company said at the time that “its employees have not been engaged in any of the activities alleged.”Purdy appeared to strike a slightly different note, telling CyberScoop that “no company can guarantee that individual employees won't do bad things.” Danks, for his part, criticized the U.S. government, suggesting American officials are fear mongering.“There's a lot of sowing of FUD - fear, uncertainty and doubt - by putting something out like this,” Danks said when asked whether Huawei created a backdoor in mobile networks for the Chinese government. Purdy is a former Department of Homeland Security official and Danks is a long-time Huawei executive.CyberScoop's report comes a day after Reuters reported Tuesday that Huawei produced records 10 years ago that appear to show the telecommunications giant was directly involved in sending U.S. technology parts to Iranian phone companies.Link to ImageU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is welcomed by Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson (Photo by Tolga Akmen- WPA Pool/Getty Images)Huawei used Hewlett-Packard Co as a middleman to deliver parts to Iran's largest mobile-phone operator, Reuters reported, citing documents dated 2010. Another memo two months later reportedly states: “Currently the equipment is delivered to Tehran, and waiting for the custom clearance.”All of this comes as President Donald Trump and U.S. officials are applying pressure on foreign nations to avoid using Huawei's technology to build out fifth-generation mobile service. Trump            says Huawei represents a threat to national security, warning Beijing could direct the company to spy on Americans.Trump's attempts have met with varying degrees of success. British officials, for instance, announced in January that they plan to allow Huawei limited access to the country's 5G networks, effectively dismissing U.S. pressure to avoid the telecommunications giant.China has reportedly spent $24 billion more on wireless communications infrastructure since 2015 than the U.S. The country also            built more 5G towers in a three-month span in 2017 than the U.S. did in three years. There are also            concerns that Huawei's and ZTE's close ties to China leave the U.S. open to cyberattacks.Huawei has not responded to the Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Continue reading Tencent to invest US$70 billion in new digital infrastructure, backing Beijing s economic stimulus effortsThe five-year plan will have Tencent focus on fields that include cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology and the Internet of ThingsOther investments will go to infrastructure such as advanced servers, supercomputers, data centres and 5G mobile networksChinese internet giantTencent Holdingsplans to invest 500 billion yuan (US$70 billion) over the next five years in new digital infrastructure, a major hi-tech initiative that would bolster Beijing's efforts to drive economic recovery in the post-coronavirus era.That massive investment will focus on fields that include           cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI),           blockchain technologyand Internet of Things, as well as the infrastructure to support them like advanced servers, supercomputers, data centres and 5G mobile networks, according to an announcement on Tencent's official WeChat account on Tuesday.Shenzhen-based Tencent's new digital infrastructure programme followed its move to raise fresh capital for general corporate purposes. The company plans to issue medium-term notes, with a maximum limit of US$20 billion, to certain professional investors, according to its filing with the Hong Kong stock exchange on Monday. It said US$12 billion of these notes were already outstanding.The company's infrastructure programme includes development across the country of a new network of large-scale data centres, with a million servers deployed at each site, according to the company's WeChat post. That would follow the company's construction of itslargest data centre complexon a 51-hectare site, which includes more than 30,000 square metres of tunnelled areas inside a 100-metre-high hill, in southwest Guizhou province. Citing an interview of           senior executive vice-president Tong Taosangwith state-owned newspaperGuangming Daily, the Tencent post said the company will also escalate collaborations with  internal scientific research experts and laboratory resources at top universities  to cultivate talent, tackle scientific issues and take part in the formulation of industry standards.A Tencent representative said the company does not have any further details to share beyond its WeChat post.The latest initiative by Tencent,which runs the world's biggest video games business by revenue and China's largest social media platform, represents a strong commitment from the nation's hi-tech sector to support economic recovery, following the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 outbreak across the country and around the world. This new infrastructure is set to play a more important role amid the global economic slowdown, the disrupted supply chains as well as weak domestic and foreign demand,  said Pang Ming, head of macro and strategic research at China Renaissance Securities. He indicated that the scale of new digital infrastructure investments could grow larger, as more companies pursue a similar strategy as Tencent and invest in data centres, AI, advanced communications and other hi-tech programmes.Such moves would follow the direction set by Premier Li Keqiang last Friday, when he announced details of the Chinese government'sfiscal stimulus package of nearly 3.6 trillion yuanat the National People's Congress. Beijing will also issue 1 trillion yuan of special treasury bonds for the first time since 2007 as part of that programme.In March, Tencent's Tong highlighted the company's intent to  explore the value of digital infrastructure  across different industries.Tencent already ranks among nine major tech companies in the world that aredriving the future of AI and development of critical digital infrastructure, according to a recent report by American think tank Future Today Institute. The other firms are Google, Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com, Facebook, IBM Corp, Apple, Baidu and Alibaba Group Holding, the parent company of theSouth China Morning PostSee Campaign:https://www.scmp.com/topics/tencentContact Information:Iris Deng and Celia ChenTags:,           Wire,           United States,           EnglishLoad-Date: June 1, 2020End of Document

The market appeared on track for another day of gains paced by longer tenors after the overnight session saw more signs of deteriorating U.S.-China relations and poor economic data from Europe. The U.S. Senate unanimously voted in favor of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act last night, followed by news that the Commerce Department extended the ban on U.S. companies doing business with Huawei for another year. At the same time, rules for granting special exemptions were tightened. Separate reports of U.S. officials blocking a shipment of chips intended for Huawei suggested that the updated rules were already being enforced. Treasuries extended their starting gains in immediate response to the April Retail Sales report (actual -16.4%; Briefing.com consensus -11.9%), which was even worse than expected. Treasuries backed down from their highs shortly after the post-data spike, spending the rest of the day in a steady pullback as equities fought to reclaim their losses. The long bond paced the early advance, but it also ended up leading the pullback after this week's show of relative strength. The 2s10s spread narrowed by five basis points to 49 bps since last Friday. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.1% to 100.40, narrowing this week's gain to 0.7%. Yield Check: 2-yr: +1 bp to 0.15% (-1 bp for the week) 3-yr: +2 bps to 0.19% (UNCH for the week) 5-yr: +1 bp to 0.31% (-2 bps for the week) 10-yr: +2 bps to 0.64% (-4 bps for the week) 30-yr: +2 bps to 1.32% (-7 bps for the week)News: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company will establish an advanced chip foundry in Arizona. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York will reduce its daily purchases of Treasuries to $6 bln from $7 bln next week. Japan's Finance Minister, Taro Aso, said that the draft for a second extra budget will be prepared on May 27. Germany's government is reportedly open to allowing public debt to exceed 80% of GDP to fund fiscal stimulus. The Italian government will relax lockdown measures on Monday and allow travel between regions on June 3. China's April Industrial Production increased 3.9% yr/yr (expected 1.5%; last -1.1%), April Retail Sales fell 7.5% yr/yr (expected -7.0%; last -15.8%), April Fixed Asset Investment fell 10.3% yr/yr (expected -10.0%; last -16.1%), and April Unemployment Rate ticked up to 6.0% from 5.9%. Hong Kong's Q1 GDP fell 5.3% qtr/qtr, as expected (last -0.3%), contracting 8.9% yr/yr, as expected (last -2.9%). South Korea's April trade deficit totaled $1.39 bln (last deficit of $950 mln). Imports fell 15.8% yr/yr (last -15.9%) while exports fell 25.1% yr/yr (last -24.3%). Eurozone's Q1 GDP contracted 3.8% qtr/qtr, as expected (last -3.8%), falling 3.2% yr/yr (expected -3.3%; last -3.3%). Q1 Employment decreased 0.2% qtr/qtr (expected -0.4%; last 0.3%). Germany's Q1 GDP fell 2.2% qtr/qtr, as expected (last -0.1%), contracting 1.9% yr/yr (expected -1.6%; last 0.2%). Italy's March Industrial New Orders plunged 26.5% m/m (last -4.1%) while Industrial Sales fell 25.8% m/m (last -1.7%). Today's Data: Total retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) while retail sales, excluding autos, declined 17.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%). The sales downturn was extreme with double-digit declines in most categories. The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment. Industrial production declined 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%), which was the largest monthly drop in the 101-year history of the index. The capacity utilization rate fell from 73.2% to 64.9% (Briefing.com consensus 64.0%), which is 14.9 percentage points below its long-run average and a record-low in a series that dates back to 1967. The key takeaway from the report is that it is a reflection of how industrial production cratered amid shutdown orders designed to contain the spread of COVID-19. On a yr/yr basis, industrial production was down 15.0%. The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 73.7 in the preliminary reading for May (Briefing.com consensus 67.4) from 71.8 in April. The key takeaway from the report is that attitudes about current conditions improved while sentiment surrounding the outlook continued to deteriorate, pinched by concerns about financial prospects that were most notable among upper income households. That is apt to be a headwind for a pickup in consumer spending. Business Inventories decreased 0.2% in March (Briefing.com consensus -0.4%) after decreasing a revised 0.5% (from -0.4%) in February. Job Openings decreased to 6.191 mln in March from a revised 7.004 mln (from 6.882 mln) in February. The Empire State Manufacturing Survey increased to -48.5 in May (Briefing.com consensus -58.0) from -78.2 in April.

The long bond has maintained its lead on the way down after it also paced the starting advance. The recent selling has lifted the 30-yr yield toward its closing level from Wednesday while the 10-yr yield has also returned to its closing level from two days ago. The U.S. Dollar Index has trimmed its loss to 0.1% at 100.35 while equities remain below their rebound highs.

The capacity utilization rate fell from 73.2% to 64.9% (Briefing.com consensus 64.0%), which is 14.9 percentage points below its long-run average and a record-low in a series that dates back to 1967. The key takeaway from the report is that it is a reflection of how industrial production cratered amid shutdown orders designed to contain the spread of COVID-19. On a yr/yr basis, industrial production was down 15.0%. Manufacturing output declined 13.7% -- the biggest drop on record. The index for durable manufacturing dropped 19.3%, with the shutdown of motor vehicle assembly plants having a huge impact there. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of motor vehicle assemblies was just 0.18 million versus 7.18 million in March and 11.37 million in February. Mining output declined 6.1%. Utilities output declined 0.9%.The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 73.7 in the preliminary reading for May (Briefing.com consensus 67.4) from 71.8 in April. The key takeaway from the report is that attitudes about current conditions improved while sentiment surrounding the outlook continued to deteriorate, pinched by concerns about financial prospects that were most notable among upper income households. That is apt to be a headwind for a pickup in consumer spending. The Current Economic Conditions Index increased to 83.0 from 74.3.

Treasuries followed their upbeat start with a push to fresh highs, but a pullback began taking shape just 20 minutes after the start. Treasuries have remained on the defensive since then, hitting lows in recent trade. Longer tenors outperformed at the start, but that relative strength has faded in recent trade. Elsewhere, equities have climbed off their opening lows with the S&P 500 narrowing its loss to just 0.1%.

EUR/USD:1.0794Longer Tenors Continue Recent StrengthU.S. Treasuries are set to remain on a path that has been established this week after overnight action saw continued strength in longer-dated Treasury futures. Treasury futures climbed steadily during the Asian session, backtracking from highs as attention turned to Europe. However, the short-lived pullback was followed by a push to fresh highs in recent trade. The market has been focused on the latest series of signs of a deteriorating U.S.-China relationship. The U.S. Senate unanimously voted in favor of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act last night, which is certain to invite at least a verbal response from China's Communist Party. In addition, the Trump administration will block Huawei from receiving shipments that are a "direct product of certain U.S. software and technology." That was not all, as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company agreed to build an advanced chip foundry in Arizona for $12 bln. This move is likely to strengthen U.S. relations with Taiwan, which is also sure to upset the Chinese government. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% at 100.41.

USD/JPY:107.23.. EUR/USD:1.078Holding a bidU.S. Treasuries held a pretty steady bid before easing up some late in the cash session as a stock market rebound effort gathered some steam. Longer-dated tenors fared best, but in general, Treasuries were supported by underlying growth concerns following an otherwise dismal initial jobless claims report, expectations that the Fed may ultimately have to increase its asset purchases, and some safe-haven posturing as European equity markets turned in a poor showing. The greenback continued to run against other major currencies, evidenced by a 0.2% increase in the U.S. Dollar Index to 100.47, which is a five-week high.Yield Check: 2-yr: -1 bp to 0.14% 3-yr: -2 bps to 0.18% 5-yr: -3 bps to 0.29% 10-yr: -3 bps to 0.62% 30-yr: -4 bps to 1.30%News: The New York Fed will stop conducting three-month term repurchase operations next month.President Trump says he won't renegotiate the trade deal with ChinaThe Trump administration will keep 90-day supply of medical supplies in the national stockpile, according to BloombergWhite House privately signals they are willing to support some state aid as part of bipartisan deal with Democrats, according to Washington PostWhite House repeats that they are open to a phase four stimulus bill, but they reject the bill from House Democrats - CNBCDelta Air Lines currently has 14,000 pilots on staff and will be overstaffed by 7,000 or more pilots by the Fall - CNBC, citing company memo Bank of England Governor, Andrew Bailey, said that the BoE is ready to finance coronavirus-related expenses.Australia's April employment plunged by 594,300 (expected -575,000; last 5,900) and full employment decreased by 220,500 (last -400,000). Today's data:Total jobless claims for the week ending May 9 were 2,981,000 (Briefing.com consensus 2.475 million). That was a decrease of 195,000 from the prior week, but still an exceedingly high number all things considered. Continuing claims for the week ending May 2 increased by 456,000 to 22.833 million, which is yet another record high.The key takeaway from the report is that the alarmingly high level of initial and continuing claims paints a risk of a slower recovery due to weaker consumer spending activity and the rising potential that temporary job losses become permanent job losses in an elongated recovery process.April export prices -3.3%m/m; ex-agricultural products -3.3% m/mApril import prices -2.6% m/m; nonfuel import prices -0.5% m/mCommodities: WTI Crude: +8.5% to $27.44/bbl Gold: +1.3% to $1738.80/ozt Copper: unch at $2.35/lb Currencies: EUR/USD: -0.3% to 1.0781GBP/USD: -0.3% to 1.2192USD/CNH: +0.1% to 7.1184USD/JPY: +0.2% to 107.23The Day Ahead: 08:30 ET: April Retail Sales (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%; Prior -8.7%); ex-auto (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%; Prior -4.5%)08:30 ET: May Empire State Manufacturing (Briefing.com consensus -58.0; Prior -78.2)09:15 ET: April Industrial Production (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%; Prior -5.4%) and Capacity Utilization (Briefing.com consensus 64.0%; Prior 72.7%)10:00 ET: March Business Inventories (Briefing.com consensus -0.4%; Prior -0.4%)10:00 ET: March JOLTS - Job Openings (Prior 6.882M)10:00 ET: May University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index - Prelim.

Impact of COVID-19 on the Global Renewable Energy Industry - Due to Decreasing Prices of Crude Oil, the Demand for Renewable Energy Can Decrease in the Near FutureGlobeNewswireApril 16, 2020 Thursday 4:58 AM PTCopyright 2020 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTSLength: 1086 wordsBodyDublin, April  16, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The     "Impact of COVID-19 on Global Renewable Energy Industry"   report has been added to     ResearchAndMarkets.com's  offering.         The global renewable energy industry includes solar, wind, hydro, biofuels and others, that are less carbon-intensive and create a more sustainable renewable energy system. The factors that were fueling the growth of the renewable energy market before the COVID-19 pandemic include rising concern about the safety of the environment coupled with a growing energy crisis. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness offered using renewable energy is also contributing significantly to the growth of the global renewable energy market.However, with the outbreak of COVID-19 since December 2019, the market of global renewable energy has shown discouraging growth rates. The COVID-19 virus was novel in nature and hence the government organizations across the globe published guidelines to quarantine oneself from the crowd and stay at home. Due to lockdowns, the global supply chains are affected and a considerable slowdown in production was observed. Sectors such as the wind industry are experiencing logistical delays. The logistic delays are resulting in delays in new project development. Moreover, due to the decrease in prices of crude oil, the demand for renewable energy can decrease in the near future.The global renewable energy industry report is segmented into the solar panel industry, wind power industry, hydropower industry, and other industries. Out of which solar panel industry is expected to get affected significantly due to the pandemic. The effect of COVID-19 on the renewable energy industry can be observed in all regions such as North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Rest of the World. In China, the renewable power sector is experiencing the impact of the COVID-19, specifically wind and solar PV, which could witness lower capacity additions due to suspended manufacturing and construction works. China is one of the significant countries for solar PV installations and the production of solar PV panels. The country has the largest installed solar power capacity of more than 205 GW by 2019, contributing more than 35% of the global installations.

Impact of COVID-19 on the Taxi and Limousine Services Market- TBRC Report InsightsPR NewswireMay 7, 2020 Thursday 11:30 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 958 wordsDateline: LONDON, May 7, 2020 BodyPR NewswireThe coronavirus pandemic has affected the taxi and limousine services market across many countries. In most of the states in the USA, shops and businesses have shuttered and offices have emptied out, and this has resulted in less demand for taxi services. For instance, in New York, yellow-cab owners and drivers estimate that their fares have dropped by more than two-thirds in March 2020, due to less demand for cabs. Ride-hailing companies Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. are experiencing the pressure from the coronavirus pandemic. According to the Canaccord Genuity pricing tracker, ride-share fares dropped by 6% month over month in March. Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc., major ride-hailing companies in the US, are already feeling the pressure from the coronavirus pandemic as travel restrictions and lockdowns are increasing across the US.In China, where the coronavirus disease was first detected, transport services are down by 50%. According to data by Aurora Mobile, a leading mobile big data solutions platform in China, the daily active users on ride sharing apps declined by more than half after the Chinese government declared the coronavirus outbreak in the country.Read More On The Business Research Company's Taxi And Limousine Services Market Report:https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/taxi-and-limousine-services-marketThe Coronavirus Impact On India And ItalyThe Indian government also declared lockdown once the country started seeing increase in coronavirus patients across the country. This has highly impacted the earnings of taxi drivers, because in lockdown, ride hailing services are also restricted to operate. Only a few taxi services are allowed to provide emergency services with proper approval. For instance, Ola Cabs, a ride hailing cab service company in India, requested the government for loan waivers for drivers, and a delay in tax payments, so that they can make up for lost income due to the coronavirus impact.Italy was the second country to be badly hit by the coronavirus disease after China, the epicenter of the disease. In Italy, the government declared lockdown to control the spread of the disease and this has tremendously impacted the market for taxis and limousine services in the country.Initiatives Taken By Taxi Service Companies Amid The Coronavirus SituationThe taxi and ride-hailing services companies are taking necessary proper measures to keep their passengers and drivers safe from the infectious and highly communicable COVID-19 disease. Maintaining the highest standards of hygiene, both personally as well as within the cabs, is of utmost importance. The taxi services companies have instructed their driver partners for the usage of masks, hand sanitizers, encouraged cashless payment, and also advised to keep sanitizing the cabs at regular intervals of time. For instance, In India, Meru cabs introduced a unique 'Ozone (O3) Treatment' to sanitize the cabs at designated hubs in the city. O3 air is released inside the cabs to make it virus and bacteria free. Also, the company distributed do's and don'ts leaflets for their driver partners and advised to maintain social distancing among fellow drivers. In another instance, Ola India instructed their driver partners to inform the 24x7 Ola Care helpline if they find any flu like symptoms among their passengers, and the driver should self-quarantine themselves. Also, Ola requested their passengers to contact the company if any customer who tested positive has taken an Ola ride in the past seven days.Request A Free Sample Of The Taxi And Limousine Services Market Report:https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/sample.aspx?id=3098&type=smpTaxi Service Companies Are Offering Emergency ServicesThe taxi services companies are offering to provide services for emergency transport to ease the burden of ambulance services. Many service providers have requested governments to issue directives on how they can help during this coronavirus outbreak so that they can do their part of duty during this period. Since there is a decline in normal rides, taxi services could be repurposed to help patients needing to attend medical appointments. For instance, NXT Taxis in Ireland requested the government to issue a directive to offer taxi services to ease the burden that is being placed on ambulances and emergency services during the coronavirus pandemic.Here Is A List Of Similar Reports By The Business Research Company:Transit And Ground Passenger Transportation Global Market Report 2020General Transportation Global Market Report 2020Interested to know more about The Business Research Company?The Business Research Company is a market intelligence firm that excels in company, market, and consumer research.

Journalism shouldn't be modern billionaires' problematic pet projectThe Lariat: Baylor UniversityApril 16, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 541 wordsByline: Baylor LariatBodyBloomberg News' decision to kill a 2013 investigation into China's richest man was back in the news this week. Parent company Bloomberg LP is a juggernaut in the world of financial software owned by former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. When its news network's reporters probed too deep into Chinese political circles, the company feared the Chinese government would target its business ventures as punishment and quashed the investigation. Profit trumped the pursuit of truth.Bloomberg LP's interference in the story violated one of the core tenets of journalism. The wall between journalism and business in a media company - or separation of church and state as it's sometimes known - is critical to preserve a publication's integrity. Normally this refers to keeping advertising and editorial content separate, but Bloomberg News' actions should prompt a much broader reading. Cutting stories because of their negative effect on business is a form of censorship, and the possibilities become ever-more concerning as the media landscape consolidates.Michael Bloomberg isn't the only billionaire to break into the news business. Print media is in decline, and investment from wealthy elites and business owners can be a lifeline for struggling publications. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett bought more than 30 newspapers before agreeing to sell them all early this year. Red Sox owner John Henry purchased The Boston Globe in 2013, and biomedical entrepreneur Patrick Soon-Shiong bought the Los Angeles Times in 2018. Perhaps the most high-profile of these ventures is Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' acquisition of The Washington Post in 2013.This decade-long shopping spree raises concerns about conflicts of interest. When casino magnate and political megadonor Sheldon Adelson purchased The Las Vegas Review-Journal in 2015 his identity was initially kept secret and had to be uncovered by the paper's own reporters. Departing staff in the months following Adelson's buyout commonly complained of reduced editorial freedom.The story on the Chinese oligarch finally ran in the New York Times in 2015, but only after reporter Michael Forsythe was fired by Bloomberg and forced to rereport much of the story. Forsythe was also bound by a nondisclosure agreement preventing him from talking about his time with Bloomberg News.It was through Forsythe's wife Leta Hong Fincher that the story could be told from a firsthand perspective. Bloomberg News lawyers tried and failed to get Fincher to sign a nondisclosure agreement. When then-candidate Bloomberg was pressed on the use of nondisclosure agreements, Fincher came forward with her own experience. There's no telling what other stories have been stamped out throughout the industry by ill-intentioned higher-ups whose priorities rest outside the realm of reporting.This country's Founding Fathers recognized the need for a free and open press. Protections for the press from government interference are enshrined in the Constitution's First Amendment, but no such boundaries are required within private companies. As long as business interests are allowed to seep into newsrooms, the greatest threat to objective journalism in the 21st century is not censorship from outside but from within.Load-Date: April 17, 2020End of Document

'This is war': Stocks, oil, Treasury yields, and bitcoin plunge as the Fed's rate cut fails to allay coronavirus fearsBusiness Insider USMarch 16, 2020 Monday 07:53 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc.

US equity futures also reached the "limit down" band preventing declines of more than 5%.The US central bank slashed the key funds rate by a full percentage point to between 0% and 0.25%, the lowest level since 2015, after lowering it by 0.5 percentage points less than two weeks ago. It also announced plans to buy $700 billion worth of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities."The Federal Reserve has panicked," Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, said in a morning note."It didn't just fire its bazooka, it dropped an atom bomb of liquidity and monetary stimulus," he added.Central banks in China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and other countries followed the Fed in trimming rates, boosting market liquidity, and taking other measures to shore up their economies. However, investors remain skeptical that monetary policy can do much to temper the economic toll of coronavirus.The virus - which causes a disease called COVID-19 - has infected more than 169,000 people, killed at least 6,500, and spread to upwards of 145 countries. It threatens to hammer global economic growth this year by disrupting supply chains, forcing businesses to cut back or close, and deterring consumers from spending.The latest developments include President Donald Trump declaring a national state of emergency on Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)            recommending the postponement of any planned gatherings of 50 people or more in the next eight weeks, and            Los Angeles and New York City shutting down bars, clubs, and other entertainment venues to slow transmission of the virus.New Chinese government data provided a worrying preview of the economic impacts of coronavirus. In the first two months of this year, industrial output tumbled 13.5% to a record low, retail sales plunged 20.5%, and fixed-asset invement fell by 24.5%, according to the Financial Times. Urban unemployment also hit a fresh high of 6.2% in February, the newspaper said."There's an understanding in markets that a recession is almost guaranteed," Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said in a morning note."Authorities throwing money at it helps but cannot stop it," he added.Other analysts painted an equally bleak picture."Markets must now accept: This is war," Michael Every, senior Asia-Pacific strategist at RaboResearch, said in a research note."Governments are going to have to support households, the self-employed AND businesses large and small through this all, or we face a domino-style economic collapse," he continued."The big policy guns have now all been rolled out and fired," Every added. "Short of open helicopter money entering while playing The Flight of the Valkyries over loudspeaker, there is little left to do already."Here's the market roundup as of 11:51 a.m. in London (7:51 a.m. in New York):• European equities plunged, with Germany's DAX down 8.4%, Britain's FTSE 100 down 6.8%, and the Euro Stoxx 50 down 8.7%.• Asian indexes closed lower.

Jack Ma Digital Bank Plans US$282,000M Loan WaveCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 6, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 552 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- In the face of a free-falling Chinese economy and millions of small businesses with ineffective, the online lending platform backed by billionaire Jack Ma went into crisis mode.In mid-February, near the peak of the coronavirus outbreak in China, MYbank had to decide whether to reduce its exposure or continue to distribute loans. After a two-day marathon of calls and self-isolation emails, the firm's executives agreed with 25 banks associated with a potentially risky strategy: to cut interest rates and activate loans like never before.MYbank is now preparing to issue a record 2 trillion yuan (US$282 billion) in new loans to small and medium-sized enterprises this year, almost 18% more than in 2019. "We have not reduced our business goals in the face of the virus outbreak," Jin Xiaolong, the company's president, said in an interview.While the increase in lending is aligned with the Chinese government's efforts to revive the world's second-largest panderated depression economy, it carries a great risk to MYbank and its largest shareholder, Financial Ant, of Jack Ma.This year's crisis marks the first major stress test of MYbank's credit algorithms, which analyze real-time payments and other data to assess borrowers who often lack collateral and credit history. If the boost to loans causes an increase in defaults, it could mean less profit for MYbank and, by extension, to Ant, who has plans for an eventual initial public offering."The model has not yet been tested in a full credit cycle," said Wang Haimei, an analyst at Shanghai-based research firm WDZJ, which specializes in online lending.MYbank is an important part of Ant's so-called open banking strategy, which also includes a consumer lending platform and a technology group that sells cloud computing and other infrastructure to lenders. Ant is about to generate 65% of its revenue from these services by 2021, up from 35% in 2017, according to a person familiar with the matter.Before the coronavirus stopped sectors of the Chinese economy in the first quarter, MYbank said its 3,000 variable risk management system kept defaults at just 1.3% of total loans. While Jin declined to provide an updated figure on delinquency, he said a recent increase is within his "expected range."MYbank finances some of its loans with its own capital, but other lenders also use the platform to reach smaller borrowers they usually rejected."SMEs are desperate to get financing as they emerge from the pandemic and try to resume normal production, profitability should not be our top priority," Jin said. "We also found that more and more banks are asking us about how to leverage Ant's risk management technologies and partner with our platform, so that we can support more SMEs in need together."Whether delinquency becomes a bigger problem will depend on how quickly China's economy recovers from its 6.8% contraction in the first quarter. The fall in global demand is likely to remain an obstacle in the coming months, but Jin sees signs of optimism as the country reverses its quarantine measures."We see that companies are recovering in March," Jin said. "We are confident that we can issue more than 2 trillion yuan in loans this year."Original Note:Jack Ma's Online Bank Plans at $282 Billion Lending Spree (1)©2020Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: May 7, 2020End of Document

Markets Test Support Levels, Amazon Earnings, Calibrating for Covid-19RealMoneyMay 1, 2020 Friday 7:46 AM EDTCopyright 2020 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1693 wordsByline: Stephen GuilfoyleHighlight: The market sold off on Thursday after close as big hitters, including Amazon, reported earnings.BodySell In May......And go away? No, this is not going to be one of those lengthy articles that ends up telling you that even though over the years the May through October period tends to underperform broader markets. (Even if it does also tend to produce a positive return.) May through October is far too long a period for traders, or maybe even investors, to ponder with any kind of certainty right now.Heck, even just the month of May could be too much to think about. Here, at Market Recon, we'll just keep on doing what we always do. We'll try to interpret what we see, if not ahead of time, at least in enough time to make some dough when the making is good, and save some dough when the making is not.Equity markets gave something back on the last trading day of April. That was fairly easy to see coming, as April 2020, at least for the S&P 500, ended up being the second-best month of my career, and the best since I was a young man. We knew ahead of Thursday's opening bell that such strength would force at least a certain level of reallocation, and that the Energy sector would probably not lead as it had earlier in the week/month.Small-caps, recently the hottest slice of the market, did give a bit back on Thursday. Trading volume at both of New York's primary exchanges shaded decisively red, that much is true. However, that volume leveled off at Wednesday's levels.On a day that saw all eleven sectors close down for the day, both internet stocks and software names, for the most part, bucked the trend. This might have been seen as a positive, as the focus for the large-cap equity traders has been more on technical analysis than on fundamentals, unless of course one considers the impacts of policy to be a part of fundamental analysis.All this said,  significantly just after Thursday afternoon's closing bell. Would it shock to see the major equity indices test their 200-day simple moving averages? After some of the macro we have seen and expectations for what may lie behind the next door?No DetailsThe president appeared angry. Heck, most of planet earth is pretty darned angry these days. John Roberts of Fox News asked President Trump if he has seen anything that leads him to a certain level of confidence that the coronavirus that has infected millions, killed hundreds of thousands and destroyed the global economy, might have originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The president did not go into details, but did let some anger show.The U.S. intelligence community does seem to agree with most who have studied this virus that it was not man-made, nor genetically engineered, but that does not rule out an accident, nor excuse what some see as less than optimal behavior in the aftermath.The Washington Post reported on Thursday that U.S. officials might be exploring ideas meant to recoup financially at least some of what has been lost from the Chinese government. Ideas supposedly under consideration could be stripping China of sovereign immunity, which would allow the nation to be sued for damages. There was also talk of maybe cancelling part of the U.S. debt obligation to China, though President Trump did appear to downplay that option.What the president did do at that press conference was suggest the possibility of new tariffs on Chinese imports. Then later on Thursday evening, Bloomberg News reported that the administration had under consideration an executive order that would in effect halt certain retirement plans in the U.S. from investing in funds that invest in Chinese securities. What ends up happening? We shall see. How broad does it go? Again unknown. Anger? Yeah, we see it.Did You See?U.S. drug developer Moderna  -- whose experimental vaccine for Covid-19, mRNA-1273, is currently undergoing early-stage clinical testing with advancement to the next stage expected sometime this quarter -- received $483 million in federal funding earlier this month to help accelerate the vaccine's development.Very early on Friday morning, Reuters reported that Moderna had come to a 10-year collaboration agreement with Swiss contract drug manufacturer Lonza AG (LZAGY) to produce up to a billion doses of this vaccine per year at Lonza U.S. for worldwide usage.Then It Got UglyThe closing bell had just stopped ringing. The futures responded before I could even see the numbers. The last sale for the shares of Amazon  told me all I needed to know. Something must have not gone according to plan. We all knew that margin could be an issue. Not could be, will be. Then came Apple  . Pretty decent quarter all things considered, increased return to shareholders... but no guidance. How could they possibly guide?There were a number of other earnings releases for investors to ponder on Thursday evening, but Mr. Market had made up his mind. He said "sold" into the evening, and then said "sold" again as the wee hours passed. Let's explore.Nice Job, ReallyAmazon went to the tape with the firm's first-quarter financial results. We all knew that demand for what this firm is best known for, e-commerce, had been immense and that the firm had taken steps that included adding payroll in order to meet that surge. Margin could be a problem. Amazon posted EPS of $5.01, earnings growth of -29%, and a sizable miss, at that. There was indeed, sizable year-over-year revenue growth (+26.5%) that amounted to $75.5 billion. This would be the strongest pace of comparable annual growth for Amazon in any quarter since mid-2018.Across the company's segments, performance was strong. As one might expect, Online Stores experienced growth of 24% (really 35% ex-FX, to give one an idea of the surge in demand), as that line provided more than 48% toward the entire pie of revenue distribution. Amazon Web Services showed growth of 33%, which may have been seen as a very small segment miss, but not one that would stop this trader from sleeping at night. That unit remains an over-achiever in terms of margin generation. Subscription Services have experienced a dramatic pop in business during the pandemic. This would be the Prime services -- video, music, e-books, audio-books, etc.Advertising also grew wildly, under the heading of "Other," as the e-commerce sites and the various subscription services attracted eyeballs even amid this period of reduced budgets for marketing. Why did I breeze past all of these business lines without going into the nitty gritty? Simple. Corporate outperformance in revenue generation, and better than could be expected corporate execution, is not why Amazon sold off over night. Let's look at guidance. "Take a Seat" CEO Jeff Bezos wrote, "If you're a shareholder in Amazon, you may want to take a seat, because we're not thinking small." What is now clear as a bell is that Amazon is now in investment mode. In the business, and in the labor force, as both must respond to, as well as co-exist with, the negative impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.As a means to meet increased demand for pantry and household essentials as well as office supplies as many Americans fortunate enough to remain employed must now work remotely, Amazon has been aggressive. The firm added 100,000 new employees to the payroll at a time when the entire nation has been moving in the other direction. The firm has made public its need to add 75,000 more, as well.The firm guided Q2 revenue toward a rather wide range of $75 billion to $81 billion, which at the low end, would still be 18% growth. The range offered allows for some wiggle room, but largely centers itself around what is already Wall Street consensus. The difference is this. The firm acknowledges "substantial uncertainty" around the pandemic. As for operating income, the firm now expects to see anything within a range of -$1.5 billion to +$1.5 billion. Wall Street was looking for something closer to $4 billion.On that note, Bezos added, "Under normal circumstances, in this coming Q2, we'd expect to make some $4 billion or more in operating profit. But these aren't normal circumstances. Instead, we expect to spend the entirety of that $4 billion, and perhaps a bit more, on Covid-related expenses -- getting products to customers and keeping employees safe."The firm will be spending on virus testing, personal protection equipment, as well as the cleansing of the firm's vast facilities, in addition to increasing wages. Amazon is investing in its business by investing in its people. That might make Wall Street sell the stock. Not me, though. Sure, I'll get hit on the nose this morning. Won't be the first time. Take a look at this:Remember this chart? I drew it up for you just a little over two weeks ago. Well, we sure did get the breakout above pivot. You may also recall that in that  , I stated the need to add a handle to the cup, and if we saw that handle, then the pivot would shift from the left side of the cup (2185) to the right side of the cup (2475 top just yesterday). Very interesting, indeed.Not only will I not join this selloff, depending on its depth, I may add. This commitment to the firm's employees and spate of hiring when no one else will, should, in my opinion, inspire loyalty in the ranks. The fact that the Amazon truck comes down the block every day regardless how how awful things have become will inspire loyalty among consumers.Investing in these issues is long-term thinking and is also very smart. Just an aside, because I do not want to leave them out, Walmart  has also in my very myopic view, performed very well under pressure. Is this a two horse race? Costco  ? Target  ? We'll see.AmazonTarget Price: $2970 (up from $2625)Pivot: $2475 (up from $2185)Panic Point: $2185 (up from $2030)Economics (All Times Eastern) 09:45 - Markit Manufacturing PMI (Apr-F):Flashed 36.9.08:30 - Construction Spending (Mar):Expecting -3.6% m/m, Last -1.3% m/m.10:00 - ISM Manufacturing Index (Apr):Expecting 34.7, Last 49.1.13:00 - Baker Hughes Oil Rig Count (Weekly):Last 378.The Fed (All Times Eastern) No Public Appearances Scheduled. Today's Earnings Highlights (Consensus EPS Expectations) Before the Open: (2.24),  (3.66),  (0.67),  (0.67),  (0.73),  (0.78),  (0.05),  (1.95),  (0.50),  (0.13)Load-Date: May 5, 2020End of Document

The head of foreign affairs of the European Union, Josep Borrell, said the Eurogroup "deeply" deplored the suspension of funds and argued that the UN health agency is "more necessary than ever." Borrell noted that Trump "has no reason" to freeze aid at this critical stage of the pandemic, and called for not promoting division.

He detailed that they were reviewing the impact of the suspension of funds and noted that they would work with their partners to cover "any financial gaps", so that their work continues uninterrupted. Meanwhile, China, which was also the center of Trump's criticism, expressed its "serious concern" over Washington's decision. "We call on the US to fulfill its responsibilities and obligations and support WHO to lead the international campaign against the epidemic (of the new coronavirus)," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian.

Trace, test and treat is the mantra ... no lockdowns, no roadblocks and no restriction on movement  in South Korea.  To suppress and control the epidemic, countries must isolate, test, treat and trace,  say WHO.But what does  tracing  look like exactly? In Singapore, they use a  TraceTogether  app, which uses Bluetooth to track nearby phones (without location tracking), keeps local logs of those contacts, and only uploads them to the Ministry of Health when the user chooses/consents, presumably after a diagnosis, so those contacts can be alerted. Singapore plans to open-source the app.In South Korea, the government texts people to let them know if they were in the vicinity of a diagnosed individual. The information conveyed can include the person s age, gender, and detailed location history. Subsequently, even more details may be made available:Victoria Kim@vicjkimThe level of detail provided by @Seoul_gov for each and every COVID-19 case in the city is astonishing:Last name (which I ve obscured)SexBirth yearDistrict of residenceProfessionTravel historyContact with known casesHospital where they re being treated201:47 PM   Mar 24, 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy 15 people are talking about thisIn China, as you might expect, the surveillance is even more pervasive and draconian. Here, the pervasive apps Alipay and WeChat now include health codes   green, yellow, or red   set by the Chinese government, using opaque criteria. This health status is then used in hundreds of cities (and soon nationwide) to determine whether people are allowed to e.g. ride the subway, take a train, enter a building, or even exit a highway.What about us, in the rich democratic world? Are we OK with the Chinese model? Of course not. The South Korean model? ...Probably not. The Singaporean model? ...Maybe. (I suspect it would fly in my homeland of Canada, for instance.) But the need to install a separate app, with TraceTogether or the directionally similar MIT project Safe Paths, is a problem. It works in a city-state like Singapore but will be much more problematic in a huge, politically divided nation like America. This will lead to inferior data blinded by both noncompliance and selection bias.More generally, at what point does the urgent need for better data collide with the need to protect individual privacy and avoid enabling the tools for an aspiring, or existing, police state? And let s not kid ourselves; the pandemic increases, rather than diminishes, the authoritarian threat.Maybe, like the UK s NHS, creators of new pandemic data infrastructures will promise  Once the public health emergency situation has ended, data will either be destroyed or returned    but not all organizations instill the required level of trust in their populace. This tension has provoked heated discussion around whether we should create new surveillance systems to help mitigate and control the pandemic.This surprises me greatly. Wherever you may be on that spectrum, there is no sense whatsoever in creating a new surveillance system   seeing as how multiple options already exist. We don t like to think about it, much, but the cold fact is that two groups of entities already collectively have essentially unfettered access to all our proximity (and location) data, as and when they choose to do so.I refer of course to the major cell providers, and to Apple & Google. This was vividly illustrated by data company Tectonix in a viral visualization of the spread of Spring Break partygoers:Tectonix GEO@TectonixGEOWant to see the true potential impact of ignoring social distancing? Through a partnership with @xmodesocial, we analyzed secondary locations of anonymized mobile devices that were active at a single Ft. Lauderdale beach during spring break. This is where they went across the US:17.3K6:44 AM   Mar 25, 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy 14.5K people are talking about thisNeedless to say, Apple and Google, purveyors of the OSes on all those phones, have essentially the same capability as and when they choose to exercise it. An open letter from  technologists, epidemiologists & medical professionals  calls on  Apple, Google, and other mobile operating system vendors  (the notion that any other vendors are remotely relevant is adorable)  to provide an opt-in, privacy preserving OS feature to support contact tracing. They re right. Android and iOS could, and should, add and roll out privacy-preserving, interoperable, TraceTogether-like functionality at the OS level (or Google Play Services level, to split fine technical hairs.) Granted, this means relying on corporate surveillance, which makes all of us feel uneasy. But at least it doesn t mean creating a whole new surveillance infrastructure. Furthermore, Apple and Google, especially compared to cellular providers, have a strong institutional history and focus on protecting privacy and limiting the remit of their surveillance.(Don t believe me? Apple s commitment to privacy has long been a competitive advantage. Google offers a thorough set of tools to let you control your data and privacy settings. I ask you: where is your cell service provider s equivalent? Ah. Do you expect it to ever create one? I see. Would you also be interested in this fine, very lightly used Brooklyn Bridge I have on sale?)Apple and Google are also much better suited to the task of preserving privacy by  anonymizing  data sets (I know, I know, but see below), or, better yet, preserving privacy via some form(s) of differential privacy and/or homomorphic encryption   or even some kind of zero-knowledge cryptography, he handwaved wildly. And, on a practical level, they re more able than a third-party app developer to ensure a background service like that stays active.Obviously this should all be well and firmly regulated. But at the same time, we should remain cognizant of the fact that not every nation believes in such regulation. Building privacy deep into a contact-tracing system, to the maximum extent consonant with its efficacy, is especially important when we consider its potential usage in authoritarian nations who might demand the raw data.  Anonymized  location datasets admittedly tend to be something of an oxymoron, but authoritarians may still be technically stymied by the difficulty of deanonymization; and if individual privacy can be preserved even more securely than that via some elegant encryption scheme, so much the better.Compared to the other alternatives   government surveillance; the phone companies; or some new app, with all the concomitant friction and barriers to usage   Apple and Google are by some distance the least objectionable option. What s more, in the face of this global pandemic they could roll out their part of the test-and-trace solution to three billion users relatively quickly. If we need a pervasive pandemic surveillance system, then let s use one which (though we don t like to talk about it) already exists, in the least dangerous, most privacy-preserving way.See Campaign:https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00740-yContact Information:Jon EvansTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: March 30, 2020End of Document

N.Y. Gov. Cuomo Calls on President Trump to Take Comprehensive Federal Action to Combat Novel Coronavirus NowTargeted News ServiceMarch 16, 2020 Monday 7:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3599 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: ALBANY, New York BodyGov. Andrew Cuomo, D-New York, issued the following transcript on March 15:Okay, we want to give you an update on what we know as of today and the recent numbers to date. Also, I am going to take a moment to go through the overall context of what we are doing. Every day we go through the daily update, but it is important that people see and understand the overall context of what is going on.What is all this about? What the United States is doing, what they are talking about in Washington, what we are talking about here - slow the spread of the virus to a rate that the healthcare system can manage. Slow the spread of the virus to a rate that the healthcare system can manage. You are not going to stop people from being infected. There are all sorts of percentages about what percent of the population will be affected: 40%, 50%, 60%. You will not be able to control that. Nobody thinks you can. But you can make efforts to slow the spread because the real question here is can your healthcare system manage the influx of patients? That is all this is about. And China, South Korea, Italy - it is the same lesson over and over again. You get into trouble when the healthcare system can't manage that rate of intake. So, try to slow the spread so it equals your capacity in the healthcare system.What do you do to slow the spread? Test, test, test. We made great progress on testing. The President's agreement to allow New York State to do its own testing is very important. We need more federal assistance in allowing what is called automated testing which the FDA still controls. Roche is a company that does automated testing. The President made an announcement with them. But it can't just be a couple of companies for the United States of America doing automated testing. We need more automated testing. What does that mean, automated testing? Manual, you put the test tube in the machine. Automated, everything is robotics. It goes from 30 tests per day to 1,000 tests per day from a laboratory that can go from manual to automated. So that is a tremendous difference and we need more help on that.How else do you slow the spread? Density control. This awkward seating arrangement that we have here today reflects two things. Number one, that the LCA does not work on Sundays. Number two, spacing out the seating, reduce the density. So, reduce the density the best you can.Those are both slow the spread strategies, okay? What does it mean to slow the spread? This is Dr. Fauci. Great New Yorker by the way. You see everyone in Washington looking at the charts of the curve. Flatten the curve. Flatten the curve. Reduce the rate so the high point of cases is reduced so it can be managed by the healthcare system. That is what they are talking about. Flatten the curve. Flatten the curve. Why do you want to flatten the curve? Because the curve is not a curve. The curve is a wave and the wave could break on the hospital system. That is what they are talking about the curve. If you have too high a number of people sick at the same time, when they descend on the hospital system you will overwhelm the hospital system. That is the issue here. It has always been the issue here - overwhelming the capacity of the hospital system. And that my friends is important.We listen to the cable news all day. Well, why did we not start testing earlier? Why were we not prepared? That is all about yesterday, right? That is all recrimination. That is blame. We should have done this. We should have done that, should have done this. I am a governor. I am here today. I am focused on what I need today to prepare for tomorrow. And that is what everybody should focus on. You want to do a retrospective on who should have done what when and who is to blame? Put a pin in it and do it afterwards. Let's be constructive by just focusing on today and tomorrow. There is an old military expression that management officials use: don't fight the last war. This is not about what happened yesterday. We are looking at a new war that no one has seen before. This is a case of first impression for this nation. We have never fought a virus like this with this potential consequence. So, plan forward. You see that wave. Try to reduce the size of the wave. Assume you can't reduce the size of the wave and assume the wave breaks at a higher level than the hospital system can accommodate. I believe that's what's going to happen.So what do you do? New York State hospital capacity: 53,000 beds, 3,000 ICU beds. Is that a lot of beds? Is that little beds? Three thousand ICU beds presently about 80 percent occupied. Okay? So that means you have several hundred ICU beds available. Why are the ICU beds available important? Because the people who come in, vulnerable populations, older people, underlying illnesses, respiratory problems - they need the ICU bed. They need the ventilators. They need the machines that breathe for them. Those are the ventilators. They are in ICU beds. The overwhelming crush is going to be on the ICU beds, not the 53,000 normal hospital beds because those are basically going to be people recovering from the flu. You can recover from the flu at home. If it's really bad you go into the hospital, they make sure that you are not dehydrated, but the critical people are the people who have underlying illnesses and need those ICU beds and those ventilators. Three thousand goes very, very quickly on any projection of these numbers.What do we do? Maximize existing hospital beds and hospital capacity, potentially build more capacity, again we're only talking about several weeks here before that wave breaks, potentially build more on the existing hospitals, provide more staff, identify backup staff, that's why we're going to medical schools, retired nurses, retired doctors, develop a reserve staff because health care workers will get sick and when they get sick they go home. You want to limit the hospitals? Limit staff. That's the way you limit the hospitals. Find doctors who are on reserve, and purchase the necessary equipment. What makes an ICU bed an ICU bed? Primarily the ventilator. These ventilators are expensive to begin with and they are scarce and you can't find available ventilators no matter how much you're willing to pay right because there is literally a global run on ventilators. And free up beds that are in the hospitals. How do you do that? Two ways: one, we may get to a point where you can't do elective surgery, you can have your hip replaced next month, not now, or develop another facility that you can move people from an existing hospital bed who don't need intensive care into a different facility.How can you build more hospital capacity now? That's a great question. It has never been done before. It takes years to build a hospital. It takes years to convert an existing facility into a hospital. It's billions of dollars, it's a workforce in the thousands, but on the theory of try everything, an area you have to explore is can you build more hospital capacity now? I'll get back to that in a minute.On the reducing density, slow the spread by reducing density. I've been talking to private businesses all across the state. I am asking them to aggressively to consider work from home strategies. I'm asking them to aggressively consider voluntary closings to help reduce density as a social responsibility to protect their workforce but I want private businesses to aggressively consider work from home and voluntary closings. Depending on what businesses do on a voluntary basis we could consider mandatory actions later on. We've already taken mandatory actions, no large gatherings over 500, 50 percent of legal occupancy of a facility. That is a mandatory way to reduce density in the workplace. I'm asking them today to voluntarily consider closings and reductions in workforce. If need be, we can calibrate up the mandatory requirements that we have already put in action. How do you calibrate it up? Rather than 50 percent of occupancy it could be 40 percent of occupancy, 30 percent of occupancy, etcetera. I'm not doing that at this point but I am asking businesses to aggressively consider these measures. If the private sector does not respond voluntarily, if the spread does not slow, then I would increase the mandatory guidelines.For New York State government, lead by example. All non-essential personnel in the state are asked to stay home from Rockland County south. That's about half the workforce of the state in that area. Why Rockland County south? That is the area with the highest density of number of cases. Remember again, the number of cases varies widely across the state. You're calibrating your actions to the data, to the science. You should be doing different things in New York City than you're doing in a county upstate that only has one or two cases, right? This is a calibration by science to the facts.The New York State court system congregates many people, tens of thousands of people all across the state. I spoke to the chief judge. I asked her to come up with a plan that keeps the essential services operational. Criminal justice services, emergency family services, et cetera, the essential services available. But non-essential services, actions that can be postponed, to postpone them. Again, reduce the density coming into the court system. I'm asking private businesses to stay home. Reduce the density coming into the court system. Don't jeopardize the criminal justice system, don't jeopardize safety, don't jeopardize family integrity, but if it's non-essential then postpone it. Come up with a plan that reduces the courts to follow that concern. The chief judge is a total pro. She's not just a great jurist, she's also a great manager. She's managed large operations before and all of her skill and tenure has been on display here as the chief judge. And she's ideally suited to do this. I asked her to come up with a plan tomorrow that she will announce on the specifics of how she'll implement this.How else do you reduce density? You come to the issue of schools. To reopen schools, close schools - a number of schools have closed. We've added Jim Malatras - you all remember Jim Malatras. He used to work here then semi-retired, went to academia. He doesn't consider it semi-retirement, but I like to irk him that way. Close the schools - it's not that easy, it's not that simple. Close the schools, for many families the school is childcare. If you close the schools and the children are home, a large percentage of the workforce may say I have to stay home and take care of my children. There are school districts that are in wealthier parts of the stay where the families are in a position where one parent stays home or they can hire a caregiver. But then there's everybody else, right? I'm from Queens, New York, I grew up in a very working class neighborhood. Most families don't have a caregiver at home - if the children stay home, a parent has to stay home. If there's only one parent in the home, that parent has to stay home. Yeah, but we have essential workers that need to go to work - police people, fire officers, healthcare workers, again, because this is all about the capacity of the healthcare system. We can't have 1199 healthcare workers not coming to work because they have to stay home. We can't have nurses staying home because they have to stay home and watch their child. So, it sounds simple, it's not simple. You close the school, how do you feed the children? For many children the breakfast and the lunch are the two main meals they get and they get that at the school.How do you distribute food to all these children who are now not in school? So, those are very real concerns. If you can address those concerns, address the negatives of closing the schools, then yes, close the schools. Why? Because it's totally in line with our density reduction, et cetera. These concerns can be addressed and it's up to the locality to come up with a plan to do it. We're speaking to Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester - County Executive Lauran Curran, County Executive Steve Bellone in Suffolk, CountyExecutive George Latimer in Westchester. They're interested in closing schools. We said closing schools, if you can reduce the negative, childcare, student meals, et cetera, then I think it's a good strategy. But, we have to address those two negatives. The worst negative is if we lose essential workers. Police officers say I can't come to work. Firefighters say I can't come to work. Public transportation operators say I can't come to work. And most dramatic impact, hospital workers. Because remember the hospital workers, there will be hospital workers who get sick. That's going to happen. That will reduce staffing in hospitals. That has to be factored in because you know that's going to happen. So given that, you want to make sure you're not artificially making that problem worse. Jim Malatras is going to be working with these counties to try to put together these situations that would take care of the negative consequences of closing schools, which would then facilitate the closing of schools. Ongoing operations, just so we sum up. We're doing testing, we've made great progress there. Thank you Vice President Pence. Thank you President Trump. We have more to do. Density reduction, which is what we've been talking about. School closures, and taking care of the negative consequences that might happen is an ongoing function. Hospital capacity, hospital capacity, hospital capacity. And tracking of the cases. Mapping of the cases. Identifying the clusters so we deploy our resources. The numbers today, total tested is up to 5,272. As I've said every day, the more you test, the more positives you will find. New cases 442. I'm sorry, newly tested 442. This is just testing data. 5,200 tested. 442 tested. Since last evening. Is that correct?Melissa DeRosa: Yeah, so far this morning.Governor Cuomo: So you see how fast, we were only doing 200 tests per day. We now did 442 since last evening at about 6:00 when we did the last briefing. Positive cases 729, new cases 69. New York is the state that has the most number of cases. Again, you would have to correlate that to how many tests the other states are doing, because the more tests they're doing, the more cases they will find. We've had three deaths. We had an additional death since we spoke last. 79-year-old woman who had multiple major underlying health issues. And had the coronavirus and succumbed to the coronavirus. Current hospitalizations, 137 out of 729, that's 19 percent of the cases. This number relates back to hospital capacity. 65 patients in ICU already. This is against the number of beds available in ICU units. And you can see how quickly these numbers move. 46 patients intubated. Again, perspective, perspective, because we're fighting the virus, we're fighting fear. The fear is winning. And the fear is disconnected from the facts. Fear is an emotion. Emotion can often be disconnected from facts, and that's what happening here. But this tracks all the cases that have happened since China. 156,000 cases, 5,000 deaths. You look at the people who have passed away in the State of New York, the three people. Those are three people who may very well have passed away from contracting the flu, right. Every year, tens of thousands of people die from the flu. We say they die from the flu, but they very often had, they were battling cancer, they had heart disease, they had emphysema. And then the flu on top of that underlying condition was the straw that broke the camel's back. I did an open letter to President Trump today that made three points. It says we know what is going to happen. Because we have the data and the projections. Look at China, look at South Korea, look at Italy and just plot the numbers. You know the term, you know how effective you are at flattening the curve, and we are now looking at a wave. And we know it is a wave. Do everything you can to reduce the wave. We are. It's still a wave. It is going to be a wave. And it is going to be a wave that at any of these projections will overwhelm the healthcare system. I asked three things. One, on the testing, that, and I'm grateful that he approved the New York testing capacity, FDA has to get out of the way on the automated testing capacity. Let us approve automated testing companies. It can't be one or two companies are the only companies in the United States doing this. You need hundreds of thousands. Accelerate the testing. Second, the federal government has to provide help and guidance to states on what to do and when to do it.This can't be a national policy of every state does its own thing. You can't have a patchwork quilt of policies. New York State closes stores - okay, New Jersey doesn't. What did I do? I just sent thousands of vehicles over to New Jersey. Flooding New Jersey stores. New Jersey closes stores and [inaudible] and what did they do. They just sent thousands of people to shop in New York and then back to New Jersey. You cannot do this ad hoc - one state at a time. Make a decision. Tell the states this is the decision and then let's go.Closing schools. If you think schools have to be closed, well then help us. Where do we get the child care? Where do we get the meals? Where do we get the money to provide the meals? There are ways to do it, we could just increase what's called the SNAP program. The food assistance program for families. And say, you know what, your food assistance payment is going to go up 50 percent. You buy Johnny breakfast and lunch. But we have the federal government that is intricately involved in that. Help us plan and help us coordinate. And don't pit one state against the other inadvertently by having to come up with different policies.The third point is this. You're going to need more hospital capacity. You're going to need more facilities. You're going to need ways to free up those 53,000 beds. You're going to need to construct or retrofit physical buildings. Acquire thousands of pieces of equipment like this. A state can't do that. I don't have that workforce. I don't have the resources, but even if I had the resources, I don't have the physical capacity to turn SUNY dorms into hospitals in 3 weeks. I can't. There's only one workforce that can do that. It's the Army Corps of Engineers and the military assets. That's what they do. They build bridges, they build camps, they have tens of thousands of personnel, trucks, equipment, excavators, logistical managers, purchasing power. Use them to come in right now, identify existing facilities that can be retrofitted and use them to do it.China built dozens of hospitals in literally a month. How? The Chinese government came in and send we're going to do this, we're going to nationalize it. South Korea, the same thing. You can't leave it to the states. I can't do it. I do not have the resources or the capacity. By the way, I'm in an aggressive governor. I push very hard. But there's no way that we could manage this undertaking. The Army Corps of Engineers. I used to be in the federal government, I worked with them, they're amazing. Their capacity is amazing. And what better time to use those resources than saying let's get to work. Let's retrofit buildings, let's purchase the equipment, let's use that massive logistical machine of the military to actually save lives.It makes all the sense in the world and, by the way, we have no option. We have no options. You what management is? It's the best option. My expression to my colleagues, what are my options? Well you have none. There's only one. Okay. I pick that option. You have no other options. Otherwise we will be sitting here 9 weeks, 10 weeks, 14 weeks from today seeing a health care overrun. We will be saying we knew this was going to happen, why didn't we provide more health care facilities. Why didn't we do everything we could to make that a reality? Doing everything you can to make that a reality means bringing in that Army Corps of Engineers and bringing in that military expertise. And I hope the President takes me up on it.* * *- In Open Letter to President Trump, Governor Calls for Aggressive National Strategy for Testing, School Closures and Hospital Surge Capacity to Slow and Mitigate Impacts of COVID-19- Directs Nonessential State Workforce in Hotspot Areas - Rockland, Westchester, NYC, Suffolk, Nassau - to Work From Home for Two Weeks- Governor Asks Chief Judge Janet DiFiore to Develop Plan to Reduce Density in Court System, Including Limiting Nonessential Proceedings- Tasks SUNY Empire State College President Jim Malatras with Developing Contingency Plans in Preparation for School Closures- Directs DMV to Move to Appointment Only to Limit Person to Person Contact- Confirms 69 Additional Coronavirus Cases in New York State - Bringing Statewide Total to 729; New Cases in 9 CountiesVIDEO of the Governor's remarks is available on YouTube here (https://youtu.be/l8Ef_b4A3Ps) and in TV quality (h.264, mp4) format here (           https://protect2.fireeye.com/v1/url?k=e3a888a0-bf902e1d-e3aa7195-000babd9fa3f-fb9c6b2f324a1ea7&q=1&e=4a699cac-2d80-4af4-a5c0-e4e9d53c9fb2&u=https%3A%2F%2Fspaces.hightail.com%2Freceive%2FnwUWODUjPC).AUDIO of today's remarks is available here (https://soundcloud.com/nygovcuomo/governor-cuomo-makes-an-announcement-2).PHOTOS of today's remarks will be available on the Governor's Flickr page (https://www.flickr.com/photos/governorandrewcuomo/albums).Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7055778 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 16, 2020End of Document

Going afloatCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 6, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 521 wordsBodyNorwegian Cruise Line offered two of its boats and two islands for $2.2 billion, while the company struggles to stay afloat on the brink of financial collapse and in the face of its customers' clamour to have their reservation money back.The company, whose corporate offices are located in the city of Miami, whose ships are prohibited from sailing to prevent the spread of Covid-19, warned on Tuesday that there is "a great doubt" that it can keep operating.The new York Stock Exchange's shares sank 23% after the cruise line announced that the cruise line expected to raise capital by $1.6 billion between debt and shares, leading its securities to a 80% drop so far in 2020.Norwegian Cruise Lines has suspended all travel until June 30, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention banned all cruises until 24 July next or until Covid-19 is no longer considered a health emergency.With news that the Chinese government announced its new virtual currency, the e-RMB, which will replace the US dollar for certain operations.The currency will be a functional alternative to the dollar settlement system that can reduce the impact of sanction or an exclusion threat from other nations. The new digital currency will not be a cryptocurrency, as it will be managed by the People's Bank of China, will be 100% linked to the yuan and can be used by different digital means of payment within the Asian country.According to Monex Stock Exchange, the new digital currency has been in development for some years, but wasn't it until August of the past when the Chinese central bank reported? that was about to put the currency in circulation.The announcement of the new Chinese currency was met with surprise by the markets, Monex noted and warned that it could be the beginning of a monetary war to place the Chinese yuan as the main means of payment worldwide, competing directly against the do?lar.So, later, the asian currency authorities are likely to decide to link the yuan to gold, with the aim of positioning the new currency as a reserve currency of value in central banks around the world.Logistics service provider CH Robinson mentioned three lessons that the logistics industry and companies can draw from the ongoing pandemic on managing their supply chain.The first is to evaluate the design of its supply chain, as current designs have predominantly followed a unique philosophy for all, on the assumption that raw materials are available for worldwide sourcing and production.In this regard, it indicates that companies should aim to optimize the production and distribution capacity of their supply chain, taking into account dynamic, rather than static, operational capacities.The second lesson is to apply the principles of risk management in advance, because while many global companies recognize the value of a risk management and management plan, it is often placed at the bottom of the priority scale in the absence of a crisis situation.Supply chains inevitably have multiple dependencies, but companies can proactively manage potential vulnerabilities at each stage, through their risk management plans.Load-Date: May 7, 2020End of Document

US sanctions would take Huawei off the marketCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 16, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 369 wordsBodyDonald Trump's administration yesterday announced a series of measures that seek to leave Chinese telecoms group Huawei, considered by Washington as a threat to national security, out of the global semiconductor market."This announcement blocks Huawei's efforts to circumvent US export controls," commerce said in a statement.According to U.S. officials, Huawei has managed to circumvent washington's previous sanctions by turning to chip and component suppliers in other parts of the world, but manufactured with U.S. technology.The text added that it would focus "specifically and strategically on Huawei's acquisition of semiconductors that are a direct product of certain U.S. software and technologies."The Chinese telecommunications company has been under extreme pressure from Washington, which with its lobby has managed to get allies around the world to avoid equipment developed by Huawei in the name of security, in a context of china-U.S. trade war.These measures are the most recent targeting the Chinese tech giant, one of the world's leading cell phone manufacturers, also a provider of telecommunications infrastructure equipment, which the United States says has committed the theft of industrial secrets and assisted Beijing in espionage tasks.Huawei rejects these accusations and denies its ties to the Chinese government.Sanctions against the company have further strained the trade relationship between the two powers.For U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Huawei's triangulation to circumvent restrictions is unacceptable."That's not how a responsible global corporate citizen behaves," he said.Ross said that even as Huawei tries to develop its own components to counter sanctions, "that effort still depends on AMERICAN technologies."According to Commerce, a grace period of 120 days will be granted before these new rules come into force. After that period, any chip to Huawei or its affiliated companies will have to obtain an export license.A State Department official who participated in a press teleconference on the new sanctions said they don't necessarily prevent Huawei from obtaining these components, but the license allows Washington to control the fate of those technologies.Load-Date: May 17, 2020End of Document

New Mexico official in video blames 'Asians' for virusAssociated Press State & LocalMarch 31, 2020 Tuesday 4:48 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: STATE AND REGIONALLength: 404 wordsDateline: DEMING, N.M. BodyDEMING, N.M. (AP) - A southern New Mexico county official is under fire for posting a social media video casting blame for the novel coronavirus pandemic on "Asians."Luna County Safety and Risk Coordinator Tyler Massey posted an expletive-laden video on Snapchat earlier this month, where he complained about people of Asian descent buying "in bulk" at a Walmart, the Las Cruces Sun-News reports."There were about six Asians," Massey says in the video, alleging that they had cut him off in the parking lot. "They parked right next to me. They were all around me. They were all buying (expletive) in bulk and I'm like, hello, it was your (expletive) cousins (who) did this to us."Massey says he felt the encounter left him "exposed" and declared he would self-quarantine for a day.Luna County Attorney Charles Kretek verified that Massey remained a county employee and said county manager Chris Brice "addressed the matter internally."Massey did not respond to phone and email messages.Massey had served as Hidalgo County's chief deputy assessor before being elected county treasurer in 2012. He was reelected in 2016. He later resigned to take the Luna County job.Meanwhile, a restaurant in Kirtland also is sparking anger for erecting a sign that blamed China for closing amid the pandemic."CLOSED you can thank CHINA!!!" the sign read outside the Country Family Restaurant."I stuck up that little-bitty sign that explained my thoughts about the communist Chinese government and the way they treat their people," the eatery's owner, Steve Jackson, told the Farmington Daily-Times.Former Navajo Nation Attorney General Harrison Tsosie said he would never eat at the place again and urged other members of the Navajo Nation to avoid it.Earlier this month, President Donald Trump faces criticism for saying he didn't think calling COVID-19 the "Chinese virus" - or the "kung-flu," as one administration official reportedly called it - puts Asian Americans at risk of retaliation despite growing reports they are facing virus-related discrimination.Since coronavirus infections started appearing in the United States in January, Asian Americans have shared stories from minor aggression to blatant attacks by people blaming them for the pandemic.Republican Party of New Mexico Chairman Steve Pearce said he's not offended by Trump's use of the words "Chinese virus." He said the controversy was a result of political correctness.Load-Date: April 1, 2020End of Document

The Basic Law states clearly that the authority to advance Article 23 legislation rests with the executive and legislative branches of the Hong Kong government, and not with Beijing. The Chinese government is once again breaking its promises to the people of Hong Kong and the international community."This comes on the heels of a series of other serious blows to Hong Kong's self-rule in recent weeks, including the advocacy of a law criminalizing disrespect of the national anthem of the People's Republic of China and pressure on Hong Kong's legislature that led to the sidelining of pro-democracy legislators."The United States will stand resolute in its support of the Hong Kong people. These developments are of grave concern to the United States, and could lead to a significant reassessment on U.S. policy towards Hong Kong."###Cory Gardner is a member of the U.S. Senate serving Colorado.

The Basic Law states clearly that the authority to advance Article 23 legislation rests with the executive and legislative branches of the Hong Kong government, and not with Beijing. The Chinese government is once again breaking its promises to the people of Hong Kong and the international community."This comes on the heels of a series of other serious blows to Hong Kong's self-rule in recent weeks, including the advocacy of a law criminalizing disrespect of the national anthem of the People's Republic of China and pressure on Hong Kong's legislature that led to the sidelining of pro-democracy legislators."The United States will stand resolute in its support of the Hong Kong people. These developments are of grave concern to the United States, and could lead to a significant reassessment on U.S. policy towards Hong Kong."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7120220 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 23, 2020End of Document

The limits of surveillance capitalismCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 7, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1235 wordsBodyUntil the emergence of coronavirus, a central concern of some Western intellectual elites (Confucian Asian culture is, perhaps, something else), was what Shoshana Zuboff, in his excellent book, dubbed the "surveillance capitalism." That is, the ability of large technology companies, in particular Facebook and Google, to monitor, predict and manipulate our behavior, through artificial intelligence (AI) using massive data (big data). However, despite this abundance of data and that, along with other companies such as China's WeChat, are the big powers in that technology, these companies were unable to detect the extent of Covid-19's spread and alert governments (with whom they normally have a close relationship) effectively. With all its enormous technological, scientific and intellectual might, based on its ability to predict the future, at least that of each of us, immense questions now arise: How can they have been unable to anticipate a catastrophe of such magnitude as the current one, not to issue a warning when it was still in time, and not to use that information to positively modify the behavior of its users , contributing to the early flattening of the epidemic curve? The same question can be translated into governments, with their data scientists and their ability to massively capture personal ones. How could they get over it? The Covid-19 crisis is a humiliation bath for data science and Artificial Intelligence, and consequently for so-called surveillance capitalism.It is true that once outbreaks were detected, the Chinese government, and others like south Korea, Singapore, or Taiwan—which were better prepared as a result of previous epidemics—decided to take drastic measures of a very diverse nature, many of them quite successfully. The situation and reaction in the West has been very different. For example, according to The Washington Post, U.S. intelligence services had already warned in January of the importance of the viral outbreak to their own government, which basically did nothing. The same skepticism and consequent delay in action has been seen in most countries where the epidemic has passed. Indeed, in China itself, the authorities initially underestimated the threat by censorship of all the information in this regard, despite numerous warnings from doctors and patients circulating on their social networks.There are several factors that can serve to explain this colossal failure of surveillance capitalism. One of them has to do with his priorities. These systems are focused on monitoring and guiding our consumption habits, our usual behavioral patterns, and even our political tendencies, rather than our pathologies or abnormal tendencies. Somehow, they tend to maximize what we prefer, or think we prefer, and minimize everything that bothers us in our daily lives. These systems don't deal well with surprise.Powerful Collective Intelligence is needed to integrate a short-sighted AISecond, social media was unable to integrate information from epidemiological and sick experts who expressed symptoms in them. There hasn't been a fake news problem— which has also existed, but it's basically been an incoherent news problem, something that's now being right for forced marches. In this case, networks have not, at least initially, allowed a coherent view of the epidemic to be established. And this even though they could have been very useful integrating all the existing information from experts, patients and other users. A Facebook of epidemiology would have been a valuable tool in thecontext, although it would need a completely different architecture.A third, more important factor is that efforts in Collective Intelligence—very present (and funded) in the 1990s—have been abandoned in favor of Artificial Intelligence in recent times. The first as Defined by Geoff Mulgan, in a 2018 book, is "any kind of large-scale intelligence involving groups that choose to be, think and act together." Of course, it must be pushed on a technological basis. Artificial Intelligence should be at the service of the Collective and not the other way around. And this should be the case, and it has begun to be so, in the search for solutions to this virus. Competition between data science experts is healthy and creative. However, we are attending excessive competition, coupled with a constant search for prominence for having the best model or platform best designed, the most original algorithm and/or the one that best predicts the future. Far away is Collective Intelligence, based on the cooperation of scientists so much in the search for answers, whether in the form of antiviral drugs, vaccines or official applications (apps) for monitoring their expansion and incidence. This crisis has highlighted the need for a world with more cooperation between intelligences, whether human or artificial.Yes, surveillance and privacy issues arise, as Yuval Noah Harari and Byung-Chul Han have pointed out, among others. It seems to be typical of the human condition, to solve a problem by generating others by the hand of that own solution. But it also responds to the scientific (and political) method of solving problems one by one, and not all at once. The priority is now to resolve the virus onslaught and push it back. Some believe they see the twilight of Western liberal democracy (although there is another Eastern one, as evidenced by the cases of Japan, Taiwan or South Korea) in order to our individual privacy. But apocalyptic visions are of little use in solving the current problem. And well-used and organized, Collective Intelligence can also serve to dominate excess surveillance. We must not fall into the defeat of thinking that the technology we are using, or can use, to stop the pandemic is a no return to more vigilance, for its scope and temporality will depend on its control by citizens.Governments have taken too long to learn from each other— and in some cases. The warnings from great experts that something like this could happen were there, at least, since 2005. While possible, the danger and its defences have not been assessed collectively. WHO should have taken this leadership in this area. Despite the advances of this organization, a true global health system based on a technology capable of integrating the information of experts from all fields, including that of experts in Artificial Intelligence, is lacking. Artificially-based Collective Intelligence should serve to create a diverse healthcare system, consisting of real and potential patient data, as well as medical experts, with a technological and multi-level basis, which is now not possible given the existing legal limitations, except in China and other authoritarian countries.Therefore, today it is more necessary than ever to reform this capitalism, rich in Artificial Intelligence on specific and limited problems, but too poor in Collective Intelligence, for well-understood surveillance to transform it into a cooperative system. Will we know how to do it?José Balsa-Barreiro is a researcher in the Human Dynamics and Connection Science groups of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston; Manuel Cebrián is research leader at Max PlanckInstitute for Human Development in Berlin and Andrés Ortega is a research associate for technological transformations at the Royal Elcano Institute and director of the Observatory of Ideas.Load-Date: April 8, 2020End of Document

Congress seeks to ban Uighur-made importsAssociated Press InternationalMarch 11, 2020 Wednesday 9:32 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 357 wordsByline: MARTHA MENDOZA, Associated PressBodyA bipartisan Congressional commission said Wednesday that China is forcing Uighurs and other minorities to work against their will in detention centers and factories in Xinjiang in the far West, and called for a halt of U.S. imports from the entire region.The newly introduced Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act says the ban is needed because forced labor has contaminated the entire 640,000 square mile Xinjiang region, making it impossible to fairly audit factories where workers can't speak freely.Over the past four years, the Chinese government has detained more than a million people from Xinjiang, most of them Uighurs, in internment camps and prisons where they are subjected to ideological and behavioral requirements. China has long suspected the Uighurs, who are mostly Muslim, of harboring separatist tendencies because of their distinct culture, language and religion.In recent reports, The Associated Press and other news organizations have repeatedly found that people inside the internment camps and prisons, places activists call "black factories," are making products for popular brands including Adidas, Costco and Tommy Hilfiger. The Congressional Commission released a report Wednesday citing 20 businesses.Most recently AP reported that Uighurs are also being outsourced across the country to a sprawling Chinese factory in Nanchang that turns out computer screens, cameras and fingerprint scanners for a supplier to international tech giants such as Apple and Lenovo.All U.S. firms that responded to requests for comment said they don't allow labor abuse in their supply chains and that they were investigating. Some have since halted imports from suspected Uighur-staffed factories.Chinese authorities say they are not abusing Uighurs and that job training is voluntary.Federal law already bans the import of products made by people who are being forced to work. Customs and Border Protection, the agency responsible for enforcing the law, halted several shipments from a Xinjiang factory last year. Lawmakers are now calling for a halt on imports of all products made in the entire area, home to some 23 million people.Load-Date: March 12, 2020End of Document

Huawei's future in U.K. 5G networks in question again FierceWirelessMay 26, 2020Copyright 2020 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 650 wordsByline: Bevin FletcherHighlight: Huawei's role in U.K. mobile networks may be in question once again, as the country's security agency launched a review of what impact new U.S. sanctions on the China telecom giant might have on Britain's telecom networks. BodyHuawei's role in U.K. mobile networks may be in question once again, as the country's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) launched a review of what impact new U.S. sanctions on the China telecom giant might have on Britain's telecom networks.In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for the U.K. government said: “The security and resilience of our networks is of paramount importance. Following the US announcement of additional sanctions against Huawei, the NCSC is looking carefully at any impact they could have to the UK's networks.”Of the review by NCSC, which is part of the U.K.'s GCHQ security and intelligence office, Huawei VP Victor Zhang commented in an emailed statement to Fierce: “Our priority remains to continue the rollout of a reliable and secure 5G networks across Britain. We are happy to discuss with NCSC any concerns they may have and hope to continue the close working relationship we have enjoyed for the last ten years.”RELATED: Industry Voices—Madden: Huawei gut-punched into survival modeThis follows reports last week that U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson changed course on the earlier decision to allow Huawei a limited role supplying telecom networks, which excluded “high-risk vendors” including Huawei from U.K. operators' core networks and placed a 35% cap on its presence in the radio access network (RAN). Instead, the U.K. now appears to be drawing up plans that would see use of Huawei gear completely phased out by 2023, according to a Telegraph            report, further verified by other            outlets citing unnamed British government officials.The U.S. has campaigned for allies to bar Huawei from 5G networks over security concerns it could be forced into Chinese government-backed spying or disruption to communications networks – claims Huawei has continuously denied. U.S. lawmakers took steps this year signaling their desire for the U.K. to reverse its decision against a total ban on Huawei.The NCSC review is focused on the impact of U.S. sanctionson U.K. telecom networks, indicating the agency is not reviewing Huawei independently of those actions.RELATED: Trump extends telecom order targeting Huawei gear by one yearIn an earlier statement, Zhang indicated the reports of a complete phase out came as a surprise to Huawei. “We've seen the reports from unnamed sources which simply don't make sense. The government decided in January to approve our part in the 5G rollout, because Britain needs the best possible technologies, more choice, innovation and more suppliers, all of which means more secure and more resilient networks,” stated Zhang in emailed comments. “As a private company, 100% owned by employees, which has operated in the UK for 20 years, our priority has been to help mobile and broadband companies keep Britain connected.”Huawei is already present in some U.K. operators' 4G networks, including Vodafone and BT. In early 2020, BT pegged the cost of implementing NCSC's guidance on Huawei gear at about            $658 million over five years. BT later selected Ericsson to supply its 4G and 5G core going forward.RELATED: BT picks Ericsson for 4G, 5G core, replacing HuaweiOver the last year amid U.S.- China trade tensions, pressure mounted against Huawei as the U.S. worked to keep the vendor out of next-gen networks and blacklisted it from procuring U.S.-based tech components and software. As Mobile Experts' Joe Madden put it in a            recent column for FierceWireless, with the U.S. action this month Huawei “took a punch to the gut” when the Department of Commerce restricted its access to semiconductors that use fabrication equipment and design tools from U.S. companies.As a leading smartphone maker, the action has been seen as a major hit to Huawei, who was already            struggling to launch handsets without access to Google's propriety software, including the popular Google Play Store app.Load-Date: May 26, 2020End of Document

On the praise of surveillance as an exit from the pandemicCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 12, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 789 wordsBodyThe global crisis generated by coronavirus is tackled by national states in different ways. International agencies have had little weight on the strategies chosen by each country. Over the past few weeks, some opinion columns have praised the policies of certain Asian states to the detriment of European ones. Above all, those decisions linked to the use of big data and surveillance to prevent the contagion of the virus.The Chinese government, for example, implemented contactless temperature detection software in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. The intention is to recognize those who have one of the symptoms of Covid-19. With helmets that have this software installed, security forces control schools, subways, and community center to identify potential infected people.The technology mentioned is just one more of the citizen surveillance system that China has had for several years. The system is composed, among other things, by its "Great Firewall" (this is called China's iron control over the internet and includes online censorship and surveillance) and its exported camera system for facial recognition.How China's controversial social credit system works: A ranking of the "good citizen"Taiwan, on the other hand, has been praised for its low number of infected people considering its closeness to China. Days ago the story of Milo Hsieh, an American student who lives there and was quarantined after returning from Europe, became known. One morning last week his cell phone ran out of battery and within minutes he had police forces at his doorstep. The Taiwanese government monitors the quarantine of its citizens through the "tracking" of their smartphones. The absence of a signal, in that case, alerted the authorities.These strategies that may seem very effective (indeed, perhaps) give unimaginable power to states (and their respective governments) and, if the necessary steps are not taken, to the companies that provide the services.The South Korean philosopher Byung-Chul Han recently wrote of this phenomenon: "To deal with the virus, Asians are strongly committed to digital surveillance. They suspect that big data could hold up enormous potential to defend against the pandemic. It could be said that in Asia epidemics are not only fought by virologists and epidemiologists, but also by computer scientists and big data specialists. A paradigm shift that Europe has not yet learned about. The apologetas of digital surveillance would proclaim that Big Data saves human lives."From Butler to Chul-Han, the world that awaits usSince 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation, better known as GDPR, has been in place in the European Union. This regulation was born with the aim of giving European citizens more rights over their personal data at a time when data has taken unimaginable value for businesses. It affects what European and foreign companies can do. It marked an important milestone in terms of digital privacy policies.The philosopher and historian Yuval Noah Harari also reports this process initiated by coronavirus: "If we are not careful, the epidemic could mark an important milestone in the history of surveillance. Not only because it could normalize the deployment of mass surveillance tools in countries that have so far rejected them, but even more so because it means a dramatic transition from 'skin' to 'under the skin'."Your data, my dataThis pandemic is far from the first situation that arouses thegovernments' interest in the personal data that technology may collect. Apple CEO Tim Cook has already said no, several times, to the FBI's request to be able to access criminal devices through special software designed by the company.Cook's argument for rejecting this request is that creating that "back door" that gives access to smartphones would be to put the millions of users of its products at risk. With the risk of becoming a company that indirectly collaborates with terrorism, Apple set a position on the side of civil rights and privacy.Shortly after the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. Congress passed the Patriot Act, which gave a lot of surveillance power to the government and its intelligence agencies. The revelations made by Edward Snowden in 2013 accounted for an abuse of the powers granted by that law during the Bush and Obama administrations. The NSA, one of the U.S. security agencies, for years collected information indiscriminately from internet communications and phone calls.At the time of its approval, the Patriot Act had an almost total consensus. We had to do whatever it took to fight terrorism. Rapid decision-making was required for a situation of great social panic. Pretty similar to the one we're living these days.Advertising       Load-Date: April 13, 2020End of Document

Coronavirus: access to coronavirus vaccine should be "universal"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 14, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 326 wordsBodyWith several countries in a race against time to get a coronavirus vaccineas soon as possible, many warned that the first to reach the finish line will reserve the doses of the new elixir for their population. The rest of the world will have to wait. And considering that these countries can be the U.S. or China with hundreds of millions of people, there will be little left for others. In this context, the European Commission sent a harsh warning on Thursday: the Covid-19 vaccine must be fairly available to all countries.? The warning came after pharmaceutical group Sanofi announced what everyone suspected: that it would prioritize the United States."The COVID-19 vaccine should be a global public good and its access must be equitable and universal," Community spokesman Stefan de Keersmaecker, for whom "the virus is a global virus, said at a press conference."Today there are 101 experiments against the new coronavirus that causes Covid-19 disease. But it's not certain that any of those projects will see the light of day. Everyone could fail.Another possibility is that some will thrive and the vaccine will reach the world in 12 months.Spanish virologists explained that the priority today should be to achieve a vaccine that stops the number of deaths and saturation of hospitals, but that in the long term a vaccine should be achieved 100% effective.The race for a vaccine has triggered an industrial espionage war between countries (including allied countries) for stealing scientific advances from laboratories.The FBI warned Wednesday of an army of Chinese hackers on that mission, something China strongly denmented on Thursday.China expresses its displeasure and strong opposition to such slander," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian. U.S. Federal Police (FBI) on Wednesday accused hackers, but also researchers and students close to the Chinese government, of stealing data on coronavirus treatments and vaccines.Source: agenciesLoad-Date: May 15, 2020End of Document

The Year of Plague: When Reality Outstrips FictionCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 3, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 921 wordsBodyUpon her return to the United States from Hong Kong after a business trip, Beth Emhoff began with symptoms of a cold leading to fatal pneumonia, a process that was also suffered by other people who had contact with her. The strange and deadly disease spread rapidly among people from different countries and the World Health Organization decided to follow in the footsteps of the "zero" patient on her journey to discover a vaccine.Beth is actually the famous actress Gwyneth Paltrow and the story, which seems to be the introduction of a regular chronicle these days on any news portal, is the plot of a 2011 Hollywood thriller that mixes drama and suspense under the baton of director Steven Soderbergh. When Contagionpremiered, no one should have crossed his mind that, nine years later, reality would almost surpass fiction: among the disbelievers of the time, there may be many viewers of the film who today may be among those infected by the stranger but this time true virus that was also born in China.Soderbergh should think about continuing the saga, but now the script's authors can rely on facts as true as it is that they are apocalyptic, to the point of putting cinematic creativity in check. Any resemblance to fiction will not be mere coincidence.Other opportunitiesIt's not the first time reality has been pressing on Hollywood's lush, prophetic fantasies. The dantesque images of the brutal impact of two planes on the Twin Towers and the fireball, smoke and debris that engulfed the dramatic collapse of the two moles, recalled not a few works of the American catastrophe cinema in which New York is the scene of terrible hecatombes. Until 2001, only in films could the cosmopolitan city be imagined with its streets transformed into a replica of any Middle Eastern city demolished by bombs and missiles."Contagion" is one of the most watched films amid the coronavirus epidemicHypotheses about the origin of the pandemic virus also compete with film fiction, riddled with stories of conspiracies to which it is difficult to assign plausibility.There are few who give certain such explanatory arguments, while more distrustful ones choose to pay so much attention to them that they come to the point of questioning the official versions accepted by the majority.This category includes, for example, the tweet of former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, where he claims that Covid-19 is a biological weapon created in laboratory. At the heart of that theory was Bill Gates, who is told by stories circulating on the Internet as the driver of artificial synthesis of the virus, with the aim of creating an outbreak that would mean a big deal for the foundation he runs, vaccines through.Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe, from the Buckingham Center for Astrobiology, decided to raise the stakes a little more: in the early 2020s, he claimed that a fireball that fell in northern China last October is a very likely source of the fashion virus. This hypothesis is reminiscent of The Threat of Andromeda,an American film released in 1971, although in that film what falls from the sky with a strange and deadly space germ is not a meteorite, but an American satellite that crashes in the Region of New Mexico.GuiltyThe pandemic is also fertile ground for pointing out culprits and taking responsibilities off, no one wants to be the one who threw the first stone. Zhao Lijian, a man in the chancellery of the Chinese government, blamed the United States for spreading the coronavirus in Wuhan,epicenter of the plague outbreak in the Asian country.According to that official, American uniforms spread the virus in that city when they participated in the World Military Games held at the site. According to this version, the virus was not born in China, but on Donald Trump's land, although U.S. authorities would hide the truth about the first infected.End-of-the-world general essay: commentary on "Contagio"To be sure, Trump and American power circles counterattacked: in recent days they have taken hold of the version that points to an accidental "leak" of the virus from a Chinese lab dedicated to studying coronavirus in bats.Almost as in the English film 28 days later (Extermination),released in 2002, only in this case the "escape" of a highly contagious microorganism from inside a laboratory is the result of a violent incident. The virus of fiction, rage, also originates in the beaten creatures.But it's not just English-speaking cinema that prophesies facts that then compete with fiction. The flu,a 2013 film from South Korea, which with good time again offers Netflix around the time, reflects the psychosis produced in a major South Korean district by the H5N1 virus that kills its victims in 36 hours. Reality strives to impale that story.The denialism of some rulers about the coronavirus and the economic effects of the pandemic were already announced in The Year of Plague,a 1979 Mexican film whose plot came out of Gabriel García Márquez's pen.This work describes how a quarantine affects the economy and social life and shows the authorities' initial contempt for medical warnings about the lethality of a respiratory virus installed in Mexico. It is possible that Andrés López Obrador has seen that film in his youth.The prophetic screen: when fiction becomes reality is the title of a book written by the Spanish sociologist Pablo Francescutti. His idea is based on a key question: does reality copy to the cinema? Maybe he copies him so much he usually gets over it.Advertising       Load-Date: May 4, 2020End of Document

With the strong upward move on the day, the major averages reached their best closing levels in over a month. The major averages all closed firmly positive, although the tech-heavy Nasdaq outperformed its counterparts. The Nasdaq spiked 323.32 points or 4 percent to 8,515.74, while the Dow jumped 558.99 points or 2.4 percent to 23,949.76 and the S&P; 500 surged up 84.43 points or 3.1 percent to 2,846.06. The rally on Wall Street came as traders continued to express optimism about signs of a flattening of the coronavirus curve. In a press briefing on Monday, President Donald Trump defended his administration's response to the pandemic and indicated he is working on plans to re-open the country. Other officials, such as White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, have also recently expressed cautious optimism. Cuomo said on Tuesday that the number of coronavirus deaths in New York rose to 778 on Monday after declining for two days but noted other indicators continue to be more encouraging. Encouraging exports data out of China has also helped ease fears of the pandemic resulting in a deep global recession. In dollar terms, Chinese exports decreased 6.6 percent on a yearly basis in March, data from the General Administration of Customs revealed. This was much slower than the expected decrease of 14 percent. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund warned the global economy could see the worst recession since the Great Depression as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the containment measures adopted to slow the outbreak. World GDP is set to contract 3 percent this year, thanks to the lockdowns imposed by countries around the world, the IMF said in its latest World Economic Outlook report. The lender expects global GDP to grow 5.8 percent next year. In a January update to the WEO, the IMF had predicted 3.3 percent global growth this year and a 3.4 percent expansion for next year.

The rally came a day ahead of the release of a report on U.S. retail sales in March. Healthcare, utilities, and commercial real estate stocks also saw considerable strength on the day, while banking stocks bucked the uptrend following the disappointing earnings news from JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher during trading on Tuesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index surged up by 3.1 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index jumped by 1.6 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets turned in a mixed performance on the day.

Why Israel Is the Ideal Ally for This MomentNewsweek.comMay 27, 2020 Wednesday 7:30 AM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 837 wordsByline: Michael Makovsky and Charles PerkinsHighlight: The coronavirus pandemic highlights why Israel is such a crucial ally for the U.S.BodyBefore the outbreak of COVID-19 in China turned the world upside down, a new Great Power competition was emerging between Washington and Beijing, with significant implications for our national security.From the quest for unbreakable codes with quantum computing to unstoppable missiles at hypersonic speed and the dominance of outer space, the race to ensure that the free world, led by the United States, remains the preeminent global economic and military power continues, but with a new twist: health security is now near the top of that list.China has responded to legitimate international criticism over its ongoing suppression of information about the outbreak by threatening to cut off supplies of medicines, protective equipment and even the industrial ingredients needed to produce drugs. Suddenly, the United States realized that supply chains for vitally important products are in the hands of an authoritarian adversary.This is a moment to ask: Which allies can America rely on?At the top of the list is Israel, which now has two of the top ten leading vaccine candidates to combat COVID-19. If Israel strikes gold in the vaccine race, there would be no delay in getting it to America, since the U.S. is Israel's first strategic partner for export. This is in stark contrast to China and even longstanding allies like France and Germany, which quickly nationalized various health-related assets and denied them to other countries when COVID broke out.The opportunity for America to benefit from Israel's pharmaceutical and scientific prowess does not end in the research lab, hospital or pharmacy. The United States and Israel enjoy a unique strategic and diplomatic relationship, rooted in shared values and close cooperation, that dates back to the Cold War. Few, if any, regional powers are as closely aligned with America's foreign policy aspirations, and no U.S. partner does more on the ground to defend U.S. interests. These same trusted channels of military, defense, industrial, intelligence, technological and security cooperation are now being deployed to fight the pandemic.U.S. federal authorities, state governments and our highly stressed public health institutions are starting to take notice. They have been accessing both established and new channels to leverage Israeli innovation to help Americans.Israel's most noteworthy initiatives over recent months range from the prosaic to the truly game-changing.In late March, Israeli pharmaceutical company Teva announced that it would donate more than six million doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets through wholesalers to hospitals across the U.S.—and more than 10 million within a month, to meet the urgent need for this anti-malaria drug widely being used to help treat COVID-19.One of Israel's leading research institutions, the Technion, in collaboration with the Israeli Defense Ministry's R&D branch, developed a 3D-printed supplementary filter layer for breathing masks, known as the Maya sticker. The sticker is composed of disinfectant-coated nanoscale fibers capable of blocking the coronavirus, and has proven to be successful.Israel's premier biological research laboratory—the Israel Institute for Biological Research—is a defense organization founded to protect the population against terror attacks from germ weapons, and it has isolated a key novel virus antibody that represents a watershed breakthrough in formulating an effective treatment for COVID-19.The Israeli counterparts to FEMA and the CDC are in close and regular communication with their American professional colleagues to share relevant data and procedures.Dozens and soon, hundreds, of such public-private collaborative undertakings are emerging, being tested, refined and will ultimately be distributed wherever the need is greatest.Israel's initiatives to address the global pandemic are a far cry from the Chinese government's intellectual property theft and reverse engineering of foreign-origin technology for mass production, market domination and geostrategic advantage.The United States should not rely on non-democratic countries to exercise the kind of transparency and good faith that is needed during a crisis. This lesson extends into other areas of foreign policy, as well. China lied to the world about the outbreak of the virus and continues its dishonesty today.Many in America made a serious mistake by placing so much trust in China during the pandemic. We must now undo the damage. The first step is building on our alliances with countries that share our values, treat us as friends and have the technological capabilities to innovate and creatively solve problems. For our pandemic future, Israel is the ultimate American ally.Michael Makovsky, a former Pentagon official in the George W. Bush administration, is president and CEO of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA). Charles Perkins is director for U.S.-Israel security policy at JINSA.The views expressed in this article are the writers' own.Link to ImageGraphic Tel Aviv, IsraelTHOMAS COEX/AFP via Getty ImagesTel Aviv, IsraelLoad-Date: May 29, 2020End of Document

FBI TAKES AIM AT CYBER CRIME INFRASTRUCTUREUS Fed NewsMarch 5, 2020 Thursday 6:27 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 1477 wordsBodyCHESTNUT HILL, Mass., March 5 -- Boston College issued the following press release:"We don't want to just keep the cyber criminals at bay, we want to burn down their infrastructure," FBI Director Christopher A. Wray told an audience of several hundred cybersecurity experts gathered at Boston College on March 4, in an address that focused on the comprehensive, innovative, and broadly collaborative approach needed to combat an increasingly complex and widespread threat.Wray delivered the keynote address at the fourth annual Boston Conference on Cyber Security, BCCS 2020, organized through a partnership between the FBI and the M.S. in Cybersecurity and Governance Program of BC's Woods College of Advancing Studies to seek better ways to defend against these invasive cyber threats and respond to the vulnerability of U.S. information systems.Cyber crime continues to grow in scope, complexity, and sophistication, Wray told the gathering, and its impact has deepened, making it a powerful weapon for a range of "threat actors," from multi-national cyber syndicates to nation-state adversaries."We can't just fight this threat one by one: One bad guy at a time, one syndicate at a time, one victim company at a time," he said. "We've got to tackle the cyber threat as a whole, applying our capabilities, our intelligence, and our partnerships to their full extent."Wray's remarks to the capacity crowd in Gasson Hall focused on the cyber threat writ large, and the spectrum of ways in which the FBI addresses it.Concerns he cited include a wider-than-ever gamut of methods continually employed in new ways...like the targeting of MSPs-managed service providers-as a way to access scores of victims by hacking just one provider, a technique pioneered in China but now used by criminal hackers.In addition, he said, "we face the increasingly blended threat of state-sponsored economic espionage facilitated by cyber intrusions. More than ever, our adversaries' targets are our nation's core economic assets-our information and ideas, our innovation, our research and development, our technology."No nation poses a broader, more severe threat to those assets than the Chinese government, he said. "They're not just targeting companies related to our defense industry, they're targeting companies producing everything from proprietary rice seeds to software for wind turbines to high-end medical devices. And they're not just targeting innovation and R&D-they're going after cost and pricing information, internal strategy documents...anything that can give them a competitive advantage."Nation-state threats from China, Russia, Iran, North Korea and others also include efforts to obtain controlled defense technology and develop the ability to use cyber means to complement any future real-world conflict. But as dangerous as nation-states are, said Wray, the threat also comes from increasingly sophisticated criminal groups, with hackers on a level previously only seen among government operatives.Befitting the scope of the danger, the U.S. deploys a whole cyber ecosystem against it-and in cross-cutting law enforcement and national security authorities, the FBI is at the center of it, Wray said, citing as an example its work in the 2018 SamSam Ransomware indictment."SamSam was sophisticated malicious software used to hack into the networks of hospitals, schools, companies, government agencies, and a number of other entities, and to encrypt their computers. There were more than 200 victims-including the City of Atlanta, the Port of San Diego, and MedStar Health."To identify the actors, we needed more than just our own intelligence. We needed information from victims across the country, and intelligence and investigative information from foreign partners and private sector entities who were also tracking SamSam. With all those pieces of the puzzle, we were able to attribute the attack to two Iranians."More puzzle pieces helped us determine the actors were working for personal profit, rather than on behalf of the Iranian government. [The Department of Justice] unsealed an indictment in November 2018. And the investigation also enabled the Treasury Department to issue sanctions against two bitcoin exchangers, and for the first time warn the private sector about some of the criminals' virtual currency addresses."Since the indictment and sanctions, we haven't seen any SamSam activity. Partnerships are what made all of this possible," Wray said.Today's threats are too diverse, too dangerous, and too all-encompassing for any agency to tackle alone, he said. "We've got to figure out how we can match strengths...that's the essence of the most effective partnerships."People should be able to say 'there's no better partner' than the FBI," Wray said.The themes emphasized in the FBI director's keynote address-the importance of partnerships across fields and disciplines, and sharing of innovation, intelligence, and expertise-were reflected in remarks and breakout sessions throughout BCCS 2020. Inaugurated in 2017 to encourage just this sort of collaboration, the annual conference, said Wray, "has become one of the most unique gatherings of voices, thinkers, and policy makers in the cyber realm. It's one we're really proud to be a part of at the FBI."Wray's remarks were followed by speakers including Mike Cote, president and CEO of SecureWorks; Helen Dixon, Ireland's commissioner for data protection; and John C. Demers, U.S. assistant attorney general for national security. Panel discussions focused on emerging technologies, operations, enforcement, as well as actual cyber and national security experiences related to risk, compliance, policy, threat trends, preparedness, resilience, and defensive strategies.Cybersecurity specialists participating in BCCS 2020 included other FBI representatives as well as experts from the U.S. departments of Defense and Justice, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Bank of America, Cisco Systems, Data Protection Commission-Ireland, Eversource, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Facebook, FireEye, Google, IBM Security, Jones Day, Microsoft, Liberty Mutual Insurance, Massachusetts Port Authority, Mintz Levin, National Grid, Oracle, Raytheon, and SecureWorks, among others.BCCS 2020 co-organizer Kevin R. Powers, founding director of the Boston College M.S. in Cybersecurity Policy and Governance Program, served as master of ceremonies for the event with FBI Boston Division Special Agent Doug Domin, head of the cyber crime program, and Joanna Baltes, curriculum coordinator of BC's M.S. in cybersecurity program.The conference co-chairs, Woods College Dean Karen Muncaster and FBI Boston Division Special Agent in Charge Joseph R. Bonavolonta, as well as Boston College Executive Vice President Michael Lochhead, also offered welcoming remarks.An approved training provider for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies, BC's M.S. in Cybersecurity Policy and Governance program-which now offers its full curriculum online as well as on campus-aims to prepare professionals to design, develop, and implement cybersecurity strategies that defend against and ensure recovery from cyberattacks and to bridge the communication gap between information technology security professionals and key business stakeholders."Boston College's mission is to educate leaders to address the world's most urgent problems; and that's exactly what we're doing in organizing this conference," said Powers, who also holds positions as assistant professor of the practice at BC Law School and in the Carroll School of Management. "We're taking the lead with the FBI by bringing together senior leaders and experts at BC to discuss ways to enhance cyber and national security. It's part of our program's effort to grow and strengthen the cybersecurity ecosystem...to bring together industry, academia, and government on these issues."FBI Special Agent Bonavolonta, conference co-chair, underscored the message that today's cyber threats "have become much more sophisticated, pervasive, and dangerous as we become increasingly dependent on our digital capabilities."The FBI is very much aware of the urgency of the task we face in defeating them," said Bonavolonta, who oversees all the bureau's operations in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island."This conference marks the fourth year that we've joined forces with Boston College to combine the talents, resources, and insights of our partners in academia, law enforcement, and the private sector to share strategies, intelligence, and better ways to lawfully access the evidence and information we need to keep our country and its citizens safe."

US: Foreign misinformation whips up fears about the virusCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 17, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 587 wordsBodyWASHINGTON (AP) -- Donald Trump's administration claims that there is a foreign disinformation campaign to generate fear in the United States during the coronavirus pandemic, three U.S. officials said Monday.Federal officials began Sunday to deal with what they said was a deliberate attempt by a foreign entity to sow fear that there would be a national quarantine because of the virus. Government agencies acted in coordination that night to disprove that there were such plans, while trying to reassure an already very nervous country about the disruptions to daily life caused by the pandemic.The three federal officials, who spoke on condition of remaining anonymous in order to testify on sensitive matters, did not give the name of the foreign entity they believe is responsible.It is not known whether the attempted misinformation is related to complaints from government officials in recent days that China was disclosing erroneous information about the United States.Last week, the Pentagon accused the Chinese government of spreading "false and absurd conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in which it blamed Us service members."At a news conference Monday, Trump said there may be some foreign entities "playing games," but added that this was irrelevant because he would not order a confinement across the country."It's not nationally right now," he said. He said there are no restrictions on travel within the United States, "but we do assessments every day."The day before, the National Security Council (NSC) tweeted that "rumors spread by text from a national quarantine are false. There is no confinement order at the national level." The NSC encouraged Americans to comply with official government guidelines.States and town halls have banned mass public gatherings, ordered the closure of schools, bars and restaurants, and recommended people to stay some distance from other people in order to reduce the spread of the virus.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the leading national expert on infectious diseases, said Americans should sharply reduce their homes, but he did not indicate that the government would order such a measure. He was specifically asked if he would like a "nationwide confinement" to be implemented."I think Americans should be prepared that they're going to have to protect themost significantly more than we're doing as a country," said Fauci, a member of the White House's special team to combat the spread of coronavirus. He heads the National Institute of Allergic and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health.On the other hand, national security officials said Monday that there had been a "cyber incident" related to the Department of Health and Human Services' computer networks, but that they operated normally. They did not provide details on the extent of what happened, but Secretary Alex Azar later said that the networks had not been penetrated from abroad and that the department has taken strong defense measures."The source of this increase in activity is still being investigated, but there was no data theft," he said.Although officials did not mention a specific entity responsible for the disinformation campaign, US intelligence authorities have repeatedly warned that Russia, China, Iran and other countries are involved in attempts to influence U.S. and voter policiesElections.___The Associated Press reporters Michael Balsamo in Washington, David Klepper in Providence, Rhode Island, and Beatrice Dupuy in New York contributed to this office.Load-Date: March 18, 2020End of Document

US officials: Foreign disinformation is stoking virus fearsAssociated Press InternationalMarch 17, 2020 Tuesday 5:30 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICAL NEWS; Only on APLength: 1233 wordsByline: By ZEKE MILLER and COLLEEN LONG, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - The Trump administration is alleging that a foreign disinformation campaign is underway aimed at spreading fear in the country amid the coronavirus pandemic, three U.S. officials said Monday.On Sunday, federal officials began confronting what they said was a deliberate effort by a foreign entity to sow fears of a nationwide quarantine amid the virus outbreak. Agencies took coordinated action Sunday evening to deny that any such plans were put in place, as they tried to calm a nation already on edge by disruptions to daily life caused by the virus.The three U.S. officials did not name the foreign entity they believe to be responsible. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.It was unclear if the disinformation effort was related to administration officials' complaints in recent days that China was spreading misinformation about the U.S.Last week, the Pentagon accused the Chinese government of promulgating "false & absurd conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 blaming U.S. service members."At a press briefing Monday, President Donald Trump said it could be that there are some foreign entities "playing games." But he said it didn't matter because he was not ordering a nationwide lockdown. "At this point, not nationwide," he said. He said there were no domestic travel restrictions, but "we're talking about it every day."A day earlier, the National Security Council tweeted that "Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE. There is no national lockdown." The NSC encouraged Americans to follow official government guidance.States and municipalities have banned large public gatherings, closed schools, bars and restaurants, and advised people to exercise social distancing to slow the spread of the virus.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday issued guidance recommending against indoor gatherings larger than 50 people for the next eight weeks.The nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said Sunday that Americans should aim to severely curtail leaving their homes, but he did not indicate the government would order such a move. He was specifically questioned on whether he'd like to see a "national lockdown.""I think Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing," said Fauci, a member of the White House task force on combating the spread of coronavirus. He heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health.Also on Monday, national security officials said there had been a "cyber incident" involving the computer networks of the Department of Health and Human Services, but the networks were operating normally. They didn't detail the scope of the incident, but Secretary Alex Azar later said that the networks were not penetrated and that the department has taken strong defensive action."The source of this enhanced activity remains under investigation, but there was no data breach," he said.Although the officials did not name a specific entity responsible for the disinformation campaign, U.S. intelligence officials have repeatedly cautioned that Russia, China, Iran and other countries are engaged in ongoing efforts to influence U.S. policy and voters in elections.Intelligence officials have warned for years that Russia has been engaging in covert social media campaigns using fictional persona, bots, social media postings and disinformation aimed at dividing American public opinion and sowing discord in the electorate.The Justice Department said the Russian social media effort during the 2016 presidential election and the 2018 midterms included spreading distrust for political candidates and causing divisions on social issues, including immigration and gun control.Earlier this year, U.S. intelligence officials privately briefed lawmakers on Russian efforts to stir chaos in American politics and undermine public confidence in this year's election. The briefing detailed Russian efforts to boost the White House bids of both Trump from the GOP and Democrat Bernie Sanders.Rumors about the government's response to the spreading virus have circulated online for weeks, prompting authorities in several states to urge residents to seek out trusted sources in government and news.Attorney General William Barr sent a memo to U.S. attorneys across the country on Monday warning that the Justice Department has seen reports of people selling fake cures for the coronavirus, phishing emails posing as official notices from the CDC and the World Health Organization and malware inserted in apps designed to track the spread of the virus.Barr directed every U.S. attorney to prioritize prosecuting all "criminal conduct related to the current pandemic."On Sunday, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said he's been asked about the rumors by "senior leaders in business, health care, politics.""I've had community leaders and elected officials all text me or call me and say 'I understand on Monday you're basically going to order everybody to shelter in place for two weeks. The message has been exactly the same," the Republican governor said."We have no plans to do that."He said it shows the need for residents to find trusted sources of news and information, such as legitimate news organizations or public health authorities."There's so much information out there," Baker said. "Some of which is legit, but a lot of it is wild speculation."Texts and posts suggesting Texas, Washington and New York states would be shutting down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus escalated with screenshots of text messages circulating online that claimed that within 48 to 72 hours Trump would place the U.S. under a two-week quarantine.New York City officials last week debunked a claim passed around in text messages that the city's Metro-North trains, connecting commuters from the suburbs to the city, would be shut down and that other train service would be limited. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, also said claims that the state would soon be under quarantine were untrue.Andy Carvin, a senior fellow at The Atlantic Council, a Washington based think tank, said the rumors circulating via text are the toughest to trace because they often percolate from private messaging platforms and texts, then are copy-and-pasted into public social media posts."There's no way to know if these are organic or intentional, unfortunately, because the sentiment contained in them is so plausible that they could very easily be born out of home-grown rumors," he said.For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The worldwide outbreak has sickened more than 180,000 people and left more than 7,000 people dead. In the United States, there have been more than 4,000 confirmed cases and scores of deaths.___Associated Press writers Michael Balsamo in Washington, David Klepper in Providence, R.I., and Beatrice Dupuy in New York contributed to this report.___The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

MCSALLY, RICK SCOTT INTRODUCE BILL TO PROTECT COVID-19 VACCINE RESEARCH FROM COMMUNIST CHINAStates News ServiceMay 22, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 887 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Arizona Senator Martha McSally:U.S. SENATE U.S. Senators Martha McSally (R-AZ), Rick Scott (R-FL), Mike Braun (R-IN), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Tom Cotton (R-AR), and Ted Cruz (R-TX) introduced the COVID-19 Vaccine Protection Act to prevent Communist China from stealing or sabotaging American COVID-19 vaccine research. The bill requires a thorough national security evaluation and clearance by the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation of all Chinese student visa holders taking part in activities related to COVID-19 vaccine research.This legislation comes as U.S. officials warn American firms to safeguard their research against China and others known for stealing U.S. technology. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Britain's National Cyber Security Center recently issued a statement saying hackers are "actively targeting organizations ... that include healthcare bodies, pharmaceutical companies, academia, medical research organizations, and local government." The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also issued a recent public service announcement warning organizations researching COVID-19 of likely insider threat targeting and network compromise by China.Senator Martha McSally said, "Communist China has hacked into American systems to steal research and technology for decades. Now, Americans are waking up to China's adversarial actions on many fronts with the coronavirus. Our bill aims to protect the United States' COVID-19 vaccine research from China's ongoing attempts to steal our science and harm Americans."Senator Rick Scott said , "Communist China is responsible for the Coronavirus pandemic, and their lies and misinformation cost American lives. We cannot let Communist China off the hook for this, and we absolutely cannot allow Communist China to steal or sabotage any American research efforts related to the Coronavirus vaccine. The COVID-19 Vaccine Protection Act protects American efforts to create a vaccine as we work to end this pandemic."Senator Mike Braun said, "I know firsthand China doesn't play fair from building a business for 38 years, and their failure to operate on-the-level regarding COVID-19 has caused untold global devastation. Requiring a thorough national security evaluation and clearance for those taking part in COVID-19 vaccine research who hold visas from China is a small measure we can take to help ensure the safety of our research efforts."Senator Marsha Blackburn said, "The Chinese Communist Party is notorious for stealing American technology to make up for China's pitiful inability to self-innovate. We will not stand idly by and watch them steal American vaccine research through spies posing as students, which is why I have led efforts to eliminate Confucius Institutes on college campuses. As we race to find a cure for a virus that has killed nearly 100,000 Americans, we need confidence that the CCP does not harm U.S. efforts to create a vaccine."Senator Joni Ernst said, "Communist China has a long history of intellectual property theft. As our universities and colleges help find a COVID-19 vaccine, it's imperative we don't let China continue to steal our information. We can do that by ensuring our top law enforcement agencies are helping our higher education institutions protect their research."Senator Tom Cotton said, "The Chinese Communist Party wants to steal or sabotage the vaccine for the pandemic it caused. The federal government ought to investigate Chinese nationals taking part in vaccine research to prevent this spying, which follows the same playbook Beijing uses to steal our research in other fields of study."Senator Ted Cruz said, "The same Chinese Communist Party that covered up the coronavirus outbreak also routinely engages in state sponsored theft of intellectual property. We cannot allow China to steal or interfere with American research and development of a vaccine. I'm proud to join my colleagues on this important measure to protect American medical innovation and will continue working to counter China's aggression."The COVID-19 Vaccine Protection Act:Requires a thorough national security evaluation and clearance by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of State, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of all Chinese student visa holders taking part in activities related to COVID-19 vaccine research, who are currently in the United States before issuing any new student visas to nationals of the People's Republic of China (PRC).Requires DHS, in consultation with State Department, DOJ, FBI, CISA, USCIS, ODNI and HHS, to complete an enhanced vetting of nationals of the PRC currently in the U.S. as nonimmigrants under F, J, or M student visas to determine if any student visa holders are a national security threat.Once the review is complete, authorizes DHS secretary, in consultation with all the above agencies, to continuously monitor all nonimmigrant student visa holders (F, M, J) who are nationals of the PRC while in the U.S. and are engaged in, or have access to, the research of any potential COVID-19 vaccine or COVID-19 related material.Requires a briefing to Congress on the results of the review.Load-Date: May 25, 2020End of Document

Since then, they have not been seen nor heard from by anyone outside of China and they are among the world's longest detained prisoners of conscience. We call for their immediate and unconditional release and remain deeply concerned about official restrictions on the practice of Tibetan Buddhism including control over the process of reincarnation, the demolition of buildings and expulsion of religious practitioners from Larung Gar and Yachen Gar, and the implementation of Tibet's new "ethnic unity" regulations. These policies are part of a systematic effort by Chinese authorities to eliminate the distinct religious, linguistic, and cultural identity of the Tibetan people.We call on the Chinese government to uphold its international commitments to protect the rights of ethnic minorities and call on the Administration to use the tools provided by the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act (P.L. 115-330), and those included in the Tibetan Policy and Support Act (H.R. 4331/S.2538), to support the human rights and religious freedom of the Tibetan people."Rubio is the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations' Subcommittee that oversees human rights, and is a member of the Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy.Load-Date: May 18, 2020End of Document

The IMF expects the Spanish economy to fall this year more than in the entire crisis from 2008 to 2013CE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 14, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1270 wordsBodySix years in one. That is the fall that Spain's economy will experience in 2020, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The projected GDP collapse is 8%, concentrated in the first two quarters of the year, i.e. in the six months from January to June. If you take as a reference the six years that go in 2008 - when the junk mortgage crisis erupted in the US - to 2013 - the year in which Spain grew steadily again with the end of the Eurocrisis - the fall was 7%.This is one of the forecasts of the 7th World Economic Outlook report, published today by the IMF, which is summed up in a phrase from the blog post just published by the institution's chief economist, Gita Gopinath: this is"the greatest recession of the world economy since the Great Depression",which lasted from 1930 to 1939 in Europe and until 1941 in the US. Globally, the Fund is an increase in GDP of 3%. As a reference, the crisis triggered by the collapse of junk mortgages only made global GDP decline by a tenth. Just three months ago, in January, the IMF expected the world economy to grow by 3.3% in 2020.These forecasts are based on a scenario "that assumes that the pandemic is disappearing in the second half of 2020 and containment efforts are gradually being relaxed." In that case, and with "political support measures" - a euphemism to avoid the term state aid - 8% of the working days of the year would be lost in the most affected economies, with the damage to concentrated activity in the April-June period. Still, they are projections with a huge degree of uncertainty, given the scarcity of certainties surrounding the Covid-19. If the Fund's worst-case scenario, which estimates a longer period of country closure and a second outbreak in 2021, global GDP would fall by 11%.Some countries are less damaged than others. That is the case of the US, which has the best forecast in the West, with a GDP decline of 5.9% this year, although followed by a growth of 4.7% nextyear. China will grow by 1.2% this year, well below 6.1% in 2019. It is a very bad figure politically for Beijing, as the Government of that country has turned economic statistics into a fetish that must be reached one year yes and another also with a margin of error of one or two tenths. The fact that these numbers don't make sense doesn't matter to the Chinese government, which also sees another political objective of great symbolic importance escape it by the coronavirus: the plan to double GDP per capita between 2010 and 2020. To achieve this, Beijing needed to grow this year to at least 5%. Now, that's for 2021. However, according to the Fund, China's massive stimulus plan will grow by 9.2% by 2021. If that forecast is met - although China's statistics are never entirely credible - it will be China's highest growth since 2011.But, of the big economies, Spain and Italy are by far the worst stops. The GDP cut in both countries amounts to 9.6 percentage points relative to the Fund's January forecasts. That means that three months ago, the institution expected growth in Spain of 1.6%, and now a fall of 8%. Italy moves from an expansion of 0.5% to a drop of 9.1%. No other major economy is approaching the magnitude of the deterioration to these two.The catastrophe doesn't end there. The Fund estimates that the average unemployment rate will be 20.8%. It is the highest level since 2015. Of course, the situation is actually worse for a simple arithmetic reason. 2019 closed with a 14.1% stoppage, according to IMF statistics. Therefore, and forthat the average rises from 14.1% to 20.8% in a year, unemployment will have to approach in some quarters to 30%. In fact, that is one of the most complex aspects of the report. Since the coronavirus hit will presumably be concentrated in the first two quarters, the fall in GDP could be around 10% in those periods. Forecasts reflect this situation, as the fall in GDP is moderated to 7.2% in the fourth quarter, indicating a revival.Recovery in 'L'But the WEO - which stands for the report and also the name it receives colloquially - has a second course: the recovery in Spain will not be in 'V', but rather 'L'. I mean, there won't be a way out of the rapid crisis. On the contrary, first.Unemployment, for example, is back to stay. With the current economic scenario, the Fund estimates that the unemployment rate will be 17.5% on average in 2021. That would be less than half of the jobs being destroyed this year. The same is true of GDP. After the 8% sinking in 2020, only 4.3% will be recovered in 2021. It is therefore a slow revival, with very high unemployment, and many uncertainties. If this scenario is met, Spain will take years to recover the level of wealth it had in February.Europe and Japan will emerge more slowly from the crisis than the US. This does not exclude, much less, States that have refused to apply formulas of solidarity in this crisis. The Netherlands, for example, falls 7.5% this year and is only growing by 3%, according to the Fund. Germany is off a bit better off, with a 7% drop in 2020 and a 5.2% recovery in 2021. The IMF advocates an expansion of aid from states to prevent an even greater collapse of economies, and within that policy it sees with good eyes greater European coordination.There is no country escaping the hecatombe. And, even if they don't make headlines, those in the course of development are the ones who are going to suffer the coronavirus the most. The next steps with these economies will be massive debt-taking, something already being done by some multilateral institutions, such as the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).The fall in global GDP of 3% is historic. And the Spanish one, more. The 8% sinking is close to 10.9% which, for example, contracted Argentina's economy in 2002, after Argentina suspended payments and devalued its currency, and very close to the 8.5% that lost the US economy in 1930, the first year of the Great Depression.Spain is going to suffer a major contraction than Mexico experienced in 1995,during the famous tequila effect, which again forced a devaluation of its currency, broke the banking system, and caused a massive bailout package from the IMF, the US Treasury, and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The fall in GDP is also going to be higher than Korea's in 1998, which forced Korea to carry out a partial suspension of its debt repayment.Economy says IMF confirms "limited" crisis over time and values Spain's fiscal responseThe Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation stresses that the latest forecasts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) point to an "intense" crisis by Covid-19, but of "limited" duration, with an uptick since the fourth quarter and a major recovery in 2021, and stresses that the international body places Spain among the countries rated for its "strong and rapid" fiscal response.This has been pointed out by agency sources following the publication of the latest IMF forecasts, whichhas worsened significantly as a result of the impact of Covid-19 coronavirus, so Spain now expects a 2020 stoppage with 20.8% unemployment and a GDP drop of 8%, while by 2021 it estimates growth of 4.1% and an unemployment rate of 17.5%.The Ministry notes that the IMF's forecasts, in line with those of other agencies, point to "an intense drop in activity in 2020 consistent with the strong containment measures taken by the Government to curb the spread of the pandemic and then an uptick from the fourth quarter with a major recovery in 2021, thus confirming that we would be talking about an intense but limited-duration crisis."Load-Date: April 15, 2020End of Document

Paid users can also choose to exit certain locations. Free users will be locked in data centers in their region, which will mean a data center in the United States for many users.Zoom went from being used by 10 million office workers per day to more than 200 million people, including many consumers. New uses have exposed security flaws with the app's default privacy settings, pushing the company into controversy and encouraging its CEO, Eric Yuan, to focus on security concerns. Researchers at the University of Toronto found that some Zoom calls were routed through data centers in China even though none of the users are in the country, fueling the spectre that the data can be accessible to the Chinese government. The company said it would stop routing calls through China unless one of the participants was located there.Zoom has 19 data centers, which are shared with other tenants, and also uses cloud computing services from Amazon.com Inc. and Oracle Corp.Original Note:Zoom Offers New Call Controls for Paying Clients in Privacy PushFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: April 15, 2020End of Document

Finding the good in the world even during troubled timesThe University Leader: Fort Hays State UniversityApril 6, 2020 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1193 wordsBodyBY CARMEN FANNING"Don't worry about a thing, because every little thing is gonna be alright."The famous lyric by Bob Marley still rings true today. In a time of panic and confusion, we must look for the light in this scary situation. It's easy to get caught up in all the negativity surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, but there is still a lot of good going on.All over the world, people are coming together. If anything, this situation is teaching us to truly value all the little moments of life we take for granted and that at the core we are all the same.For once, people are recognizing the importance of small-paying jobs. Medical workers, grocery workers, sanitation personnel, first-responders, mail carriers and so many more are the people keeping America going during this difficult time. They're risking their lives every day for the sake of our comfort and safety. These people work behind the scenes to keep the world going round.Locally, the Hays community is doing its part to make this transition a little easier for everyone. Companies all over town have donated their time to help others. When students were forced to move off-campus, fellow students helped those living on campus to move their belongings for free. Additionally, Eagle Communications is offering free wifi to students in the area.To combat the feeling of loneliness, the Hays community brought back Draggin' Main. Back in the day, fellow Hays citizens would pack Main Street with their cars to chat and hang out."Let's teach our kids what it was like back in the day when driving together was the best Friday night activity there was," stated a Facebook post by The Bricks in Downtown Hays.Other surrounding towns, such as Victoria, also participated in their own Draggin Main events.Students also have access to Tiger Care Team, a platform for students to connect with during this stressful time. All students received an email asking about the safety, security and academic support available to them. If any student were to lack any of these, they can reach out to a member on the team for help.For those staying on campus, McMindes Hall is offering take-out meals. Students with dining dollars can choose from a selection of meals to pick up and take home with them. The campus is also allowing students who can't go home to stay on campus. The Hays community, along with the university, are ensuring everyone has the resources they need.Nationwide, hospitals lack gloves and masks. A photo from the New York Post even show nurses using trash bags as a means of defense. People are taking it upon themselves to sew masks for the nurses and doctors on the frontline. Doctors and nurses are risking their lives every day with this rapidly increasing pandemic. The demand for gloves and masks can't compete with the accelerated spread of the virus.According to the New York Times, people with the ability to sew are coming together to utilize their talents to help doctors and nurses all over the world."They are making masks for America, much as a previous generation manufactured ammunition and tended 'victory gardens' during World War II," the article said. "Legions of sewers, called to duty in a matter of days via social media and word of mouth, their skills no longer taken for granted or dismissed as a mere hobby. They are working in living rooms, at kitchen tables and inside shuttered storefronts."The National Health Service in London issued a public service announcement for retired doctors and nurses to help at the hospitals.According to the London Economic the government sent out a cry, "Your NHS Needs You." Nearly 4,500 retired nurses and doctors answered the call within 48 hours. It was a great display of public support to tackle the virus.In a March article from Syracuse University, Isaac Budmen and Stephanie Keefe, of Budmen Industries in Liverpool, N.Y., are using the means of their 3D printer company to help those at their local hospital. The couple is mass-producing face shields for coronavirus testing sites. These shields are vital for the workers there to eliminate their exposure to the virus."It just sort of felt right to us to do what we could to help the situation," Budmen said. "I just said we'll get it done. We're really not looking to make money off the county in this crisis. We're just sort of looking to get through it as fast as we can," they said in the article.People all over are using little free libraries to help others. These are public bookcases found in many cities where people can leave books for others to take for free. The goal is to promote paying it forward. In a recent article by Mental Floss, people have begun to leave food, toilet paper and other necessities in these bookcases to lend a helping hand."Many of the makeshift pantries encourage people to pay it forward with handwritten messages like, 'Take what you need, share what you can,' and other similar adaptations of Little Free Library's 'Take a book, leave a book' motto," Ellen Gutoskey of Mental Floss said in the article.This is a great way to help those who can't make it to the grocery store or can't afford the necessities to survive this trying time.Schools and universities nationwide have switched classes to online. The world could use a daily dose of happiness. Yale University is offering a free class, The Science of Well-Being. The class discusses and teaches how to be happy. You can enroll in the class here.Professor Laurie Santo's course description says class topics will cover misconceptions about happiness, annoying features of the mind that lead us to think the way we do, and the research that can help us change."You will ultimately be prepared to successfully incorporate a specific wellness activity into your life," Santo said.China is slowly but surely returning back to normal life. In a recent New York Times article, the Chinese government reports no new local infections. Citizens can now walk around with their masks on and slowly return to normal life. We can look to China with hope that we can and will get through this."As life in China returns to a semblance of normality, many people are moving on," the article states.China is now using its knowledge and resources for controlling the virus to help other countries."China is mounting a diplomatic offensive to help as the rest of the world struggles to get the virus under control," said NYT analysts Steven Myers and Alissa Rubin. "From Japan to Iraq, Spain to Peru, it has provided or pledged humanitarian assistance in the form of donations or medical expertise."There are so many other positive things we can look to during this time. If you have a place to quarantine, you're privileged. If you have toilet paper or food, you're privileged. If you have running water, you are privileged. So many other people around the world don't have access to these. There is still so much good in the world.We will get through this.Share• Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)• Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)• Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)• Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading...RelatedLoad-Date: April 6, 2020End of Document

Treasury futures climbed steadily during the Asian session, backtracking from highs as attention turned to Europe. However, the short-lived pullback was followed by a push to fresh highs in recent trade. The market has been focused on the latest series of signs of a deteriorating U.S.-China relationship. The U.S. Senate unanimously voted in favor of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act last night, which is certain to invite at least a verbal response from China's Communist Party. In addition, the Trump administration will block Huawei from receiving shipments that are a "direct product of certain U.S. software and technology." That was not all, as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company agreed to build an advanced chip foundry in Arizona for $12 bln. This move is likely to strengthen U.S. relations with Taiwan, which is also sure to upset the Chinese government. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% at 100.41.

USD/JPY:107.23.. EUR/USD:1.078Holding a bidU.S. Treasuries held a pretty steady bid before easing up some late in the cash session as a stock market rebound effort gathered some steam. Longer-dated tenors fared best, but in general, Treasuries were supported by underlying growth concerns following an otherwise dismal initial jobless claims report, expectations that the Fed may ultimately have to increase its asset purchases, and some safe-haven posturing as European equity markets turned in a poor showing. The greenback continued to run against other major currencies, evidenced by a 0.2% increase in the U.S. Dollar Index to 100.47, which is a five-week high.Yield Check: 2-yr: -1 bp to 0.14% 3-yr: -2 bps to 0.18% 5-yr: -3 bps to 0.29% 10-yr: -3 bps to 0.62% 30-yr: -4 bps to 1.30%News: The New York Fed will stop conducting three-month term repurchase operations next month.President Trump says he won't renegotiate the trade deal with ChinaThe Trump administration will keep 90-day supply of medical supplies in the national stockpile, according to BloombergWhite House privately signals they are willing to support some state aid as part of bipartisan deal with Democrats, according to Washington PostWhite House repeats that they are open to a phase four stimulus bill, but they reject the bill from House Democrats - CNBCDelta Air Lines currently has 14,000 pilots on staff and will be overstaffed by 7,000 or more pilots by the Fall - CNBC, citing company memo Bank of England Governor, Andrew Bailey, said that the BoE is ready to finance coronavirus-related expenses.Australia's April employment plunged by 594,300 (expected -575,000; last 5,900) and full employment decreased by 220,500 (last -400,000). Today's data:Total jobless claims for the week ending May 9 were 2,981,000 (Briefing.com consensus 2.475 million). That was a decrease of 195,000 from the prior week, but still an exceedingly high number all things considered. Continuing claims for the week ending May 2 increased by 456,000 to 22.833 million, which is yet another record high.The key takeaway from the report is that the alarmingly high level of initial and continuing claims paints a risk of a slower recovery due to weaker consumer spending activity and the rising potential that temporary job losses become permanent job losses in an elongated recovery process.April export prices -3.3%m/m; ex-agricultural products -3.3% m/mApril import prices -2.6% m/m; nonfuel import prices -0.5% m/mCommodities: WTI Crude: +8.5% to $27.44/bbl Gold: +1.3% to $1738.80/ozt Copper: unch at $2.35/lb Currencies: EUR/USD: -0.3% to 1.0781GBP/USD: -0.3% to 1.2192USD/CNH: +0.1% to 7.1184USD/JPY: +0.2% to 107.23The Day Ahead: 08:30 ET: April Retail Sales (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%; Prior -8.7%); ex-auto (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%; Prior -4.5%)08:30 ET: May Empire State Manufacturing (Briefing.com consensus -58.0; Prior -78.2)09:15 ET: April Industrial Production (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%; Prior -5.4%) and Capacity Utilization (Briefing.com consensus 64.0%; Prior 72.7%)10:00 ET: March Business Inventories (Briefing.com consensus -0.4%; Prior -0.4%)10:00 ET: March JOLTS - Job Openings (Prior 6.882M)10:00 ET: May University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index - Prelim.

USD/JPY:107.16.. EUR/USD:1.0832Data ReconIndustrial production declined 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%), which was the largest monthly drop in the 101-year history of the index. The capacity utilization rate fell from 73.2% to 64.9% (Briefing.com consensus 64.0%), which is 14.9 percentage points below its long-run average and a record-low in a series that dates back to 1967. The key takeaway from the report is that it is a reflection of how industrial production cratered amid shutdown orders designed to contain the spread of COVID-19. On a yr/yr basis, industrial production was down 15.0%. Manufacturing output declined 13.7% -- the biggest drop on record. The index for durable manufacturing dropped 19.3%, with the shutdown of motor vehicle assembly plants having a huge impact there. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of motor vehicle assemblies was just 0.18 million versus 7.18 million in March and 11.37 million in February. Mining output declined 6.1%. Utilities output declined 0.9%.The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 73.7 in the preliminary reading for May (Briefing.com consensus 67.4) from 71.8 in April. The key takeaway from the report is that attitudes about current conditions improved while sentiment surrounding the outlook continued to deteriorate, pinched by concerns about financial prospects that were most notable among upper income households. That is apt to be a headwind for a pickup in consumer spending. The Current Economic Conditions Index increased to 83.0 from 74.3. The Index of Consumer Expectations dipped to 67.7 from 70.1.Yield Check:2-yr: +1 bp to 0.15%3-yr: +2 bps to 0.19%5-yr: +1 bp to 0.31%10-yr: +2 bps to 0.64%30-yr: +1 bp to 1.31%10:15 ET10-Yr:-1/32..0.633%..

Treasuries followed their upbeat start with a push to fresh highs, but a pullback began taking shape just 20 minutes after the start. Treasuries have remained on the defensive since then, hitting lows in recent trade. Longer tenors outperformed at the start, but that relative strength has faded in recent trade.

The sales downturn was extreme with double-digit declines in most categories. The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment. Clothing and accessories sales plummeted 78.8%. Electronics and appliance store sales fell 60.6%. Furniture and home furnishing store sales dropped 58.7%. Food services and drinking places sales declined 29.5%. Motor vehicle and parts dealer sales were down 12.4%. The one area of strength was nonstore retailers, which increased 8.4% m/m with the surge in online ordering.Yield Check:2-yr: UNCH at 0.14%3-yr: +1 bp to 0.18%5-yr: -1 bp to 0.29%10-yr: -2 bps to 0.60%30-yr: -3 bps to 1.27%08:08 ET10-Yr:+5/32..0.599%..

Treasury futures climbed steadily during the Asian session, backtracking from highs as attention turned to Europe. However, the short-lived pullback was followed by a push to fresh highs in recent trade. The market has been focused on the latest series of signs of a deteriorating U.S.-China relationship. The U.S. Senate unanimously voted in favor of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act last night, which is certain to invite at least a verbal response from China's Communist Party. In addition, the Trump administration will block Huawei from receiving shipments that are a "direct product of certain U.S. software and technology." That was not all, as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company agreed to build an advanced chip foundry in Arizona for $12 bln. This move is likely to strengthen U.S. relations with Taiwan, which is also sure to upset the Chinese government. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% at 100.41.

USD/JPY:107.23.. EUR/USD:1.078Holding a bidU.S. Treasuries held a pretty steady bid before easing up some late in the cash session as a stock market rebound effort gathered some steam. Longer-dated tenors fared best, but in general, Treasuries were supported by underlying growth concerns following an otherwise dismal initial jobless claims report, expectations that the Fed may ultimately have to increase its asset purchases, and some safe-haven posturing as European equity markets turned in a poor showing. The greenback continued to run against other major currencies, evidenced by a 0.2% increase in the U.S. Dollar Index to 100.47, which is a five-week high.Yield Check: 2-yr: -1 bp to 0.14% 3-yr: -2 bps to 0.18% 5-yr: -3 bps to 0.29% 10-yr: -3 bps to 0.62% 30-yr: -4 bps to 1.30%News: The New York Fed will stop conducting three-month term repurchase operations next month.President Trump says he won't renegotiate the trade deal with ChinaThe Trump administration will keep 90-day supply of medical supplies in the national stockpile, according to BloombergWhite House privately signals they are willing to support some state aid as part of bipartisan deal with Democrats, according to Washington PostWhite House repeats that they are open to a phase four stimulus bill, but they reject the bill from House Democrats - CNBCDelta Air Lines currently has 14,000 pilots on staff and will be overstaffed by 7,000 or more pilots by the Fall - CNBC, citing company memo Bank of England Governor, Andrew Bailey, said that the BoE is ready to finance coronavirus-related expenses.Australia's April employment plunged by 594,300 (expected -575,000; last 5,900) and full employment decreased by 220,500 (last -400,000). Today's data:Total jobless claims for the week ending May 9 were 2,981,000 (Briefing.com consensus 2.475 million). That was a decrease of 195,000 from the prior week, but still an exceedingly high number all things considered. Continuing claims for the week ending May 2 increased by 456,000 to 22.833 million, which is yet another record high.The key takeaway from the report is that the alarmingly high level of initial and continuing claims paints a risk of a slower recovery due to weaker consumer spending activity and the rising potential that temporary job losses become permanent job losses in an elongated recovery process.April export prices -3.3%m/m; ex-agricultural products -3.3% m/mApril import prices -2.6% m/m; nonfuel import prices -0.5% m/mCommodities: WTI Crude: +8.5% to $27.44/bbl Gold: +1.3% to $1738.80/ozt Copper: unch at $2.35/lb Currencies: EUR/USD: -0.3% to 1.0781GBP/USD: -0.3% to 1.2192USD/CNH: +0.1% to 7.1184USD/JPY: +0.2% to 107.23The Day Ahead: 08:30 ET: April Retail Sales (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%; Prior -8.7%); ex-auto (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%; Prior -4.5%)08:30 ET: May Empire State Manufacturing (Briefing.com consensus -58.0; Prior -78.2)09:15 ET: April Industrial Production (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%; Prior -5.4%) and Capacity Utilization (Briefing.com consensus 64.0%; Prior 72.7%)10:00 ET: March Business Inventories (Briefing.com consensus -0.4%; Prior -0.4%)10:00 ET: March JOLTS - Job Openings (Prior 6.882M)10:00 ET: May University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index - Prelim.

Failed Rallies, Semiconductors Rising and the Fed's Big GunsRealMoneyMarch 24, 2020 Tuesday 8:05 AM EDTCopyright 2020 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1693 wordsByline: Stephen GuilfoyleHighlight: The Fed has attacked developing problems in real-time -- and as China shows signs of life, the semi stocks are benefitting.BodyTrackingDensity in the soil. Humidity. Distance between strides. Definition. Tells you more than you think. What are you tracking? How heavy is it? How fast was it moving? Was it stalking? Or was it fleeing? Are you stalking? Or the fuzz on the back of your neck stiffens. You realize that you are almost certainly being watched, probably by a large predator. How foolish? How foolish to think I was top of the food chain all the way out here, all by myself. Slowly, the hand slides down to the Ka-Bar knife hanging off of the right hip, unfastening the sheath. Barely moving.Equity markets tried three times on Monday to put a rally to the tape. One such spate of active pricing came over the final few minutes of the trading day, as everyday Americans deprived of the ability to feed themselves and their families were once again stymied by those in D.C. who just cannot get their acts together at a time that an entire economy has been forced into a deep state of slumber in response to a legitimate health scare. (Without making a political statement supportive of either side here... "You've gotta be kidding me!")Sign Of a Bottom?Not exactly. More like a sign of China trying to get that nation's industrial base back to work. The Chinese government has indicate that the lockdown of the city of Wuhan, where this all began, will be lifted on April 8. What happens in U.S. markets as investors look toward a reopening of the Chinese economy is that semiconductors get hot.That's exactly what happened here on Monday. That's precisely why both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials gave up roughly 3%, while the Nasdaq Composite barely gave up any ground at all. Digging just a little further, the Nasdaq 100, which is even tech-heavier than is the Composite, did close in the green, while the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF  popped 3.4%.Among popular names, Microchip Tech  and Intel  easily lead the way, as ON Semiconductor  , Micron Technology  , Applied Materials  , Advanced Micro Devices  and NXP Semiconductors  all scored gains of more than 5%, easily beating the industry benchmark.What those trading the group look for now, illustrated through the SOXX ETF, would be (underneath the chart) a bullish crossover of the daily Moving Average Convergence Divergence. Though with all three exponential moving averages trading well below zero, I might trust the crossover less than I would under normal circumstances.It all begins with the faintest of confirmations. The baby step would, for newer traders, be a move by the 12-day Exponential Moving Average (black line) over the 26-day EMA (red line) -- if we can get a little help from Congress. As readers can easily understand, a move of the faster line (12 days) over the slower line (26 days) often signals a change in momentum. Day traders use these averages using units measured in minutes instead of days. When I need to try to pad my P/L on a bad day, I pick a volatile name, and go to the three minute chart. Doesn't always work. Just feel that it gives me a chance to fight back. Just an aside. No promises.The FedJust wow. One thing that you have to say about this Fed is that under Jerome Powell's leadership, the Fed has attacked developing problems involving frozen liquidity and issues in the movement of credit in about as real-time as any Fed we have ever seen. As our legislative leadership somehow continues to fail to react to a broadly suffering populace, Jerome Powell and his central bank of been as proactive as I really think they could have been in the face of sudden economic catastrophe.The kitchen sink? Yes. The cupboards too. On Monday, the Federal Reserve re-launched TALF, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Lending Facility as a means to support consumer and business credit issues. This enables investors to purchase securities backed by measures of consumer debt, even revolving debt. The Fed also takes steps now to offer four-year bridge loans to corporations in need of new financing as long as they are investment grade and willing to limit share repurchase programs and dividend payments. Plus, the central bank will be willing to purchase high-quality, already-existing corporate credit, and this will include certain ETFs. Yes, ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) that track the corporate bond market, not equities. This is a market that has seen severe disruption of late, and I think we can all agree that these are wise moves made by the central bank.Lastly, this central bank has decided to buy whatever it has to, as the need to maintain order in markets and the financing of an imminent change in fiscal policy stare a troubled nation in the face. The floors of $500 billion in Treasuries, and $200 billion in mortgage backed securities are last week's roast beef. The Fed now has no caps, no targets. The Fed is going to do what the Fed has to do. Period.If all goes according to plan, and let's face, it, plans change constantly, the Fed will purchase $375 billion in Treasury securities this week alone, while tacking on $250 billion in MBS. The balance sheet? Not right now, kid, we're busy. The Fed may, no, the Fed will, have to do a lot more.Operation NeptuneWe have all heard of "Operation Overlord", as the Battle of Normandy is often referred to. A massive allied airborne and amphibious assault aimed at freeing Western Europe from the shackles of tyranny. It was launched on June 6, 1944, and by August, more than two million allied troops would occupy France. The D-Day invasion itself? The largest seaborne invasion in global history was known as "Operation Neptune."Ever train for amphibious assault? It really stinks. Coming off of a landing craft with 120 pounds on your back... poof... the water is over your head. You can't breathe. The waves won't stop. All with nobody shooting at you, making the June 6 landing all the more incredible. You crawl through the sand, 300, 500 yards or more. Anything to reach a berm or a tree-line.Those two million troops don't free France if no one establishes a beachhead. We may need to establish an economic beachhead. You guys watch Jim Cramer on  last night? Silly question. Of course you did. The Fed cannot do this alone. Fiscal support can only be expected to support hundreds of millions of people for an instance in time. Next month beckons quickly."We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself." --President Donald J. Trump"I'm very proud of the measures being taken to address the public health crisis. But, I'm also very aware that it is unsustainable to run this state and run this country with the economy closed down." --NY Gov. Andrew CuomoNever thought you would see a prominent Republican leader and a prominent leader of Democrats basically think the same thought, did you? Can't say that anymore. So, what is the answer. Choose public safety? Choose economic performance? Can economic performance even be saved at this point? Yes, people will go to work who are not working right now, saving jobs. That said, large swaths of the population will still avoid public contact. There will be less travel, less recreation, far smaller attendance at ballgames or shows. Of that, I have no doubt.Taking steps to get the economy moving does not stop a recession. That's already on the tape. Does it stop something far worse? Would good folks die in greater numbers from poverty or isolation than from exposure to this virus? I really do not know. What Jim suggested last night on his show might work. The quarantining of those older than 65 years of age, or known to have underlying issues with their health. Weekly testing for Covid-19 at workplaces once the tests that can provide a rapid result are broadly available. This might allow the labor force to work without fear, or allow consumers to interact with that labor force, also without fear. If one week, an individual tests positive.. quarantine.. and notification.Perfect solution? We don't have one of those today. A lengthy era of economic despair? We may have to form a beachhead.OvertaxedGilead Sciences  made the announcement on Monday. The firm could no longer continue to fulfill many compassionate-use requests for the experimental Remdesivir treatment for Covid-19. While the firm is working toward filling two studies for patients in the U.S. with moderate and severe symptoms of the infection. The firm has also been trying to provide the drug (that was originally used to target HIV) to patients throughout the U.S., Japan, and much of Europe through the compassionate-use program.The firm will now try to transition toward a broader access program for patients in need, but will have to stop accepting new individual requests for the time being. The firm has stated that pregnant women and children under 18 years of age suffering from severe symptoms would be exempt form the halt during this transition.In the meantime, Regeneron  continues to work toward a treatment, while a nation places some hope in the malaria drug known as hydroxychloroquine, which has been around since 1955. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  has donated 6 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to U.S. hospitals, while Mylan  has restarted production of this drug at its West Virginia location.Eye On...I've got my eye on BP  . Once this stock gets back into the low to mid-$20s, I'll be whole -- not including dividends -- making the entire venture if not worth it, at least profitable. We see a few bucks in this name and I am outta here, probably just above $23 if I can get it. Probably not today. Maybe amid a broad rally inspired by a fiscal pop.Economics (All Times Eastern) 08:55 - Redbook (Weekly):Last 8.5% y/y.09:45 - Markit Manufacturing PMI Flash (Mar):Expecting 45.3, Last 50.7.09:45 - Markit Services PMI Flash (Mar):Expecting 44.7, Last 49.4.10:00 - New Home Sales (Feb):Expecting 748K, Last 764K SAAR.10:00 - Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index (March):Expecting -1, Last -2.16:30 - API Oil Inventories (Weekly):Last -421K.The Fed (All Times Eastern) 09:45 - Speaker:St. LouisFed Pres.

Global Portfolio Risk Report, Friday, May 1MT Newswires Live Briefs PROMay 1, 2020 Friday 8:45 AM ESTCopyright 2020 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 641 wordsBody Long-tense Beijing-Washington relations are in the headlines again, raising concerns for investors already weighing the COVID-19  pandemic. President Donald Trump Thursday raised the issue of "COVID reparation" for damages resulting from the virus, which some contend initially leaked from a state-run virology lab in Wuhan, China. Also, the Trump Administration is pondering a plan to block the Thrift Savings Plan, the federal government's retirement savings fund, from investing $50 billion into a vehicle based on the MSCI All-Country World Index, as China is in that index. Another trigger point between China and the US may come in Hong Kong, the former British crown colony that reverted to mainland China in 1997. In recent weeks, Beijing is said to have engineered the arrest of 15 pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, and demanded that "Hong Kong officials enact national-security legislation-which would ban treason, secession, sedition and subversion against the Chinese government," as reported by The Wall Street Journal. It remains to be seen if a Western powers-Sino showdown will result from Beijing's increasing role in Hong Kong, and if the city's famed financial and property markets will prosper under tighter Beijing rule. Dollar BearsUS dollar bears are a hardy lot, predicting greenback gloom for generations, only to see the dollar hold its own against other major currencies. "Consensus on the dollar has been bearish for years, only to be proven wrong again and again," noted Morgan Stanley. Perhaps this time is different, said the investment adviser. If there is a decent global economy recovery from the COVID-19 lockdowns, then "the demand for US dollars could subside from the current extreme levels." Stronger oil prices would bring more dollars into the petro-kingdoms, and their current-level demand for dollars would also decline, said Morgan Stanley. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve is printing money to finance central-bank buying of bonds, also known as quantitative easing. "In particular, we expect the Fed's unconventional policies, which expand its balance sheet and increase the supply of US dollars to simply outstrip other central banks." So, less demand and more supply of greenbacks in H2 2020 and thereafter and a dollar decline.Emerging Market Debt DefaultsThe speculative-grade default rate for emerging market companies will likely rise sharply in 2020, predicted Moody's Investors Service. "We base our forecasts on the expectation of a global recession and widening high-yield spreads, as coronavirus-induced economic disruption and financial market turmoil have intensified." Recently, noted investor Howards Marks' Oaktree Capital announced plans to raise $15 billion for a new distressed-debt fund. The investment house said it saw "unprecedented" opportunities in Asian distressed debt.VIX/Gold/BitcoinMarket volatility may be heating up again. The Cboe VIX, a metric of expected US stock market volatility in the next 30 days, posted at 38.67 pre-market Friday, up 13.24%. Readings above 20 indicate the market is projecting above-average volatility in the next four weeks of trading. The VIX has retreated from the high of 82.69 set on March 16, and sank into the low 30s earlier this week, but is rising again.Gold, the safe-haven metal, is uncertain and trades near near $1,678 an ounce pre-market, above the $1,300-and-change trading range of most of the last five years, but below the all-time high nominal price of $1,908 it hit in 2011. Gold has made a few runs at $1,700 an ounce in recent weeks, but can't seem to hold above that plateau.Bitcoin, dubbed the "new gold" by some, trades near $8,932 pre-market. That is above H1 2019, but below the July 2019 high of $12,927, or February 2020 highs above $10,000.  Bitcoin also hit an all-time high near $20,000 in December 2017.Load-Date: May 2, 2020End of Document

US APPROACHING PEAK OF 'ACTIVE' COVID-19 CASES, STRAIN ON MEDICAL RESOURCES, NEW MODELING SHOWSStates News ServiceApril 10, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 925 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: SEATTLE, Wash. BodyThe following information was released by the University of Washington:James UrtonA new data-driven mathematical model of the coronavirus pandemic predicts that the United States will peak in the number of "active" COVID-19 cases on or around April 20, marking a critical milestone on the demand for medical resources."This indicates an important turning point that each country will reach in the COVID-19 pandemic, and we predict that the United States is on course to reach this point in the coming weeks," said Ka-Kit Tung, a professor of applied mathematics at the University of Washington. "It is a point of maximum strain on a country's health and medical infrastructure."The new model is intended to help health officials and policymakers see at least two weeks in advance how COVID-19 will likely strain medical infrastructure in the U.S. and around the world. It relies on the number of newly diagnosed cases and the number of individuals who have recovered or died in a geographic region whether an entire country or a subnational level like a state or province.Norden Huang and Fangli Qiao, both from the First Institute of Oceanography's Data Analysis Laboratory in Qingdao, China, created the model with Tung. Their paper describing the analysis is not yet peer reviewed but has been submitted to a journal for consideration. Their study was posted March 30 to the preprint site medRxiv.For the U.S., this model predicts that:The rate of daily new COVID-19 cases peaked on April 5-7, a projection that appears to be accurate, according to TungThe number of "active" COVID-19 cases, which are individuals who have been diagnosed but haven't recovered or died, will peak on April 20, plus or minus four days, and will then slowly decline as the number of cases entering the medical system becomes less than the number of cases leaving the medical systemThe U.S. outbreak will taper off in the first week of June with projections of 710,000 total cases, but could be up to 990,000, and 28,000 deaths, but could be up to 39,000, if the current U.S. fatality rate of 4% holdsTheir model also predicts that other hard-hit countries, such as Germany and Spain, have either recently peaked in active COVID-19 cases or will do so soon. The United Kingdom will not peak until the latter half of April, according to the analysis.The model finds that the length of outbreaks will also vary by country. Germany and Italy will take a week longer than the city of Wuhan, China the earliest epicenter to reach their turning point in active COVID-19 cases. The United States is projected to take two weeks longer than Wuhan. Wuhan and Hubei Province were placed under strict lockdowns by the Chinese government early in the outbreak, which may explain the shorter course there, said Tung. Italy was slower to roll out lockdowns, first regionally and then nationally. The United States has no national lockdown, though a majority of states have issued stay-at-home orders.The researchers tested the model's efficacy using COVID-19 data from China. With an accuracy of a few days, their model predicted key events in the outbreak's growth, spread and decline of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei and the rest of China including the peak of new cases, the peak of active cases and the subsidence of the epidemic. Wuhan's 76-day lockdown was lifted April 8.Scientists at the UW's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation have created a separate data-driven model for COVID-19, which relies on other pieces of information about the pandemic, such as observed death rates. In contrast, the model by Huang, Qiao and Tung uses the number of newly diagnosed cases and the number of individuals who have recovered or died. The Institute's model primarily projects COVID-19 deaths in a region, as well as the demand for hospital resources such as ventilators."Our two approaches complement one another, providing the projections that health officials and governments need to understand when the maximum strain on resources is coming, and to show how the course of the pandemic depends heavily on the level of social distancing measures adopted," said Tung.Compared to other modeling approaches, such as widely reported projections from the Imperial College London, the model developed by Tung and his colleagues does not require knowledge of the infection rate or the total number of infected cases including asymptomatic individuals. These are difficult data to collect or estimate given the relatively sparse testing for COVID-19 in many countries, and the fact that most symptom-free or mildly ill individuals are not entering the medical system for treatment.As a result of these and other key differences, the predictions by Huang, Qiao and Tung differ significantly from Imperial College London projections of a longer outbreak with 40% to 80% of the U.S. population infected and 1.1 to 2.2 million deaths. The results from the model used by Imperial College London differed significantly because it relied on separate assumptions about COVID-19 and the predictions were generated when key parameters, such as its infection rates, were unknown, according to Tung."Those types of models do serve purposes, such as moving policymakers into action," said Tung. "But once the epidemic begins, it is important to turn to data-driven models that incorporate real-time information such as diagnosed cases, recovered cases and deaths which reflect the effects of policy decisions and the degree of compliance so that we can more realistically project the pandemic's course."Load-Date: April 11, 2020End of Document

Panel Calls For Transparency, Strong Leadership During COVID-19 PandemicThe Hoya: Georgetown UniversityMarch 23, 2020 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 897 wordsBodyTackling the COVID-19 pandemic requires decisive and coordinated leadership, a panel of public health and political experts said at a virtual Zoom forum March 19.COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by a new coronavirus strain, originated in Wuhan, China, in November 2019 and was first reported by the Chinese government in December. Since then, there have been over 300,000 cases in 188 countries and territories around the world, with the highest mortality rate in Italy. As of press time, there have been 31,289 confirmed cases in the United States and 395 deaths, more than double the amount reported just last week, according to CNN.GU POLITICS/FACEBOOK | The Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and the Georgetown Global Health Initiative hosted its first ever virtual forum event over Zoom, a remote conferencing software. The event featured a panel of experts, including U.S. Ebola response coordinator for the Obama administration Ron Klain.Given the rapid spread of the virus, world leaders must organize and communicate effective plans of actions to their people, according to panelist Ron Klain (CAS '83), who served as the U.S. Ebola response coordinator for the Obama administration."We need transparency, we need candor, we need science-led leadership," Klain said. "That's the kind of communication that's going to reassure people and going to tell people we have a plan in place to fight this thing effectively."Many people have criticized President Donald Trump for his administration's response to the pandemic so far, with over half of those surveyed ranking the response of the U.S. federal government as "poor" or "very poor," according to a U.S. News & World Report survey. The U.S. has lagged behind in testing especially, only performing over 71,000 tests so far, while South Korea, which has around 9,000 reported cases, has tested over 270,000 people to date, according to NPR.Although Trump placed travel restrictions on foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the last 14 days as of Jan. 31, the restrictions only temporarily stalled the larger crisis without setting proper contingency plans to limit the spread of the virus in the U.S., according to Klain."Those travel restrictions slowed the spread of the disease, but they bought us time, not protection," Klain said. "With that time, the Trump administration squandered the opportunity. They did not prepare us for testing. We have fallen behind every other developed country in the world for testing its people for this virus."In response to growing concerns around the COVID-19 outbreak, Georgetown University pivoted to online learning and announced that all students must move out of university-owned housing by March 22. With most students off campus, the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and the Georgetown Global Health Initiative hosted the forum event over Zoom, a remote conferencing software. The event, titled "Leadership During Crisis: Combating the Coronavirus," was the first ever GU Politics virtual forum. Georgetown students, faculty and staff were asked to provide their Georgetown email address when responding interested to the event, so that GU Politics could then send out the link to join the Zoom conference, according to the event's Facebook page.Other panelists at the event included Chair of the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services Jeff Colyer (CAS '81), Director of Georgetown 's Center for Global Health Science and Security Rebecca Katz and Former Assistant Secretary of Treasury for the Trump administration Tony Sayegh.Policymakers must collaborate to provide necessary financial assistance to citizens as the pandemic continues to hurt the U.S. economy, Sayegh said."We're all in this together and I really feel very strongly that one of the essence of the American DNA is we fight together and we win together," Sayegh said. "And that's where I feel we are starting to emerge, especially on the economic side with Congress working in such a bipartisan and bicameral way to provide direct relief to the American people."A major concern surrounding the pandemic is its projected effect on the global economy. Many economists are predicting a global recession, as the economies of major countries such as the U.S. and China come to a halt. Economists predict the U.S. economy will shrink 8% between April and June, according to CNN Business.The biggest concern regarding the spread of the virus, however, is the potential for hospitals to be overrun with patients, which is a likely consequence of the U.S. government's failure to enact timely protective measures, according to Klain."We are seeing this disease spread quickly in the country," Klain said. "We didn't do the testing right, we didn't do the contact tracing, we didn't get the hospitals ready, we don't have the equipment where it needs to be and we are going to see the consequences of that in the days ahead."The urgency of the situation creates a need for quick and concise decision-making from political leaders, according to Coyler."You really have to have a leader that's out there communicating every single day," Colyer said. "People haven't experienced this kind of war. This is a war that is on our shores right now so we're in an entirely different environment and different political and decision-making environment."Load-Date: March 23, 2020End of Document

[LINK]In an interview on the Hold These Truths podcast, hosted by Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX), Edward Lazear says that the economic fall out of COVID-19 does not resemble the financial crisis of 20072008: "There is an obvious proximate cause and immediate factor that is reducing economic activity. When that goes away, economic activity should pick up again." [LINK]March 19, 2020In an interview for National Review, Research Fellow Russ Roberts warns that the COVID-19 outbreak, in a worst-case scenario, may have significant financial implications: "I think there's a chance we'll have another round of bailouts." [LINK]In an interview with Fox News's Martha MacCallum, Michael Auslin explains why the Chinese government's claims that it has contained the COVID-19 outbreak are best met with skepticism: the regime cares most "about their own survival and not the people, either in China or around the world." [LINK]On the Grumpy Economist, John Cochrane writes that while debt relief during a crisis is an age-old tradition, bills and contracts will eventually be paid: "It usually means a transfer from whoever entered the crisis not immensely leveraged to those that did." [LINK]On The Classicist podcast, Senior Fellow Victor Davis Hanson argues that COVID-19 may exact an enormous human toll if self-isolation continues for much longer, with consequences including increased anxiety and idleness, and lost income, jobs, and businesses. [LINK]March 18, 2020In an interview on Fox News @ Night, Visiting Fellow John Yoo said that while city "lockdowns" might be going too far, he doesn't believe they are a violation of constitutional rights. [LINK]In an op-ed for RealClearPolitics, Michael Auslin, in Contemporary Asia, writes that, in its desperation to evade blame from the world community, Beijing's propaganda machine has effectively reshaped the narrative about the origins of COVID-19. [LINK]March 17, 2020In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Senior Fellow John Cochrane writes that what the US economy needs during this crisis is more lending and not just a "cash dump" from the federal government: "Since loans must be paid back, larger amounts can go where needed." [LINK]In the American Interest, Distinguished Visiting Fellow Josef Joffe writes that there is no need for the world's democracies to adopt China's model of repression to contain the spread of COVID-19: "If governments communicate truthfully with the people, the ruled do what needs to be done voluntarily." [LINK]In National Review, Senior Fellow Victor Davis Hanson says the global toll of the coronavirus can be attributed back to the Communist Party of China. [LINK]March 16, 2020In his Boston Globe column, Niall Ferguson argues that America's "panic phase" of the COVID-19 epidemic is paradoxically a good one. He says that the United States was at greater risk of infection than Italy but was able to mitigate the pandemic's effects early enough through policies of social distancing.

No cuts to freedomsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 21, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 759 wordsBodyThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic generate changes that we immediately notice. The use of beards, and the need to keep distance between people will be incorporated as usual behaviors.Other changes are in process, they will take longer, but they are already happening, such as the massive incorporation of telework in the business field and the centrality that new information and communication technologies acquired in the cultural, scientific and social fields.A transformation of greater weight and much more complex is the geopolitical change and the new ordering of links and relations at the international level.While Donald Trump launches "Operation Devil Speed," to create a vaccine against the virus that, if found, would be a priority to be used in the United States, Xi Jinping announces to a UN Assembly that when China obtains the vaccines "they will be available as a global public good in order to make them accessible and affordable to all developing countries."To be sure, the great world powers, after underestimating the depth of viralization of the pandemic, are warning of the massive economic crisis in which the world will plunge in the coming months and its devastating consequences on local economies, mainly for developing countries.They play their game of supremacy and compete for a future that today, with much of the population under quarantine, appears far away. We are certainly facing a change in Age that will be able to reformulate the equation between East and West and the relationship between blocs of countries or continents with impoverished and most punished countries.That dispute is not far away, nor should we go unnoticed. Argentina discusses its integration under the new international paradigm. That is why we must make a great effort in the internal consensuses that must be reached to achieve this.What is at stake beyond the economy and health measures, in a false dichotomy that wants to settle down, is democracy.China, Korea and other Asian countries implemented extreme confinement measures and comprehensive population monitoring. Apps of compulsive tracking, among other measures of hard and extreme social control. New Zealand, Sweden, Germany, imposed moderate restrictions on solitary confinement but appealing to civic responsibility in the fight against the disease.It is not right to make any comparisons as the health strategies of each country are unprecedented and homogeneous scientific data can hardly be found to be compared.What is clear is that no simplification is good. It's not about choosing between economics or deaths or between freedom and contagion.Overcoming this pandemic depends to a large extent on collective effort, also on a lot of individual solidarity and awareness. That is why no attempt to cut freedoms is permissible in Argentina's memory. We have very cool the pain and tragedy of the times where democracy was defeated.Neither attempts to silence social networks by posting "scraches" in news signals to twitters expressing divergences with the ruling party, nor the proposal of a minor official to regulate "fakes news" and digital news portals, nor monitoring on citizens' personal data without guarantees of preservation of their privacy should thrive in a society that commits , accompanies and obeys the health indications in the hope that their economic effort, and also emotional, will serve to succeed, never to return to the past.While the Chinese government censored the Weibo network and pursued the "8 gossips" - as the regime called doctors alerting about the first outbreaks of theDonald Trump called The New York Times "Fake News Opposition Party." Populsms or authoritarian leaderships, no matter their ideological bias, share the denial of the press and censorship as a favorite instrument.At the other end, Angela Merkel just noted in the 75th Anniversary of the Free Press in Germany "Democracy needs facts and information, capable of allowing us to discern between truth and lie and, at the same time, to project different perspectives of reality and diversity of opinions" added "Journalists must be able to confront a government and all political actors with a critical perspective" It is good to remember these concepts in Argentina , where the hegemony of the word re-seduces and exacerbates some spirits. We must not think the same, the differences enrich. We will come out of this being better if we learn that the path is not backward and that the repression of divergence is never the way.Silvana Giudici is a former owner of ENACOM.Load-Date: May 22, 2020End of Document

$30+ Bn Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) Equipment Market Outlook, 2025: Stringent Regulations Mandating Safety Drives GrowthPR NewswireApril 3, 2020 Friday 7:02 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2090 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, April 3, 2020 BodyPR NewswireThe"Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) Equipment Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2020 - 2025)"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.The global non-destructive testing equipment market was valued at USD 14,099.26 million in 2019, and it is projected to be worth USD 30,312.98 billion by 2025, registering a CAGR of 6% during the period 2020-2025.The introduction of stringent government safety regulations across different regions, due to an increase in failure incidents and the need for extending the life of aging infrastructure, is compelling the industries to employ testing across their manufacturing cycles.The need for maintenance optimization for efficient operations and quality/safety assurance is further helping the adoption of NDT testing equipment. Moreover, factors, such as safety, increased service intervals, reducing tolerance to disruption, small emission targets, and innovative materials have further contributed to the rising demand for NDT techniques in the aerospace and defense sectors.However, the high cost of acquiring these systems and the lack of skilled technicians may hinder market growth. Also, outsourcing of NDT operations to third-party vendors and the advent of service providers may cripple the sales of these devices.Among the technologies used in NDT testing equipment, the ultrasonic and radiography testing segments are witnessing high innovations, which are aimed at filling in gaps of existing market product offerings. Ultrasonic detectors, however, have significantly aided the demand for ultrasonic test equipment, with Olympus NDT and GE Measurement and Control Systems playing a crucial role in offering these advanced solutions. Within the ultrasonic testing segment, the market for phased array ultrasonic testing is witnessing a saturation, with guided-wave ultrasonic testing being dubbed as the next major fillip.Approximately 70-80% sales of NDT equipment manufacturers, like GE, Olympus, etc., cater to NDT service providers, such as Acuren, Applus RTD, among others, through a wide variety of distributors and local representatives, including Inspection Technologies Inc., Detek, etc.In the end users segment, the global recovery from the slump in crude oil prices has been among the promary factors that have significantly driven investments in the oil and gas vertical. Moreover, assets within the oil and gas industry are complex and have a limited life cycle. By employing Asset Integrity Management (AIM) programs, integrity services, and risk-based inspections, the life cycle of these assets can be significantly improved by increasing ROI. NDT systems here provide clarity enabling to identify, characterize and size flaws, enabling effective, safe, and production asset management.Though the market studied is expected to dwindle in short-term due to volatility, long-term projections create immense market potential for the end-users. Additionally, the emergence of Big Data and IoT devices enabled equipment vendors to integrate improved reporting mechanisms, primarily as a value addition to gain a competitive advantage in the market. However, the lack of skilled professionals and training centers is significantly plaguing the growth of the market studied. Tighter integration, along with equipment manufacturers establishing their own training centers, is expected to partially address this restraint.Key Market TrendsPower & Energy Generation Industry to Witness Strong GrowthThe NDT equipment market witnessed an increased demand from the power generation industry, as most of these plants established have aged and were designed and constructed using the standards, materials, and components, thus, meeting industrial practices prevalent at the time of construction The main scope of NDT applications in the energy and power industry is to help ensure the safety, integrity, and reliability of plant equipment, such as pressure vessels, boilers, heat exchangers, pipework, and pipelines. The inspection of concrete structures is a part of plant life assessment, as these materials often form an essential part of the construction of such plant equipment. The utilization and adaptability of developing digital imaging technology have also added to the cost-effectiveness of the advanced NDT equipment methods. The capability of continuous data collection, storage, online inspection, advanced simulation of data in real-time, and interpretation of the information are also possible with new NDT equipment techniques. These techniques are creating greater opportunities in the market Additionally, The market studied is experiencing an increase in acceptance and applications in the power generation industry, due to the continuous evolution of traditional NDT techniques. These techniques, along with the increased assimilation with the technology, have made many NDT methods cost-efficient, allowing end users to cut down a part of the operations and maintenance costs. In the Middle East & Africa, power plants under construction, such as nuclear plants in the United Arab Emirates, coal-based plants in Africa, and replacement of older oil-based power plants by newer ones in Qatar and Saudi Arabia, are expected to drive the demand for the NDT equipment, during the forecast period. Futuremore, the development of new nuclear plants, as well as renewable energy projects, globally, is expected to augment the market growth over the forecast period.Asia-Pacific to Witness the Fastest Growth Owing to Huge Investments in InfrastructureCurrently, China is the world's largest producer of electricity. The energy demand of the country is expected to increase, thereby provoking the growth of energy production. NDT application in the fossil fuel segment dominates the market but is slowly expected to shift toward the nuclear and renewable segments. China is the largest consumer and importer of oil and gas in the world, after the United States. The country's rising demand for cleaner sources of energy is a major contributor to the weakening oil demand, in the country. China is also the world's top market for electric vehicles. The Chinese government is said to be working on a plan to implement a ban on vehicles powered by fossil fuels, similar to France and the United Kingdom, which announced that they would ban the sale of vehicles powered by fossil fuels, by 2040. India has the fifth largest power generation capacity in the world. The country ranks third globally in terms of electricity production. In May 2018, India ranked 4th in the Asia Pacific region out of 25 nations on an index that measures their overall power. Electricity production in India reached 108.90 Billion Units (BU) in April 2019. This implies that the current demand for NDT is dominated by the fossil fuel sector, with nuclear energy-based NDT equipment slowly gaining momentum. With the Indian aviation sector witnessing a surge in consumption, supported by growing incomes and increasing affordability, the industrial consumption of the NDT equipment is expected to witness substantial growth, over the forecast period. Singapore accounts for more than 25% of the Asia-Pacific MRO (maintenance, repair, and overhaul) market, with more than 100 aerospace companies catering the demand for aviation-related services. Leading companies, such as Singapore Technologies and SIA Engineering Company carry, out the nose to tail MRO services, thereby contributing to large-scale adoption of NDT equipment, in this segment. Indonesia offers opportunities for NDT equipment in the fossil fuel segment, as it is the dominant contributor to electricity production in the country. NDT is suitable for the inspection of pressurized pipelines, boilers, and exhaust systems. There are more than 133 CPP and 7 GPP operational, in the country which is further bolstering the growth of the Indonesian segment, over the forecast period.Competitive LandscapeThe Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) Equipment Market is competitive in nature and consists of several major players. With the increasing regulations, which makes it mandatory for different organizations to undergo a life assessment procedure as a safety measure coupled with the regular inspection required to check for any damage in the equipment is creating a market for NDT equipment.The end-users demand is driven by safety and regulatory needs and the companies operating in the market are leveraging on strategic collaborative initiatives, to offer specialized solutions, to increase their market share and increase their profitability. The companies operating in the market are also into mergers and acquisitions of start-ups that help in improving the served market portfolio on Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) Equipment to strengthen their product capabilities.October 2019 - Intertek announced the expansion of its corrosion testing at its Sharjah Laboratory Complex, which assists clients in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, and Egypt. The upgrade and expansion of the Sharjah facility allow Intertek to offer enhanced local services in a laboratory devoted to the testing of corrosion inhibitors under highly sour' conditions; for example, fluids containing high levels of corrosive hydrogen sulfide (H2S). July 2019- Applus+ RTD in Germany was planning to deliver non-destructive testing (NDT) for the construction of a new chemical plant for Covestro. Applus+ RTD is expected to provide services, including NDT on piping, new construction, and work during the assembly phase of the project. In view of the tight schedule, Applus+ is partnering with the UK company, SafeRad Ltd, whose qualified system allows for radiographic techniques to be used with a minimum of radiographic exposure. Radiographic Testing (RT) can be performed during day and night shifts, in parallel with the work of the piping companies. January 2019 - Nikon's X-ray and CT inspection systems perform quality inspection of aircraft and vehicle parts, helping to ensure reliability. Nikon makes effective use of X-ray systems in the fields of manufacturing and R&D to contribute to a safer society. Nikon's X-ray and CT systems provide a non-contact, non-destructive inspection solution to assure aircraft safety and manufacturing quality.Key Topics Covered1 INTRODUCTION1.1 Study Deliverables1.2 Study Assumptions1.3 Scope of the Study2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY4 MARKET DYNAMICS4.1 Market Overview4.2 Introduction to Market Drivers and Restraints4.3 Market Drivers4.3.1 Stringent Regulations Mandating Safety4.3.2 Ageing Infrastructure and Increasing Need for Maintenance4.4 Market Restraints4.4.1 Lack of Skilled Personnel and Training Facilities4.5 Industry Attractiveness - Porter's Five Force Analysis4.5.1 Threat of New Entrants4.5.2 Bargaining Power of Buyers/Consumers4.5.3 Bargaining Power of Suppliers4.5.4 Threat of Substitute Products4.5.5 Intensity of Competitive Rivalry5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 By Technology5.1.1 Radiography Testing5.1.2 Ultrasonic Testing5.1.3 Magnetic Particle Testing5.1.4 Liquid Penetrant Testing5.1.5 Visual Inspection5.1.6 Eddy Current5.1.7 Other Technologies5.2 By End-user5.2.1 Oil & Gas5.2.2 Power & Energy5.2.3 Aerospace & Defense5.2.4 Automotive & Transportation5.2.5 Construction5.2.6 Other End-users5.3 Geography5.3.1 North America5.3.2 Europe5.3.3 Asia-Pacific5.3.4 Latin America5.3.5 Middle East & Africa6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE6.1 Company Profiles6.1.1 MISTRAS Group6.1.2 SGS Group6.1.3 Fujifilm Corporation6.1.4 Olympus Corporation6.1.5 Bureau Veritas S.A.6.1.6 GE Measurement & Control6.1.7 Nikon Metrology Inc.6.1.8 Intertek Group PLC6.1.9 Applus Services, S.A.6.1.10 Acuren Inspection Inc.6.1.11 TEAM Inc.6.1.12 YXLON International GmbH (COMET Group)6.1.13 TV Rheinland AG6.1.14 Magnaflux Corp.7 INVESTMENT ANALYSIS8 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND FUTURE TRENDSFor more information about this report visithttps://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/eewwx5Research and Markets also offersCustom Researchservices providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.Media Contact:Research and MarketsLaura Wood, Senior Managerpress@researchandmarkets.comFor E.S.T Office Hours Call +1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call +1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900U.S. Fax: 646-607-1907Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716 View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/30-bn-non-destructive-testing-ndt-equipment-market-outlook-2025-stringent-regulations-mandating-safety-drives-growth-301034804.htmlSOURCE Research and MarketsLoad-Date: April 3, 2020End of Document

Katu Arkonada: Technology and militarization in Covid-19 timesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 11, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 826 wordsBody       Tthe world, journalists and analysts especially, writes about the crisis of the new coronavirus making analogies with the economic crisis of 2008. But we have to look a few years back to find another point of reference: the post-11S era where a planetary shock served as an excuse for the further cut to civil and political freedoms ever seen, Patriot Act through.The scenario ahead is a combination of both scenarios: the biggest economic crisis of the past 70 years combined with the militarization and retreat of freedoms in our nations. All this at a time when neoliberalism has left us fragmented societies where individualism prevails, increasingly encouraged by great technological advances.Once the fear of the virus is inoculated, our societies are transforming into leaps and bounds. Locked in our homes, the greatest fear now is that inert markets will become ill with coronavirus, a virus that does not discriminate by race, gender or class, but our societies do, discrimination facilitated by an increasing militarization of them.This whole scenario is summed up in the United States, which has already become the most contagious and dead country in the world and where, however, and despite the denial first and a lousy management afterwards, Donald Trump's popularity continues to grow, and everything seems to indicate that it will be re-read in November in front of a Democratic Party with no ideas once Bernie Sanders's withdrawal is consummated , who had the best proposals to deal with a health and economic crisis like the one we're experiencing, and the consolidation of Joe Biden as a presidential candidate to take on Trump. The choice between him and Biden shows that fear prevails and that the American people are not prepared for the changes that are coming.Meanwhile, in France, Macron declares: we are at war, and in Spain the state of national alarm is declared, the army is taken to the streets and the Secretariat of State for Digitalization and Artificial Intelligence develops an application that allows to geolocate by mobile phone each and every citizen of the nation to verify where they are and if they are where they claim to be. In Italy the app that is being developed seeks to detect the cases of contagion and with which people have been meeting or gathering the Italians in order to isolate them as quickly as possible.Handing over our data to solve a health crisis wouldn't be so serious if it weren't for the time the pandemic ends, technology at the service of social control will remain.But it is in China where the use of technology and social control has been perfected through the Suishenban app, a kind of traffic light that after granting you all the permissions for your geolocation and control, gives you green, yellow or red light, depending on the places you've visited and the people you've been close to. The QR code you provide is already a passport to enter government buildings, hospitals and even private businesses. Suishenban uses big data and has access to the databases of the Police, the Health Commission, telephony and Internet operators and airlines. This, combined with controlling people's body temperature on the streets, has succeeded in curbing the pandemic on the territory of the People's Republic of China. If we add to all this the social credit system of the Chinese government, along with others like the Zhima Credit of Alibaba, in which an algorithm gives you a more or less high score, according to your good behavior, score that allows you to access different services, 1984, of Orwell, falls short, although the episode Nosedive, of BlackMirror, it's pretty close.Also in Latin America and the Caribbean, the military has taken to the streets in Chile, Colombia or Brazil, and not only to carry out the necessary logistical tasks, as in Mexico, but to control the population. A population that Cepal says is imminent to be poorer, from 185 million to Latin Americans and Caribbeans in poverty and extreme poverty, one third of the 620 million that inhabit our America.But if the coronavirus is going to leave us with greater militarization and cuts of freedoms as negative effects of the economic and health crisis, it should also leave us with positive elements to think of the coming society, such as a determined commitment to demerktilize health and an increasingly weak dependence on the dollar, the currency of a US that accounts for only 10 percent of trade and 15 percent of world GDP.The era of digital biopolitics is here, and to the extent that the concept of sovereignty is transformed, closing borders, but opening up the data, we must seize the commitment to technology and the 5G that the United States and Europe try to veto so as not to let China become the world's first power, and use it in our favor to build a fairer society that leaves behind the way of capitalist production. With or without coronavirus.*Basque-Bolivian political scientistLoad-Date: April 12, 2020End of Document

US 2020 wind projects at risk due to COVID-19 delaysJournal of CommerceApril 20, 2020 Monday 8:50 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Commonwealth Business Media All Rights ReservedLength: 1015 wordsByline: Chris Barnett, Special Correspondent | Apr 20, 2020 4:50PM EDTBodyhttps://www.joc.com/sites/default/files/field_feature_image/WindUpdate%2BBarnett%2Bsmall.jpg [caption caption="US wind energy developers were planning or beginning construction of about 44 new gigawatts of wind-powered energy generation as of the end of 2019. Photo credit: American Wind Energy Association."][/caption]Planned US wind power projects totaling 25 gigawatts (GW) are in danger of being delayed, scaled back, or scrapped altogether due to the COVID-19 economic slowdown, according to the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA). Modifying the federal wind power production tax credit schedule, which has encouraged wide-scale wind development in the United States, would reduce these risks, according to AWEA. Ripple effects from the pandemic are playing out from China to Ecuador and further - wherever wind components are sourced, manufactured, and shipped. "There is no shortage of shipping capacity, but there are manufacturing facility shutdowns and delays in loading, with ships being stuck in port," John Hensley, AWEA vice president of research and analytics, told JOC.com. "At the same time [developers] are competing globally for these components and supplies."AWEA is lobbying Congress to add a one-year extension to the production tax credit (PTC) schedule already in place so wind farm developers can complete projects launched in 2016 and 2017 that might not be done within the tax credit schedule due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).AWEA is not asking that a new year be added to the PTC, the group said during a briefing last week, but rather that the deadline for projects already under way be extended. The PTC gives wind energy farm owners the right to take a tax credit of varying amounts per kilowatt hour for electricity sold once the project is producing energy, depending on the year in which the project qualified and provided they have met the PTC requirements. If a project qualified for the PTC before the end of 2016 and is up and running before the end of 2020, it will be eligible to take 100 percent of a 2.4 cent-per-kilowatt-hour tax credit for every kilowatt of electricity sold during the first 10 years after energy production begins. Projects that met the qualifications before the end of 2017 will get an 80 percent credit if producing by the end of 2021; 2018 would get 60 percent, 2019 would get 40 percent, and after that, nothing. Similar to the AWEA, China's wind energy association is lobbying the Chinese government to postpone project deadlines, according to the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC). More than 60 GW of China's onshore wind projects were approved before the end of 2018. These must be "grid connected" by the end of 2020 to receive a government subsidy, according to GWEC.  Wind bottlenecks Supply chain bottlenecks are affecting the wind turbine supply chain globally, Hensley said. "Ecuador is the world's largest supplier of balsa wood, a core component in the manufacturing of wind blades, yet the cou/;'ntry also has the largest breakout of COVID-19 in Latin America," he said.In Spain, a two-week nationwide lockdown, now eased, forced wind turbine manufacturers Vestas and Siemens Gamesa and component supplier LM Wind Power to slow or stop work, according to GWEC. On April 20, an LM Wind Power manufacturing plant in North Dakota shut down production following an outbreak, according to Wind Power Monthly. Any lags in manufacturing and transit, including delays at US ports, can delay project schedules and exacerbate driver shortages, Hensley said, affecting the "finely choreographed movement" of wind components. "We're seeing delays now ... There are only so many technically qualified truckers to move wind components of this size and scale," Hensley said. Before the COVID-19 crisis hit, he said, there were "adequate transport crews and [wind] components available, but a fairly small margin of error." Delays put a "supreme amount of stress on the transportation and logistics in the value supply chain, and there's not a lot of flexibility to rebound," Hensley added. "Delays are totally outside of developers' control, with very limited ability to recover given the small amount of float in [transportation] schedules." Additionally, there are not enough heavy-haul tractor trailer drivers. "We would like to see a growth in folks with this specialized skill set," he said. "As [wind] components get bigger, development of this workforce becomes more critically important."  Going where the wind goes Total US wind energy capacity hit 105.6 GW in 2019, with nearly $14 billion invested during the year and 9.1 new GW added to the grid, accounting for 39 percent of new utility-scale power additions, AWEA CEO Tom Kiernan said during the media briefing. Wind now supplies more than 7 percent of the nation's electricity, the trade group reported, and almost 60,000 wind turbines are now operating across 41 states, Guam, and Puerto Rico.Another 44 GW of wind project capacity, representing $62 billion in investment and generating enough power for 15 million American homes, is either under construction or in advanced stages of development, Kiernan said. This total includes the 25 GW deemed "at risk" owing to the uncertainties created by COVID-19.One experienced hauler of wind energy components remains optimistic about the industry's outlook. "Current crisis aside ... the industry was very strong in 2019, not just on new construction but on components for wind farm maintenance," Kris Rzepkowsky, director of marketing for Bennett International Group of McDonough, Georgia, told JOC.com. "All our trucks were well-utilized and, again, current situation aside, we would consider adding more owner-operator drivers to our fleet."On coping with COVID-19, he said, "We are open for business as usual, but customers are holding us up because they closed down some facilities. But beyond this delay, it looks strong for the remainder of the year - [particularly] in the Midwest and in Texas. We go where the wind goes."Contact Special Correspondent Chris Barnett at chris@cbarnmedia.com. Load-Date: April 29, 2020End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 34 of 287Bel Reports First Quarter 2020 Results  Page 36 of 287Hong Kong pro democrats mobilize against Beijing and Stock Exchange falls by 5.5%  Page 38 of 287Thoughts on COVID-19 from a student living in an authoritarian regime  Page 40 of 287A pro-Trump super PAC is stepping up its advertising campaign against Joe Biden in Pennsylvania  Page  of Hong Kong Stock Exchange down 0.72% after controversial security law passed  Page 48 of 287How the  Plandemic  video hoax went viral  Page 51 of 287Business Highlights  Page 53 of 287OPINION: Trump, conservative news outlets are racist in handling of the coronavirus  Page 56 of 287The 'infodemic' that spreads more than the pandemic  Page 58 of 287Beijing mayor tightens quarantine for travelers from abroad  Page 60 of 287Beijing mayor tightens quarantine for travelers from abroad  Page 63 of 287EXCLUSIVE: House Republicans Open Inquiry Into Mysterious Drone Program Officials Use To Police Americans Who Aren't Social Distancing  Page 68 of 287Industrial lasers Market Size, Revenue, End Users And Forecast Till 2026 | Fortune Business Insights  Page 70 of 287Duke and relative diplomacy  Page 73 of 287Lopez Obrador's coronavirus challenge: hand out hugs, kisses and discards styling  Page 75 of 287XINJIANG AUTHORITIES CONSTRUCT PARKING LOT ATOP HISTORIC UYGHUR CEMETERY  Page 77 of 287RISCH, MENENDEZ, RUBIO, CO-HOST EVENT WITH EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ON PERSECUTION OF UYGHUR MINORITY  Page 79 of 287The UK is reviewing Huawei's role in its 5G network again, and it's a new sign it could still cave to US pressure  Page 82 of 287University of Waterloo: COVID-19 Expert Commentators  Page 84 of 287Andrés Rodriguez demonstrates his leadership in Beijing  Page 86 of 287TikTok surpassed 2 billion downloads on iPhone and Android  Page  of U.S. grants Huawei new moratorium until mid-August  Page 94 of 287The Latest: South Korea vice health minister urges alertness  Page 101 of 287The Latest: South Korea vice health minister urges alertness  Page 103 of 287The head of the US Army spoke about the origin of the coronavirus: "The weight of the evidence seems to indicate that it is natural"  Page  of RUBIO, RISCH, GARDNER: CCP EFFORTS TO ERODE HONG KONG'S AUTONOMY ARE OF GRAVE CONCERN TO THE U.S.  Page 106 of 287Kiwa Bio-Tech Established Joint Venture to Address Ring-fenced Soil Remediation Projects  Page 108 of 287New U.S. Commerce Dept. rule to further hamper Huawei  Page 112 of 287Industrial laser Market Ravishing Growth With Major Industry Factors And Key Players Till 2026  Page 116 of 287Industrial lasers Market Size, Share And Development By 2026 | Fortune Business Insights  Page 118 of 287'No Company Is Perfect': Huawei Execs Respond To Allegations Employees Are Helping Surveil Dissidents  Page  of Hong Kong Stock Exchange falls 0.36% in debate day of another controversial law  Page 121 of 287Tencent to invest US$70 billion in new digital infrastructure, backing Beijing s economic stimulus efforts  Page 126 of 287Briefing.com: Bond Market Update - 15:55 ET  Page 129 of 287Impact of COVID-19 on the Global Renewable Energy Industry - Due to Decreasing Prices of Crude Oil, the Demand for Renewable Energy Can Decrease in the Near Fut....  Page 132 of 287Impact of COVID-19 on the Taxi and Limousine Services Market- TBRC Report Insights  Page 134 of 287Journalism shouldn't be modern billionaires' problematic pet project  Page 137 of 287'This is war': Stocks, oil, Treasury yields, and bitcoin plunge as the Fed's rate cut fails to allay coronavirus fears  Page 140 of 287Post COVID-19, the global electric vehicle and electric vehicle infrastructure market is projected to reach 4.18 million units by 2021 from an estimated 3.42 mi....  Page 143 of 287ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF (THNQ) Launches on NYSE;
