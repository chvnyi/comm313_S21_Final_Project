Word on Wall Street; Campaigning on the Economy; Proposed Vaccine Roll Out; Business Struggles Amid PandemicMORNINGS WITH MARIA MORNINGS WITH MARIA 7:00 AM ESTSeptember 18, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; FinancialLength: 6642 wordsByline: Maria Bartiromo, Dagen McDowell, Jackie DeAngelisGuests: Joseph Pinion, James Freedman, Dennis Gartman, Bryn Talkington, Jeff Saut, Frank Luntz, Hessam NadjiBodyMARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, September 18th.Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.Coming up this morning, 7:30 a.m. Eastern, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will be here with breaking news on the TikTok deal and China. You don't want to miss it. Stay with us for that.Stimulus stalemate continues. Nancy Pelosi is calling for at least $2.25 trillion. That is far more than what the White House is looking for.And markets this morning are under some selling pressure. Take a look. It's a mixed story, really. The Dow futures right now down 35 points but the Nasdaq is up. It's up 35 and the S&P 500 just turned positive. Now up 1 point.This after a selloff yesterday, but markets were able to cut early losses almost in half by the close. Despite the declines, the Dow, the Nasdaq, and the S&P 500 are on track for a winning week.The battle for the White House goes prime time. President Trump takes aim at former Vice President Joe Biden on the economy and China. Plus, announcing billions in aid for farmers.Meanwhile, Biden breaks down the election as Scranton versus Park Avenue.Love is on the web. Weddings going virtual.And then at 8:00 am. Eastern, it is our power panel hour. Co-host of "THE FIVE," Juan Williams is here, along with "The Hill" Media Reporter Joe Concha. They'll join Dagen and me to tackle some of the hot topics that impact you, including what the polls are really saying about the 2020 race.Growing backlash over the Netflix film "Cuties" and FaceBook accused of spying on Instagram users. Yes, tapping into your phone camera.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.Checking global markets this morning in Europe. We are looking at a mixed story. The FT 100's down 9 points, the CAC quarante is down 11, but the DAX index in Germany higher by 30 points.In Asia overnight, China led the gains overnight and it was a pretty good move for the Shanghai composite, up better than 2 percent.Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning right now, President Trump rallying voters in Wisconsin last night as Joe Biden fields softball questions all night in his first prime time town hall since accepting the nomination. The main topic, the pandemic.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: If the president had done his job, had done his job from the beginning, all the people would still be alive. All the people -- I'm not making this up. Just look at the data.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: President Trump hosted thousands of supporters in the battleground state of Wisconsin, meanwhile, last night. It was clear he was actually watching Biden's town hall on Air Force One before he started.Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Biden wants to surrender our country to the violent, left-wing mob.If Biden wins, the rioters, anarchists, arsonists and flag burners, they win.I just see he's up there tonight getting softball questions from Anderson Cooper. They don't ask me questions like that.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The president also telling the crowd he remains optimistic a working vaccine is close to reality. Both candidates head to Minnesota later today.And President Trump is expected to make a decision on the fate of TikTok in the United States in the next day or two. In the latest plan, Oracle and Wal-Mart along with existing American investors, would take ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations. Wal-Mart's Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon will get a seat on the board if this plan flies. And TikTok would reportedly file for a U.S. initial public offering in the next 12 months. President Trump and the Chinese government still need to sign off on a final deal.A massive manhunt is underway this morning in Arizona for the suspect in a brazen attack on a state trooper in Phoenix. The Arizona Department of Public Safety says the trooper was sitting in his cruiser when a car pulled up, the passenger got out and opened fire with AK-47. A 17-year-old is behind bars this morning. His alleged accomplice is on the run, last seen in vehicle, a silver 2013 Infinity.Joining the conversation this morning, Fox Business Dagen McDowell, "The Wall Street Journal's" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and Republican strategist, Pinion Enterprises Founder and CEO, Joseph Pinion.Great to see you guys this morning.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you.JOSEPH PINION, FOUNDER AND CEO, PINION ENTERPRISES: Good to be here.JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL": Good to be here. Thanks.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for being here.It is time for the "Word on Wall Street."Joining me right now is "The Gartman Letter" Editor and Publisher Dennis Gartman, along with Market Strategist at Capital Wealth Planning, Jeff Saut, and Requisite Capital Management Managing Partner Bryn Talkington.Great to see you guys. Thank you so much for being here for the "Word on Wall Street."We are looking at markets this morning. Really a mixed story. The Dow snapped a four-day winning streak yesterday.Dennis, what do the charts say to you right now in terms of where this market heads the rest of the year and into 2021? How you feeling about stocks?DENNIS GARTMAN, EDITOR AND PUBLISHER, "THE GARTMAN LETTER": Well, first of all, it's a hooter to be on your show this morning. I love this -- I love this thing that --BARTIROMO: Thank you.GARTMAN: That was funny.I'm -- I trade only for my own account, and I have to say that I think I'm -- I'm modestly bearish. And the operative word here is modestly. I have a few puts on. I'm short a few S&Ps. Not dramatically so. I think we've seen the highs in the stock market. If you take a look at almost anything, the DAX, the Nikkei, the Russell here in the United States failing to make highs. What we've -- I've seen the market rally on less volume in the future's markets, decline on larger volume in the future's markets. That tells -- that's the type of action that one gets when a market is making its top.Now, I'm not aggressively short, just modestly so. I have a position on in the bond market where I'm short the long end of the curve because I do think the Fed is going to remain expansionary for a long period of time and that would be inflationary. And I think over the long term that's somewhat depression -- depressive of stock prices. So I'm modestly -- and, again, the operative word here is modestly bearish.BARTIROMO: Yes, because, I mean, we know that, you know, rates where they are makes it very tough to find any alternatives for yield. That's the issue, right, Denise?GARTMAN: Well, that's --BARTIROMO: And the Fed just told us the other day we're going to see these rates -- this -- this level until 2025 perhaps?GARTMAN: I think the most important statement that we've seen from a Federal Reserve official was the one made two meetings ago when Mr. Powell said they haven't even begun to think about thinking about tightening monetary policy.The question is, when will they begin to think about thinking about that and that's going to be quite some period of time in the future.BARTIROMO: Yes. Exactly.All right, now there's big tech stocks, like Amazon and FaceBook and Apple dragging the Nasdaq yesterday to the worst day in five sessions.Bryn, September has been a rough month so far for the sector, but let's remember the Nasdaq selling off has to do with these five companies or, you know, a handful of big-tech companies.BRYN TALKINGTON, MANAGING PARTNER, REQUISITE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Yes, well, I mean I think the Nasdaq and the market, I agree with Dennis, the market's tired. I do think that the highs are in for the year, at least until the election. But I think you have to take a step back and realize, I mean, the Nasdaq's up close to 23, 24 percent for the year versus small caps are still down 13 percent. So there's a huge disparity between, you know, the winners and losers this year in terms of returns.And so the Nasdaq hit a peak of 12,000. We're about 10,900 (ph) right now. And so I could easily see us trading sideways. I think the debate will be really important later on this month, getting a -- setting a tone for the market because what -- what I really look at is, you know, whoever wins the election, if it is a Biden victory, you know, if you look at JPMorgan estimates, Wall Street consensus is about 163 right now. You can take about $14 off of 2021 earnings just from what -- what he's announced they would do. And so we'll see what happens with the election, but I think we'll definitely be trading sideways in this range until we get some clarity around that, which could be months.BARTIROMO: Yes, and Joe Biden has, you know, not been quiet about what he wants to do. He wants to raise taxes by $4 trillion. He wants to have big government plans that are going to cost trillions of dollars.Despite that, Jeff, you say we are in a secular bull market. Tell us more.JEFF SAUT, MARKET STRATEGIST, CAPITAL WEALTH PLANNING: Well, I don't disagree in the short-term with my friend Dennis Gartman. I think you could be range bound here for a while.I do think the lows are in. I think the economy gets better going forward. The uncertainty of the election is certainly up for grabs, although I will tell you that presidents don't make markets, markets make presidents. I do think Trump's going to get re-elected despite the polls. I do think the Fed is going to be true to its word. So, you know, after the election, I think the market's going up. And I think the secular bull market continues.But I think they're right, between here and the election, I think there's a very decent chance you're going to be range bound. But there's still individual stocks that are going to go up in that range-bound market. And I think it's our job to try and pick them out.BARTIROMO: Yes, but, Dennis, don't you -- I mean -- but -- but, Jeff, don't you think that this market would not be trading where it is near record highs if investors, broadly speaking, thought that the president was not going to be re-elected, that the policies would change? I mean, you know, there is something call the message of the market. And what is the message telling us right now about the election, Jeff?SAUT: I think the message is telling me that Trump's going to be re- elected. The market's been pretty ebullient here --BARTIROMO: Yes.SAUT: Whether it gets more ebullient from here is -- is questionable. But I do think Trump's going to get re-elected. And I think the stocks are going to do very well. I mean secular bull markets, Maria, I -- you know, I've known you for 25 years. Secular bull markets tend to last 15 to 20 years, 1949 to 1966, the 1982 to 2000. There were 30 and 40 percent pullbacks in there. And these alleged market experts that come on these shows and say, you know, we went down 37 percent, that was a bear market, well, that's just hogwash. That was just a pullback in an ongoing secular bull market.BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, it's been fun watching this bull market with you, Jeff, these 25 years.It's great to see everybody. Thank you so much, Dennis Gartman, Bryn Talkington and Jeff Saut. We will see you soon. Great "Word on Wall Street" this morning, guys.Coming up, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is here. He's got breaking news on TikTok and China. You don't want to miss it.And then in the 8:00 a.m. hour, don't miss our power panel hour. Join me and Dagen, along with "THE FIVE" Co-Host Juan Williams and "The Hill" Media Reporter Joe Concha with the hottest market topics and the hottest political topics making headlines.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Campaigning on the economy. Both President Trump and Joe Biden headed to Minnesota today after offering dueling outlooks on the economy last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I really do view this campaign as a campaign between Scranton and Park Avenue.All that Trump could see from Park Avenue is Wall Street. All he thinks about is the stock market and tell them, we're going to do all right. Everybody owns stock. How many of you all own stock in -- now, my neighborhood in Scranton, not a whole hell of a -- whole lot of people own stock.DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You see he's up there tonight getting softball questions from Anderson Cooper.Biden supported every disastrous global sellout for half a century, including NAFTA, China. You take a look at China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the TPP. He supported them all. Biden surrendered your jobs to China.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is the founder and president of Luntz Global, that's Frank Luntz.Frank, it's great to see you. Thank you so much for being here.FRANK LUNTZ, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, LUNTZ GLOBAL: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: So access the race, Frank, right now. You've been talking with voters, of course, in your focus groups. You worked at a focus group and asked people how they feel about the economy and personal finances.Tell us what you learned.LUNTZ: Well, it was done for Working Nation and it was a survey of a thousand people across the country, evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. And we found three things.Number one, the public really wants careers rather than jobs. You and I have a career and we're fortunate. And the people who appear on your program have a career. A job is something you do 9:00 to 5:00. And career is something you do 24/7. And these -- the presidential candidates have been promising jobs, and that's not really what Americans want.Second is the idea of security, of safety, which is particularly important right now. And according to the Working Nation poll, the number one way that you demonstrate that you can achieve the American dream or that you're living the good life is the ability to go to sleep at night, to put your head on the pillow, close your eyes and not be afraid that the next day how you're going to put food on the table or how you're going to pay your bills.And, third, 53 percent of Americans now live paycheck to paycheck. And this is a challenge for the president because the economy did take a significant dip. But it's also a challenge to Joe Biden because the jobs seem to be coming back.Maria, jobs and the future of the workforce is not a partisan issue. Republicans and Democrats, it doesn't matter, because if you're unemployed or under skilled or your job's been outsourced for automation or you lost it to China, you don't care whether they're Republican or Democrat, you only care that you have the skills and the abilities to get that next job and to have the career that you want.Working Nation is the foremost organization that is focused on the future of employment and both Joe Biden and Donald Trump should be leading these results.BARTIROMO: Yes, I think you're right, Frank. I think you're really hitting it on the head. But I just want to point out to the census bureau numbers that we got earlier in this week which showed us that, in fact, income inequality was actually narrowing before Covid-19 showed up with wages from the bottom end of the scale actually moving up pretty significantly. Has that resonated with people? I mean you look at every group, whether it's Asian, black, white, et cetera, all wages went up and the rich actually was the -- were the lagers, it was the low earners on the -- on the scale that actually saw the biggest increases.LUNTZ: You're correct. And I've seen reports that have underplayed that. And that's not fair to what has happened over the last four years.However, that was back in March. And we're now in September.BARTIROMO: Right.LUNTZ: And the American people don't look backward. They only see things as they are. Donald Trump has only one more month where they're going to report the results before the public will come to the polls.BARTIROMO: Yes.LUNTZ: And the question for them is not how is it now, but how it's going to be over the next year and the next four years.BARTIROMO: Joseph Pinion.PINION: Yes, Frank, obviously I think, you know, we're talking about the economy. I think by every metric you see, you know, the economy is head over hills the number one issue that swing voters in places like Florida, Michigan, North Carolina are pulling on.How do you juxtapose that with individuals, you know, who obviously are concerned about tomorrow, at the same time we're talking about Covid, you know, connecting the thread from understanding that we have a global pandemic that basically took a wrecking ball to the side of the global economy and who has the best plan moving forward for their individual lives?LUNTZ: Well, that's why the debate's going to be so important because both candidates have to do a better job of laying out not what they've done or what they support, but what's going to happen over the next 100 days and what's going to happen over the next four years.And, second, according to the Working Nation poll, and I find this fascinating because it hasn't existed before, the public believes that the direction of the country is negative, but the direction for themselves is positive. And if you isolated it to the last few weeks, which is how voters will be voting as they go to the polls, it's actually getting better for the individual even as they are very concerned for the country.I don't know how this plays out. I do know that the election is too close and -- to call right now and I also know that those people who try to get a partisan advantage over the pain and suffering of the American worker is making a big mistake because they will be punished in the end. They expect their governors, their mayors, members of Congress and Senate and particularly the president to get in there and help them get the skills they need. They're not asking for a bailout, they're asking for a hand up and they want the American economy to work for them, not just for -- for others.BARTIROMO: Yes, that's really great insight.Frank, it's good to see you this morning. Of course we'll be watching. Hope you'll come back soon, Frank, thank you so much.LUNTZ: You got it, Maria. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Frank Luntz joining us there.Stay with us. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.All eyes on a vaccine. Pfizer says by the end of October it should know whether its Covid-19 vaccine is safe and effective. This as Moderna expects to see results in November. And then, of course, there's AstraZeneca, another frontrunner, with resuming their vaccine trials following a brief halt due to safety concerns.Once available, not everybody will be able to get it immediately. A U.S. advisory task force laid out four phases of rollout, starting with frontline workers and ending with the general public.So it is the frontline workers that may very well have access to this, this year.Dagen, what do you think?MCDOWELL: So this is an ethical issue of who gets the vaccine and when that people within the government and within these healthcare companies, these pharmaceutical companies, are trying to roll out.I'll point out that Dr. Anthony Fauci said in -- at a panel on Wednesday that he does expect to see a Covid-19 vaccine being proven safe and effective by November or December.But there are a lot of logistics that the government and these pharmaceutical companies, the states and the distributors say, McKesson (ph), need to iron out.First, vaccine doses, how will they be allocated. The vaccine -- the vaccination sites. Say the Pfizer vaccines comes in two part. You need the first part and then the second. You need a database to track, to make sure that people have taken both of those doses.And then it's the ultra-cold chain distribution that's required. Pfizer is working with UPS to develop what are called freezer farms for the distribution because the vaccines have to be kept at, I think, it's like negative -- negative 70-degrees Celsius. So there's a lot that's going on.I'm just very, very disturbed by the fear mongering that we've heard from the Biden campaign about, I don't know. I wouldn't trust Donald Trump. There are a lot of people who are reticent to take these vaccine in the -- in this country, whether it's the Covid vaccine or other ones. And I think to it -- to plant doubt in people's brains about a vaccine based on who's in the White House is potentially deadly for many Americans. And I just think that is beyond the pale for the Biden campaign to even raise that issue.BARTIROMO: Yes, to put politics in something so important as a vaccine that could save someone's life. You're right.We'll take a break.When we come back, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is here. He's got breaking news for us on TikTok and China.Plus, Adidas thanks about a galaxy far, far away. The new sneaker channeling a "Star Wars" legend.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox BusinessBARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, September 18th.A look at markets this morning just before 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.Futures are mixed as we close out the week. The Dow Industrials are negative, down 26 points. But look at the Nasdaq, picking up speed here. The Nasdaq is up 65 points right now and the S&P 500 is also higher by almost 5.This after a selloff yesterday, but the market was able to cut early losses almost in half by the close. The Dow Industrials were down 130 and the Nasdaq was down 140. They are still on track to snap a two-week losing streak this week.Global markets this morning also mixed. European indices right now look like this where the FT 100 is down 11, the CAC quarante is down 11 and the DAX index in Germany is up almost 30 points.In Asia overnight, a flat situation overnight with the exception of China. Shanghai composite up better than 2 percent.Meanwhile, President Trump is pledging billions of dollars in additional aid to farmers.Jackie DeAngelis with the details.Jackie.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Maria, that's right.Well, the president announcing in Wisconsin that his administration will give out $13 billion worth of relief to distressed farmers. The money is in addition to the $19 billion that the president and agriculture department authorized back in April. Many farmers were already struggling before the pandemic due to the trade war with China.New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and lawmakers strike a deal to hike taxes on millionaires. Under the plan, the state's gross income tax rate on earnings over $1 million will increase nearly 2 percent. Murphy's administration estimates that the tax increase will raise about $40 million in revenue.And the newest member of United Airlines cleaning crew, a giant germ killing robot. The NovaRover machine created by MicroSonic will soon be spraying antimicrobial spray on United flights to combat the spread of Covid-19. Planes will get a coating from the NovaRover every seven days, in addition to United's existing cleaning regimen.Maria, I wonder if the NovaRover makes house calls.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.Jackie, thank you.All right, we've got breaking news right now.The Commerce Department is announcing new prohibitions on the Chinese-owned apps TikTok and WeChat. These new rules will prohibit both apps from being sold in the United States at stores, as well as banning money transfers through WeChat in the United States.Joining me right now in an exclusive interview is the Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross.Mr. Secretary, it's good to see you this morning. Thank you so much for joining us.WILBUR ROSS, U.S. SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: Thank you, Maria. Good to be on with you.BARTIROMO: So, of course, we are waiting on the president's and the government's decision on a potential deal with TikTok, but walk us through this Commerce Department's ruling here. These are separate from the ongoing negotiations between Oracle and TikTok, correct?ROSS: Yes. The ongoing negotiations between TikTok and CFIUS, which Commerce is a part, are separate from these rules. These rules are put out --BARTIROMO: So --ROSS: -- in connection with executive orders 13942 and 13943 dealing, respectively, with TikTok and We Chat.BARTIROMO: So you are -- the Commerce Department is going to be banning transactions relating to the mobile applications. Tell me what this means as far as TikTok and WeChat.I mean, could this be turned or overturned once we get details on a plan with Oracle and Wal-Mart? Because this latest plan has Oracle and Wal-Mart, along with existing American investors, taking ownership of the app's U.S. operations --ROSS: Right.BARTIROMO: -- we understand. And the CEO of Wal-Mart, Doug McMillon, will also get a seat on the board.ROSS: Right.BARTIROMO: TikTok would also reportedly file for an IPO in the next 12 months.ROSS: Right. Well, they're two separate situations. Both are a problem in that both are taking data from the American public and sending it to China is our fear.Where they differ is that WeChat is essentially a funds transfer and payment processing mechanism. For all practical purposes, it will be shut down in the U.S., but only in the U.S., as of midnight on Monday, by the Commerce Department ruling.TikTok is more complicated because, in effect, there are two alternatives there. One is the rules that we'll be announcing right now and the other is if there is a transaction completed by November 12th.The original orders required Commerce Department to promulgate these rules in the Federal Register by September 20th. The 20th is Sunday. Federal Register doesn't public on Sunday, doesn't publish on Saturday. That's why we're publishing them today.So as to TikTok, the only real change as of Sunday night will be -- won't have access to improved apps, updated apps, upgraded apps, or maintenance. So if that were to continue over a long period of time there might be a gradual degradation of services. But the basic TikTok will stay intact until November 12th.If there's not a deal by November 12th under the provisions of the old order, then TikTok also would be, for all practical purposes shut down.BARTIROMO: I see.So you are making this in response, obviously, to the president's executive order, but also the fact that, as you just said, the worry is that the CCP is stealing data. Tell us what they're doing exactly, Wilbur. You know, people look at these social media apps and say well, how could this really be that dangerous? But there's actually a lot of danger related to us. Can you walk us through it?ROSS: Well, surely. What they collect are data on locality, data on what you're streaming toward, what your preferences are, what you're referencing. Every bit of behavior that the American side is indulging in becomes available to whoever is watching on the other side.And as you note, China has been taking all kinds of data from all sorts of Internet activities and that's what we're trying to squelch.BARTIROMO: But how does this change even with an Oracle partnership? I mean, if you're looking at the CCP trying to take swaths of information from American citizens, wouldn't that continue regardless? I mean, we've seen the Chinese Communist Party identify people on the inside, whether it's academics or the Houston Consulate, to identify people on the inside of these companies and relay information back to the CCP. How would that end if TikTok employees are working for Oracle?ROSS: Well, there's no way a rule, as such, can prohibit bad behavior on the part of individuals. That's a question of management, that's a question of supervision, that's a question of enforcement. All that the rules can do is to limit the data to which they have access, and that's the purpose of what's going on here.Also, it's a very big difference in size between TikTok and WeChat. WeChat is mainly used by American companies as a payment mechanism in China and elsewhere. That's not being disturbed at all. And that's the big function, that's the big moneymaker for WeChat.TikTok is the one that's much more into the social media -- the little play acts, the kids exchanging data, and all that -- and so, it's a much more complicated thing. And I think that's part of the reason that the deals are potentially more complicated. It's both bigger and a more complex interface with the American public.BARTIROMO: So I want to ask you about the airline CEOs, but one more question on this. The U.S. is going to blocking TikTok and WeChat downloads beginning on Sunday. Are you expecting retaliation from China?ROSS: Well, remember, it's not doing the same thing. Our rule is not doing the same thing to TikTok as to WeChat. WeChat U.S., for all practical purposes, will be shut down.As to TikTok, it just upgrades maintenance and things like that, that would be shut down at this stage. The real shutdown would come after November 12th in the event that there is not another transaction.So it's very different the way the two are being handled and that reflects the quantitative and qualitative differences between the two apps.BARTIROMO: Right. Yes -- no, I understand.ROSS: As to the airlines --BARTIROMO: Do you think the CCP is going to retaliate -- yes.ROSS: Well, that's up to them.But as to the airline question that you also asked, right now, under the $25 billion that we --BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, the CEOs are going to be meeting with White House chief of staff -- they met with the White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows yesterday. They want an additional $25 billion in coronavirus aid to help them avoid layoffs before the September 30th deadline.Meadows said that the White House could be open to a standalone deal for the sector. What are the opportunities here, Secretary?ROSS: Well, the issue we're trying to deal with is that as of October first, the airlines under the April $25 billion would be free to lay off 30,000 people. We don't want that to happen for obvious reasons.Airline traffic is running about 30 percent of what it had been a year earlier and it's really no fault of the airline. It's the fault of the coronavirus. So the reason the White House might be receptive to a standalone deal is that it's not right to punish the airlines differentially because of coronavirus. We think coronavirus is soon going to have vaccines, in any event.But we've got to bridge the airlines -- got to bridge their employees, if we can, through that period. So that would be the purpose of the additional $25 billion.BARTIROMO: Understood.What about the farmers, Secretary? The president also announced new aid for farmers during his rally in Wisconsin yesterday. Here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Starting next week, my administration is committing an additional -- you've been asking for this for a long time -- $13 billion in relief to help farmers recover from the China virus, including Wisconsin's incredible dairy, cranberry, and ginseng farmers who got hurt badly. You've been after that money for a long time.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Secretary, the farmers, as well, getting aid here. You know, a lot of people saying look, what other industries are there poised to need money? There are a lot of them. Why the farmers -- more money there, as well?ROSS: Well, the farmers really deserve it for the same reason as the airlines may. This is not a problem of their making. This is a problem created by the export from China of the coronavirus to the U.S., and earlier, some of the constraints that China had put on agricultural trade.Now, lately, China has been buying a lot more agriculture from us. But still, there's a lag and it still is necessary to give the farmers a helping hand through this temporary period. The farmers really --BARTIROMO: Yes.ROSS: -- don't want aid. What they want is trade. And we hope -- as we come out from under the coronavirus and if China continues to honor its phase one agreement, we hope they will get trade instead of aid.BARTIROMO: Right, but I mean there are other industries that could say the same thing, right? I mean, it wasn't the restaurants' fault that they had to shut down. Will the government be giving the restaurant industry money?ROSS: Well, the restaurants, as you know, got protected in a different way. Most of them are in the category of employing fewer --BARTIROMO: OK.ROSS: -- than the 500 people. And therefore, there were separate programs, that while they weren't just called restaurant programs, effectively --BARTIROMO: Yes.ROSS: -- benefitted the restaurant industry.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there.Secretary, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for walking us through all of that.Secretary Wilbur Ross joining us this morning.And I hope you'll preorder my new book. We're talking about all of this. In it, James Freeman and myself, "The Cost: Trump, China and the American Revival," co-authored by James Freeman, that's coming out next month. Preorder it today. The costbook.com.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.American business is struggling amid this pandemic. Movie theaters, gyms, retailers, among those seeing decimated revenue. Many businesses are worried that without another round of stimulus checks, they will not survive the year.Joining me right now is Marcus and Millichap CEO Hessam Nadji.Hessam, it's great to see you again. Thanks for being here.Let's talk about the industries that you are seeing as being the hardest hit by this pandemic. Do you think there's a chance of survival there? And I guess within industries there are companies that won't make it either.HESSAM NADJI, CEO, MARCUS AND MILLICHAP: Good morning, Maria. Great to be with you again.First of all, there are investors that are coming into the market now that are looking well beyond a Covid world and a post-vaccine reality and they're reimagining what any structure of real estate may look like post- Covid three, five years from now. If you look back three to five years from now, this will have proven to be a phenomenal opportunity to invest in real estate because of interest rates alone and a pending economic recovery.To your question, hospitality and older shopping centers and experiential (ph) retail, as you said, fitness, restaurants are suffering the most. In the short-term, that's going to continue. There is no relief in sight of any kind of a systematic nature. And more relief from a government certainly is necessary, certainly will be welcome. Without it, more small companies, mid-size tenants will be under pressure. And a fair amount of them aren't going to make it. But, again, investors are looking well beyond the next six months. They're looking at the next five to seven years.BARTIROMO: And that's what I want to look at with you Hessam, because I think that commercial real estate is going through its own reckoning right now. I know a number of Wall Street executives and business people who are renegotiating space in terms of their landlord and the big buildings and space that they have right now.How do you expect commercial real estate to look different within the next five years?NADJI: It really depends on the property type, Maria. If you look at office space, for example, there's all this concern about people not coming back into the work space and workers being resistant and companies being resistant. That is, in fact, true and will be for the next six to nine months until we get more clarity on a medical solution.In the meantime, remember, the leases that are in place, on average, have another four years left. Companies are obligated to make their rent payment. If they don't, obviously that's going to create stress with the marketplace. Again, that's another area where the government could be doing more to sure up those owners that are trying to partner with their tenants to give them a break on their rent but they still have to make their mortgage payments.So we still have some issues around all that. But if you look beyond the next six -- six to nine months, the urban markets that are hit the most right now -- in fact significantly worse than a lot of the suburban areas, I think are going to slowly start to see people come back. People do want to gather, they do want to work in teams, they do want to be managed in person, maybe not quite the way it was pre-Covid --BARTIROMO: Yes.NADJI: Where we, you know, all conjugated in the office space, but a hybrid use of office space with remote combination I think is -- is realistic.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, I agree with you. I think that -- that's what I'm hearing a lot about right now, the hybrid.Hessam, great to see you. we've got more to talk about with you. Please, come back soon.Hessam Nadji joining us there.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Time for the "Morning Buzz."First up, a presidential memoir set to hit shelves after the November election. Former President Barack Obama announcing the first part of his memoir will be published on November 17th. The demand is expected to be so high that the publisher is printing 1 million copies in Germany and arranging for three cargo ships to bring them here to the United States.Joseph, what do you think about that?PINION: Well, look, we've got a Covid-19 crisis that's decimated the world economy. Michelle Obama telling people that voting for Joe Biden's a matter of life or death. But as we just learned, the Obama business model will roll on and continue to print mint -- and mint cash irrespective of who wins the election.So it's going to be a great time for the Obamas. More trips to Martha's Vineyard. I don't know how it helps America, though, but at least we'll have the history in writing.BARTIROMO: Yes, good analysis there, Joseph.Next up, saying I do on live stream with large gatherings still restricted. More couples are having virtual weddings. Virtual weddings. In a new survey, more than one-third of couples with October weddings say that they are now considering making the wedding virtual.James, do you think that they are here to stay, past this pandemic virtual weddings?FREEMAN: I hope not and I doubt it. I think the people who go that route now in response to what has been a campaign of terror about Covid and much of the media are going to regret it. I think they are going to regret it in future years if all their guests were in basements watching on video, playing (ph).BARTIROMO: Well, you certainly save a lot of money.FREEMAN: Truth (ph).BARTIROMO: Finally this, a walk with Chewbacca. Adidas and "Star Wars" are paying tribute to Chewbacca with new sneaker collection. The fur-covered high-tops will get you one step closer to the Wookie warrior, Dagen.You going to get a pair?MCDOWELL: No, because I live in New York City. And can you imagine the detritus that you would pick up on that fur just walking in the streets. And I'm not talking about just gum on your shoes.This raises the issue, Gucci did kind of a mule that had fur hanging out of the back of it and I would see some folks walking around in New York wearing those, they weren't clean, say it -- they had stuff stuck in them.BARTIROMO: Well --MCDOWELL: So that's -- that's like -- more like a bedroom shoe.BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: You got to wear that around your house.BARTIROMO: Well, when -- when you're in New York and we're dealing with the things that we're dealing with, all roads lead to the story, and that's the problem. It doesn't matter what's going on. Until we actually see a change, this is front and center in New York.I want to thank James Freeman and Joseph Pinion for joining us this morning. Gentlemen, thank you so much. It was great to see you both.Stay with us. We've got our power hour coming up next.Stay with us.Load-Date: September 18, 2020End of Document

TikTok fate in the balance as judge weighs app store banAssociated Press InternationalSeptember 27, 2020 Sunday 8:04 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 896 wordsByline: ANNE D'INNOCENZIO and MATT O'BRIEN, AP Business WritersDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) — Lawyers for TikTok pleaded with a U.S. federal judge on Sunday to delay the Trump Administration's ban of the popular video sharing program from app stores set to take effect at the end of the day, arguing the move would infringe on First Amendment rights and do irreparable harm to the business.The 90-minute hearing came after President Donald Trump declared this summer that TikTok was a threat to national security and that it either sold its U.S. operations to U.S. companies or the app would be barred from the country.TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, is scrambling to firm up a deal tentatively struck a week ago in which it would partner with tech company Oracle and retailer Walmart and that would get the blessing of the Chinese and American governments. In the meantime, it is fighting to keep the app available in the U.S.The ban on new downloads of TikTok, which has about 100 million users in the U.S, was delayed once by the government. A more comprehensive ban is scheduled for November, about a week after the presidential election. Judge Carl Nichols of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said he would make a decision by late Sunday, leaving TikTok's fate hanging.In arguments to Judge Nichols, TikTok lawyer John Hall said that TikTok is more than an app but rather is a “modern day version of a town square."“If that prohibition goes into effect at midnight, the consequences immediately are grave,'" Hall said. “It would be no different than the government locking the doors to a public forum, roping off that town square" at a time when a free exchange of ideas is necessary heading into a polarized election.Hall called the ban “punitive," noting that this is “just a blunt way to whack the company now while doing nothing to achieve the stated objective of the prohibition. “TikTok lawyers also argued that a ban on the app would stop tens of thousands of potential viewers and content creators every month and would also hurt its ability to hire new talent. In addition, Hall argued that a ban would prevent existing users from automatically receiving security updates, eroding national security.Justice Department lawyer Daniel Schwei sought to undercut TikTok lawyers' argument, saying that Chinese companies are not purely private and are subject to intrusive laws compelling their cooperation with intelligence agencies. The Justice Department has also argued that economic regulations of this nature generally are not subject to First Amendment scrutiny. Plaintiffs can't claim a First Amendment right in hosting TikTok itself as a platform for others’ speech because merely hosting a platform is not an exercise of the First Amendment, the Justice Department contends.“This is the most immediate national security threat," argued Schwei. “It is a threat today. It is a risk today and therefore it deserves to be addressed today even while other things are ongoing and playing out."Schwei also argued that TikTok lawyers failed to prove it would suffer irreparable business harm.The Justice Department laid out its objections to TikTok's motion for a temporary injunction in a brief under seal, but it was unsealed in redacted form to protect confidential business information.Trump set the process in motion with executive orders in August that declared TikTok and another Chinese app, WeChat, as threats to national security. The White House says the video service is a security risk because the personal information of its millions of U.S. users could be handed over to Chinese authorities.Trump has said he would approve a proposed deal in which Oracle and Walmart could initially own a combined 20% of a new U.S. entity, TikTok Global. Trump also said he could retract his approval if Oracle doesn’t have “total control.”The two sides of the TikTok deal have also appeared at odds over the corporate structure of TikTok Global. ByteDance said last week that it will still own 80% of the U.S. entity after a financing round. Oracle, meanwhile, put out a statement saying that Americans “will be the majority and ByteDance will have no ownership in TikTok Global.”Chinese media have criticized the deal as bullying and extortion, suggesting that the Chinese government is not happy with the arrangement. ByteDance said Thursday it has applied for a Chinese technology export license after Beijing tightened control over exports last month in an effort to gain leverage over Washington’s attempt to force an outright sale of TikTok to U.S. owners.China's foreign ministry has said the government will “take necessary measures” to safeguard its companies but gave no indication what steps it can take to affect TikTok’s fate in the United States.TikTok is suing the U.S. government over Trump’s Aug. 6 executive order, saying it is unlawful. So are resulting Commerce Department prohibitions that aim to kick TikTok out of U.S. app stores and, in November, essentially shut it down in the U.S., it claimed.The Chinese firm said the president doesn’t have the authority to take these actions under the national-security law he cited; that the ban violates TikTok’s First Amendment speech rights and Fifth Amendment due-process rights; and that there’s no authority for the restrictions because they are not based on a national emergency._______Follow Anne D’Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzioLoad-Date: September 29, 2020End of Document

Ant Group raises $34 billion in world's largest IPOCNN WireOctober 27, 2020 Tuesday 9:46 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 785 wordsDateline: HONG KONG/LONDON (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG/LONDON (CNN Business) --  Jack Ma's Ant Group has just pulled off the biggest share sale in history, marking a huge win for the Chinese tech champion and the country's stock market.The tech company behind China's largest online payments platform priced its dual listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Shanghai's Star Market at 80 Hong Kong dollars ($10.32) and 68.8 yuan ($10.26) per share respectively, according to regulatory filings released Monday.That means the initial public offering will raise some $34.4 billion and value the company at more than $310 billion. The previous record for an IPO was held by Saudi state oil company Aramco, which raised $29.4 billion when it issued shares on the Riyadh exchange last December. The share issue is a boon for Beijing, which has been encouraging the country's top tech companies to list at home instead of on exchanges in the United States, where scrutiny of Chinese companies is rising as a long-running trade war rumbles on.Beijing hopes the company's decision to sell 1.67 billion shares in both Hong Kong and Shanghai, or about 11% of the company in total, will attract the seasoned institutional investors it has long courted. That strategy appears to be working.Ant is closing its Hong Kong institutional book building on Wednesday, a day earlier than scheduled, because of strong demand from global institutional investors, a source familiar with the matter told CNN Business. The Hong Kong shares were oversubscribed within the first hour of pricing.Powerful tech giantAnt is the financial technology company affiliated with Chinese e-commerce group Alibaba, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014 in what was also a world-record setting IPO. Billionaire Ma has ultimate control over Ant, and is due to profit handsomely from the share sale.Mirroring Ma's success with Alibaba, Ant has quickly grown into most powerful tech companies in the world. It has established its presence in every aspect of financial life in China, from investment accounts and micro savings products to insurance, credit scores and even dating profiles.The company's payments app Alipay had 731 million monthly active users as of September, Ant said in regulatory filings. The platform handled 118 trillion yuan ($17.7 trillion) in payments in the 12 months through June.The company said revenue for the nine months ended in September rose about 43% to 118.2 billion yuan ($17.7 billion) compared to the same period last year. Gross profit for the period rose 74% to 69.5 billion yuan ($10.4 billion).Xiaomeng Lu, senior geotechnology analyst at Eurasia Group, said that Ant is also poised to benefit from the Chinese government's latest economic development plans, which are being drawn up this week."Ant is being viewed as this national technology champion --- it's investing in AI, it's investing in blockchain," Lu said. These are priorities for Chinese President Xi Jinping, she added.Whether Ant can keep growing apace, however, is an open question. Lu noted that Ant faces tough competition inside China from rival Tencent, while potential regulatory pressure from countries like the United States could limit opportunities abroad.US-China falloutGeopolitical considerations have already been a major background factor in Ant's IPO.A growing number of Chinese companies have been seeking refuge on national exchanges as tensions between Washington and Beijing ramp up, and Ant's success could encourage more firms to follow suit, according to Brock Silvers, chief investment officer at Kaiyuan Capital and former chief investment officer at Adamas Asset Management.US threats and restrictions against Chinese tech companies such as Huawei, TikTok and WeChat have sent a clear warning, while scrutiny of Chinese firms on Wall Street is rising.Luckin Coffee was kicked off the Nasdaq following the disclosure of major accounting irregularities. US lawmakers, government agencies and stock exchanges have since taken steps aimed at limiting Beijing's access to America's vast capital markets.This environment is likely a major reason Ant chose to list on exchanges in Shanghai and Hong Kong, rather than follow Alibaba to Wall Street.

At UN, Trump raps China for virus as US deaths top 200,000Associated Press InternationalSeptember 22, 2020 Tuesday 6:30 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICAL NEWSLength: 927 wordsByline: DEB RIECHMANN, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump urged world leaders to hold China accountable for the spread of the coronavirus, in a video address to a scaled-down U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday as America's death toll topped 200,000.Beyond criticizing China, Trump took aim at the very foundation of the United Nations by urging other leaders to put their own countries first, a message that echoed his “America First” campaign mantra.“Only when you take care of your own citizens, will you find a true basis for cooperation,” Trump said. “As president, I have rejected the failed approaches of the past — and I am proudly putting America first, just as you should be putting your countries first. That’s OK. That’s what you should be doing.”But it was the coronavirus that was both the core and the backdrop of Trump's address. Speeches by U.S. presidents are normally a highlight of the annual General Assembly, a premier event on the global diplomatic calendar. But this year's gathering is being held remotely because of the pandemic. Trump, denied an auditorium packed with global leaders, gave a speech lasting just under eight minutes, the shortest General Assembly speech by a U.S. president in more than two decades.Under fire for his own handling of the coronavirus, Trump cast blame on China, noting the virus began there and accusing the Chinese government of acting irresponsibly in failing to contain it.“The United Nations must hold China accountable for their actions,” Trump said, without elaborating on what punishment he thought was warranted.Trump's handling of the virus is a top issue in the presidential campaign. His Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, says Trump bungled the response to COVID-19 and is responsible for the U.S. having more deaths than any other nation. Trump minimized the danger of virus, encouraged the reopening of U.S. society even as the virus was spreading rapidly and continues to hold campaign rallies where few wear face masks or practice social distancing.Trump also attacked China’s environmental record, even though his administration has rolled back or eliminated scores of existing or pending public health and environmental protections.China's U.N. ambassador rejected criticism of China on its handling of COVID-19 as “totally baseless.”“At this moment, the world needs more solidarity and cooperation, and not a confrontation,” Ambassador Zhang Jun said before introducing President Xi Jinping’s prerecorded speech.Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the world faces the risk of a new Cold War between the U.S. and China.“Our world cannot afford a future where the two largest economies split the globe in a Great Fracture — each with its own trade and financial rules and internet and artificial intelligence capacities,” Guterres said. “A technological and economic divide risks inevitably turning into a geo-strategic and military divide. We must avoid this at all costs.”Trump's U.N. address came as he faces an expected fight over a Supreme Court nomination and a heated reelection campaign in an America bitterly divided in Democratic and Republican camps.The Republican president is running behind Biden in many polls, yet told the U.N. General Assembly that he'd be back next year.“I am supremely confident that next year, when we gather in person, we will be in the midst of one of the greatest years in our history," Trump said.Trump's address comes at a time when U.N. members are pushing back against Washington. On Monday, Trump declared that all U.N. sanctions against Iran have been reimposed, a move that most of the rest of the world rejects as illegal.Trump's statement came shortly after he signed an executive order spelling out how the U.S. will enforce the “snapback” of sanctions. “My actions today send a clear message to the Iranian regime and those in the international community who refuse to stand up to Iran," he said.The U.S. said it was reimposing sanctions on Iran for being in noncompliance with the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and global powers. But Trump in 2018 pulled out of the deal in which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in sanctions relief.Few U.N. member states believe the U.S. has the legal standing to restore the sanctions because Trump withdrew from the agreement. The U.S. argues it retains the right to do so as an original participant in the deal and a member of the council.Trump also briefly highlighted agreements the U.S. brokered between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. The historic agreements come as relations between the Jewish state and Arab nations are thawing as a pushback against Iran.The president also mentioned the U.S. brokering of economic cooperation between Serbia and Kosovo.He didn't mention the threat from North Korea's nuclear weapons. In his speech in 2017, Trump told the U.N. he was bringing a “message of peace,” but then said that if the U.S. was forced to defend itself against Kim Jong Un, “we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.”Trump called Kim “rocket man,” but later embraced him as a friend, met with him three times and proclaimed North Korea no longer posed a nuclear threat to the U.S. So far, the Trump administration's diplomatic efforts to get Kim to give up his nuclear weapons have not succeeded.___Associated Press writers Hope Yen in Washington and Edith Lederer in New York contributed to this report.___This story has been corrected to show that Trump's speech was nearly eight minutes, not less than seven minutes.Load-Date: September 22, 2020End of Document

White House trade director: Trump to talk tough on China in DaytonSpringfield News-Sun, OhioSeptember 21, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Springfield News-Sun, OhioDistributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength: 489 wordsByline: Chris Stewart, Springfield News-Sun, OhioBodySept. 21--     Sep. 21--The White House's trade director said President Donald Trump will draw a clear distinction on China policy between himself and former Vice President Joe Biden when Trump takes the stage this afternoon in Dayton."Dayton is in many ways Ground Zero on communist China's economic war against the United States," said Peter Navarro, director of the Trump administration's Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy. "The primary goal today in Dayton is to draw a very sharp contrast between Joe Biden, who is directly responsible for two of the worst trade deals in American history that devastated Dayton and much of the manufacturing base in Ohio, versus a president in Donald J. Trump, who over the last four years has stood up to China through tough tariffs and sanctions policies."Navarro said Ohio was hurt by Biden's support of the World Trade Organization and his vote in the Senate for the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the Trump Administration replaced."It's going to be important to remind the people of Dayton and the people of Ohio, the damage that Joe Biden caused, with his globalist support for NAFTA and China in the WTO versus Donald Trump, the blue collar president, the working class president, the nationalist president, who wants to make American manufacturing great again," he said.Navarro said in a second Trump term, the renegotiated NAFTA deal -the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement -- will help return the economy to its "pinnacle" where it was earlier this year before the virus spread and decimated employment.Navarro said America is under siege from China due to its organized cyber hacking, stealing of trade secrets, intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer and dumping goods below cost as well as currency manipulation.The president's tariffs on China are a way to reshore manufacturing, he said."Made in the USA is the president's goal," he said.Trump is scheduled to meet supporters at 4:30 p.m. today at Wright Bros Aero at the Dayton International Airport and take Air Force One next to Toledo.Navarro said China also bears responsibility for supplying the U.S. with illicit fentanyl that fueled an opioid crisis.Without offering details, Navarro said the Trump administration in a second term will also hold China accountable for the coronavirus pandemic, which he said the Chinese government transmitted from a lab in Wuhan, a claim that remains unsubstantiated."We have to have a national conversation about how we can recover those costs. It's trillions of dollars," he said.Election 2020Count on the Dayton Daily News for everything you need to know this election season.

AP: Oracle and TikTok struck a deal. What it is, none will sayThe Spinnaker: University of North FloridaSeptember 15, 2020 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 940 wordsByline: MATT O'BRIEN and TALI ARBEL, AP Technology WritersBodyThe short-video app TikTok has chosen Oracle as its corporate savior to avoid a U.S. ban ordered by President Donald Trump. The U.S. government will review the prospective deal.That much is known. Everything else is confusion, at least to outsiders. For instance:- What does it mean that, as Oracle declared, it will become a "trusted technology provider" for TikTok? Is this a joint venture, a vendor agreement or something else? Oracle is pointedly not referring to its deal as a sale or acquisition.- Will Trump approve such an arrangement after having threatened a ban if TikTok remains owned by its China-based parent ByteDance? Would it answer the national-security concerns around potential data siphoning, censorship and propaganda from Beijing that Trump raised?- Will the Chinese government go along with it?- Will TikTok get kicked out of the major app stores after Sept. 20, when Trump's threatened ban was supposed to go into effect, threatening its future in the U.S.?"This whole process has been a mess," said Martin Chorzempa, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Microsoft, an announced TikTok suitor, said Sunday that its rejected bid would have protected U.S. national security interests by making "significant changes" to ensure security, privacy, online safety, and anti-misinformation measures. Oracle's statement Monday was more muted, emphasizing that it has a "40-year track record providing secure, highly performant technology solutions."U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appeared to support the Oracle bid on CNBC Monday morning. Oracle's proposal made "many representations for national security issues," Mnuchin said. He also noted a new commitment - by whom, he didn't say - to make TikTok's global operations a U.S.-headquartered company with 20,000 new jobs. Neither TikTok nor Oracle mentioned that pledge Monday, although TikTok said in July that it would add 10,000 U.S. jobsTikTok said in a statement Monday that its proposal to the Treasury Department should "resolve the Administration's security concerns" and emphasized the importance of its app to the 100 million users it claims in the U.S.TikTok, which says it has about 700 million globally, is known for its fun, goofy videos of dancing, lip-syncing, pranks and jokes. It's also home to more political material, some of which is critical of Trump.An Aug. 6 Trump order threatened a vague ban on TikTok, creating a sense of emergency and seeding chaos into an existing national-security review of TikTok by a U.S. interagency group, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS. A subsequent Aug. 14 order demanded that ByteDance divest its U.S. business. In addition, Trump insisted that the U.S. government get a cut of any deal, something experts said was unprecedented and possibly illegal.Matters were complicated further when the Chinese government appeared to suggest that the technology used in TikTok's algorithm could not be exported without government permission. On Sunday, ByteDance tapped Oracle as its U.S. partner, embracing a company whose co-founder Larry Ellison has raised funds for Trump. Its decision also followed criticism of Microsoft by a Trump trade adviser, Peter Navarro.Oracle and TikTok did not answer questions about the structure of the proposal on Monday. The Treasury Department didn't return an emailed request for more information about the proposal."We don't know that this is the wrong outcome. But we do know that (the administration) shouldn't have politicized it this way," said Derek Scissors, who studies China at the American Enterprise Institute think tank.The promise of 20,000 new jobs and a U.S. headquarters for TikTok "certainly smacks of crony capitalism," said Chorzempa.Eurasia analyst Paul Triolo noted that if ByteDance retains ownership of TikTok, it won't have actually sold anything. China doesn't want to be seen approving a deal where a Chinese company is forced to a sale or stripped of its intellectual property, he said, while Trump can't easily walk back a ban without major concessions he can point to. "A face saving way out of this will be very difficult for all parties to find," he said.Any deal must still be reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, a group chaired by the Treasury Secretary that studies mergers for national security reasons. Mnuchin said he expects the group to review the proposal this week and later make a recommendation to the president.The president can approve or deny a transaction recommended by the panel, though Trump has already voiced support for Oracle as a "great company" that could handle the acquisition.Oracle primarily makes database software. It competes with tech giants such as Microsoft and Amazon that provide cloud services as well as business-software specialists like Salesforce. Some analysts see Oracle's interest in a consumer business as misguided, but its shares popped 4.3% on Monday to $59.46.If the arrangement is approved by the U.S. government, TikTok would be allowed to continue operating.Whether the Oracle-TikTok deal will allow the sidestepping of Chinese export restrictions depends on which entity retains control of TikTok in the U.S., said Paul Haswell, a Hong Kong-based partner at law firm Pinsent Masons.Another loose end is Walmart, which had planned to partner with Microsoft on the acquisition. The retailer said Sunday it "continues to have an interest in a TikTok investment" and is talking about it with ByteDance and other parties.__AP technology writer Zen Soo in Hong Kong contributed to this report.Load-Date: September 15, 2020End of Document

Judge Hales Trump's WeChat Restrictions on Freedom of ExpressionCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 20, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 593 wordsBodyThe Trump administration's restrictions on WeChat were suspended on Sunday by a California judge, which turned an effort to stop the use of Chinese-owned ende application in the United States.Judge Laurel Beeler in San Francisco issued a preliminary court order at the request of a group of WeChat users in the United States, who argued that the bans would violate the freedom of expression rights of millions of Chinese-speaking Americans who rely on it to communicate. The app, which was supposed to disappear from U.S. app stores this day, has 19 million regular users in the United States and one billion worldwide.WeChat "serves as a virtual public square for the Chinese-speaking and Chinese-American community in the United States and is (as a practical matter) its only means of communication," the judge wrote in the ruling, dated Saturday and published earlier this Sunday.  Prohibiting it effectively "excludes meaningful access to communication in your community and therefore operates as a pre-restriction on your right to freedom of expression".The U.S. administration had argued that WeChat posed a threat to national security, but the judge said there was insufficient evidence of that. "Certainly, the government's general national security interest is significant," he wrote. "But in this register, while the government has established that China's activities raise significant national security concerns, it has provided little evidence that its effective WeChat ban for all U.S. users to address these concerns."The Department of Justice and Commerce did not respond immediately to requests for comment.The United States has claimed that WeChat is a threat because its owner, Tencent Holdings, is intertwined with the Communist Party of China, which can use the app to spread propaganda, track users, and steal their private and proprietary data. This is a similar argument that the administration has used to target the TikTok application, while forging the sale of that application's operations in the US nation.TikTok delayOn Saturday, the U.S. government delayed its plan to ban downloads from TikTok, the popular video-sharing app after Trump said it approved Oracle's bid for TikTok's U.S. operations "as a whole." TikTok's ban would also take effect on Sunday, but the order was delayed until September 27. TikTok filed a lawsuit in Washington, D.C. on Friday.WeChat users have said that restrictions on implementation are driven by election year policy.At a court hearing Saturday, Michael Bien, a lawyer for WeChat's user group, said the restrictions on WeChat are a long way from the 'strictly designed' measures that the government must impose so as not to unnecessarily restrict people's constitutional rights.Michael Drezner, a government lawyer, said that anxiety anduncertainty that U.S. WeChat users may experience because prohibitions do not entitle them to an order to stop the implementation of restrictions. Its dependence on WeChat is the result of China's ban on other social networks, which has made WeChat the exclusive Chinese government-controlled option for communicating with people in China, according to Drezner.The case judge rejected a preliminary court order application on Friday, which users had requested on the grounds that the executive order was too vague. Commerce detailed on Friday what transactions with WeChat and its Chinese parent company will not be allowed under the August 6 executive order. The judge scheduled the hearing on Saturday in response to a revived request from the user group.Load-Date: September 21, 2020End of Document

U.S. RENEWS BAN ON COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERS SEEKING TO EMIGRATEStates News ServiceOctober 5, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1289 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The United States has renewed policy guidance preventing members of the Communist Party or "any other totalitarian party" from gaining residency or citizenship, in a move that could affect tens of millions of members of China's ruling party.The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued the policy guidance on Oct. 2, saying that "membership in or affiliation with the Communist Party or any other totalitarian party is inconsistent and incompatible with the ... Oath of Allegiance to the United States of America, which includes pledging to 'support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States'," the agency said in a statement on its official website."Any intending immigrant who is a member or affiliate of the Communist Party or any other totalitarian party (or subdivision or affiliate), domestic or foreign, is inadmissible to the United States," it said, with "inadmissibility" applying to citizenship or residency criteria.The U.S. has previously ruled that members of communist parties are inadmissible to take the Oath of Allegiance, but the rules have been very leniently applied in recent years.The new advisory could affect nearly 200 million members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Communist Youth League.Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the party-affiliated Global Times newspaper, appeared to welcome the move."Many outstanding talents in China are Communist Party members," Hu said via his Twitter account. "The decision by the US helps keep more talents in China since it takes out their illusion. Not bad."But foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying expressed "strong dissatisfaction.""If this is true, then I think it's very sad," Hua told a regular news briefing in Beijing. "We hope that the United States will end this policy, which violates the basic norms of international relations and does little to boost the image and credibility of the U.S. as a great power."90 million party membersA Beijing-based academic who gave only the surname Wei said the news could signal huge changes among China's political and financial elite, most of whom are linked to the ruling party in some way."There are 90 million party members in China," Wei said. "Most of them have no commitment to communism; they just joined as a way to improve their profile.""For them, joining the party was a means to an end, because it's much easier to gain promotion or get the better jobs," he said. "So this is serious, for them."More than 80 million members of the Communist Youth League will also be affected by the ban, Wei said.A former party member surnamed Mao said the middle- and higher-ranking members of the party will be hardest hit by the new policy."This is because they all have relatives, property and children in the U.S.," Mao said. "The lower-ranking party members would never have the option of going to the U.S., so only some people in the system will be directly affected."According to a 2012 survey by Hong Kong's Dongxiang magazine, some 90 percent of the relatives of Communist Party Central Committee members have overseas passports or residency.Many Chinese nationals who emigrate and obtain foreign nationality don't then register their new passport in China, enabling them to retain their Chinese residency rights and other benefits, including pensions, the report found.The new rules means that nobody can now receive a U.S. green card or citizenship without swearing that they are not, nor have ever been, a member of the Communist Party or other totalitarian parties.Warning to younger peopleFederal investigators will check such claims, and will disqualify anyone found to have fraudulently obtained residency or citizenship, experts told RFA.Beijing-based scholar Song Hui said the new rules also send a warning to younger people in China."Anyone who is thinking about their advancement, say in academia or the technology sector, or who plans to go to the U.S. shouldn't be joining the party," Song told RFA. "They will choose not to, if they plan to go to the U.S. for further studies."Jiangsu rights activist Zhang Jianping said members of the Chinese Communist Party are no longer welcome in the free world."The 90 million party members should know the truth about what kind of person you should be to live in the civilized world," Zhang said.In Hong Kong, the new guidelines raised fresh questions about which of Hong Kong's high-ranking officials, former officials and top-level business leaders are members of the CCP.Hong Kong representatives to the National People's Congress (NPC), the heads of Beijing's Central Liaison Office in the city, and the heads of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office are among those assumed to be CCP members.Former chief executive Tung Chee-hwa now serves as vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a CCP advisory body. He has lived in the U.S., and his children are U.S. citizens.He visited the U.S. alongside former Chinese president Hu Jintao in 2011, and stood next to then vice president Xi Jinping when he received then U.S. vice president Joe Biden in Beijing in the same year, fueling speculation that he is a member of the CCP.But the CCP generally remains silent regarding the party membership of public figures, so many suspected members among the Hong Kong elite have never been publicly confirmed as such.It was unclear whether members of underground CCP affiliate the Hong Kong and Macau Work Committee, or the China-backed Federation of Trade Unions, would be covered by the U.S. guidelines.Political commentators told RFA that it is hard to verify who is a member of the secretive Work Committee.U.S.-based democracy activist turned immigration expert Zheng Cunzhu called on people to send any evidence they could find of a person's membership in the Work Committee to the U.S. authorities."If the evidence leads to a conclusion that the [Work Committee] or the Federation of Trade Unions have connections with extremist ideology or espouse communism, then the members of these groups will likely be prevented from emigrating to the U.S. in future," Zheng said.China analyst Willy Lam said there are already a large number of CCP members already in the U.S., and that their status was unlikely to be affected."Immigration has been going on for years," he said. "There are many party members who are students or who stay in the United States to work after graduation.""I don't think the Chinese side will issue an order for this group to return to China, so there will still be a certain number of CCP members in the U.S.," he said.Chinese government figures from this year showed the number of registered members of the Communist Party at 91.914 million.Hong Kong's Apple Daily newspaper reported last month that a CCP member and retired Chinese official was denied entry to the U.S. and had his visa revoked after trying to visit his daughter there, amid unconfirmed reports that the U.S. is getting ready to impose a total entry ban on CCP members.A Chinese woman who had immigrated to the U.S. said her father, a retired cadre of the Chinese Communist Party, was denied entry into the country at Detroit Metropolitan Airport on Sept. 17, the Apple Daily quoted Zheng Cunzhu as saying.The New York Times reported in July that the Trump administration was considering an outright visa ban on CCP members. Commenting on the report, Secretary of State Mike Pence said the administration was looking at ways of "pushing back" against Beijing.Reported by Man Hoi-tsan for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Qiao Long for the Mandarin Service.

Negotiations to sell TikTok's U.S. deal get complicatedCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 2, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 506 wordsBody       Negotiations for the sale of TikTok's operations in the United States have been complicated by the question of whether the application's core algorithms can be included in the deal, The Wall Street Journal reported. These algorithms decide which videos users see without first requiring them to follow other users or specify their preferences.     Based on unidentified sources but knowledgeable about the process, the newspaper said the algorithms were integrated into the business until last Friday - when the Chinese government introduced restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence technology, such as the one that powers TikTok.             Read Also Beijing has a say in the sale of Tik Tok The Chinese decision followed u.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to force the Chinese sale of TikTok's U.S. business, which has 100 million users. These export restrictions mean that TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance Ltd., will need to obtain a license to export any restricted technology to a foreign company. The question is whether its algorithms need the approval of the Chinese government to be transferred and, if so, whether Beijing will authorize the transfer.             Read Also Microsoft and Walmart compete with Oracle and make an offer by TikTok The newspaper said that both eventual buyers, as the seller, ByteDance, are trying to clarify the situation. Among those interested in the purchase is the duo Microsoft-Walmart.Representatives for Microsoft and Walmart declined to comment on the situation and officials at TikTok and Oracle did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Microsoft's intention to buy TikTok in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand had been known for weeks, and then joined forces with Walmart.

The U.S. proposal to Brazil to keep Huawei out of its 5G networkCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 20, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 660 wordsBodyThe U.S. government on Tuesday intensified its efforts to keep China's Huawei company out of Brazil's 5G market. Specifically, Washington offered to finance the purchase of equipment from its competitors by Brazilian telecommunications companies.During a visit to Brasilia, officials from the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), US bank EXIM and the National Security Council spoke to local journalists about the funds available to purchase equipment from other companies.The U.S. delegation was headed by National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien, who met with President Jair Bolsonaro. Both then attended the signing of an EXIM bank financing agreement that identifies areas of business cooperation including 5G telecommunications.In Washington, senior U.S. officials urged Brazil to carefully monitor Chinese investments in Brazil and Beijing's actions to expand its influence on Latin America's largest economy, especially through Huawei's sale of 5G technology.U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer said that trade agreements reached with Brazil on Monday would pave the way for future negotiations on steel, ethanol and sugar, and promote greater U.S. investment as Washington moved to provide a counterweight to China's expansion in the region."I would clearly say that there is an element of China... in everything we do," Lighthizer said at an event hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "China has made a very significant move in Brazil. They're Brazil's largest trading partner, so it's something we're worried about."FILE IMAGE. U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer during a Senate panel hearing in The Capitol, Washington, USA, June 17, 2020. Anna Moneymaker/Pool via REUTERS (POOL New/)Lighthizer's comments were part of a press conference. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Washington had urged Bolsonaro and other Brazilian officials to keep a close eye on China's investments and advanced technologies, as Washington had done."We encouraged Brazil to try to work together to make sure we watch China carefully regarding all kinds of technology and telephony and 5G," Kudlow said at the event."We have taken action here in the United States; we are moving forward, and I have great hope that Brazil will move with us," he added. "We hope that Brazil will also maintain a careful and critical look at Chinese investments."The statements come a few days after a report by Bloomberg agency, which indicated that Bolsonaro is considering banning the Chinese tech giant from participating in the supply of components to build the country's future 5G network. According to a senior member of the Brazilian president's cabinet to the Bloomberg chain, Brasilia sees China as a global threat to data privacy and sovereignty. The source clarified that, however, no final decision had yet been taken. Washington believes Huawei would hand over data to the Chinese government for espionage, a claim Huawei denies.Brazilplans to auction 5G frequencies next year to telecommunications companies operating in Brazil, many of which already buy from Huawei and would like to continue to do so for their 5G networks because Chinese equipment is cheaper.DFC CEO Sabrina Teichman said 20% of her $135 billion portfolio was available for trade agreements with companies that wanted to partner with the United States as part of the Trump administration's program to neutralize Chinese competition."We have capital financing and we also have debt financing and those plans are available to Brazilian companies" looking to acquire new technology," he told reporters. "We look forward to supporting the Brazilian telecommunications sector," he added.By Lisandra Paraguassu and Andrea Shalal (Reuters)Read on:Australia joined the United States, Japan and India in military exercises in the face of escalating tensions with ChinaJair Bolsonaro mulls banning Huawei from participating in the construction of Brazil's 5G networkLoad-Date: October 21, 2020End of Document

EXCLUSIVE-US weighs blacklist Chinese chip maker SMICCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 4, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 259 wordsBodyBy Idrees Ali and Alexandra AlperWASHINGTON, 4 Sep (Reuters) - The U.S. government considers adding China's major chip manufacturer SMIC to a commercial blacklist, a Defense Department official said Friday, at a time when Donald Trump administration intensifies its strong action against Chinese companies.A Pentagon spokeswoman said the Department of Defense is working with other agencies to determine whether to make the decision against Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, which would force U.S. suppliers to obtain a special license before shipping to the company.SMIC did not immediately respond to an email for comment.Washington has often used this blacklist, which now includes more than 275 Chinese-based companies, to attack China's industrial sectors, from telecom giants Huawei Technologies and ZTE for violating sanctions, to watch camera manufacturer Hikvision over china's Uighur minority crackdown.While the Pentagon official did not detailed the reasons for the action, another U.S. official said SMIC's relationship with the Chinese Army is under scrutiny.Recently, the government has focused on Chinese companies that support the Army in Beijing.Last month, the United States blacklisted 24 Chinese firms and focused on people who, he said, were part of military and construction actions in the South China Sea, in the first such sanctions against Beijing for the strategic waterway in dispute.(Report by Idrees Ali and Alexandra Alper; additional information by Karen Freifeld.

ByteDance quits sale of TikTok in US and seeks to partner with OracleCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 14, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 571 wordsBodyBy Echo Wang and Greg Roumeliotis13 Sep (Reuters) - ByteDance resigned Sunday from the sale of TikTok in the United States to seek a partnership with Oracle Corp with which it hopes to avoid Washington's ban on operating in the US while placating the Chinese government, sources familiar with the operation told Reuters.The Beijing-based company had held talks to sell the US version of the popular short video app to Oracle or a consortium led by Microsoft Corp after Donald Trump threatened to ban the use of TikTok in the United States.Although this app is best known for dance videos that go viral among teens, Washington has expressed concern that user data and information can be transferred to the Chinese government.TikTok, which has up to 100 million users in the United States, has assured that it would not accept any request to share that data with the Chinese authorities.The sales negotiations were disrupted by the updating of China's export control rules last month, which allowed Beijing to rule on the delivery of TikTok's algorithm to a foreign buyer. Reuters reported last week that the Chinese government prefers TikTok to close in the US than become a forced sale.Under the new proposal, Oracle will be ByteDance's technology partner and will assume the management of TikTok user data in the US, sources indicated. Oracle is also negotiating to take a stake in TikTok's business in the US, they added.Some of ByteDance's main sponsors—including investment firms General Atlantic and Sequoia—will have minority stakes in TikTok's U.S. operations, one of the sources added.In any case, it's unclear that Trump, who wants an American tech company to own most of TikTok in the United States, is going to approve the deal. The U.S. Foreign Investment Committee (CFIUS), a U.S. government commission that reviews agreements in terms of national security risks, is overseeing the bytedance-Oracle talks.ByteDance plans to rely on CFIUS' approval for china Oceanwide Holdings Group's purchase of US insurer Genworth Financial, which would set a precedent for its proposal with Oracle, sources said.In that operation, China Oceanwide agreed to use a U.S.-based third-party service provider to manage data from US Genworth policyholders. ByteDance will argue that a similar agreement with Oracle can safeguard data from US TikTok users.ByteDance and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment and the White House declined to speak out.Oracle President Larry Ellison is one of the few Trump supporters in the tech world. Your company has great capacity for data management and protection, but has no experience in social media. Its clientele is made up of companies steady consumers. TikTok user data is currently stored in the cloud of Alphabet Inc, which owns Google.On Sunday, Microsoft reported that ByteDance had informed him that it would not sell him TikTok's business in the United States.Walmart Inc, which had joined Microsoft's offering, said that same Sunday that it remained interested in investing and would have more discussions with ByteDance and the other stakeholders.(Information from Echo Wang andGreg Roumeliotis in New York; additional information from David Shepardson in Washington, Melissa Fares in New York, Stephen Nellis in San Fransisco and Yingzhi Yang in Beijing, written by Joshua Franklin; edited by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Christopher Cushing; translation by Jorge Martínez)Load-Date: September 15, 2020End of Document

Disney magic fails to cover up horrifying injusticeHilltop News: St. Edward's UniversitySeptember 17, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 503 wordsBodySix months after its postponement in movie theaters due to the coronavirus pandemic, Disney has announced that "Mulan" will be available to stream Sept. 4 for $29.99 on Disney's streaming service, Disney Plus. Starting Dec. 4, all Disney Plus subscribers will have access to the film, but that doesn't mean they should watch it.The film became controversial when #BoycottMulan began trending on Twitter after lead actress Liu Yeifei expressed her support for the Chinese government amid pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong on Weibo, a Chinese social media site. "I support Hong Kong's police, you can beat me up now," she posted, then added in English, "What a shame for Hong Kong."Yeifei's alarming comments aren't the only reason for the boycott. Disney, placing profits first, filmed a few scenes in Xinjiang, a region of China accused of widespread abuse of the Uyghur Muslim population. Within the film's credits, Disney included a "special thanks" to eight different government bodies located in Xinjiang, including the Chinese Communist Party's propaganda department and a public security bureau in Turpan, where multiple internment camps holding Muslims have been accused of residing. While most activists calling for the boycott have been from Hong Kong, Thailand, and Taiwan, deemed the "Milk Tea Alliance," Americans should also pay attention to these pro-democracy protests and boycott "Mulan" as well.After all, the United States is a democracy and time and time again interfered with China to support democractic values. In June 1989, after the Chinese government sent in military troops into Tiananmen Square in Beijing to clear demonstrations demanding democratic reforms, the U.S. government suspended military sales to Beijing. In November of last year, President Donald Trump signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act that allows for the U.S. to sanction those responsible for human rights abuses in Hong Kong. "There's always an issue somewhere in the world," said Alan Horn, a chairman of Disney Studios. "We [Disney] try to be non-political, apolitical when it comes all to this stuff."Since the U.S. has already admitted support for the pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong, the U.S. should continue to do so, even in the smallest of ways. A film led by an actress who endorses police brutality in Hong Kong and filmed in places accused of heinous human rights abuses shouldn't make a profit off an American audience. "Devastatingly, Disney's support amounts to collaboration and enables repression," said Rayhan Asat, an Uyghur lawyer. "Those who claim to champion freedom in the world cannot afford to ignore such complicity." The decision to choose an actress who is pro-Beijing and to film in controversial places was likely Disney's way to ensure the film would not be censored in mainland China and soar at the box office there. Horn admitted, "If 'Mulan' doesn't work in China, we have a problem." So, save your $29.99 and stream a different movie.• china• disney• hong kong• MulanLoad-Date: September 18, 2020End of Document

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCES BANS OF TIKTOK, WECHATStates News ServiceSeptember 18, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 679 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):By VOA NewsSeptember 18, 2020 08:49 PMThe Trump administration issued a sweeping ban Friday that will begin barring downloads and use of the Chinese-owned mobile apps WeChat and TikTok from U.S. app stores as of midnight Sunday. The announcement is the latest escalation in America's tech fight with China.Officials from the U.S. Commerce Department cited national security and data privacy concerns over the move to ban the two popular internet platforms that serve more than 100 million people in the United States.Starting Monday, both apps will be removed from app stores and users will not be able to download the apps to their phones. For users who have the apps already installed, they will not be able to receive updates to the platforms. This restriction will quickly make the app obsolete on smartphones, as the inability to update will make it incompatible with Apple and Google smartphone software, which currently dominate the tech market.The order includes moves to render WeChat useless within the United States by banning American companies from hosting internet traffic or processing transactions from within the app as of midnight Sunday.WeChat serves millions of U.S. users who predominantly rely on the app to stay in touch and conduct business with people and companies in China.Like most social networking sites, both TikTok and WeChat collect user data, including location and messages to track what kind of targeted ad content is most applicable to them.As of now, TikTok will escape the most drastic sanctions until similar restrictions go into effect November 12 unless the company is able to resolve the administration's national security concerns by the deadline. The order follows weeks of wrangling with the company, which recently struck a deal with U.S.-based software maker Oracle, the details of which have yet to be announced.The app, which has become especially popular among younger users, has proved useful in some political contexts, including for mischief.TikTok users made headlines earlier this year by working to inflate the expected turnout for a rally President Donald Trump held in Tulsa, Oklahoma and making the actual attendance seem especially low by comparison.The deadline to comply with restrictions falls just after the November 3 presidential election in the United States.Prior to striking the deal, representatives of TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, were in talks with Microsoft. The partnership between Microsoft and ByteDance fell through earlier this month after reports estimated that the company would shell out up to $30 billion for the acquisition of the app."We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok's users, while protecting national security interests," Microsoft said in a blog post Sunday. "We would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety and combating disinformation, and we made these principles clear in our August statement."The move to ban the use of the apps in the United States follows an August 6 executive order by Trump, in which he argued that TikTok and WeChat collect data from American users that could be accessed by the Chinese government. Over the past several weeks, Trump has pressured the app's owner to sell TikTok's U.S. operations to a domestic company to satisfy these concerns.TikTok spokesman John Gartner said in a statement that the company is "disappointed" by the move and that it would continue to challenge the "unjust executive order."The American Civil Liberties Union denounced the move as well, saying that the order is an infringement on Americans' rights to free expression.While the Trump administration has accused the apps of collecting data used by the Chinese government to surveil Americans, the government has not provided specific evidence to support the allegations.ByteDance has repeatedly denied that it has partnered with the Chinese government to siphon U.S. user information.Load-Date: September 18, 2020End of Document

China accuses Trump of violating WTO rules with its bans on TikTok and WeChatCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 5, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 408 wordsBodyDuring a closed-door meeting at the World Trade Organization (WTO), China accused the United States and India of violating the rules of world trade over the prohibitions implemented on applications from the Asian giant, including TikTok and WeChat.According to sources cited by Reuters and the South China Morning Post, during his speaking at the Council for Trade in Services meeting last Friday, the Chinese spokesman accused both countries of taking measures that are "clearly inconsistent with WTO rules, restrict cross-border trade services, and violate the basic principles and objectives of the multilateral trading system".US President Donald Trump's administration ordered through two decrees and citing concerns about his country's national security by blocking the download of both WeChat and TikTok. However, two U.S. federal magistrates have blocked this decision.In the case of TikTok, its parent company, ByteDance has presented a plan to partner with Oracle and Walmart to create a new company, TikTok Global, in order to continue operating in the U.S. market. The proposal is under review by the Chinese and US government. If it does not reach a good port, TikTok will have to cease its activities in the country next month. During the WTO Council for Trade in Services meeting, the US argued that its actions against Chinese applications responded to the defence of its national security. The WTO General Agreement on Services allows such action in cases "related to the provision of services that are carried out directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment".However, China argued that Washington's actions are a "clear abuse" given that the Trump Administration has not presented concrete and relevant evidence in this regard. Last June, India banned TikTok and more than half a hundred Chinese-made applications, including WeChat and Baidu Maps, after its army clashed with Chinese soldiers on its disputed Himalayan border. New Delhi at the time considered that applications were "stealing and transmitting user data in an unauthorized manner to servers that have locations outside India."Neither the US Trade Representative's Office nor Chinese mission officials to the WTO have commented on this, but Beijing's accusations will have no consequence on its own, unless China files a formal lawsuit with the Geneva-based multilateral body.commentsforum0WhatsApp  Facebook  Twitter  Linkedin       Load-Date: October 6, 2020End of Document

Worldwide Green Petroleum Coke and Calcined Petroleum Coke Industry to 2025 - Aluminum Segment to Drive the Market Growth - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireOctober 12, 2020 Monday 3:08 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 820 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Green Petroleum Coke and Calcined Petroleum Coke Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2020-2025)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The green petroleum coke and calcined petroleum coke market is expected to register a CAGR of around 6% during the forecast period. Petroleum coke is a byproduct of oil refineries, and the quality of coke (sulphur content in petroleum coke).Around 75% of petcoke produced globally is used as fuel, while the rest is usually either calcined for usage in the aluminum industry or treated for use as metallurgical coke in steel making.Asia-Pacific dominated the market across the world, with robust demand from various applications, such as fuel, aluminum, iron and steel, and silicon metal, among others.Companies Mentioned• Aluminium Bahrain (Alba)• BP America, Inc.• CNOOC Limited• ELSID S.A.• Maniayargroup• Petrocoque• Phillips 66 Company• Rain Carbon Inc.• Rio Tinto• Oxbow Corporation• Zhenjiang Coking And Gas Group Co., Ltd.Key Market TrendsAluminum Segment to Drive the Market Growth• The global demand for primary aluminum is being fuelled by increasing focus toward lightweight construction in the automotive industry coupled with the booming aerospace industry.• The increasing pressure to utilize lightweight materials, in order to protect the environment is expected to drive the growth of aluminum in the automotive sector.• In the light of megatrends, such as electro mobility and additive manufacturing, new applications involving aluminum materials are increasingly used at a higher pace.• Although aluminum is facing strong competition from other materials, such as plastic composites, its growth areas are expected to remain larger in comparison to its substitute areas.• The increasing focus towards energy-saving cars and aluminum's excellent reusability, which allows the energy invested in its production to be entirely reclaimed, is expected to increase aluminum consumption in the coming years.China to Dominate the Asia-Pacific Market• Globally, China and India are one of the major consumers of petroleum coke. Historically, China has produced around 25 million metric tons of pet-coke annually, half of which is anode-grade. Chinese smelters used around 4.0-4.5 Mt of higher-sulfur coke as fuel until 2016.• However, due to strict environmental norms, the consumption of fuel-grade coke decreased reasonably. The country adapted to the recognized industry standard of three percent sulfur as the cut-off point. The country is finding it more challenging to source CPC, due to low supply and high demand for low-sulfur coke from Chinese smelters.• Further, the Chinese government's decision to expand its tariff program in retaliation with the United States includes a new 25% tariff on thermal and metallurgical coal, as well as fuel-grade and calcined petroleum coke (CPC).• China continues to be the primary driver of growth in the aluminum industry, and e-mobility is a major factor.• China is the global leader in the electric car market. The Chinese government is providing strong financial and non-financial incentives to boost the electric cars sales.• New applications are coming up, such as pedestrian bridges, aluminum formwork and aluminum furniture, which is also likely to be an additional source of aluminum consumption growth, which in turn will aid in driving the petroleum coke market through the forecast period.Key Topics Covered:1 INTRODUCTION1.1 Study Assumptions1.2 Scope of the Study2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY4 MARKET DYNAMICS4.1 Drivers4.2 Restraints4.3 Industry Value-chain Analysis4.4 Porter's Five Forces Analysis5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 Type5.1.1 Fuel Grade5.1.2 Calcined Coke5.2 Application5.2.1 Green Petroleum Coke5.2.1.1 Aluminum5.2.1.2 Fuel5.2.1.3 Iron and steel5.2.1.4 Silicon Metal5.2.1.5 Others (Bricks, Glass, Carbon Products, etc)5.2.2 Calcined Petroleum Coke5.2.2.1 Aluminum5.2.2.2 Titanium dioxide5.2.2.3 Re-carburizing Market5.2.2.4 Others (Needle Coke, Carbon Products, etc)5.3 Geography5.3.1 Asia-Pacific5.3.1.1 China5.3.1.2 India5.3.1.3 Japan5.3.1.4 South Korea5.3.1.5 ASEAN Countries5.3.1.6 Rest of Asia-Pacific5.3.2 North America5.3.2.1 United States5.3.2.2 Canada5.3.2.3 Mexico5.3.3 Europe5.3.3.1 Germany5.3.3.2 United Kingdom5.3.3.3 Italy5.3.3.4 France5.3.3.5 Russia5.3.3.6 Rest of Europe5.3.4 South America5.3.4.1 Brazil5.3.4.2 Argentina5.3.4.3 Rest of South America5.3.5 Middle-East and Africa5.3.5.1 Saudi Arabia5.3.5.2 South Africa5.3.5.3 Rest of Middle-East and Africa6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE6.1 Mergers & Acquisitions, Joint Ventures, Collaborations and Agreements6.2 Market Share/Ranking Analysis**6.3 Strategies Adopted by Leading Players6.4 Company Profiles7 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND FUTURE TRENDSFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/w066fcView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201012005598/en/CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.comLaura Wood, Senior Press Managerpress@researchandmarkets.comFor E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900http://www.businesswire.comLoad-Date: October 12, 2020End of Document

ICYMI: RUBIO JOINS BOB COSTA FOR A CONVERSATION IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE TEXAS TRIBUNEStates News ServiceSeptember 15, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 2437 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) joined Bob Costa for a conversation on the 2020 election, common good capitalism, China's relationship with the United States, and more. The interview was part of a Washington Post Live event in partnership with the Texas Tribune Festival. Watch the full interview here and see below for excerpts.On the threat of foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election:"What the adversaries basically do is they look at all the preexisting fractures in our society and they just seek to drive it, they push on that. They use social media. Increasingly what you're seeing is that they'll create a website somewhere, they may even hire Americans to write on that website, and put that out there as real news content..."And the theory behind it is, if you get a country to fight against each other internally, which we already do a pretty good job of by ourselves, but if you drive that, it weakens that country and that society over time..."More concerning to me is the situation where you could get into a county's election system, you could delete a bunch of voters from the voter rolls, and you would do it strategically... And then if it's a close election, you then use your influence operation to promote the narrative that in some parts of the country, in certain counties, partisan officials were preventing Democrats or Republicans or people from a certain racial or ethnic makeup from voting. All of that is designed to create chaos and questions about the legitimacy of the election."And that would be their dream that would be the biggest achievement that any adversary has ever scored against us in an election cycle to bring us to the point where people honestly believe, half the country believes, that the person who is going to be sworn in was not validly and legitimately elected. It's a grave threat to our republic."On the use of social media in foreign meddling:"It's evolved beyond Russia. It's not just about some fake account where it's a bot that has a name on a Facebook account. I'm talking about [where] you create a website, you create some news agency of some sort on the Internet and it really is promoted and sponsored by a state. And then you hire some Americans who wittingly or unwittingly use it to write up stories that look like news reports. And then you get people to organically spread it online as real news and that spreads."That's one of the challenges that all of us need to be aware of. Just because it looks like a news organization doesn't mean it becomes one. We've reached the point now where it's very difficult to distinguish and I'll be frank, and with all due respect, a lot of Americans already question the mainstream outlets, they view them as places where they promote narratives, not places that promote news stories."So it's this huge muddle, where people are naturally drawn to reports, to news, to stories, that further their pre-existing notions and that affirm your pre-existing beliefs. It becomes attractive for people to read articles, even if it's a source you've never heard of, to read articles that confirm your preexisting bias on politics."On the Russian government's role in stoking racial division in social media:"I don't think there's any doubt that beyond Russia Iran, China, particularly Iran and Russia in this case, are constantly in search of what are fractures, what are things that get Americans to fight against each other."It helps them by weakening us internally. They figure that the more we're at each other's throat in this country, the less capable we are of governance internally or around the world. But it also helps Russia, and to some extent Iran, domestically. They say, 'these are the people that are lecturing us about democracy and freedom, they're chaos, they're destroying each other this is what so-called democracy, at least their version of it, the Western version of it, looks like'."It helps them by weakening us, and that helps them geopolitically. But it also helps them domestically by going to people and saying, 'our system of government is better than the American system because look what's happening over there, they have riots they aren't capable of doing anything, they're fighting with each other all the time.' So there is no doubt that if there's anything that's deeply divisive in America, they don't create it, but they will drive it. They will do everything they can to drive it."On Chinese interference in the election:"When it comes to China, their tactics and their goals are a little different... I don't have any doubt in my mind that China doesn't want Donald Trump to be reelected. I think they measure that against a concern that if their involvement is revealed, that'll be counter productive for them."The Chinese goal ultimately is to try to influence American policy towards China's preferred position. And that could eventually extend to going after individual candidates in an election."They have the capability of doing everything Russia does and more so. They have hack and leak capabilities. You can foresee them using that against individuals who they view as China hardliners and what have you."They have the capability to do everything Russia does, they have more capability than Russia does in many cases. They certainly have more capabilities than Iran. It's just a question of deciding how far they want to go, because I do think, not that they're more measured, but because they worry more about backlash if their hand is revealed, they can be more cautious. If they were aggressive, we probably wouldn't know about it until after the fact."On potential regulation of social media companies to further prevent foreign meddling:"Well that's a great question ... and here's the complexity it raises: What is the fine line between foreign interference and narratives on social media that are domestic, but that may not be true? The truth of the matter is, as an American, the First Amendment does give you the right to say things that are not true. ..."The problem now becomes when they start going after the speech of political figures because they don't agree with their political narrative... Whether regulation will make it closer is something that I am always cautious about ... I would much prefer to enter into a collaborative compact with them that clearly delineates the difference between domestic political speech and foreign efforts to interfere or spread divisive propaganda within our country. ..."I do think, however, that if social media companies are going to get in the business of being publishers, where they are going to edit out information they want in versus not in, then they should be treated like a publisher, including for purposes of liability."On the prevalence of conspiracy theories in today's political environment:"My deeper concern is that we are a society and a country in which people are vulnerable to this sort of thing. At the core of every conspiracy theory is fear fear is what drives it. That we've reached this point of fear and insecurity in our country that people are likelier to believe some ridiculous conspiracy theory than what they see reported or what their leaders tell us, is a warning to leaders and to those that report the news about how important it is they do everything possible to build up, protect, and secure credibility both for those of us in public service and those who report on our work."On the recent DHS whistleblower report claiming that the White House pressured officials to stop providing intelligence analysis on threat of Russian interference:"There is a process in the law for how a whistleblower complaint is handled. It's referred, when it's revealed to Congress, to the committee who has jurisdiction in this case ours, because it's an intelligence matter. We have a process for handling it. We've already begun that process. We will handle it the way we will handle any whistleblower complaint that comes forward. We're going to take it seriously,we're going to run it by the book. Our staff is already working on it, and we'll get to the end conclusion on it after we've done that work. So we'll treat any whistleblower complaint that way, and that process has already begun."On common good capitalism:"The fundamental question is why do we have a market and an economy. Is the purpose of our country and our people to serve the market and the economy? Or is the purpose of the economy and the market to serve the country and the people? The answer is self obvious. The economy is the means, the ends is the well being of our country."I'm a supporter of free enterprise and capitalism because I believe it is the best system to deliver the best results for our people, and for our country, and for the common good of our nation. That said, I recognize that the free market will always reach the most efficient outcome. It will allocate capital to the most efficient use. And oftentimes that's of great benefit to the United States of America. Every now and then, it is not in the best interest of our country..."It is not in our best interest to depend on China, or any other country for that matter, for an overwhelming percentage of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in our generic medicines, or our personal protective equipment. And I would extend that: it is not in the best interest to depend on China for a significant percentage of rare earth minerals that we need for technology, or our manufacturing and installation capabilities for telecommunications and 5G."So in those instances in which the most efficient outcome is not in the best interest of our country, the government has an obligation to create incentives for the private market and for free enterprise to do that activity within the United States. Sometimes that best interest is because of national security. Sometimes that best interest is because the jobs that industry creates are the kinds of jobs that allow people to raise a family and have strong communities that they are a part of. And that's good for the country too."On incentivizing pharmaceutical companies to stay in the United States:"If we're going to incentivize behavior, it should be behavior that's good for Americans and behavior that's good for American jobs to be created. Because that's what's going to help our country be stronger and our communities be stronger."On the future of the U.S. relationship with China:"I'm not anti-China, I don't even consider myself a hardliner, I'm a realist. China is a rich and powerful country... The 21st century is going to be defined by the relationship between the United States and China, and it will either be a relationship of conflict, even potential military conflict, or it will be a balanced relationship between two great powers. I want the latter. That's not the direction we're headed right now."We made a decision in this country, a long time ago, that we thought once China got rich and prosperous that they would become more democratic and they would adhere to fairness and rule of law in international relations and international commerce. That has not worked out that way. It was a terrible mistake. That needs to now be rebalanced. We've allowed them, through our own means, to deindustrialize us. We came up with this notion that we would be the place that innovates and they would be the place that builds. And we forgot that eventually the place that makes things is also the place that innovates them in the long-term. We need to be able to be a place that does both..."It's an important moment for rebalancing this relationship. We're almost too late to it, and if it feels overly aggressive it's because we are trying to make up for 15 or 20 years of mistakes all at once. This work of rebalancing the relationship with China is not the work of one administration or one Congress, it's the work of a generation..."It's not about holding China back. It's about ensuring that their rise does not come at our expense, particularly self inflicted expense... Ideally you want to reach the situation where you do have two great powers, China and the United States, who have a balanced working relationship, but that's not where we are today and it's going to take some time to get to that point."On the Administration's actions toward China at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic:"If you recall, when [President Trump] implemented the travel ban, he was immediately criticized by Joe Biden and others of xenophobia. I thought that was the right move... I think they've been pretty aggressive about it in hindsight... What I would have preferred to see is that early on it would have been said that there's this virus, we have no idea the extent that it's spreading, [China is] not sharing information about the viral markers that will allow researchers to begin to work on it."There's no doubt that, like any totalitarian regime, the default position of the Chinese government is to try and cover up and protect their image... I also don't think it takes away from the things [the Administration] has done right, like mobilizing our industrial base to wipe out what at the time was a very severe concern about a shortage of ventilators. We didn't have enough and the President was able to rally the private sector to create a ventilator surplus now in this country that's actually allowed us to share those with other countries."On the prospect of a stimulus deal amid the threat of government shutdown:"I think Democrat leadership has made a decision that they're better off doing nothing, because things will get bad, the President will be blamed for it, and it will help them in November... I hope that that breaks momentarily so we can keep the government funded and we can find a way to do something. There's no way we're going to do $3 trillion, but we have to do something, and I hope that we can realize that our country desperately needs us to act and to do something."On the state of the 2020 election in Florida:"I ultimately think the President will win Florida for a variety of different reasons, but it's going to be a very close race. And we may not know right away who the winner is."On the future of Senator Rubio's political career:"I enjoy very much being in public office, because I wake up every morning, I can see something in the world that I think needs to be addressed, and I'm in a place where I can actually try to do something about it. I've enjoyed doing that a lot, and I hope to have the opportunity to continue doing it in some form or fashion down the road."Load-Date: September 15, 2020End of Document

Sen. Rubio Joins Bob Costa for a Conversation in Partnership With the Texas TribuneTargeted News ServiceSeptember 16, 2020 Wednesday 7:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2464 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, issued the following news release:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) joined Bob Costa for a conversation on the 2020 election, common good capitalism, China's relationship with the United States, and more. The interview was part of a Washington Post Live event in partnership with the Texas Tribune Festival. Watch the full interview here and see below for excerpts.On the threat of foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election:"What the adversaries basically do is they look at all the preexisting fractures in our society and they just seek to drive it, they push on that. They use social media. Increasingly what you're seeing is that they'll create a website somewhere, they may even hire Americans to write on that website, and put that out there as real news content..."And the theory behind it is, if you get a country to fight against each other internally, which we already do a pretty good job of by ourselves, but if you drive that, it weakens that country and that society over time..."More concerning to me is the situation where you could get into a county's election system, you could delete a bunch of voters from the voter rolls, and you would do it strategically... And then if it's a close election, you then use your influence operation to promote the narrative that in some parts of the country, in certain counties, partisan officials were preventing Democrats or Republicans or people from a certain racial or ethnic makeup from voting. All of that is designed to create chaos and questions about the legitimacy of the election."And that would be their dream -- that would be the biggest achievement that any adversary has ever scored against us in an election cycle -- to bring us to the point where people honestly believe, half the country believes, that the person who is going to be sworn in was not validly and legitimately elected. It's a grave threat to our republic."On the use of social media in foreign meddling:"It's evolved beyond Russia. It's not just about some fake account where it's a bot that has a name on a Facebook account. I'm talking about [where] you create a website, you create some news agency of some sort on the Internet and it really is promoted and sponsored by a state. And then you hire some Americans who wittingly or unwittingly use it to write up stories that look like news reports. And then you get people to organically spread it online as real news and that spreads."That's one of the challenges that all of us need to be aware of. Just because it looks like a news organization doesn't mean it becomes one. We've reached the point now where it's very difficult to distinguish -- and I'll be frank, and with all due respect, a lot of Americans already question the mainstream outlets, they view them as places where they promote narratives, not places that promote news stories."So it's this huge muddle, where people are naturally drawn to reports, to news, to stories, that further their pre-existing notions and that affirm your pre-existing beliefs. It becomes attractive for people to read articles, even if it's a source you've never heard of, to read articles that confirm your preexisting bias on politics."On the Russian government's role in stoking racial division in social media:"I don't think there's any doubt that beyond Russia -- Iran, China, particularly Iran and Russia in this case, are constantly in search of what are fractures, what are things that get Americans to fight against each other."It helps them by weakening us internally. They figure that the more we're at each other's throat in this country, the less capable we are of governance internally or around the world. But it also helps Russia, and to some extent Iran, domestically. They say, 'these are the people that are lecturing us about democracy and freedom, they're chaos, they're destroying each other -- this is what so-called democracy, at least their version of it, the Western version of it, looks like'."It helps them by weakening us, and that helps them geopolitically. But it also helps them domestically by going to people and saying, 'our system of government is better than the American system because look what's happening over there, they have riots they aren't capable of doing anything, they're fighting with each other all the time.' So there is no doubt that if there's anything that's deeply divisive in America, they don't create it, but they will drive it. They will do everything they can to drive it."On Chinese interference in the election:"When it comes to China, their tactics and their goals are a little different... I don't have any doubt in my mind that China doesn't want Donald Trump to be reelected. I think they measure that against a concern that if their involvement is revealed, that'll be counter productive for them."The Chinese goal ultimately is to try to influence American policy towards China's preferred position. And that could eventually extend to going after individual candidates in an election."They have the capability of doing everything Russia does and more so. They have hack and leak capabilities. You can foresee them using that against individuals who they view as China hardliners and what have you."They have the capability to do everything Russia does, they have more capability than Russia does in many cases. They certainly have more capabilities than Iran. It's just a question of deciding how far they want to go, because I do think, not that they're more measured, but because they worry more about backlash if their hand is revealed, they can be more cautious. If they were aggressive, we probably wouldn't know about it until after the fact."On potential regulation of social media companies to further prevent foreign meddling:"Well that's a great question ... and here's the complexity it raises: What is the fine line between foreign interference and narratives on social media that are domestic, but that may not be true? The truth of the matter is, as an American, the First Amendment does give you the right to say things that are not true. ..."The problem now becomes when they start going after the speech of political figures because they don't agree with their political narrative... Whether regulation will make it closer is something that I am always cautious about ... I would much prefer to enter into a collaborative compact with them that clearly delineates the difference between domestic political speech and foreign efforts to interfere or spread divisive propaganda within our country. ..."I do think, however, that if social media companies are going to get in the business of being publishers, where they are going to edit out information they want in versus not in, then they should be treated like a publisher, including for purposes of liability."On the prevalence of conspiracy theories in today's political environment:"My deeper concern is that we are a society and a country in which people are vulnerable to this sort of thing. At the core of every conspiracy theory is fear -- fear is what drives it. That we've reached this point of fear and insecurity in our country that people are likelier to believe some ridiculous conspiracy theory than what they see reported or what their leaders tell us, is a warning to leaders and to those that report the news about how important it is they do everything possible to build up, protect, and secure credibility both for those of us in public service and those who report on our work."On the recent DHS whistleblower report claiming that the White House pressured officials to stop providing intelligence analysis on threat of Russian interference:"There is a process in the law for how a whistleblower complaint is handled.

US judge rejects government order to withdraw Chinese 'app' WeChatCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 24, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 278 wordsBodyBy David Shepardson23 Oct (Reuters) - A judge rejected on Friday a request from the U.S. Department of Justice requesting the revocation of a decision allowing Apple and Google, owned by the Alphabet group, to continue offering the Chinese-owned WeChat mobile app for download in the country.Judge Laurel Beeler said the new evidence provided by the Government did not change her mind about the implementation of the Tencent group. As in the case of the Chinese video application TikTok, the Justice Department has argued that WeChat poses a threat to national security.WeChat has an average of 19 million daily active users in the United States. It is popular with Chinese students, Americans living in China, and some Americans who have personal or business relationships with China.WeChat is an all-in-one mobile app that combines services similar to Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Venmo. The app is an essential part of the daily lives of many residents in China and has over one billion users worldwide.The Justice Department appealed Beeler's decision to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, but no ruling is likely to be issued before December.Following a lawsuit filed by WeChat users, Beeler last month blocked an order from the US Department of Commerce that had entered into force on September 20 and would have required the removal of the app from US app stores.The Commerce Department's order would also have banned other operations made with WeChat in the US, making the application in the country potentially unusable.(Information by David Shepardson; edited by Chris Reese and Cynthia Osterman; translated by Dario Fernandez in the writing of Gdansk)Load-Date: October 25, 2020End of Document

Trump gives 'blessing' to TikTok deal with OracleStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 21, 2020 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 585 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyAfter an unusual Saturday afternoon hearing in SF, a federal judge entered an order that temporarily blocked a Trump Administration mandate banning "downloads" of the Chinese-owned global messaging app WeChat - keeping it in popular app stores for at least a little while longer. Oracle will provide secure cloud services while Walmart will handle things like advertising, payments and fulfillment.Rubio, R-Fla., told "Sunday Morning Futures" that the social media and video service has drawn concern because of its ties to China, and the ruling Chinese Communist Party's ability to surreptitiously gain access to users' personal data - and that the phenomenon could still exist even if Oracle brings operations stateside.The TikTok deal has been a vivid example of the Trump administration's policy of reciprocity toward Chinese businesses.Walmart's chief executive officer Doug McMillon will serve on TikTok Global's board of directors, the retailer said in a statement.Oracle's Generation 2 Cloud fully isolates running applications and responds to security threats auto-nomously, according to the statement, which eliminates the risk of foreign governments spying on American users or trying to influence them with disinformation.ByteDance also said earlier in a statement on Chinese microblogging platform Weibo that it had learned from the media about President Trump's statement that ByteDance would contribute $5 billion to an education fund.The new company, which will be called TikTok Global, has agreed to funnel US$5 billion (S$6.8 billion) in new tax dollars to the U.S. and set up a new education fund, which Mr Trump said would satisfy his demand that the government receive a payment from the deal.Tadej Pogacar poised to win Tour de FranceIt is an unforgettable moment in cycling which has written both Pogacar and UAE Team Emirates into the history books. The defeated Roglic and Australia's Richie Porte completed the podium behind cycling's newest breakout superstar.Oracle and Walmart have partnered to form TikTok global, which will have a headquarters set up in the United States.If the government appeals and wins, the plaintiffs can appeal that decision. On Saturday, he said he supported in principle a deal that would allow TikTok to continue to operate in the US. Oracle CEO Safra Catz said in the statement that the deal would "ensure data privacy to TikTok's American users". Majority are young consumers, who spend hours on TikTok, memorized by the app's addicting algorithm that is without peer in Silicon Valley.The deal, its backers say, strengthens USA oversight of the app and provides American companies to more robustly pushback on ByteDance's decisions, including any that may involve the Chinese government. The TikTok Global deal does not include the app's China twin, Douyin, which has become an enormous hit in its own right. Western companies and bankers are still wrangling with TikTok's owner, the White House and Chinese authorities to try to arrange a sale of some of TikTok's business.Trump has claimed TikTok is collecting user data for Beijing, without providing evidence, and in early August gave ByteDance until September 20 to hand over TikTok's United States operations to an American company.According to Walmart's press release, TikTok Global will go public with an IPO "in less than 12 months"."The administration is clear that they want to get Chinese tech off of USA networks, so I wonder if they'll want to push this further after time", Lewis said.Load-Date: September 21, 2020End of Document

The global market for Consumer Batteries is projected to reach US$50 billion by 2025; driven by the growing indispensability of batteries in the digital era of laptops, smartphones, tablets, smart electronic wearables and digital cameras. As the most important portable power source, batteries are omnipresent in virtually every sector that utilizes electronic/electrical equipment.GlobeNewswireSeptember 9, 2020 Wednesday 9:38 AM PTCopyright 2020 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: MARKET RESEARCH REPORTSLength: 5909 wordsBodyNew York, Sept.  09, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report "Global Consumer Batteries Industry" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p090632/?utm_source=GNW   In the consumer electronics sector, smartphones need long-lasting batteries; electronic wearables need cost-effective battery solutions; and consumer internet of things (IoT) to reach its full potential needs smart batteries. Consumerism, especially digital consumerism, is driving increased use of digital technology, tools and devices. This rise of digital consumers is supported by a host of factors such as rapid development of internet infrastructure; spread of mobile communication network technologies like 4G and 5G; falling cost of mobile data and voice tariffs; falling prices of smartphones and their rapid penetration. All of these factors have changed the way people consume digital goods and services, leading the way to rapid proliferation of digital devices and platforms. Deeper engagement with digital technologies is further being encouraged by concepts such as consumer IoT; smart homes; and home automation. Against this backdrop of the emergence of the modern digital consumer, the consumer electronics industry is poised to grow from US$322.8 billion in 2018 to over US$623.4 billion by 2024. This emerging opportunity brings batteries into the spotlight as a key enabler of the age of portable electronics and smart mobile computing.  Manufacturers are investing massive resources into developing new and efficient battery technologies, given the fact that advancements in portability and mobility in the field of telecommunications and computing are limited by battery power dynamics. There is growing pressure on developing energy-dense batteries especially against a backdrop where microprocessor performance has been increasing at a rate much higher than the annual gain in energy capacity in batteries. Growing environmental concerns over climate change is driving the development of green battery chemistries. Lithium battery ranks as the fastest growing type of primary battery supported by benefits such as high energy density; slower rate of self-discharge; low maintenance; smaller and lighter in form factor; low memory effect when compared to nickel-metal hydride rechargeable batteries; quick and rapid charging cycles; longer operating life and durability with the ability to withstand hundreds of charge-discharge cycles. Lithium polymer (LiPo) rechargeable batteries today represent the preferred power source for a wide range of consumer products including battery operated toys, PDAs, laptop computers, smartphones, MP3 players and GPS units, among numerous others. The United States, China and Europe represent large markets worldwide with a combined share of 60.5% of the market. China also ranks as the fastest growing market with a CAGR of 5.9% over the analysis period supported by factors such as strong economic growth; growing disposable incomes; rapidly digitalizing lifestyles of the growing base of affluent middle class population and resulting huge appetite for electronic goods.

TikTok will partner with Oracle in the United States after Microsoft loses bidCNN WireSeptember 14, 2020 Monday 4:29 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1265 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON, D.c. / Hong Kong (CNN Business) BodyWASHINGTON, D.c. / Hong Kong (CNN Business) --  TikTok and Oracle will become business partners in the United States --- a deal meant to satisfy the Trump administration's national security concerns about the short-form video app, according to a person familiar with the matter.The news comes after weeks of speculation about the Chinese app's future in the United States. President Donald Trump has demanded the app be sold, or else shut down in the United States.The exact nature of the agreement between TikTok and Oracle remains unclear, but it was not described as an outright sale. The news about Oracle came just after Microsoft announced that it will not buy TikTok's US operations from ByteDance. In a statement, Oracle confirmed it is part of the proposal submitted by ByteDance to the Treasury Department in which it will serve as the "trusted technology provider." ByteDance has not responded to a request for comment. TikTok declined to comment. A controversial appTikTok has exploded in popularity in the United States and other western countries, becoming the first Chinese social media platform to gain significant traction with users outside of its home country. It was downloaded 315 million times in the first three months of this year --- more quarterly downloads than any other app in history, according to analytics company Sensor Tower. But Trump and other US politicians have said the app poses a threat to national security because it could be used as a spying tool by Beijing. Authorities have also expressed concern that it could be used to collect personal data on US citizens, or censor speech deemed to be sensitive by the Chinese government. TikTok has denied those allegations. The company has said its data centers are located entirely outside of China and that none of that data is subject to Chinese law. The agreement with Oracle comes days before a ban on TikTok in the United States was scheduled to go into effect. After September 20, the Commerce Department is expected to clarify which types of business dealings involving TikTok will be prohibited in the country, according to an executive order Trump signed August 6.It's not clear whether TikTok's partnership with Oracle would allow the short-form video app to avert that ban. The scope and language of the order, along with Trump's own remarks about TikTok, have led to confusion about how a ban would be implemented. In another executive order, Trump said TikTok had until November 12 to find a buyer.Separately, a TikTok employee has challenged the looming ban in federal court and is seeking a judicial decision to suspend the August 6 executive order. A hearing to consider the plea is scheduled for Tuesday. TikTok has also sued the Trump administration over one of the orders, calling it "heavily politicized."Structuring the dealMuch about the exact nature of the agreement between TikTok and Oracle is still unknown. But experts have pointed to other partnerships between US and foreign companies that were vetted by authorities as potential templates.When the Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank acquired a 78% stake in Sprint in 2013, the two firms agreed to several conditions to address national security concerns. A new member of Sprint's board was appointed to oversee national security compliance. The US Defense, Homeland Security and Justice departments were also given the power to review and veto deals for certain kinds of equipment.The focus for ByteDance and Oracle will be on "oversight, transparency and how they structure it for Americans involved and the information they have on Americans," said James Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank based in Washington, D.C. Lewis was an adviser on the SoftBank-Sprint deal. He added that an "intermediary entity" could be created to examine ByteDance's relationship with TikTok. The agreement could also involve limiting what information ByteDance has access to, or putting approved Americans on the company's board.Even if a consensus is reached on how this partnership should be structured, the Oracle-TikTok agreement will still be incredibly complicated, according to Harry Broadman, partner at Berkeley Research Group and former member of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government body that vets certain deals that could give a foreign investor control of a US business.Tensions between the United States and China are continuing to rise ahead of the US election in November. The US government has taken aim at several Chinese companies --- from TikTok to Huawei and Tencent's WeChat --- that Trump has accused of threatening national security."We're in a different territory where national security issues, particularly with personal information, have risen to the fore," Broadman said.Chinese state media on Monday pointedly reported that ByteDance would not sell TikTok's US operations to Microsoft or Oracle. State broadcaster CGTN added that ByteDance would not "give the source code" to any US buyers, citing anonymous sources.It's also not clear how much say Beijing will have in the arrangement. Last month the country revised rules that govern the sale of certain kinds of technology to foreign buyers. The updated list includes data processing, speech and text recognition --- the kind of tech that experts say is used by TikTok.While those notices did not name TikTok or ByteDance, experts have pointed out that the rule change would likely require ByteDance to obtain government permission before it could sell TikTok to a foreign company.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment about the Oracle partnership when asked by reporters at a regular press briefing on Monday, and instead reiterated longstanding criticisms about the US government's campaign against TikTok. "Without any evidence and under the pretext of national security, they abuse state power and conduct unreasonable suppression and intimidation of non-US companies that have achieved a leading edge in a certain field," spokesperson Wang Wenbin said. "We will firmly support relevant companies to safeguard own legitimate rights and interests."A loss for MicrosoftOracle's apparent victory is a blow to Microsoft, which had been gunning for TikTok for weeks. Multiple analysts had described Microsoft's pursuit of TikTok as a potential "coup" --- an opportunity to scoop up one of the world's fastest growing social media platforms at a time when TikTok may be desperate to make a deal."We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok's users, while protecting national security interests," Microsoft said in a blog post Sunday. "To do this, we would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combatting disinformation, and we made these principles clear in our August statement." Walmart had also been participating in negotiations with Microsoft over a potential deal. The retailer had said it was interested in how TikTok could have bolstered its access to consumers.Walmart on Sunday told CNN Business that it "continues to have an interest in a TikTok investment and continues discussions with ByteDance leadership and other interested parties.""We know that any approved deal must satisfy all regulatory and national security concerns," the company said in a statement.-- Clare Duffy, Rob McLean, Donie O'Sullivan and Sherisse Pham contributed to this report.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

US meets its threat, will ban TikTok and WeChatCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 18, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 488 wordsBodyU.S. President Donald Trump's government will ban TikTok and WeChat, Chinese-owned services used by more than 100 million people in the US country, in the country's computer applications market, Commerce Department reported.Restrictions issued will prohibit the transfer of funds or the processing of payments via WeChat within the United States from Sunday, and similar restrictions affecting TikTok will take effect on November 12.?? US and China move war to murky pathTrump has repeatedly assured that TikTok, one of the most growing social media in recent years, poses a "threat" to U.S. national security and seeks to force its sale to an American company."These measures prove, once again, that President Trump will do everything he can to ensure our national security and protect Americans from the threats of the Chinese Communist Party," Trade Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.  Finance  "By instructions from the president we have taken significant steps to combat the malicious Chinese collection of personal data of U.S. citizens, while promoting our national values, democratic rules based on rules, and the resolute application of U.S. laws and regulations," he added.According to the US Government, TikTok and WeChat "collect vast amounts of user data, including network activity, location, and search and browsing history."?? Trump bans any transaction with TikTokThese companies, according to the Department of Commerce, are active participants in the combination of civilian and military activities in China and are subject to mandatory cooperation with the intelligence services of the Chinese Communist Party.On Thursday a federal judge heard the arguments of WeChat users who have filed a complaint against the ban, but there was no immediate ruling.  Finance  In their case argument on Wednesday, Justice Department attorneys said the government will not take legal action against individuals using WeChat "to communicate personal or business information between users," and plaintiffs said that this does not clarify what activities will be specifically prohibited.?? Trump to get resources for his microsoft-TikTok transaction governmentUS Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced Monday that his government would review on the Foreign Investment Committee the agreement reached between Oracle and China's ByteDance, owner of TikTok, to ensure the data protection of Americans and their phones.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs opposes the forced sale of TikTok, an operation that it believes violates the principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO).The Chinese government sees its intention to sell TikTok as one more chapter of the Beijing-Washington trade war, which seeks to contain the growing technological power of the Asian giant, which has already seen telecoms firm Huawei face restrictions, as well as the popular social network WeChat, owned by digital conglomerate Tencent. Load-Date: September 19, 2020End of Document

Global Green Petroleum Coke and Calcined Petroleum Coke Market (2020 to 2025) - Growth, Trends, and ForecastGlobeNewswireOctober 9, 2020 Friday 3:44 AM PTCopyright 2020 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTSLength: 975 wordsBodyDublin, Oct.  09, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Green Petroleum Coke and Calcined Petroleum Coke Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2020-2025)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.   The green petroleum coke and calcined petroleum coke market is expected to register a CAGR of around 6% during the forecast period. Petroleum coke is a byproduct of oil refineries, and the quality of coke (sulphur content in petroleum coke). Around 75% of petcoke produced globally is used as fuel, while the rest is usually either calcined for usage in the aluminum industry or treated for use as metallurgical coke in steel making. Asia-Pacific dominated the market across the world, with robust demand from various applications, such as fuel, aluminum, iron and steel, and silicon metal, among others.Key Market TrendsAluminum Segment to Drive the Market Growth• The global demand for primary aluminum is being fuelled by increasing focus toward lightweight construction in the automotive industry coupled with the booming aerospace industry.• The increasing pressure to utilize lightweight materials, in order to protect the environment is expected to drive the growth of aluminum in the automotive sector.• In the light of megatrends, such as electro mobility and additive manufacturing, new applications involving aluminum materials are increasingly used at a higher pace.• Although aluminum is facing strong competition from other materials, such as plastic composites, yet its growth areas is expected to remain larger in comparison to its substitute areas.• The increasing focus towards energy-saving cars and aluminum's excellent reusability, which allows the energy invested in its production to be entirely reclaimed, is expected to increase aluminum consumption in the coming years.China to Dominate the Asia-Pacific Market• Globally, China and India are one of the major consumers of petroleum coke. Historically, China has produced around 25 million metric tons of pet-coke annually, half of which is anode-grade. Chinese smelters used around 4.0-4.5 Mt of higher-sulfur coke as fuel until 2016.• However, due to strict environmental norms, the consumption of fuel-grade coke decreased reasonably. The country adapted to the recognized industry standard of three percent sulfur as the cut-off point. The country is finding it more challenging to source CPC, due to low supply and high demand for low-sulfur coke from Chinese smelters.• Further, the Chinese government's decision to expand its tariff program in retaliation with the United States includes a new 25% tariff on thermal and metallurgical coal, as well as fuel-grade and calcined petroleum coke (CPC).• China continues to be the primary driver of growth in the aluminum industry, and e-mobility is a major factor.• China is the global leader in the electric car market. The Chinese government is providing strong financial and non-financial incentives to boost the electric cars sales.• New applications are coming up, such as pedestrian bridges, aluminum formwork and aluminum furniture, which is also likely to be an additional source of aluminum consumption growth, which in turn will aid in driving the petroleum coke market through the forecast period.• However, the demand is likely to be affected during 2020 as well, as economic performance and demand are likely to remain affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic in the country.Competitive LandscapeThe market for green petroleum coke and calcined petroleum coke is partially consolidated with the top five players accounting for a significant share of the market. Some of the major players in the market include Oxbow Corporation, Rain Carbon Inc., BP America, Inc., Phillips 66 Company, and Aluminium Bahrain (Alba), amongst others.Reasons to Purchase this report:• The market estimate (ME) sheet in Excel format• 3 months of analyst supportKey Topics Covered:   1 INTRODUCTION1.1 Study Assumptions1.2 Scope of the Study2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY4 MARKET DYNAMICS4.1 Drivers4.2 Restraints4.3 Industry Value-chain Analysis4.4 Porter's Five Forces Analysis4.4.1 Bargaining Power of Suppliers4.4.2 Bargaining Power of Consumers4.4.3 Threat of New Entrants4.4.4 Threat of Substitute Products and Services4.4.5 Degree of Competition5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 Type5.1.1 Fuel Grade5.1.2 Calcined Coke5.2 Application5.2.1 Green Petroleum Coke5.2.1.1 Aluminum5.2.1.2 Fuel5.2.1.3 Iron and steel5.2.1.4 Silicon Metal5.2.1.5 Others (Bricks, Glass, Carbon Products, etc)5.2.2 Calcined Petroleum Coke5.2.2.1 Aluminum5.2.2.2 Titanium dioxide5.2.2.3 Re-carburizing Market5.2.2.4 Others (Needle Coke, Carbon Products, etc)5.3 Geography5.3.1 Asia-Pacific5.3.1.1 China5.3.1.2 India5.3.1.3 Japan5.3.1.4 South Korea5.3.1.5 ASEAN Countries5.3.1.6 Rest of Asia-Pacific5.3.2 North America5.3.2.1 United States5.3.2.2 Canada5.3.2.3 Mexico5.3.3 Europe5.3.3.1 Germany5.3.3.2 United Kingdom5.3.3.3 Italy5.3.3.4 France5.3.3.5 Russia5.3.3.6 Rest of Europe5.3.4 South America5.3.4.1 Brazil5.3.4.2 Argentina5.3.4.3 Rest of South America5.3.5 Middle-East and Africa5.3.5.1 Saudi Arabia5.3.5.2 South Africa5.3.5.3 Rest of Middle-East and Africa6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE6.1 Mergers & Acquisitions, Joint Ventures, Collaborations and Agreements6.2 Market Share/Ranking Analysis**6.3 Strategies Adopted by Leading Players6.4 Company Profiles6.4.1 Aluminium Bahrain (Alba)6.4.2 BP America, Inc.6.4.3 CNOOC Limited6.4.4 ELSID S.A.6.4.5 Maniayargroup6.4.6 Petrocoque6.4.7 Phillips 66 Company6.4.8 Rain Carbon Inc.6.4.9 Rio Tinto6.4.10 Oxbow Corporation6.4.11 Zhenjiang Coking And Gas Group Co., Ltd.7 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND FUTURE TRENDS  For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/xlikbj Research and Markets also offers Custom Research services providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.com          Laura Wood, Senior Press Manager          press@researchandmarkets.com          For E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470          For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630          For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900 Load-Date: October 9, 2020End of Document

ASSOCIATE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL SUJIT RAMAN DELIVERS REMARKS AT THE COMMUNITY ORIENTED POLICING SERVICES (COPS)/POLICE EXECUTIVE RESEARCH FORUM (PERF) FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY FORUMStates News ServiceSeptember 15, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 6332 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of Justice:Washington, DCUnited States~Tuesday, September 15, 2020"Five Principles That Inform the Justice Department's Use of Facial Recognition Technology"Remarks as Prepared for DeliveryAs the Nation's primary federal law enforcement agency, the U.S. Department of Justice enforces and defends the laws of the United States; protects public safety against foreign and domestic threats; and provides national and international leadership in preventing and investigating crime. Technological innovation has created new opportunities for our law enforcement officers to effectively and efficiently tackle these important missions. At the same time, such innovation poses new challenges for ensuring that technology is used in a manner consistent with our laws and our valuesand equally important, with the support and trust of the American people.Facial Recognition Technology (FRT) is at the forefront of these developments. For law enforcement, facial recognition promises a number of benefits, many of which like providing leads for crime-solving, and reuniting missing children with their families have been discussed throughout this forum. When Facial Recognition Technology is used according to professional standards and within appropriate limitations, it can enable law enforcement to react quickly and effectively to emerging threats, and to conduct more efficient investigations. It can also have hugely impactful health, business, and commercial applications, though I will not focus on those non-law enforcement uses today.And yet, it is undisputed that certain applications of FRT raise legitimate questions about the extent to which the use of new technology can remain consistent with our society's commitment to privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.I would like to use my time with you to discuss how the U.S. Department of Justice, particularly the FBI, uses Facial Recognition Technology. While the details are important, what really matter are the underlying principles that inform our use of this technology. The Justice Department began funding face detection and recognition research nearly a quarter-century ago.[1] We remain committed to the federal government's broader investment in building better algorithms, especially by capitalizing on the rapid advance of machine learning tools in the past few years. But even as we support the cutting edge of research and even as we embrace new capabilities that will assist us in fulfilling our duty to protect the American people our use of Facial Recognition Technology remains fundamentally conservative. The FBI does not, for example, use FRT for real-time identification or surveillance. Neither does it use this technology as a means of positive identification without corroborating evidence. A trained human being is always in the loop; the FBI uses the technology to produce investigative leads, but nothing more.The key is trust. And while it might seem counterintuitive in connection with dazzling, fast-moving technologies like FRT, trust often finds a refuge in the gray, bureaucratic prose of privacy impact assessments, training manuals, work logs, and compliance audits that is, in the everyday grammar of the accountability and transparency structures that we, as a free people, demand of our government in order to preserve our liberty, ensure we are treated equitably, and promote the rule of law. It is those structures, and the principles that give them the spark of life, that I will discuss with you today.I.Facial Recognition Technology raises a number of novel questions implicating public safety, individual privacy, and technological change. But this is not the first time our society has grappled with these types of questions. Our Nation's history is replete with examples where our government, our courts, and our civil society have explored how our expectations of privacy evolve along with technological innovation.Over the past fifty years in particular, our courts have confronted a number of cases involving law enforcement's novel use of technology to advance criminal investigations.[2]Of course, before many of these questions came before the courts, they had been debated in State and local lawmaking bodies, as well as in the U.S. Congress. FRT is no different. Some State and local lawmakers already have taken steps to begin addressing this issue, and several bills have been introduced in the U.S. Congress. Thus, while the use of Facial Recognition Technology may eventually come before the courts as a constitutional question, as citizens in a self-governing society we have an important duty to confront and to debate the complex questions that this technology raises, in the first instance.Thanks to facial recognition, tasks that would take countless hours like combing through large databases of photos, biometric data, or other personally identifiable information already in the government's lawful possession can be accomplished in a fraction of that time, at much lower cost. It goes without saying how such advancements can assist law enforcement. At the same time, fears of inaccuracy, the potential for unintended performance differentials reflecting gender, ethnicity, or racial characteristics, and concerns about mass surveillance have led many calls for strict regulatory action. State and local governments across the country are in the process of determining for themselves how best to address law enforcement use of facial recognition. Some governmental entities, including in San Francisco, Boston, Oakland, and just last week Portland, have gone so far as to ban local agencies' use of the technology.The use (or, more accurately, the misuse) of Facial Recognition Technology in other parts of the world has no doubt exacerbated concerns here in the United States. Numerous public reports suggest, for instance, that the Chinese Communist Party takes advantage of facial recognition to assist in its oppression of the Chinese people. Chinese officials use facial recognition in public spaces to identify and track dissidents, activists, and other individuals who are of political interest to the regime. The Chinese government is also reportedly using FRT to suppress minorities, such as the Uyghur and Tibetan populations, in the name of "national security." Moreover, the use of Facial Recognition Technology by authoritarian nations like China and Russia to enforce quarantines shows how these governments justify dragnet surveillance even outside of the purported "law enforcement" and "national security" contexts, and raises important questions about the persistence of such all-encompassing surveillance measures once the pandemic has subsided.Europe is in the midst of an intense debate about these issues. Recently, for example, the data protection authority in Sweden fined a school for deploying Facial Recognition Technology to streamline students' access to school facilities and monitor their attendance. According to the data protection authority, under European privacy law, students lacked the capacity to consent to such monitoring. Shortly thereafter, however, the same data protection authority approved police's use of FRT to identify criminal suspects. In France, a court similarly ruled against schools' use of facial recognition technology rendering this judgment against a background where the French government had announced that FRT would be the only way that its citizens could enroll in a mandatory national digital identity program to securely access public services. (That program is currently on hold.) Meanwhile, reports suggest that Germany is considering using live, automated FRT in train stations and airports throughout the country for security purposes, even as, just last month, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales struck down a local police force's use of that technology, which it had openly deployed around fifty times over two years at a variety of large public events.[3] The court's judgment focused mostly on process errors, however, which the police force has stated it plans to fix.Some in the European Union have called for a total ban on facial recognition technology, while others have advocated for its substantially increased deployment, in both commercial and public safety applications. Perhaps reflecting the deep and unresolved complexities of the public policy debate concerning this technology, the European Commission's recently-published White Paper on Artificial Intelligence makes virtually no mention of Facial Recognition Technology at all, apart from calling for "a broad European debate on the specific circumstances, if any, which might justify [its] use, and on common safeguards"[4] a remarkable turnabout from an initial draft of the white paper, which had proposed an outright ban on the technology for between three-to-five years.In India, the Supreme Court has struck down portions of the Aadhaar national identity system, which incorporates facial recognition among numerous other biometric ID technologies. The court upheld the mandatory use of the system for tax purposes, but prohibited its mandatory use by commercial entities in certain contexts where privacy and security risks were involved. Meanwhile, a widely-publicized press report from 2018 stated that the Delhi Police traced nearly 3,000 missing children in the span of a mere four days, thanks to a trial use of FRT.[5]These are just a few examples of the varied discussions going on around the globe, and around our Nation, regarding the proper role of Facial Recognition Technology in society. The Department of Justice recognizes the value of these discussions, and we understand the significant concerns giving rise to them.We also strongly believe that adopting outright bans or moratoriums on the use of FRT by law enforcement in the United States is not a useful approach. Not only do such bans deprive the American public of the clear benefits of this technology in the short term, but they also disrupt the development of better and safer ways for facial recognition to be developed, tested, and deployed in the future. It is a false dichotomy to think we have to choose between embracing this emerging technology and abandoning our moral compass. To the contrary, "[w]e can advance emerging technology in a way that reflects our values of freedom, human rights, and respect for human dignity."[6] The United States should be a leader in FRT and the issues surrounding it precisely so that we can help establish the norms and standards that will shape this technology in the decades ahead. Otherwise, nations and entities that share neither our values nor our constraints will happily, and aggressively, fill the void.But this is not to say that we should blindly move forward with widespread adoption of Facial Recognition Technology without proper consideration for the risks involved. A careful, incremental approach that appropriately balances costs and benefits is the best way forward.II.Our government already has embarked on this path. Consistent with the President's Executive Order titled Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence,[7] and the Office of Management and Budget's proposed, first-of-their-kind principles regarding the regulation and oversight of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications developed and deployed outside of the federal government,[8] our Nation's strategy on achieving leadership in AI technologies can be realized only by ensuring public engagement, limiting regulatory overreach, and promoting trustworthy technology.At the Department of Justice, five core principles guide our approach to Facial Recognition Technology. These non-exhaustive principles help ensure that we appropriately and responsibly implement FRT specifically and AI technologies more broadly consistent with our obligations to protect privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.First, the Department will develop and use Facial Recognition Technology only pursuant to, and in accordance with, constitutional protections, applicable federal laws, and Department policy. When considering the U.S. government's use of facial recognition, it is important to note the significant requirements imposed by existing laws and policies, particularly with regard to the protection of individual privacy. These laws and policies set us apart from other entities that are struggling with the implementation of FRT, and are an essential part of any analysis of the costs and benefits of its use by federal law enforcement.For instance, the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended,[9] regulates the collection, use, maintenance, and dissemination of personal information by federal executive branch agencies. "Broadly stated, the purpose of the Privacy Act is to balance the government's need to maintain information about individuals with the rights of individuals to be protected against unwarranted invasions of their privacy stemming from federal agencies' collection, maintenance, use, and disclosure of personal information about them."[10] The Privacy Act ensures transparency by requiring federal agencies to describe to the public how they secure and maintain lawfully collected biometric images (like palm prints, facial images, and iris images) for criminal, civil, and/or national security purposes.In addition, Section 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002 requires federal agencies to conduct Privacy Impact Assessments that describe the risks and benefits of information technologies, and detail how the agencies appropriately mitigate privacy risks when using them.The FBI's Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation (FACE) Services' use of Facial Recognition Technology provides a useful example of how existing laws and policies can help strike the right balance.[11] FACE Services employees support FBI investigators "by comparing the facial images of persons associated with open assessments and investigations against facial images available in [S]tate and federal face recognition systems."[12] This point bears repeating: the FBI investigator can provide FACE Services a photograph (called a "probe" photo) only of persons who are subjects of, or are relevant to, an already-open "assessment," "preliminary investigation," or "full investigation," as those terms have long been defined in the publicly-available Attorney General's Guidelines for Domestic FBI Operations.[13] Moreover, the probe photos themselves must have been collected "pursuant to applicable legal authorities as part of an authorized [FBI] investigation."[14] For instance, FBI policy prohibits the submission of photos of individuals exercising rights guaranteed by the First Amendment (like lawful assembly or free exercise of religion), unless those actions are pertinent to, and within the scope of, authorized law enforcement activity.Upon receipt of the probe photo, FACE Services employees "use[ ] face recognition software to compare the probe photo against photos contained within government systems, such as FBI databases . . . , other federal databases . . . , and [S]tate photo repositories,"[15] under the terms of an applicable Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with each State or federal agency. The FBI does not have direct access to these photos repositories, and a written MOU or other type of agreement must be in place with the relevant federal or State agency (such as a Division of Motor Vehicles) prior to requesting a search.After comparison and evaluation, which includes "both automated face recognition software and manual review by a trained biometric images specialist," FACE Services may identify photos that are likely matches to the probe photo.[16] (In many cases, there will not be any likely matches.) The "likely match" photos are called "candidate photos."[17] Candidate photos serve only as investigative leads; unlike fingerprints, the FBI's face recognition results do not constitute positive identification of an individual.The candidate photos are then sent to the FBI investigator, who is prohibited from relying solely upon them to conduct law enforcement action. Instead, he or she must perform additional investigation to determine if the person in the candidate photo is the same person as in the probe photo.All of these protections, along with advanced training requirements and robust auditing capabilities, enhance the accountability of the system.[18] This, in turn, increases the likelihood of success storiesof which there are many. I can publicly discuss one notable example. In 2017, the FBI identified and arrested an MS-13 gang member and murderer who had evaded authorities for over six years, thereby earning a place on the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. FACE Services played a critical role in helping agents track the fugitive killer down, as photos that he and a woman he was associated with had posted on social media yielded matches that, in turn, provided investigators with a physical location to surveil. There, agents confronted the killer and apprehended him without incident. Last year, he pled guilty to his crimes, and was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison.[19]As with any other investigatory technique, the FBI's use of Facial Recognition Technology during the course of an investigation must have a valid purpose consistent with The Attorney General's Guidelines, and must comply with the U.S. Constitution, and with all applicable statutes, executive orders, and Department of Justice regulations and policies. Moreover, the information technologies used by FACE Services are properly documented in publicly-available Privacy Impact Assessments, which spell out in considerable detail the privacy risks associated with FACE Services' use of FRT, and describes the practices and controls the FBI has implemented in order to mitigate those risks so the public can benefit from the technology's use.[20]It bears emphasizing again that federal law enforcement will not use Facial Recognition Technology to unlawfully monitor people for their political views, or based solely on a person's exercise of First Amendment rights. This is expressly prohibited by the Privacy Act and by the FBI's internal policies, as well as by a number of other laws governing the systems of records created by federal agencies.Finally, we regularly test, evaluate, and improve the relevant policies and procedures as technology continues to evolve, and as new use cases emerge. Notably, an audit revealed that, through December 2018, FACE Services employees had performed nearly 400,000 searches on a variety of databases.[21] Each of these searches was made "in support of active FBI investigations," with "no findings of civil liberties violations or evidence of system misuse."[22]Second, in making its Facial Recognition Technology resources available to other law enforcement agencies, the Department will insist those agencies use these resources at a similarly high standard, with appropriate safeguards. The Department of Justice sets a high bar in its use of FRT, and we share a large number of resources in common with our law enforcement partners around the Nation. In making our resources available to other agencies, we will require those agencies to use these resources at a similarly high level of responsibility and accountability.The FBI's management of its Next Generation Identification (NGI) Interstate Photo System (IPS) is a prime example. The NGI System "serves as the FBI's biometric identity and criminal history records system and maintains the fingerprints and associated identity information of individuals submitted to the FBI for authorized criminal justice, national security, and civil purposes."[23] This System features a capability by which over 43 million photos are available for facial recognition searching by law enforcement agencies around the Nation. State, local, tribal, and federal law enforcement can submit and enroll photos of arrestees, based upon probable cause and supported by ten-print fingerprints, into the NGI IPS.[24] These agencies can access the facial recognition search capability that the FBI provides, thereby leveraging the cutting-edge algorithm that the FBI employs but only if they comply with policy regarding use of the system that the FBI requires of its own employees.[25] This includes the requirement that candidate photos serve only as investigative leads, and not as a means of positive identification, as well as the rule that the FBI does not retain any of the probe photos that are searched against the NGI IPS, to ensure that "only those photos collected pursuant to a probable cause standard and positively associated with ten-print fingerprints would be available for searching."[26]In addition, the FBI imposes training requirements in line with national scientific guidelines before users can conduct searches on the System, and requires jurisdictions to meet rigorous technical standards before they can access it. To date, fifteen States, the District of Columbia, and two federal agencies have the technical capability to conduct facial recognition searches on the NGI IPS.[27]All federal law enforcement agencies, including those outside of the Department of Justice, are authorized to enroll and search photos in the NGI IPS for legally authorized purposes. Currently, only two federal entities perform facial recognition searches on the System. Those agencies are the FBI's FACE Services and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP) National Targeting Center (NTC).[28] The NTC accesses the NGI IPS to conduct facial recognition searches using its screening rules to determine on an individualized basis which travelers are reasonably suspected to pose a risk to border security or public safety; who may be a terrorist or suspected terrorist; who may be inadmissible to the United States; or who may otherwise be engaged in illegal activity under federal criminal law.[29] "As with all [NGI IPS] users, the candidate photos returned to the NTC are for lead purposes only, cannot be used for positive identification, and the NTC must perform additional research to resolve the identities of the subjects before taking any action."[30]Overall, like FACE Services' use of FRT, law enforcement use of the NGI IPS System should give the American people confidence. An audit revealed that, from fiscal year 2017 through April 2019, authorized law enforcement users made over 150,000 facial recognition search requests of the NGI IPS repository. "During that time, there [were] no findings of civil liberties violations or evidence of system misuse."[31]Third, the Department will ensure that Facial Recognition Technology is developed and used in a manner that minimizes inaccuracy and unfair biases. Improper discrimination has no place in our society, let alone in our law enforcement function. It is unlikely we can achieve perfection in any endeavor in which imperfect human beings play a role. Perfection is probably unattainable even for machines; after all, "[f]acial recognition, like many AI technologies, typically have some rate of error even when they operate in an unbiased way."[32] But we must do everything in our power to employ mitigation techniques so that any errors or demographic differentials are minimized and addressed. In the FRT context, this effort is already well underway throughout the U.S. government. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), for instance, has developed a number of reports from its Face Recognition Vendor Test Program[33] that focus on issues like the accuracy of vendor-tested facial recognition models. Notably, NIST's work covers demographic differentials. Its most recent report on this topic, published late last year, states:Contemporary face recognition algorithms exhibit demographic differentials of various magnitudes . . . [F]alse positive differentials are much larger than those related to false negatives and exist broadly, across many, but not all, algorithms tested . . . Operational implementations usually employ a single face recognition algorithm. Given algorithm-specific variation, it is incumbent upon the system owner to know their algorithm . . . Since different algorithms perform better or worse in processing images of individuals in various demographics, policy makers, face recognition system developers, and end users should be aware of these differences and use them to make decisions and to improve future performance . . . Reporting of demographic effects often has been incomplete in academic papers and in media coverage. In particular, accuracy is discussed without stating the quantity of interest be it false negatives, false positives or failure to enroll. As most systems are configured with a fixed threshold, it is necessary to report both false negative and false positive rates for each demographic group at that threshold. This is rarely donemost reports are concerned only with false negatives.[34]We have a moral obligation to study demographic differentials in connection with Facial Recognition Technology. We must approach this issue honestly, and with due regard for evidence-based reviews. We in the federal government will continue to ensure that demographic differentials and inaccuracies are constantly being tested, quantified, and mitigated using an evidence-based approach. In fact, it is precisely that approach that led to the progress reflected in the 2018 NIST Face Recognition Vendor Test, in which top algorithms experienced a failure (i.e., a false positive or a false negative match) on NIST-provided data inputs only 0.2% of the time, compared with a 4% failure rate in 2014 an improvement by a factor of 20 in only four years.[35] Through its partnership with NIST, the FBI in 2019 upgraded its NGI IPS algorithm; the selected vendor's facial recognition algorithm performs at an accuracy rate that exceeds 99%.[36] Going forward, the FBI plans, in collaboration with NIST, to test its NGI IPS facial recognition technology annually. Much work remains to be done. But the remarkable progress we have seen in the accuracy of FRT in just a few years is cause for optimism.Fourth, the Department will continue to ensure human involvement in areas where technology is used in a manner that impacts fundamental rights and civil liberties. As I've said, our view is that Facial Recognition Technology assists, but does not replace, the work conducted by our law enforcement investigators and national security personnel. Accordingly, we believe that a human being should be involved before any actions are taken that could deprive a person of his or her civil rights or civil liberties, based on any outputs produced by facial recognition (or any similarly advanced) technology. Of course, the fact that a human is involved is not enough; that person needs to be properly trained, and needs to function within a broader institutional culture where the state serves its citizens rather than the other way around. But human involvement is a prerequisite to any law enforcement or national security use of FRT that claims to advance the cause of freedom.Finally, the Department will prioritize the security and quality of the data it uses in connection with Facial Recognition Technology. The data involved in FRT, especially in the law enforcement context, can be highly sensitive. The FBI imposes strict access requirements to the relevant databases, and complies with all applicable laws and regulations concerning the storage and retention of this data. In addition, it provides a secure transport mechanism for all the criminal history record information and biometric-related information it handles. "Transmission hardware for [the relevant telecommunications infrastructure] is configured by FBI personnel; transmission data to and from [the FBI] is encrypted; and firewalls are mandated and in place."[37] The Department will prioritize securing its face image (and associated) data from unauthorized access. State and local law enforcement partners, as well as commercial firms, should do the same. The American people, too, should be cautious about the products they use, and with whom they share their biometric data. Any mobile applicationeven a free, "fun," seemingly harmless one that entertains youdeveloped in a nation that does not share our rule of law values could be a potential counterintelligence threat, based on the data that the app collects, its privacy and terms of use policies, and the legal mechanisms available to the host nation to access data within its borders. As Americans, we must never forget that our critical AI technologiesas well as our citizens' personal dataare under constant attack from strategic competitors, adversarial nations, and malicious non-state cyber actors.III.Thank you for participating in this important discussion on the future of law enforcement's use of Facial Recognition Technology. There are many complex and important questions that need to be resolved as technology continues rapidly to advance around us. At the U.S. Department of Justice, we firmly believe the best way to answer these questions is through principled action; through an honest evaluation (and constant re-evaluation) of benefits and costs; and through active engagement with impacted stakeholders. Only then can we ensure that the manner in which the government uses technology best serves the American people.[1] See U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, "History of NIJ Support for Face Recognition Technology," Mar. 5, 2020, available at: https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/history-nij-support-face-recognition-technology (last accessed September 12, 2020).[2] For representative U.S. Supreme Court cases, see, e.g., Katz v.

Trump backs proposed deal to keep TikTok operating in USAssociated Press Financial WireSeptember 19, 2020 Saturday 11:40 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 666 wordsByline: STAN CHOE, AP Business WriterDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump said Saturday he's given his “blessing” to a proposed deal that would see the popular video-sharing app TikTok partner with Oracle and Walmart to become a U.S. company.Trump has targeted Chinese-owned TikTok for national security and data privacy concerns. The announcement comes just a day after the Commerce Department announced restrictions that if put in place could eventually make it nearly impossible for TikTok fans to use the app.Trump said if completed the deal would create a new company likely to be based in Texas.“I have given the deal my blessing,” he said. “If they get it done, that’s great. If they don’t, that’s OK too.”Trump said the new company will be hiring at least 25,000 people and making a $5 billion contribution to a fund dedicated to education for Americans. “That’s their contribution that I’ve been asking for,” he said.“We are pleased that the proposal by TikTok, Oracle, and Walmart will resolve the security concerns of the U.S. Administration and settle questions around TikTok’s future in the U.S.,” TikTok said in a statement.TikTok said both Oracle and Walmart will take part in a financing round before an initial public offering of stock, where they can take up to a 20% cumulative stake in the company.The deal will make Oracle responsible for hosting all TikTok's U.S. user data and securing computer systems to ensure U.S. national security requirements are satisfied. TikTok said it's also working with Walmart on a “commercial partnership” but gave no other details.Oracle said in a separate statement that it would take a 12.5% stake in TikTok Global. Representatives for Walmart could not be immediately reached for comment late Saturday.Trump has been demanding that the U.S. operations of TikTok, a video app popular with younger people, be sold to a U.S. company or else be shut down. He's also been targeting WeChat, another Chinese-owned app. The dispute over the two apps is the latest flashpoint in the rising tensions between the world’s two largest economies.Ttrump said the new company — to be known as TikTok Global — “will have nothing to do with China.”Just a day earlier, the U.S. Commerce Department said it would bar TikTok from U.S. app stores as of late Sunday. Further restrictions that would prevent TikTok from accessing essential internet services in the country would go into effect on Nov. 12. Commerce said Saturday that it will delay the barring of TikTok from U.S. app stores until Sept. 27 at 11:59 p.mCommerce is imposing similar restrictions on WeChat, although all of the restrictions on WeChat are set to go into effect Sunday night at 11:59 p.m.Earlier Saturday, WeChat users asked a U.S. judge to block the moves targeting the app, saying they would restrict free speech. WeChat is an all-in-one app with instant-messaging, social media and other communication tools. The U.S. government argued that it is not restricting free speech because WeChat users still “are free to speak on alternative platforms that do not pose a national security threat.”The aggressive tactics are part of Trump’s latest attempt to counter the influence of China, a rising economic superpower. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.China-backed hackers, meanwhile, have been blamed for data breaches of U.S. federal databases and the credit agency Equifax, and the Chinese government strictly limits what U.S. tech companies can do in China.China’s ministry of commerce condemned the U.S. moves and urged it to stop what it called bullying behavior. It also said China may take “necessary measures” to protect Chinese companies.The U.S. Treasury Department said that TikTok's deal with Oracle and Walmart also still needs documentation and conditions to be approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.Load-Date: September 19, 2020End of Document

Oracle stays with TikTok's U.S. operationsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 14, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 334 wordsBodyThe Chinese company ByteDance reached an agreement with US-based Oracle Corp. to take over TikTok's U.S.operations,after rejecting Microsoft's offer and less than a week before President Donald Trump's deadline for the popular app to go into the hands of a national company or banned in the country.According to the Bloomberg agency, which cited sources familiar with the transaction, the deal is not a direct sale but resembles a corporate restructuring,so not all the way is paved for the Chinese company as it will remain to see if the Trump administration accepts it.Observers believe this possible because of good relations between the Republican representative and the Oracle owner. In fact, the tycoon seeking his re-election advocated, in recent weeks, a deal with that company and not with Microsoft as originally urged.In principle, the agreement between the two companies includes the U.S. becoming TikTok's technology partner and the app's user data being stored in the Oracle cloud, Bloomberg published.Security around U.S. user data is the argument the Trump administration used to launch its ultimatum against the Chinese company, which it accuses of providing that information to the Beijing authorities, something ByteDance and the Chinese government itself categorically reject.The forced sale of TikTok in the United States became the last major episode of deteriorating relations between Washington and Beijing. And any agreement for his requisition requires not only the approval of Trump's executive, but also China's, because of his policies on intellectual property and technology companies.On Monday, the Chinese government declined to comment on the possibility of an alliance between ByteDance and Oracle."China spoke many times of its position on TikTok. The United States is now surrounding TikTok. This is a typical coerced transaction by the government," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin.Oracle shares rose 17% at the start of trading on Monday, Bloomberg reported.Load-Date: September 15, 2020End of Document

Oracle Wins Bid for TikTok Following Executive OrderThe Whit: Rowan UniversitySeptember 16, 2020 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 922 wordsByline: Luke GarciaBodyTikTok logo / Photo by play.google.comIt was announced on Sunday that Oracle Corporation won the bidding for the U.S. operations of the video sharing app, TikTok. This does not mean that Oracle will have majority ownership of the app, but they will have control of TikTok in America which includes over 100 million users.The rushed sale was prompted by an executive order signed by President Donald Trump stating that TikTok had to sell its U.S. operations to an American company before September 20 or the app would be blocked in the U.S. TikTok was seen as a security threat to the U.S. because of the way that it stores user information along with the parent company of the app, ByteDance, being a Chinese company.The official White House website addressed the "threat" of TikTok and the executive order. Here is an excerpt of theirexplanation of why they believe it may be unsafe for Americans to use the Chinese video-sharing app: TikTok automatically captures vast swaths of information from its users, including Internet and other network activity information such as location data and browsing and search histories. This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information - potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.The sudden concern for cyber safety by Trump really put ByteDance backed up against a wall. By having to sell U.S. operations before September 20, they were forced to look quickly for a buyer and did not have quite the leverage in the deal that they would have wanted. The way ByteDance chose their buyer also raises questions about their intentions.Last month, the Chinese government issued new regulations that would prohibit TikTok from selling its technology to a foreign company without their explicit permission. They did this by updating the list of technologies that they have the power to veto from being sold to a foreign country. This list now includes data processing and speech and text recognition, which are used for the TikTok app.The timing of these new regulations have sparked speculation that the Chinese government might not have been thrilled with the idea of Microsoft obtaining the coveted computer code which would give Microsoft the power to decide what videos are seen by the 100 million U.S. users, among other functions.Microsoft, who is in the consumer technology industry with products like Xbox, was seen by many industry experts as the most likely buyer of TikTok. There is no question that they have the money, resources and power to clean up any security risks that TikTok may have posed. However, Microsoft made their initial offer, which was rejected, and was never asked to make another. After the somewhat surprising deal struck by Oracle, Microsoft had this to say in astatement: We would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combating disinformation.Oracle is known for making software designed for businesses, not consumers. This leaves some experts scratching their heads at this move. According toUSA Today, Jefferies Analyst Brent Thill believes Oracle's interest in TikTok is questionable to say the least. He stated that it "does not fit with the rest of the company." He went on to compare it to "Delta Airlines buying a motorcycle company."Unlike the other big tech executives, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison is a massive public supporter of President Donald Trump. He was reportedly the first person to recommend Hydroxychloroquine to Trump as a drug to treat COVID-19, despite a lack of scientific proof that it is effective against the virus. Back in February, he even went as far as to host a fundraiser for Trump at his ranch in California.Trump has said that Oracle "could handle" buying TikTok and that they are a "great company" but when asked to state his preference between Oracle and Microsoft as buyers he declined to answer. This relationship between Trump and Ellison begs the question of if the executive order was implemented to assist Ellison and his company in acquiring TikTok's U.S. operations.Although, by placing the executive order, Trump's intentions to eliminate any security risk with the app seem reasonable, since over 100 million Americans use TikTok (and that number is growing fast). It just seems like a peculiar coincidence that he placed this executive order, forcing an American tech company to run TikTok or else the country is not allowed to use it, and then it ends up in the hands of one of his corporate buddies.This sale changes the tech landscape in the U.S. Microsoft being pushed to the side is not something that they are used to. It is especially confounding since Oracle is not in the consumer tech business whatsoever. The deal certainly raises as many questions as it answers.Whether the Chinese and American governments influenced this deal or not, Oracle ended up as the winner here and they now have control of the hottest video-sharing/social media app on the planet. TikTok has the extraordinary capability to jump-start the careers of many "influencers" into the entertainment industry. The app spreads popular content like wildfire causing the simplest of videos to go viral and boost teenagers and young adults into stardom.For questions/comments about this story, email arts@thewhitonline.com or tweet@TheWhitOnline.Load-Date: September 16, 2020End of Document

Facebook takes down accounts it says were run from China and posting about 2020 electionCNN.comSeptember 22, 2020 Tuesday 3:29 PM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHLength: 392 wordsByline: By Donie O'Sullivan, CNN BusinessDateline: New York BodyFacebook on Tuesday said it had shut down more than 150 fake accounts it determined were run from China, including accounts posting about November's US presidential election.The accounts "posted content both in support of and against presidential candidates Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden and Donald Trump," Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of security policy, wrote in a post on the company's website.Graphika, a social media analytics company commissioned by Facebook to study the network of accounts, wrote in its report Tuesday, "In 2019-2020, the operation began running accounts that posed as Americans and posted a small amount of content about the US presidential election. Different assets supported President Donald Trump and his rival Joe Biden; one short-lived group supported former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg. The operation did not single out either candidate for preferential treatment. Many of the accounts in this phase of the operation were barely active."Facebook did not say if the accounts were tied to the Chinese government, only that the accounts were run from China's Fujian province. The company did point out, however, that the accounts had been posting about "Beijing's interests in the South China Sea."Graphika said accounts in the network had defended Beijing.Gleicher stressed that most of the activity focused on South East Asia and only a very small amount of activity focused on the 2020 election.However, there was a sense of urgency in Facebook's announcement Tuesday.The company normally discloses takedowns like this once a month ? the next announcement is not due for another week or two.Gleicher told reporters Tuesday that given the nature of the company's findings "we thought that it was important that people should be aware of what we are seeing."Ben Nimmo, head of investigations at Graphika told CNN, "The US-focused content was the least and last part of the operation. It ran one group each to support President Trump, Vice President Biden and Pete Buttigieg; all together, they had under 2,000 members.

TikTok, at the heart of the technological pulse between Beijing and WashingtonCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 5, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1115 wordsBodyTikTok has become a fighter at the center of the rivalry between the two world powers: the United States pulls one arm, China from the other. Last week, a court ruling froze the Trump Administration's veto with just a few hours to go. The Party, meanwhile, has restricted the export of some of the app's key technologies to reserve the last word. Too many details of the operation between TikTok and its hypothetical partners, Oracle and Walmart, remain a mystery. The pursuit of this utopian agreement that satisfies all parties continues. Toys that spark fights, it's well known, rarely end whole.Washington had resolved that the sanction, formulated ambiguously, would take the form of a mandatory withdrawal of TikTok from Apple and Google's official mobile app platforms. The competent federal judge, however, called this maneuver "largely a unilateral decision with very little opportunity to listen to the plaintiffs." This opinion is the second procedural setback. The previous weekend, another judge cited the First Amendment – which protects freedom of expression – to paralyze the blockade of Wechat, China's second-threatened app.Events have continued to take speed since Trump signed the original executive order on August 6, banning "any transaction with ByteDance [TikTok's parent company]," which would initially take effect on September 15. On 14 August, however, he amended the edict; granting 90 days for the Chinese organization to sell or fragment its U.S. operations. This deadline, which expired on September 20, was postponed to 27 when the US president granted his approval to the agreement with Oracle and Walmart, an operation whose consequences vary depending on the interlocutor.According to ByteDance, the agreement would entail the creation of a new U.S.-based entity, named TikTok Global, of which Oracle and Walmart would own 12.5 and 7.5% respectively. This is a common formula for some of the Asian giant's companies listed on the country's financial markets. The sum of both percentages, albeit minority, would allow the White House to place the message that TikTok would be under U.S. control within its borders, one of the conditions imposed by the executive order, given that 40% of ByteDance belongs in turn to American shareholders. ByteDance would own the remaining 80% of the new entity, which it referred to in a recent statement as a "100% subsidiary subsidiary". Oracle Executive Vice President Ken Glueck said instead that the Chinese house would "not control TikTok Global."The line of disagreement runs from secondary issues, such as the composition of the board of directors, to the core of the puzzle: access to technology. ByteDance claimed in its text that "the current plan does not involve any algorithm transfer". According to Oracle and Walmart, however, "all TikTok technology will be available for TikTok Global". In the fight for technology control lies the heart of the issue. Last week Trump threatened that "if we find that [Oracle and Walmart] do not have full control, then we will not approve the agreement."Beijing, for its part, has interfered with the operation to impose its own limits. Late last August, the Ministry of Commerce expanded the list of "sensitive technologies" to include two components of the TikTok algorithm. This means that, from now on, ByteDance will need explicit permission from the authorities before closing any transactions.The list had not been updated in the last twelve years. It follows from this move that China will block any agreement in which TikTok's source code ceases to be a secret. As hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post declared a source close to negotiations, "the car can be sold, but the engine can't."ByteDance's reaction was to issue a statement suring that it will "scrupulously comply" with the new regulation. Or what is the same: that the company would voluntarily give up its business in the U.S. without contravening the Party's designs. This announcement, interestingly, is a true reflection of the concern that prompted the process in the first instance: doubts about ByteDance's lack of independence from the Chinese government and the legal inability to refuse its requirements, affecting both the security of its users' data and content policy.The country's legal framework fuels suspicion. The national intelligence law, for example, was revised in 2017 to demand the support and collaboration of "every organization or citizen." In the case of Zhang Yiming, founder and head of ByteDance, you don't have to look too hard to find an explicit commitment to his handwriting. When in April 2018 the Chinese authorities closed Neihuan Duanzi, another of its platforms, Zhang issued a letter apologizing, accepting that the app was "unbalanced with fundamental socialist values" and maintained a "weak" implementation of Xi Jinping's Thought, so he promised that his organization would "continue to deepen cooperation" with the Party.This high-tech, authoritarianism union is of concern in the U.S. No one expressed it more clearly or hyperbolically than Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union between 2018 and 2020. "If someone at the Politburo in Beijing picks up the phone and says "I want to hear such a conversation, I want to get a car that's connected to the 5G network off the road and kill their driver," there's nothing the company can legally do in China to prevent it," he said in February last year. "[That's why] We want to keep critical infrastructure in the West out of China's evil influence."In the event that everything is twisted, the Party has already prepared a counterattack. Last week the government rekindle the threat launched a year ago to develop its own "list of unreliable companies," which would include U.S. firms to which it would apply sanctions, mimicking state department proceedings with Huawei and ZTE. "Beijing has been reluctant to retaliate against U.S. companies for fear of scaring foreign investment, and is unlikely to want to aggravate ties before the election result is clear," said Dan Wang, Technology Analyst for Consulting Firm Gavekal in a recent report."Perhaps the most dangerous outcome would be if Trump lost and decided to use his remaining 11 weeks in office to sign even more executive orders to Chinese companies. His team's falcons, such as Mike Pompeo and Peter Navarro, would probably see these measures as their last chance to restart the relationship with China," the expert concluded. TikTok was the one who was most at hand, but in the room there are many other dolls.You can follow THE COUNTRY RETINA TECHNOLOGY on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or subscribe here to our Newsletter.Load-Date: October 6, 2020End of Document

TikTok owner asks USA court to temporarily block Trump banStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 24, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 459 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyAlthough U.S. Companies will have part ownership of TikTok, China's ByteDance would still have about 80 percent of the shares.TikTok logos are seen on smartphones in front of a displayed ByteDance logo in this illustration taken November 27, 2019.TikTok's working deal with USA tech giant Oracle to avoid a ban in the United States could soon be in tatters because of Chinese opposition, so the Beijing-owned video-sharing network has turned to form relationships with major American social media platforms.TikTok is now owned by Chinese internet giant ByteDance, which is being forced by the Trump administration - citing national security concerns - to sell its United States operations.The administration has offered no specifics to substantiate that charge.Since then, TikTok has been working to make a deal with an American company that would allow it to keep operating in the United States.Chargers Team Doctor Punctured QB Tyrod Taylor's Lung Before Chiefs GameTaylor was taken to the hospital due to difficulties breathing after Lynn said he had a reaction to an injection. Taylor is in his 10th season in the National Football League and second with the Chargers.If a deal is clinched, a five-person board at TikTok Global - set to include Walmart's CEO, three USA -based ByteDance investors, and ByteDance founder and CEO Zhang Yiming - would vote on the direction and size of the education fund. But he also said he could retract his approval if Oracle doesn't "have total control".TikTok's request marks the latest development in a turbulent stretch of deal negotiations that has exposed rifts between Chinese and U.S. parties to the proposed restructuring. ByteDance is now seeking a valuation of $60 billion for TikTok Global in which ByteDance may end up owning as much as 80 percent after investments from Oracle and Walmart.Chinese media have criticised the deal, suggesting that the Chinese government is not happy with the arrangement. The Chinese government can force tech companies to hand over user data, leading to concerns that TikTok could be made to. Furthermore, according to Fox Business Trump said, this deal could open up 25,000 new jobs for people in Texas. "The Commerce Department said Friday that it would start banning USA transactions with TikTok starting on Sunday, but Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross Jr. later clarified that 'the basic TikTok will stay intact until November 12th".The app, a relative newcomer to the social media landscape, has had fewer instances of wrestling publicly with the persistent content moderation scandals that have dogged larger and more entrenched competitors like Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc.ByteDance and the commerce ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Load-Date: September 24, 2020End of Document

Northeastern University: TikTok Won't Be Banned From U.S. App Stores. Here's WhyTargeted News ServiceSeptember 23, 2020 Wednesday 9:41 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 637 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BOSTON, Massachusetts BodyNortheastern University issued the following news:Dance tutorials, arts and crafts, food, dogs.Anyone scrolling through TikTok can see that the widely popular video-sharing app is, at the very least, incredibly entertaining. Addicting? Maybe. A questionable use of time? Perhaps.But is it an enormous threat to national security as the Trump administration claims in its proposal to ban the app in the United States? Not likely, says David Choffnes, associate professor of computer sciences.For the average American user, the Chinese-owned TikTok app doesn't pose a national security threat any more than our beloved Facebook or Twitter, he says."There are some risks for sure," Choffnes says. "TikTok could be collecting your location data, and they could potentially be forced to hand that information over to the Chinese government, even if they don't want to."But unless you are, for example, a member of the military using TikTok on a classified base, then the stakes of the Chinese government knowing your location via TikTok are very low.The ban on new downloads of TikTok, which was supposed to go into effect on Sunday, has been postponed until Sept. 27, a date that will likely be extended unless, in the meantime, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, can negotiate a deal with an American company to host the app's data in the U.S.As of Wednesday, Oracle and Walmart were working on a partnership with ByteDance to create a spinoff company, TikTok Global.Oracle would hold a 12.5 percent stake in the new company and serve as the cloud hosting provider for the new entity. Walmart would hold a 7.5 percent stake in the company, with ByteDance owning the remaining 80 percent.TikTok will most likely not be taken out of app stores in the U.S. because the companies that would be affected, such as Apple and Google, would either compromise with the U.S. government or challenge it in court.A company like ByteDance could, hypothetically, inject code into TikTok that could prove harmful to U.S. national security."The app stores do reviews to look for that kind of malicious code," Choffnes says. "They can't catch everything. But generally speaking, it's hard to mount such an attack without detection," especially in an app as popular and closely monitored as TikTok.Plus, even if new downloads of the app were banned in the U.S., in most cases, no one except the user themselves can uninstall the app from their phone if they already have it. This makes things complicated for network providers--would these companies be breaking the law for allowing users to access the app if they already have it?"It's one thing to take it out of the app store. But when I start seeing network-level controls, that's the opposite of an open internet," Choffnes says. "It's a slippery slope that takes us down a path other countries have taken that we prefer not to be compared to, like widespread censorship in China."He adds that the deal, which is still being disputed, seems more like a political move by the Trump administration than an attempt to protect people in the U.S. from a national security threat.It also isn't an attempt to protect individuals' privacy. "In this proposal, the argument isn't being made for consumer protection where we actually see the greatest risk," he says. And TikTok is only a small piece of a much larger problem when it comes to consumer protection."The Chinese government doesn't need TikTok to figure out that I'm at home right now," he says. "They can just buy that data from a data broker. That's how much information is already out there."This kind of thing is pretty scary as someone who works on privacy and consumer protection, and also net neutrality and internet freedom," Choffnes says. "There's a whole lot of wrong here."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7247551 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 27, 2020End of Document

With Microsoft discarded, the game about TikTok's future in the US is oversteerCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 14, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 609 wordsBodyTikTok will not be left to Microsoft, after ByteDance, the Chinese owner of the video app, rejected a purchase offer from the US giant, which oversteers the future of the app in the United States.Californian giant Oracle appears well positioned to reach some kind of collaboration agreement with TikTok, although this would not include a sale, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cites sources close to the research."ByteDance let us know today that it will not sell TikTok's U.S. operations to Microsoft. We are convinced that our proposal would have been good for TikTok users, while protecting the interests of national security," Microsoft said in a statement Sunday night.The U.S. group had indicated in early August their interest in buying TikTok's U.S. operations, which is under threat of being officially banned in the country.President Donald Trump, who has been accusing the popular social network of alleged espionage for months for the benefit of China, signed decrees to force ByteDance to quickly sell TikTok's activities on American soil.Trump also demanded that a significant portion of any eventual transaction go to the U.S. Treasury, sparking a cascade of criticism.If a buy-sell agreement is not reached before September 20, the platform must close in the United States.The implementation filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government against that measure."We would have made significant changes to ensure that the service met the highest standards for security, respect for private life, and anti-misinformation," Microsoft said.In late August, the Walmart store group confirmed that it had partnered with Microsoft in negotiations to acquire the platform on which short videos are shared, usually humorous or musical.The alliance of the two American giants was, however, not enough.- Chinese limitation -"We thought Microsoft wanted to buy TikTok only with its main algorithm, a condition in which the Chinese government and ByteDance did not want to give in," Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securites, said in a note."And faced with the need to get the green light from Beijing following changes in export rules a few weeks ago, TikTok's days in the United States may be numbered," he continued.In late August, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce amended its list of technologies with export limitations or prohibitions, which now includes artificial intelligence technologies such as those that have made TikTok successful, which shows videos to users more based on their tastes than their contacts.According to The Wall Street Journal, Oracle is about to be designated TikTok's "technology partner" in the United States. A direct sale is not contemplated at the moment, according to the sources cited by the US newspaper.On his side, Chinese state media said on Monday that ByteDance would not sell TikTok to Oracle. The CGTN television channel and the China News Service press agency did not specify the sources of this statement.Oracle and TikTok did not respond to AFP inquiries.In August, the app surpassed 2 billion downloads worldwide and claims to be present in more than 200 countries. In the United States, the social network claims to have 100 million monthly users.Washington has also accused other Chinese technology companies, such as Huawei, of passing information and working in accordance with the interests of the Chinese Communist Party.The War for TikTokit comes as part of a broader deterioration in relations between the world's two major economies for months, with the United States and China launching harsh recriminations in the commercial, human rights or coronavirus pandemic.dho/roc/lda/llu-mar/zmLoad-Date: September 15, 2020End of Document

Ironically, the Op-ed called for more positive relations between our two countries and asked to "build relationships through unrestricted engagement and uncensored discussion."

I have to see the deal,” Trump told White House reporters Wednesday evening about Oracle's interest in TikTok.Some in the U.S. have raised concerns about the deal, fearing that ByteDance Ltd., the Chinese company that owns TikTok, would maintain access to information on the 100 million TikTok users in the United States.“It has to be 100% as far as national security is concerned," Trump said.The president previously said that he would ban TikTok if it wasn't sold to an American company. In an Aug. 6 order, Trump said TikTok “reportedly censors content that the Chinese Communist Party deems politically sensitive,” is potentially a source for disinformation campaigns and “threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans’ personal and proprietary information.”TikTok maintains that it has not shared U.S. user data with the Chinese government and would not do so, says it does not censor videos at the request of Chinese authorities and notes that moderators for U.S. operations are led by a U.S. team.Trump said he was stunned to learn that the Treasury could not receive any payment in exchange for the U.S. signing off on the deal.“Amazingly, I find that you’re not allowed to do that,” Trump said. “If they’re willing to make big payments to the government they’re not allowed because ... there’s no legal path to doing that. ... How foolish can we (the United States) be?"TikTok, which says it has 100 million users in the U.S. and 700 million globally, is known for fun, goofy videos of dancing, lip-syncing, pranks and jokes. It’s also home to more political material, some of which is critical of Trump.The Oracle arrangement, according to a person familiar with the matter who isn’t authorized to speak publicly, entrusts TikTok’s U.S. user data to Oracle, which would oversee technical operations for TikTok in the U.S. Oracle won’t develop code for the app, but will review it and updates to it.Not all Republicans are on board with the Oracle deal. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, a frequent critic of both China and the tech sector, called for the government to reject the Oracle partnership and instead pursue a full sale of TikTok in the U.S. or ban the app.“An ongoing ‘partnership’ that allows for anything other than the full emancipation of the TikTok software from potential Chinese Communist Party control is completely unacceptable, and flatly inconsistent with the President’s Executive Order of Aug. 6,” he wrote on Tuesday.A group of six other Republican senators led by Marco Rubio of Florida on Wednesday sent a letter to the president expressing reservations about the partnership agreement with Oracle, saying that it appears to have “significant unresolved national security issues” and that a deal “must ensure that TikTok’s U.S. operations, data and algorithms are entirely outside the control of ByteDance or any Chinese-state directed actors.”A Trump executive order has set a Sept. 20 deadline, although it isn’t clear what will happen on that day. TikTok has sued to stop the ban, which also affects a separately owned Chinese messaging app, WeChat, which is used by several million in the U.S.Load-Date: September 16, 2020End of Document

PUBG ditches Tencent to avoid India's ban on Chinese appsCNN WireSeptember 8, 2020 Tuesday 12:37 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 408 wordsDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  The developer of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds has cut ties with Tencent in India in a bid to skirt a government ban on Chinese mobile apps in one of the video game's most lucrative markets.PUBG Corporation said in a statement on Tuesday that Tencent Games in India will no longer be authorized to publish the mobile version of its PUBG franchise. The South Korean gaming company said it will take on all publishing responsibilities itself within the country, where PUBG was the biggest grossing mobile game last month.The decision comes after the Indian government said last week that it would block 118 apps in the country, which it claimed threatened national security. The list included two PUBG mobile apps, as well as Chinese search giant Baidu and Alipay, the mobile payment app from Ant Group, the financial affiliate of Jack Ma's Alibaba."PUBG Corporation fully understands and respects the measures taken by the government as the privacy and security of player data is a top priority for the company," it said in a statement. "It hopes to work hand-in-hand with the Indian government to find a solution that will allow gamers to once again drop into the battlegrounds while being fully compliant with Indian laws and regulations."PUBG was the top mobile game by monthly active users in India last year, according to analytics firm AppAnnie. In the first half of this year, it was downloaded more than 54 million times, analytics firm Sensor Tower told CNN Business. Last month, it generated $2.2 million in revenue, earning the most among India's top 20 mobile games.The news will come as a blow to Tencent, which has already had its popular messaging app WeChat banned in India. It is also contending with a possible WeChat ban in the United States. Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment on PUBG's announcement.India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has now banned nearly 200 mobile apps originating from China, according to Gateway House, a foreign policy think tank in Mumbai. It June it banned the short-form video app TikTok, which is owned by ByteDance.The ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether PUBG's actions will give Indian fans access to the mobile version of the game again.--- Sherisse Pham, Julia Horowitz and Swati Gupta contributed reporting.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

TikTok will not be sold to Microsoft, Oracle now has via freeCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 14, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 576 wordsBodyMicrosoft said this Sunday that its offer to purchase the activities of the TikTok video app in the United States was rejected by ByteDance, the Chinese owner of the platform, leaving the road open to Californian giant Oracle to reach an agreement.According to The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, which cite near-negotiating sources, Oracle won the bidding battle, although the company did not immediately confirm this result to the AFP."ByteDance let us know today that it will not sell TikTok's U.S. operations to Microsoft. We are convinced that our proposal would have been good for TikTok users, while protecting the interests of national security," Microsoft said in a statement Sunday night.The U.S. group had indicated in early August their interest in buying TikTok's U.S. operations, which is under threat of being officially banned in the country.President Donald Trump, who has been accusing the popular social network of alleged espionage for months for the benefit of China, signed decrees to force ByteDance to quickly sell TikTok's activities on American soil.Trump also demanded that a significant portion of any eventual transaction go to the U.S. Treasury, sparking a cascade of criticism.If a buy-sell agreement is not reached before September 20, the platform must close in the United States.The implementation filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government against that measure."We would have made significant changes to ensure that the service met the highest standards for security, respect for private life, and anti-misinformation," Microsoft said.In late August, the Walmart store group confirmed that it had partnered with Microsoft in negotiations to acquire the platform on which short videos are shared, usually humorous or musical.The alliance of the two American giants was, however, not enough.- Chinese limitation -"We thought Microsoft wanted to buy TikTok only with its main algorithm, a condition in which the Chinese government and ByteDance did not want to give in," Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securites, said in a note."And faced with the need to get the green light from Beijing following changes in export rules a few weeks ago, TikTok's days in the United States may be numbered," he continued.In late August, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce amended its list of technologies with export limitations or prohibitions, which now includes artificial intelligence technologies such as those that have made TikTok successful, which shows videos to users more based on their tastes than their contacts.According to Ives, even if an agreement was reached between Oracle and TikTok, it is unlikely that it foresees a purchase of the Chinese social network or a transfer of its activities in the United States."Oracle could be a technology partner," the expert added.In August, the app surpassed 2 billion downloads worldwide and claims to be present in more than 200 countries. In the United States, the social network claims to have 100 million monthly users.Washington has also accused other Chinese technology companies, such as Huawei, of passing information and working in accordance with the interests of the Chinese Communist Party.The war over TikTok comes as part of a broader deterioration in relations between the two major world economies for months, with the United States and China launching harsh recriminations in the commercial, human rights or pandemic of theCoronavirus.dho/roc/lda/lluLoad-Date: September 15, 2020End of Document

The third calendar quarter ends on Sept. 30.All 11 sectors of the Standard & Poor's 500 ended lower, and just four companies on the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained ground in the session.Tech shares dropped 1.7% after the Trump administration said it would prohibit transactions relating to mobile apps WeChat and TikTok, effective Sunday. The administration has said the apps pose national security threats, which the makers of the apps deny. Tencent Music (TME) which is owned by WeChat's parent company, fell 1.2%. Oracle (ORCL) slipped 0.7% with questions over the viability of the software giant's potential deal with ByteDance for the TikTok's US operations.Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a note Friday that a deal is still likely to be reached. "The broader worry is that if a deal is not reached over the next 48 hours with approval by the Chinese government around source code access and majority ownership, this shutdown move could be a Fort Sumter moment in the US/China cold tech war tensions with retaliation on the horizon," he said.Apple (AAPL) fell 3.2%, and Microsoft (MSFT) retreated 1.2%.Materials lost almost 1.8%, pulled lower by Westrock's (WRK) 3.8% fall and PPG's (PPG) 2.7% slide. Newmont (NEM) fell 2.4%.Consumer discretionary shares fell 1.5%.

OPENING STATEMENT BY DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR BONNIE GLICK FOR PANEL DISCUSSION AT THE INDO-PACIFIC BUSINESS FORUMStates News ServiceOctober 27, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1069 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID):Tuesday, October 27, 2020Challenges and Opportunities in the Indo-Pacific Digital Economy[As prepared]Thank you, Todd, I'm delighted to be here.And thank you, Under Secretary Krach, for beginning our conversation today by emphasizing the importance of trust in digital networks. This issue and other opportunities and challenges relating to the digital economy are critical to the Indo-Pacific regionand for USAID's work there.Though the Indo-Pacific is the world's fastest-growing region for digital infrastructure, from storage to transmision, we know that there are many opportunities to improve access and affordability.We are taking an active interest in how the digital economy will serve and shape the region.We want it to serve the long-term interests of each of the nations that invest in it.And we recognize that so much of the investment in the digital economy is yet to occur.The Asian Development Bank estimates that developing nations in the region need to invest $2.3 trillion by 2030 in telecommunications alone just to keep up with current demand.Within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, between 40 and 50 percent of the population is not connected to the Internet. That represents a tremendous challenge.And, USAID is calling on our experience and relationships in the region to build a comprehensive and effective strategy for digital investments.We see the adoption and expansion of open, inclusive, and secure digital networks as a priority in our work to advance prosperity and promote resilient, democratic societies.In fact, I just got back from a very productive trip yesterday with Under Secretary Krach where we focused specifically on this topic. I was in Estonia, Finland, and the United Arab Emirates talking to their leaders in government and the private sector about the critical importance of secure supply chains, telecommunications, and 5G. So many regions around the world have realized that digital security is keyand we welcome the Indo-Pacific with open arms as the region begins to join us in this transformation.Consider the potential impact of 5G mobile networks. Think what these networks will mean for greater security and speed in multiple fields of endeavour, including the development of payments systems or for vital services like education and telemedicine.Advanced digital infrastructure is a game-changer, and we want the Indo-Pacific region to benefit fully from it.But for that to happen, we will need to move forward in a coherent and cooperative way.That is one reason USAID launched our first-ever Digital Strategy back in April. We recognized the need for public-private cooperation and co-investment in the digital economy.Part of our focus is on the gender digital divide. In too many places around the world, women don't enjoy the same access to technology and the digital economy as men. And when they do have access, we need to ensure their safety and security.As with everything else, when women have access and are empowered, they can put their skills and energy to use.This has been an area of focus for USAID for quite some time. In fact, at this same forum last year, we announced the launch of our Digital Asia Accelerator based in Bangkok. These programs offer digital safety awareness and cybersecurity skills training throughout the region. We do not want to see digital haves and have-nots, and we want everyone to understand the rules of the road in the digital economy.Governments and the private sector should work together on these issues. The more we involve civil society and private firms in security and accountability in digital networks, the better off economies will be.We are also advocates for the American model of digital innovation.That model favors openness, reliability, security, and constant improvement. It is not driven by the needs of any given government or state actor.Of course, we recognize that there is competition in this regard. Andas Under Secretary Krach outlined a few minutes agoit is important to address the attempts by the Chinese government to dominate the digital economy through 5G technology.The Chinese effort is anchored by state-controlled entities. These entities are offering equipment and systems that the Chinese Communist Party ultimately controls.If a nation anchors its 5G network with Chinese technology, they are, in effect, giving their citizens' and governments' over to tools of Beijing's surveillance state.It's one of the many reasons President Trump is leading a global campaign to stop the spread of untrusted network equipment around the world.But it's not enough to say "don't buy from China." We have to offer our own approachand we do.For example, across the Pacific Islands, USAID is gearing up to expand access to secure digital infrastructure in places that are far from population centers and hard to reach. These include some of the remote atolls and islands that don't currently have Internet access.In 2020, there is no reason for these nations and islands to be cut off from the digital economy. With our help and that of our partners, these nations will be fully integrated and have the internet access that will help their people to thrive.For instance, the Republic of Palau has expressed an aspiration to be connected to a second undersea fiber optic cable to ensure reliable, secure digital connectivity. We call this "fiber redundancy."Secretary of State Michael Pompeo announced the U.S. Government's commitment, alongside Australia and Japan under the Trilateral Partnership for Infrastructure Development, to fund Palau's need to build this new cable connection. USAID is pleased to be leading the U.S. Government's efforts to move this project forwardit will enable Palau to strengthen its digital connectivity and thus advance efforts to achieve integral economic and human development.The global digital infrastructure is changing rapidly, and the pitfalls and opportunities it presents have never been more consequential. I am encouraged by the attention that friends and partners in the Indo-Pacific region and around the world are giving to this issue. Together, we can ensure the widespread, equitable, and safe proliferation of these vital new technologies.I look forward to our discussion of these issues, and any questions you may have.Thank you.Load-Date: October 29, 2020End of Document

All rights reserved.This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.Length: 1428 wordsBodyStory Stocks (R)Updated: 14-Sep-20Quotes at time of story, top stories today: 12:14 | 10:36 | 10:1112:14 ETPfizer and vaccine development partner BioNTech moving closer to the goal line:In a busy morning that featured two blockbuster M&A deals (NVDA/Arm Holdings and GILD/IMMU) and a partnership between Oracle (ORCL) and TikTok, encouraging vaccine news from Pfizer (PFE) and AstraZeneca (AZN) is also being singled out for today's bullish stock market action.Specifically, Pfizer's (PFE) CEO, Albert Bourla, commented during an interview on "Face the Nation" that the company should have enough data by the end of October to know whether the company's vaccine, BNT162b2, is safe and effective.This revelation doesn't necessarily qualify as "new news", however.On September 3, the company disclosed that it expects clarity on the efficacy of its vaccine in October. Therefore, Mr. Bourla's announcement is more of a reaffirmation that clinical trial progress and the timeline for possible approval remain on track.On a related note, PFE and its development partner BioNTech (BNTX) also announced that the companies are looking to expand enrollment in the phase three trial to 44,000 volunteers from the original plan of 30,000. The primary reason for adding more people is to diversify trial populations to include younger participants, as well as more people with special conditions like HIV or Hepatitis C.The main takeaway from the pair of announcements is that the PFE/BNTX team remains in position to have a vaccine ready for mass production by the end of this year. In fact, the companies are already producing hundreds of thousands of doses, in the event that the FDA eventually approves the vaccine.Over the past couple of months, PFE/BNTX has secured agreements to potentially supply doses to various governments, including the U.S. (up to 600 mln doses), Japan (120 mln doses), and the EU (up to 300 mln doses).While PFE/BNTX hasn't encountered any speed bumps along the way, the same can't be said for the AstraZeneca (AZN)/Oxford University team. On September 9, AZN reported that their phase 3 trial was voluntarily put on hold due to a suspected serious adverse reaction. The company said that the pause was a voluntary decision and that the delay was a "routine action."Information about the volunteer's health has been very scarce, but AZN's commentary suggested that a more widespread safety concern wasn't evident. That assessment came to fruition today after the company announced that it has resumed its COVID-19 vaccine trials.When combined with PFE/BNTX's positive update, the resumption of AZN's clinical trial helped construct a bullish tone for the market today.10:36 ETNVIDIA announces largest deal ever as it aims to acquire Arm from Softbank:There is some big M&A action in the semiconductor space today as Nvidia (NVDA +7%) announced a deal to acquire Arm Limited from Softbank for $40 bln in cash and stock. SoftBank will get an ownership stake in NVIDIA, expected to be under 10%. At first, this may seem like an odd combination but it makes sense when one digs into it.NVDA is known for making graphics chips for videogames, but it's real sweet spot is its data center chips. Its data center segment is seeing booming demand and the recent shift to at-home work/learning is fueling this segment even more. NVDA is also very involved in artificial intelligence (AI) and automation applications.Arm Holdings is a bit different. Arm is not a manufacturing company. It's more of a neutral designer of chips and it licenses its technology to a wide variety of semiconductor companies who then build chips using Arm's designs. Arm's technologies are used in everything from sensors to smartphones to supercomputers. The company's designs power roughly 90% of all smartphones.The combination brings together NVDA's AI computing platform with the vast ecosystem of Arm's CPU. NVDA says the combination will turbocharge Arm's R&D capacity and expand Arm's IP portfolio with NVDA's GPU and AI technology. In the years ahead, trillions of computers running AI will create a new internet-of-things that is thousands of times larger than today's internet-of-people, according to NVDA.There could be some troubles ahead.Arm is known as a neutral provider of technology and Arm's current licensees may not be too thrilled with a competitor owning Arm. NVDA counters this by saying Arm will continue to operate its open-licensing model, it will maintain its customer neutrality and Arm will maintain its name while continuing to be based in the UK. However, this could cause some uneasiness going forward. This deal could face regulatory hurdles as both the US and China will need to sign off on the transaction. With US-China tensions running high and with the US recently blocking Broadcom's (AVGO) bid for Qualcomm (QCOM), China may not approve the deal.Based on the stock reaction today, it's clear that NVDA shareholders are excited about this deal. Assuming the deal goes through and it's not a slam dunk, NVDA would gain massive exposure to the smartphone market and a deal would open up a world of new applications for the company's AI technology.10:11 ETOracle emerges as winner in TikTok deal, but key details still lacking:In a surprising twist of events, Oracle (ORCL) has reportedly emerged as the winning bidder for TikTok's U.S. business. When President Trump ordered China-based ByteDance to sell the U.S. TikTok operations last month, Microsoft (MSFT) quickly surfaced as the front-runner to buy the assets.Last night, however, ByteDance turned down MSFT's offer, choosing instead to hammer out a deal with ORCL.The terms of that deal are very murky, though. In fact, it's not even known whether ORCL is taking a majority ownership position in TikTok. Several reports indicate that the arrangement is set to be more like a partnership than an outright acquisition.Due to the unprecedented circumstances surrounding this forced sale, as well as the mounting tension between the U.S. and China, the path to this clouded outcome has been a winding one.After the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) expressed concerns that TikTok user data was being shared with the Chinese government, President Trump imposed a September 20th deadline for ByteDance to sell the business.Unsurprisingly, China balked at the assertion and updated the country's technology export control rules. Specifically, any company considering selling technology to an outside party must gain permission from the Chinese government. This includes TikTok's proprietary algorithm.This new law threw a wrench in any proposed transaction because TikTok's algorithm is a vital component behind the success and popularity of the app. Specifically, the algorithm uses machine learning to queue up videos and memes that match a user's interests.Without the algorithm, ORCL would have to attempt to recreate it, which would be a time-consuming, and possibly unsuccessful, endeavor. It's also unclear whether CFIUS will approve a deal without the algorithm.There's plenty of uncertainty swirling around this arrangement, but it's clear why ORCL is interested in TikTok. The app, which has 100 mln users in the U.S., is growing by leaps-and-bounds. ByteDance believes TikTok will generate revenue of $6 bln next year, which is enough to significantly move the needle for ORCL. Analysts are currently forecasting that ORCL will post about $40 bln in revenue for FY21.ORCL would house TikTok's data, which is currently stored in Alphabet's (GOOG) cloud. This would allow ORCL to structure and monetize the rapidly expanding data.Traditionally known for on-premise database software, ORCL has shifted its focus to cloud storage and application software in order to spark stronger growth. Bringing TikTok on board would not only accelerate this transition, but it would also diversify ORCL's business by adding social media to the mix.The benefits for ORCL could be substantial. Like other aspects of this deal, it's unknown whether ORCL paid a hefty price to make this transaction happen. A couple weeks ago, reports suggested that TikTok was seeking as much as $50 bln for its U.S. assets.More information should be emerging very soon, so stay tuned. For the moment, it appears that ORCL is on the verge of making a game-changing deal.Briefing.com Note: Shares of ORCL are currently halted.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: September 14, 2020End of Document

TikTok closes deal to sell its U.S. tradeCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 14, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 334 wordsBodyTikTok would have reached an agreement to sell its U.S. operations to the Oracle giant, just before the September 15 deadline imposed by President Donald Trump's administration.The agreement ensures that the popular social media app will remain operational for its millions of fans in the United States, Digital Trends reported.News of the acquisition became known shortly after the once main interested party, Microsoft, announced that talks with the application's parent company, China's ByteDance, had failed.TikTok's career in finding a buyer began in early August 2020, after the White House issued an executive order banning the platform in the United States unless ByteDance sold its assets to a local company before September 15.A subsequent executive order extended the deadline to November 12, but Trump told the press in early September that the deadline would not extend, accelerating negotiations.As a subsidiary of Beijing-based byteDance, the Republican representative regarded TikTok as a threat to national security.In the original executive order, Trump said TikTok "automatically tracks vast swaths of user information, including internet browsing and other network activity data, such as location data and search and browsing history."He added that if the Chinese government accessed TikTok's data, it could potentially allow it to "track the locations of federal employees and contractors, create records of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage."The order also stated that TikTok "allegedly censors content" that the Chinese government considers politically sensitive, and said the app "can also be used for disinformation campaigns that benefit the Chinese Communist Party," Digital Trends added.TikTok said at the time that it "has never shared user data with the Chinese government, nor has it censored content at his request."The app is estimated to have around 100 million monthly active users in the United States and around 800 million worldwide.Load-Date: September 15, 2020End of Document

Loyal, brave, true: Why you should boycott 'Mulan'Daily Targum: Rutgers UniversitySeptember 14, 2020 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 801 wordsByline: Michelle FanBodyLoyal, brave, true: Why you should boycott 'Mulan'September 14, 2020 12:00am|By Michelle FanPhoto by Twitter |The Daily TargumThe live-action remake of the Disney classic "Mulan" faced backlash after fans realized the film's connection to Uyghur "re-education" camps and the lead actress's support for the Hong Kong police force.When the live-action remake of the Disney classic movie "Mulan" was announced years ago, the hearts of thousands of Asian-American girls soared and sang with glee.Mulan is one of the few Disney princesses of color, and arguably the Disney princess with the most compelling story - not about falling in love or finding her prince, but about discovering her own strength, living her truth and saving her country. From "Reflection" to "I'll Make A Man Out Of You," the movie was also filled with some of the most iconic music that defined this era of Disney animated films.The excitement and joy I felt at the prospect of seeing the lore of Mulan reimagined on the big screen, with a full cast of people who look like me, telling the story of a woman simultaneously fighting for her people and against her patriarchal society, kept me on the edge of my seat for months. I eagerly awaited any and all news, trailers and teasers about the movie.So I also quickly learned that this "Mulan" was not the same "Mulan" that I had grown up with. Besides the many developments to the filming that alarmed excited fans - such as the changes to the story, the characters and the music, all of which I was able to accept after some hesitance - news emerged that Liu Yifei, the beautiful actress cast as Mulan, declared her support for the Hong Kong Police Force in midst of the Hong Kong democracy protests of 2019.She shared a post that expressed support for the police force, which had arrested more than 1,300 protesters by September 2019 and had been repeatedly criticized by international human rights organizations for "excessive use of force," including brutal beatings, torture and sexual violence in police detention."I also support the Hong Kong police," Liu wrote on Weibo, a popular Chinese social media platform. I wasn't particularly surprised by her post - many Chinese celebrities, from Jackson Wang, a Hong Kong native himself, to Lay, who was previously a member of the K-pop boy band EXO, have either denounced the protests or expressed their support for the Hong Kong police force. But I was still frustrated to see that the actress playing Mulan, my childhood hero, could condone the violence and brutality that threatened the lives of many of my own close friends.As more footage from the movie emerged, something else about the movie alarmed me. "This was definitely shot in Western China," my mother mused as we watched the trailers together. "Probably Xinjiang."Indeed, the official release of "Mulan" thanked several Chinese government bodies, including the Xinjiang government's publicity department and the Public Security and Tourism bureaus for Turpan, a city in Xinjiang with several "re-education camps."The Public Security Bureau of Turpan specifically has been listed by the U.S. government as an organization involved in human rights violations and abuses. China has repeatedly come under fire from multiple organizations, including the United Nations, for the arbitrary detention and "re-education" of more than 1 million Uyghurs in camps in Xinjiang. That parts of "Mulan" may have been filmed right next to what more and more scholars and experts are calling a genocide truly makes me sick to my stomach.Mulan is a story about a girl who struggles to fit the mold of what a gentle, demure Chinese wife should be. Instead, she steals her father's armor and weapons in the middle of the night and rides off to defend her family's honor and her country's future. It's an exhilarating, gender-bending legend about defying traditional expectations for feminine propriety, becoming your most authentic self and most importantly, fighting for what is right.This live-action remake featured a cast of iconic Chinese-American actors, phenomenal costume design and incredible traditional Chinese sets and architecture. Needless to say, my heart shattered at the realization that I would not be able to support this film.I still want to see diverse representation in Hollywood, especially of Asian characters and narratives. I still want more movies of women taking charge and saving the day, as they often do in real life. I still want to support the creators, actors and artists who make all of these films possible. But I cannot do so at the expense of other morals.Mulan, in the remake, reminds us to be "loyal, brave and true" - and I know the real Mulan, the hero who lives on in my heart and my conscience, would want us to stand up for the values we believe in.Load-Date: September 14, 2020End of Document

Oracle and the power struggle that transcends TikTok's algorithmCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 19, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 702 wordsBodyThe 30-second videos with music are discord in the United States. The fact that President Donald Trump has TikTok in his sights has opened up several fronts in the tech sector. His intention to kick ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns the popular app, from the United States has propelled a race against the clock since late July to find an American partner willing to access the wishes of the chief negotiator. Microsoft and Walmart have been introduced to the offering, but in the end it has come to the finish line what was thought to be the least likely bidder: Oracle. The software company's relationship with the Trump Administration has been the key to becoming the Chinese firm's "technology partner."With the deal yet to close, Oracle has become the company that will calm concerns about the data security that TikTok handles. Trump, advised by cybersecurity agencies, accused ByteDance of storing its users' information and then sending it to the Chinese Communist Party. In the face of a trade war with China, the White House chooses to close any business gap related to Beijing, including the tech industry. In July, the U.S. president called for the cessation of ByteDance's U.S. operations but suggested a possible exit: the Chinese firm should sell its operations in the country to a U.S. company. Trump put on his negotiator's suit and proposed that a portion of the transaction go to the Treasury as retribution.The first company to raise its hand was Microsoft, which had a particular interest in application code, but was not quite sure if it would get it. Then he joined Walmart, whose success in the e-commerce business positioned him as an explorer with possibilities in this offer. Instead, Oracle eventually reached an agreement that is estimated not to have a significant share of actions, but where it will have access to the algorithm that makes the application so popular. According to The Wall Street Journal, the Californian company will have TikTok's formula so it can address the U.S. government's concerns about national security. It's still unknown whether Trump will agree to the proposal.What is known is that in the eyes of the President of the United States, Oracle is the highest bidder. "They could handle it," Trump said in August about the company's interest in buying TikTok. The company, founded in 1977, has also leaned in favor of Trump in different scenarios that could well represent a conflict of interest. His ceo, Safra Catz, formed part of Trump's transition team in 2016; and its founder, Larry Ellison, has been a major promoter of the Republican and just this year raised about $130,000 for his re-election campaign, at an event held at his home in California. The firm has had some contracts with the government between its businesses for at least 10 years and recently financed with nearly $1 million the GOP lobbying in north American Free Trade Agreement negotiations.Trump has taken the offensive against TikTok personally. The intervention of such a U.S. president in such a transaction is unreleased. The representative issued a presidential order in August in which he issued a 90-day deadline for ByteDance to close all of its operations in the United States. On Friday, the White House confirmed that the Chinese social network could no longer be discharged into the country as of this Sunday. With deadlines set from the White House, the scope for such a negotiation has been completely narrowed. "We're going to close the app or they're going to sell it to aAmerican company, let's see what happens," the president summed up.TikTok has so far accumulated some 100 million users in the United States and its demand has increased considerably during the months of confinement due to the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. pressure on implementation led to Kevin Mayer's resignation in August as CEO, when he had barely served three months in office. Meanwhile, China has updated its export control rules, involving some technology companies that do an analysis of the data they collect. The Chinese government has accused Trump of bullying TikTok, but with the new rules it is reinforced in order to enter directly into negotiations with the Americans.Load-Date: September 20, 2020End of Document

TikTok sees a light of hope in America with OracleCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 15, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 662 wordsBodyUpdates with TikTok reaction in paragraphs 5 and 6 ///Washington, 15 Set 2020 (AFP) - The U.S. government will this week study a "proposal" alliance between Chinese group ByteDance and Us's Oracle, to try to resolve the dispute over the popular TikTok video platform, which Trump Donald wants to close if it doesn't pass into the hands of an American firm." We received a weekend proposal that includes Oracle as a trusted technology partner, with many national security recommendations," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at CNBC. Mnuchin gave no details as to how the Partnership between Bytedance and Oracle, specializing in business software and services, would form. Oracle confirmed that it had submitted a proposal but did not disclose its content. Meanwhile, a TikTok spokeswoman said the idea "could solve the security issues" that unsettle the Trump administration." This proposal would allow us to continue to support our community of 100 million people in the United States who like TikTok (...) as well as the hundreds of thousands of small business owners and creators who have TikTok to develop," he added. Trump, who has been accusing the popular social network of alleged espionage on behalf of China for months, signed decrees to force ByteDance to quickly sell TikTok's activities on American soil." We're going to look at it in the Cfius committee (foreign investment, ndlr) this week, then we'll make a recommendation to the president and review it with him," the Treasury secretary said. I don't want to go into the details of the negotiation, I will just say that one factor that has always been fundamental to us is national security, ensuring that the technology on American phones is secure," insisted Mnuchin, who mentioned "great trust in Microsoft and Oracle." A connoisseur of the case told The Wall Street Journal that the agreement will not be "probably structured as a sale," while some media outlets citing Chinese sources speak on Monday of a "privileged technology society" and not of a sale of TikTok.CNBC's U.S. activities also evoked the possibility of Oracle taking a minority stake in TikTok's capital.It remains to be known whether this type of alliance would leave Trump satisfied.Time runs because the deadline has passed from September 15 to 20, that is to say next Sunday. TikTok has already complained about justice against the U.S. government in this case. Oracle's stock price was suspended shortly after opening on Wall Street on Monday. After re-established, it ended with a 4.32% up to close. Microsoft was interested in buying TikTok's U.S. operations. Supermarket group Walmart, another giant, had partnered with Microsoft in this acquisition attempt that was rejected Sunday by ByteDance.          - The Chinese move - "We thought Microsoft wanted to buy TikTok only with its main algorithm, a condition in which the Chinese government and ByteDance did not want to give in," Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securites.At the end of August, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce amended its list of technologies with export limitations or prohibitions, which now includes artificial intelligence technologies such as those that have made TikTok successful, a platform on which videos are shown to users more based on their tastes than their contacts. ByteDance made it known that it will "strictly respect" Beijing's new rules, i.e. obtaining an export licence from the Chinese authorities. In August, the appsurpassed 2 billion downloads worldwide and claims to be present in more than 200 countries. In the United States, the social network claims to have 100 million monthly users. The war over TikTok comes as part of a broader deterioration in relations between the two major world economies for months, with the United States and China launching harsh recriminations in the commercial, human rights or coronavirus pandemic.

What's happening with TikTok? Here's the latestCNN WireSeptember 21, 2020 Monday 1:45 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1163 wordsDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  With roughly 100 million users in the United States, it's no surprise that TikTok videos have taken over the internet.But as the relationship between Washington and Beijing frays, the fate of the video app, which is owned by China's ByteDance, looks uncertain. In recent weeks, US government officials have claimed that TikTok poses a serious threat to national security, and President Donald Trump has threatened to ban it unless an American company takes control of its domestic operations.That set off a bidding contest that's roped in some of America's top corporations, including Microsoft, Oracle and Walmart. While Microsoft is no longer a contender --- the company on Sept. 13 announced its bid was rejected by ByteDance --- Oracle and Walmart appear to have emerged victorious.The latest major development came Saturday, when Trump said he'd approved a deal "in concept" between ByteDance, Oracle and Walmart, temporarily averting a looming ban on the app that had sent downloads soaring. But the saga isn't over yet. Beijing still needs to weigh in, and Trump's backing isn't set in stone.What is clear is that the fight over TikTok is bigger than who owns an app popular with Generation Z. It's also about the future of US-China relations, and the murky new rules businesses are forced to navigate as tensions between the world's two biggest economies ramp up.Here's the latestOver the weekend, Trump green-lit a proposed deal from Oracle just hours before a ban on downloads was due to take effect.The ban has now been delayed by one week.Under the deal, TikTok will set up its headquarters in the United States, creating 25,000 jobs. Oracle would store TikTok data on its cloud platform, while Walmart would be involved as a commercial partner.Speaking to reporters, Trump said he approved the deal "in concept." "I have given the deal my blessing," Trump said. "If they get it done, that's great. If they don't, that's okay, too."Meanwhile, a US ban on messaging app WeChat, which is owned by China's Tencent, was temporarily blocked by a federal judge Sunday night, just hours before it was to take effect. The ban would have barred new downloads and any security updates in the United States.In issuing the preliminary injunction, Judge Laurel Beeler wrote that the ban on WeChat does not provide enough evidence that it is narrowly tailored to resolve the US government's national security concerns with respect to the app.How did we get here?The frenzy kicked off in early August when Trump signed an executive order that would effectively ban TikTok in the United States unless ByteDance could find an American owner for its US operations by Sept. 20.The Trump administration expressed concerns that the hugely popular app could be used as a spying tool by Beijing. Authorities also fear that it could be leveraged to collect personal data on US citizens, or to censor speech deemed sensitive by the Chinese government.TikTok has denied those allegations. The company has said its data centers are located entirely outside of China and that none of that data is subject to Chinese law.Some experts think the proposed deal from Oracle could be helped along because of Trump's ties to cofounder Larry Ellison, a supporter of the president. CEO Safra Katz has also donated to Trump's reelection bid.Still, the decision was a surprise to some following negotiations who expected a joint bid from Microsoft and Walmart to win the day.What's Trump's role?Trump has positioned himself as the kingmaker of any TikTok deal, making clear that he must agree to the terms before anything is made official.If that seems unusual, it's because it is. While governments often vet pending deals to protect consumers from monopoly power, and often do weigh national security when a merger is announced, Trump's deep involvement is a stark departure from how deals are typically finalized --- as is his move to compel a sale in the first place."In the end, Trump is the X-factor," said Dipayan Ghosh, the co-director of the Digital Platforms and Democracy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School. "Whatever he wishes will happen, no matter the merits of the related set of policies underlying the proposal."Trump has previously said that any company that scoops up TikTok must make a payment to the US Treasury as a sign of thanks. Why does this matter?The battle for control of TikTok in the United States goes beyond social media, security concerns and who winds up in charge.Sure, that's a big part of it. But the outcome will have major geopolitical consequences, too, as the United States and China move further apart under Trump.For a while, the focus was on trade and protecting intellectual property, with both sides slapping tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in goods while government officials tried to negotiate new terms of engagement. But over the past two years, sensitive technology has become a big area of contention, too.The US government has been conducting a long campaign against China's Huawei, which makes smartphones and is a leading manufacturer of equipment for 5G wireless networks. Citing similar spying concerns, the Trump administration has pushed allies to opt for other 5G equipment vendors, while cutting off Huawei's access to US technology, including crucial computer chips.As pressure expands to TikTok as well as WeChat, companies are considering the emergence of a new world order that could reshape how global firms do business.Deutsche Bank has estimated that supply and demand disruptions, along with the construction of a "tech wall" that forces companies to create two sets of standards for the United States and China, could cost companies $3.5 trillion over the next five years.The broader economic relationship is also at stake at a delicate moment following the historic shock from the pandemic. In a report published in mid-September, the consultancy Rhodium Group found that US-China investment dropped to its lowest level in nine years during the first half of 2020 as tensions rose.I use TikTok. What does it mean for me?As the situation rapidly progresses, TikTok's tens of millions of US users worry they could lose access to one of their favorite products.Under the terms of the ban, people who already had TikTok on their phones could still post short videos of dances, fun recipes and comedy routines per usual, but no new downloads would be allowed. US users also wouldn't be able to receive security patches or other updates, which could cause outages or glitches in the future.Though a ban has been averted for now, fears about restrictions have sent TikTok downloads soaring. They rose 12% to 247,000 in the United States on Friday, compared to Thursday, according to preliminary estimates from Sensor Tower, a research firm.--- Brian Fung, Sherisse Pham, Jill Disis and Selina Wang contributed reporting.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Market Chatter: Microsoft, Walmart, Oracle Shares Turn Lower on Report Beijing Prefers TikTok US Shutdown to Forced SaleMT Newswires Live BriefsSeptember 11, 2020 Friday 3:32 PM ESTCopyright 2020 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 232 wordsBody Shares of Microsoft (MSFT), Walmart (WMT), and Oracle (ORCL) shares fell in afternoon trading on Friday, reversing course. Reuters, citing unidentified sources, reported that China would rather see TikTok operations shut down in the US than a forced sale of the China-based video-sharing app.Shares of Microsoft fell as much as 2% after rising as much as 1.6%; Walmart slid as much as 0.9% after gaining as much as 1.2%; and Oracle skidded as much as 0.7% after advancing as much as 7.9%. The three US giants are interested in the TokTok franchise.Chinese officials believe a forced sale would make both ByteDance, the China-based owner of TikTok, and the Chinese government appear weak in the face of pressure from the US government, the news agency reported, citing those sources.US President Donald Trump threatened last month to ban the service if it was not sold, and has given ByteDance a deadline of mid September to finalize a deal, according to the report.Reuters cited ByteDance as saying the Chinese government had never suggested to the company it should shut down TikTok's operations in the US or in any other markets.(Market Chatter news is derived from conversations with market professionals globally.

TikTok parent company Bytedance is 'in talks' with the Trump administrationStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 12, 2020 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 433 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyTikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, is reportedly entering negotiations with the United States government to discuss possible arrangements that would allow the video-sharing app to avoid a full sale of it's USA operations.The original deadline for the sale will not budge, Trump told reporters on Thursday.US President Donald Trump said he would not give TikTok, the Chinese video app, more time to sell off its US-based assets, insisting a deal must come within days despite reports the firm is seeking to skirt the sale altogether. He maintained there will be "no extension of the TikTok deadline". In Hong Kong, the company chose to halt operations after China passed a new national security law that would make it more hard for TikTok to do business there.In India, where the country has the power to force service providers to block access to websites, government officials banned TikTok as part of a larger shutdown of Chinese-owned apps after a deadly border clash with China. "I'm not extending deadline, no". In an executive order last month, Trump had set September 15 as the deadline for the Chinese app to either change its ownership to an American company or shut it down.Sources familiar with the matter said that the discussions have risen in prominence since the Chinese government took steps to make it hard to sell to the likes of Microsoft or other technology giants in the US, the Wall Street Journal reports. But U.S. officials have expressed concern that information on those who use the platform could be passed to Beijing.Here's Why Denise Richards is Leaving 'Real Housewives of Beverly Hills'Richards also joined the cast of the CBS daytime soap The Bold and the lovely a year ago as single mom Shauna Fulton. She also starred in the E! realit show Denise Richards: It's Complicated. "I think she's just had enough".When confronted with a ban in India, TikTok chose to shut down voluntarily. Several other large American tech companies have since reportedly entered into talks with popular video-sharing app-but potential new roadblocks to a deal have also emerged.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment by the Reuters news agency.China's commerce ministry joined the party on August 28 with a revised tech export control list that experts said would give it regulatory oversight over any TikTok deal. The US is also likely to ban TikTok from being downloaded from app stores.TikTok and ByteDance filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles federal court on August 24 against Trump's executive order, calling it a pretext to fuel anti-China rhetoric.Load-Date: September 12, 2020End of Document

OPINION: TikTok ban is complex, people should consider personal actionHerald: Arkansas State UniversitySeptember 24, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 606 wordsByline: Anna SchmidtBodyTikTok has been subject to controversy over the potential ban in the U.S. (Bailey Britton | Collegian Media Group)Each week seems to bring with it new information surrounding the Chinese owned social media platform and ultra popular video generating app, TikTok. Will President Donald Trump ban all Americans from using the app? Perhaps he will just decide to remove it from app stores and phase it out. Maybe no action will be taken. It's been quite a rollercoaster trying to keep up with what action will be taken against the foreign owned phenomenon.Originally, rumors ran rampant that the president was looking to ban TikTok because he was personally offended by videos being made to discourage people from attending his rallies. Large media outlets like Forbes, Vox and the New York Times ran stories theorizing this. While it is surely true that the president didn't appreciate the situation, his reason for considering a TikTok ban runs much deeper.TikTok is a Chinese owned app that has access to an alarming amount of your data. By clicking on the app, you give them access to your location, phone contacts, social media contacts, age, type of device you use, browsing and search history, direct messages on the app and content you post on the app.My initial reaction to this information was, "So what? Facebook, Instagram and Twitter have similar accesses." Well, as long as the app has access to this information, Chinese government spies and hackers do, too.Why does that matter? China can use that information to seek out national security plots through complex methods - ones I even have trouble fully understanding.When you consider the fact that China is an intense geopolitical power and a communist-run government that places little value in human rights, this is not ideal.Related:"OPINION:Read NowFinding a solution to this problem is horribly complex. Banning the app hasn't been done because it's not as easy as it sounds, and it shouldn't be. It is not necessarily within the power of the president to "ban" an app because publishing on an app can be considered speech, which cannot be banned for obvious reasons.So what's next? Well, the back and forth between President Trump, TikTok and China is bound to continue for an extended amount of time. At this point, personal action seems to be the only way to make a difference.I am a long time TikTok maker and video watcher. I've loved the distraction and laughs that it has brought to my life since downloading it. However, using the app and handing over loads of information is an action that can potentially result in China gaining more power on the world stage.China is currently being run by the Chinese Communist Party who monitor and control their citizens very strictly. According to Amnesty International, members of the LGBTQ community in China suffer discrimination, many people are condemned for practicing unpopular religion and human rights defenders are subjected to discrimination and harassment by authorities.In 2020, a time when Americans have never been so focused on human rights, China is depriving many people of basic human rights each day. When we use TikTok, we potentially hand them more power in the form of information they may use to grow their ability to control citizens. It's time to take that power back from them and stop using TikTok.Anna Schmidt is a junior in mass communications and the opinion editor for the Collegian.

The Nasdaq Composite increased 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 finished flat.The S&P 500 started the day lower by 0.9%, extending the month's pullback and briefly turning negative for the year, before the dip buyers stepped in. By the afternoon, the benchmark index was up 1.3% but sellers regained control on no specific news. The inability to sustain another rebound was disappointing for the bulls but not necessarily bearish.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in positive territory, even as declining issues edged out advancing issues at both the NYSE and Nasdaq. The utilities (+1.2%), consumer staples (+0.8%), and information technology (+0.6%) sectors outperformed in a defensive-minded trade that excluded the health care sector (-0.5%).Generally, investors remained nervous about election volatility, the prospects for another fiscal relief bill, the trajectory of the coronavirus, and U.S.-China relations. On stimulus, House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) will reportedly introduce a $2.4 trillion relief bill, but it's unlikely to have the support of Republicans.Regarding the economy, the labor market remained in poor standing as weekly jobless claims increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000). New home sales, however, rose 4.8% m/m in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) -- its highest rate since November 2006.Interestingly, a pair of analysts turned bullish on some battered financial stocks. Goldman Sachs (GS 195.11, +8.99, +4.8%) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at UBS, and Wells Fargo (WFC 23.32, +0.49, +2.2%) was added to the Fresh Pick List at Robert W. Baird.U.S. Treasuries traded within another narrow range and closed little changed. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 94.33. WTI crude futures gained 0.9%, or $0.37, to $40.31/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Jobless claims for the week ending September 19 increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000) while continuing claims for the week ending September 12 decreased by 167,000 to 12.580 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial jobless claims remain at stunningly high levels that point to the ongoing challenges U.S. businesses face getting back on a pre-pandemic track. In the same period a year ago, initial jobless claims were 215,000.New home sales in August did something they haven't done since November 2006 -- exceed a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.0 million. Specifically, they rose 4.8% m/m to 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) and were up 43.2% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects strong demand for new homes at more affordable price points, as the South region, which is the largest homebuilding region and features lower average prices, saw sales increase 13.4% m/m.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for August on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +18.9% YTDS&P 500 +0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -6.0% YTDRussell 2000 -13.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1439/1513. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1356/1928.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: September 25, 2020End of Document

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -10.90.The S&P 500 futures are trading 14 points, or 0.4%, below fair value, suggesting the market is on track for its fourth straight weekly decline. The S&P 500 enters the session down 2.2% this week amid a host of uncertainties and downwards momentum.Some of those uncertainties pertain to the political sphere, specifically regarding the dimming hopes for another relief bill before the election and the likelihood that the election results are delayed. According to a recent Bloomberg report, Goldman Sachs believes markets are overstating the risk from a delayed election result.There aren't any new macro factors this morning, although month-end and quarter-end rebalancing could contribute to the recent volatility in the market. Separately, today's economic data will be limited to Durable Goods Orders for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.9%), which will be available at 8:30 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries continue to sit relatively unchanged.

The Nasdaq Composite increased 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 finished flat.The S&P 500 started the day lower by 0.9%, extending the month's pullback and briefly turning negative for the year, before the dip buyers stepped in. By the afternoon, the benchmark index was up 1.3% but sellers regained control on no specific news. The inability to sustain another rebound was disappointing for the bulls but not necessarily bearish.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in positive territory, even as declining issues edged out advancing issues at both the NYSE and Nasdaq. The utilities (+1.2%), consumer staples (+0.8%), and information technology (+0.6%) sectors outperformed in a defensive-minded trade that excluded the health care sector (-0.5%).Generally, investors remained nervous about election volatility, the prospects for another fiscal relief bill, the trajectory of the coronavirus, and U.S.-China relations. On stimulus, House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) will reportedly introduce a $2.4 trillion relief bill, but it's unlikely to have the support of Republicans.Regarding the economy, the labor market remained in poor standing as weekly jobless claims increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000). New home sales, however, rose 4.8% m/m in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) -- its highest rate since November 2006.Interestingly, a pair of analysts turned bullish on some battered financial stocks. Goldman Sachs (GS 195.11, +8.99, +4.8%) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at UBS, and Wells Fargo (WFC 23.32, +0.49, +2.2%) was added to the Fresh Pick List at Robert W. Baird.U.S. Treasuries traded within another narrow range and closed little changed. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 94.33. WTI crude futures gained 0.9%, or $0.37, to $40.31/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Jobless claims for the week ending September 19 increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000) while continuing claims for the week ending September 12 decreased by 167,000 to 12.580 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial jobless claims remain at stunningly high levels that point to the ongoing challenges U.S. businesses face getting back on a pre-pandemic track. In the same period a year ago, initial jobless claims were 215,000.New home sales in August did something they haven't done since November 2006 -- exceed a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.0 million. Specifically, they rose 4.8% m/m to 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) and were up 43.2% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects strong demand for new homes at more affordable price points, as the South region, which is the largest homebuilding region and features lower average prices, saw sales increase 13.4% m/m.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for August on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +18.9% YTDS&P 500 +0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -6.0% YTDRussell 2000 -13.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1439/1513. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1356/1928.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: September 25, 2020End of Document

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%, and the Russell 2000 is up 0.7%.The trading range has been tighter than yesterday's range, suggesting a general lack of conviction amid ongoing uncertainties that include politics and the economy. Understandably, some investors are distrustful of today's advance given the downwards momentum, and volatility, this month and any tactical activity caused by month-end/quarter-end rebalancing.At this juncture, the S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.3%) is at the leadership position, followed by industrials (+0.8%) and real estate (+0.7%). The energy (-1.1%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) sectors underperform in negative territory.The mega-caps are stepping up today, with Apple (AAPL 110.27, +2.05, +1.9%) and Microsoft (MSFT 206.29, +3.14, +1.6%) trading comfortably higher. Smaller cyclical stocks are also seeing gains following some positive-minded analyst recommendations.Barclays upgraded cruise lines Norwegian (NCLH 16.08, +1.45, +9.9%), Royal Caribbean (RCL 63.80, +3.84, +6.4%), and Carnival (CCL 14.83, +1.09, +7.9%) to Overweight from Equal Weight. The Benchmark Company upgraded Norfolk Southern (NSC 217.62, +3.19, +1.5%) and CSX (CSX 77.54, +0.96, +1.3%) to Buy from Hold.Costco (COST 339.94, -7.06, -2.0%) is bucking the positive trend despite beating EPS estimates and reporting in-line revenue and comparable sales results. Telsey Advisory Group liked what it saw, raising its price target on the stock to $390 from $385 after the report.Reviewing today's economic data:Durable goods orders increased 0.4% m/m in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.9%) following an upwardly revised 11.7% increase (from 11.2%) in July. Excluding transportation, orders were also up 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.0%) following an upwardly revised 3.2% increase (from 2.4%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that order increases were seen across most categories, as manufacturing needs continued to recover from their pandemic depression, yet total orders are still down 11.3% yr/yr (down 3.0%, ex-transportation). ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1817/1140. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2281/1063.12:25 ETDow +44.75 at 26850.19, Nasdaq +107.09 at 10779.38, S&P +13.98 at 3260.57[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.5%, and the Nasdaq is up 1.0% in a tech-driven gain.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 110.46, +2.24, +2.1%) setting the leadership pace with a 2% gain. No other member is up more than 1.0% but neither one is trading lower. Microsoft (MSFT 206.46, +3.25, +1.6%) is another mega-cap in the green.Shares of Peloton (PTON 96.03, +7.53, +8.5%) are up 8.5% in a continuation of the stay-at-home trade that has propelled the stock nearly 400% since March 13.11:55 ETDow +21.93 at 26827.37, Nasdaq +95.79 at 10768.08, S&P +10.84 at 3257.43[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has traded in a tighter range than yesterday, reflecting a lack of conviction amid a host of uncertainties in the market, including politics and the economy. The S&P 500 is up 0.3% and is on track for its fourth straight weekly decline.Some analyst recommendations that stand out today include Amazon (AMZN 3037.28, +18.04, +0.6%) being resumed with an Overweight rating at Piper Sandler and ConocoPhillips (COP 33.27, -0.33, -1.0%) being initiated with an Overweight rating at KeyBanc.Regarding ConocoPhillips, this is the second straight day that analysts have stepped up with positive-minded recommendations on battered cyclical stocks. Recall, Wells Fargo (WFC 23.28, -0.04, -0.2%) and Goldman Sachs (GS 192.74, -2.37, -1.2%) were yesterday's top calls in the financials sector from a pair of analysts.11:30 ETDow +100.03 at 26905.47, Nasdaq +131.12 at 10803.41, S&P +20.02 at 3266.61[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.6% but remains below yesterday's intraday high (3278.70). Transports are having a good day.UPS (UPS 166.41, +5.98, +3.7%) is setting the direction of the Dow Jones Transportation Average (+1.2%) as it trades near all-time highs. FedEx (FDX 249.19, +4.97, +2.0%) follows behind with a 2% gain. Expectations for a busy, and profitable, holiday shipping season have helped both stocks outperform recently.The S&P 500 industrials sector is up 0.7%, as it also gets a boost from a 3.5% gain in Boeing (BA 151.11, +5.09, +3.5%).10:55 ETDow +54.07 at 26859.51, Nasdaq +87.43 at 10759.72, S&P +10.79 at 3257.38[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.4% to trade near session highs. The Nasdaq is up 0.8%, benefiting from the gains in technology and mega-cap stocks.The information technology sector (+0.9%) has assumed the sector leadership, led by Apple (AAPL 110.09, +1.88, +1.7%), Microsoft (MSFT 205.02, +1.89, +0.9%), and NVIDIA (NVDA 500.18, +6.31, +1.3%). Tech has performed relatively well over the past two sessions, which has been viewed as a good sign for the market in the short-term.On the other hand, the energy sector remains the place to avoid despite the contrarian bargains in the space. The sector is down another 1.0% today to extend its weekly decline to 9.6%. Lower oil prices ($40.15/bbl, -0.16, -0.4%) have pressured sentiment.10:25 ETDow -12.43 at 26793.01, Nasdaq +60.85 at 10733.14, S&P +2.99 at 3249.58[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is back in positive territory with a 0.1% gain, following a similar indecisive pattern from yesterday.In corporate news, London bookmaker William Hill (WIMHY 14.72, +3.41, +30.2%) has received separate cash proposals from Caesar Entertainment (CZR 57.02, +4.18, +7.9%) and Apollo Management International LLP.

On a related note, Telsey Advisory Group raised its price target on the stock to $390 from $385.Apple (AAPL 108.81, +0.55, +0.5%) is helping offset some of the broader weakness in the market with a modest 0.5% gain.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -10.90.The S&P 500 futures are trading 14 points, or 0.4%, below fair value, suggesting the market is on track for its fourth straight weekly decline. The S&P 500 enters the session down 2.2% this week amid a host of uncertainties and downwards momentum.Some of those uncertainties pertain to the political sphere, specifically regarding the dimming hopes for another relief bill before the election and the likelihood that the election results are delayed. According to a recent Bloomberg report, Goldman Sachs believes markets are overstating the risk from a delayed election result.There aren't any new macro factors this morning, although month-end and quarter-end rebalancing could contribute to the recent volatility in the market. Separately, today's economic data will be limited to Durable Goods Orders for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.9%), which will be available at 8:30 a.m. ET.U.S. Treasuries continue to sit relatively unchanged.

The Nasdaq Composite increased 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 finished flat.The S&P 500 started the day lower by 0.9%, extending the month's pullback and briefly turning negative for the year, before the dip buyers stepped in. By the afternoon, the benchmark index was up 1.3% but sellers regained control on no specific news. The inability to sustain another rebound was disappointing for the bulls but not necessarily bearish.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in positive territory, even as declining issues edged out advancing issues at both the NYSE and Nasdaq. The utilities (+1.2%), consumer staples (+0.8%), and information technology (+0.6%) sectors outperformed in a defensive-minded trade that excluded the health care sector (-0.5%).Generally, investors remained nervous about election volatility, the prospects for another fiscal relief bill, the trajectory of the coronavirus, and U.S.-China relations. On stimulus, House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) will reportedly introduce a $2.4 trillion relief bill, but it's unlikely to have the support of Republicans.Regarding the economy, the labor market remained in poor standing as weekly jobless claims increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000). New home sales, however, rose 4.8% m/m in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) -- its highest rate since November 2006.Interestingly, a pair of analysts turned bullish on some battered financial stocks. Goldman Sachs (GS 195.11, +8.99, +4.8%) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at UBS, and Wells Fargo (WFC 23.32, +0.49, +2.2%) was added to the Fresh Pick List at Robert W. Baird.U.S. Treasuries traded within another narrow range and closed little changed. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 94.33. WTI crude futures gained 0.9%, or $0.37, to $40.31/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Jobless claims for the week ending September 19 increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000) while continuing claims for the week ending September 12 decreased by 167,000 to 12.580 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial jobless claims remain at stunningly high levels that point to the ongoing challenges U.S. businesses face getting back on a pre-pandemic track. In the same period a year ago, initial jobless claims were 215,000.New home sales in August did something they haven't done since November 2006 -- exceed a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.0 million. Specifically, they rose 4.8% m/m to 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) and were up 43.2% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects strong demand for new homes at more affordable price points, as the South region, which is the largest homebuilding region and features lower average prices, saw sales increase 13.4% m/m.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for August on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +18.9% YTDS&P 500 +0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -6.0% YTDRussell 2000 -13.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1439/1513. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1356/1928.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: September 25, 2020End of Document

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%, and the Russell 2000 is up 0.7%.The trading range has been tighter than yesterday's range, suggesting a general lack of conviction amid ongoing uncertainties that include politics and the economy. Understandably, some investors are distrustful of today's advance given the downwards momentum, and volatility, this month and any tactical activity caused by month-end/quarter-end rebalancing.At this juncture, the S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.3%) is at the leadership position, followed by industrials (+0.8%) and real estate (+0.7%). The energy (-1.1%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) sectors underperform in negative territory.The mega-caps are stepping up today, with Apple (AAPL 110.27, +2.05, +1.9%) and Microsoft (MSFT 206.29, +3.14, +1.6%) trading comfortably higher. Smaller cyclical stocks are also seeing gains following some positive-minded analyst recommendations.Barclays upgraded cruise lines Norwegian (NCLH 16.08, +1.45, +9.9%), Royal Caribbean (RCL 63.80, +3.84, +6.4%), and Carnival (CCL 14.83, +1.09, +7.9%) to Overweight from Equal Weight. The Benchmark Company upgraded Norfolk Southern (NSC 217.62, +3.19, +1.5%) and CSX (CSX 77.54, +0.96, +1.3%) to Buy from Hold.Costco (COST 339.94, -7.06, -2.0%) is bucking the positive trend despite beating EPS estimates and reporting in-line revenue and comparable sales results. Telsey Advisory Group liked what it saw, raising its price target on the stock to $390 from $385 after the report.Reviewing today's economic data:Durable goods orders increased 0.4% m/m in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.9%) following an upwardly revised 11.7% increase (from 11.2%) in July. Excluding transportation, orders were also up 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.0%) following an upwardly revised 3.2% increase (from 2.4%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that order increases were seen across most categories, as manufacturing needs continued to recover from their pandemic depression, yet total orders are still down 11.3% yr/yr (down 3.0%, ex-transportation). ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1817/1140. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2281/1063.12:25 ETDow +44.75 at 26850.19, Nasdaq +107.09 at 10779.38, S&P +13.98 at 3260.57[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.5%, and the Nasdaq is up 1.0% in a tech-driven gain.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 110.46, +2.24, +2.1%) setting the leadership pace with a 2% gain. No other member is up more than 1.0% but neither one is trading lower. Microsoft (MSFT 206.46, +3.25, +1.6%) is another mega-cap in the green.Shares of Peloton (PTON 96.03, +7.53, +8.5%) are up 8.5% in a continuation of the stay-at-home trade that has propelled the stock nearly 400% since March 13.11:55 ETDow +21.93 at 26827.37, Nasdaq +95.79 at 10768.08, S&P +10.84 at 3257.43[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has traded in a tighter range than yesterday, reflecting a lack of conviction amid a host of uncertainties in the market, including politics and the economy. The S&P 500 is up 0.3% and is on track for its fourth straight weekly decline.Some analyst recommendations that stand out today include Amazon (AMZN 3037.28, +18.04, +0.6%) being resumed with an Overweight rating at Piper Sandler and ConocoPhillips (COP 33.27, -0.33, -1.0%) being initiated with an Overweight rating at KeyBanc.Regarding ConocoPhillips, this is the second straight day that analysts have stepped up with positive-minded recommendations on battered cyclical stocks. Recall, Wells Fargo (WFC 23.28, -0.04, -0.2%) and Goldman Sachs (GS 192.74, -2.37, -1.2%) were yesterday's top calls in the financials sector from a pair of analysts.11:30 ETDow +100.03 at 26905.47, Nasdaq +131.12 at 10803.41, S&P +20.02 at 3266.61[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.6% but remains below yesterday's intraday high (3278.70).

FedEx (FDX 249.19, +4.97, +2.0%) follows behind with a 2% gain. Expectations for a busy, and profitable, holiday shipping season have helped both stocks outperform recently.The S&P 500 industrials sector is up 0.7%, as it also gets a boost from a 3.5% gain in Boeing (BA 151.11, +5.09, +3.5%).10:55 ETDow +54.07 at 26859.51, Nasdaq +87.43 at 10759.72, S&P +10.79 at 3257.38[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.4% to trade near session highs. The Nasdaq is up 0.8%, benefiting from the gains in technology and mega-cap stocks.The information technology sector (+0.9%) has assumed the sector leadership, led by Apple (AAPL 110.09, +1.88, +1.7%), Microsoft (MSFT 205.02, +1.89, +0.9%), and NVIDIA (NVDA 500.18, +6.31, +1.3%). Tech has performed relatively well over the past two sessions, which has been viewed as a good sign for the market in the short-term.On the other hand, the energy sector remains the place to avoid despite the contrarian bargains in the space. The sector is down another 1.0% today to extend its weekly decline to 9.6%. Lower oil prices ($40.15/bbl, -0.16, -0.4%) have pressured sentiment.10:25 ETDow -12.43 at 26793.01, Nasdaq +60.85 at 10733.14, S&P +2.99 at 3249.58[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is back in positive territory with a 0.1% gain, following a similar indecisive pattern from yesterday.In corporate news, London bookmaker William Hill (WIMHY 14.72, +3.41, +30.2%) has received separate cash proposals from Caesar Entertainment (CZR 57.02, +4.18, +7.9%) and Apollo Management International LLP.

On a related note, Telsey Advisory Group raised its price target on the stock to $390 from $385.Apple (AAPL 108.81, +0.55, +0.5%) is helping offset some of the broader weakness in the market with a modest 0.5% gain.

The Nasdaq Composite increased 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 finished flat.The S&P 500 started the day lower by 0.9%, extending the month's pullback and briefly turning negative for the year, before the dip buyers stepped in. By the afternoon, the benchmark index was up 1.3% but sellers regained control on no specific news. The inability to sustain another rebound was disappointing for the bulls but not necessarily bearish.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in positive territory, even as declining issues edged out advancing issues at both the NYSE and Nasdaq. The utilities (+1.2%), consumer staples (+0.8%), and information technology (+0.6%) sectors outperformed in a defensive-minded trade that excluded the health care sector (-0.5%).Generally, investors remained nervous about election volatility, the prospects for another fiscal relief bill, the trajectory of the coronavirus, and U.S.-China relations. On stimulus, House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) will reportedly introduce a $2.4 trillion relief bill, but it's unlikely to have the support of Republicans.Regarding the economy, the labor market remained in poor standing as weekly jobless claims increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000). New home sales, however, rose 4.8% m/m in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) -- its highest rate since November 2006.Interestingly, a pair of analysts turned bullish on some battered financial stocks. Goldman Sachs (GS 195.11, +8.99, +4.8%) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at UBS, and Wells Fargo (WFC 23.32, +0.49, +2.2%) was added to the Fresh Pick List at Robert W. Baird.U.S. Treasuries traded within another narrow range and closed little changed. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 94.33. WTI crude futures gained 0.9%, or $0.37, to $40.31/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Jobless claims for the week ending September 19 increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000) while continuing claims for the week ending September 12 decreased by 167,000 to 12.580 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial jobless claims remain at stunningly high levels that point to the ongoing challenges U.S. businesses face getting back on a pre-pandemic track. In the same period a year ago, initial jobless claims were 215,000.New home sales in August did something they haven't done since November 2006 -- exceed a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.0 million. Specifically, they rose 4.8% m/m to 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) and were up 43.2% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects strong demand for new homes at more affordable price points, as the South region, which is the largest homebuilding region and features lower average prices, saw sales increase 13.4% m/m.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for August on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +18.9% YTDS&P 500 +0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -6.0% YTDRussell 2000 -13.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1439/1513. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1356/1928.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: September 25, 2020End of Document

For its part, WRK (along with industry peers like Int'l Paper (IP 41.32, +2.11, +5.38%), Packaging Corp (PKG 109.16, +4.89, +4.69%), and Domtar (UFS 26.76, +1.11, +4.33%)) benefit from rumors of a price hike, ILMN continues to bounce of Grail-related weakness, with NOW reaping the benefits of a broader bounce in tech.Conversely, Houston-based oil&gas producer Apache (APA 9.98, -0.92, -8.44%) is again one of the worst-performing names in the index as energy (-0.37%) is again the worst-performing group in the S&P 500.14:00 ETDow +192.16 at 26997.6, Nasdaq +170.91 at 10843.2, S&P +33.02 at 3279.61[BRIEFING.COM] The steady climb in the major averages continued in the last half hour with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (+1.60%) still out front.Gold futures settled $10.60 lower (-0.6%) to $1,866.30/oz, notching its fourth loss in five sessions, amid this week's strength in the greenback.The U.S. Dollar Index sits higher by about +0.3% to $94.64.13:30 ETDow +142.64 at 26948.08, Nasdaq +138.90 at 10811.19, S&P +25.63 at 3272.22[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have marched steady toward session highs in the last half hour with the DJIA (+0.53%) still at the bottom of the standings.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that UnitedHealth (UNH 298.62, +5.96, +2.04%), Intel (INTC 49.77, +0.61, +1.24%), and Honeywell (HON 160.69, +1.93, +1.22%) are outperforming.Conversely, athletic retailer Nike (NKE 122.74, -2.01, -1.61%) sits at the bottom of the index.The DJIA now stands -5.21% lower on the month.12:55 ETDow +96.16 at 26901.6, Nasdaq +121.56 at 10793.85, S&P +19.47 at 3266.06[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.6% to trim its weekly decline, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 1.1% to trade relatively unchanged for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%, and the Russell 2000 is up 0.7%.The trading range has been tighter than yesterday's range, suggesting a general lack of conviction amid ongoing uncertainties that include politics and the economy. Understandably, some investors are distrustful of today's advance given the downwards momentum, and volatility, this month and any tactical activity caused by month-end/quarter-end rebalancing.At this juncture, the S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.3%) is at the leadership position, followed by industrials (+0.8%) and real estate (+0.7%). The energy (-1.1%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) sectors underperform in negative territory.The mega-caps are stepping up today, with Apple (AAPL 110.27, +2.05, +1.9%) and Microsoft (MSFT 206.29, +3.14, +1.6%) trading comfortably higher. Smaller cyclical stocks are also seeing gains following some positive-minded analyst recommendations.Barclays upgraded cruise lines Norwegian (NCLH 16.08, +1.45, +9.9%), Royal Caribbean (RCL 63.80, +3.84, +6.4%), and Carnival (CCL 14.83, +1.09, +7.9%) to Overweight from Equal Weight. The Benchmark Company upgraded Norfolk Southern (NSC 217.62, +3.19, +1.5%) and CSX (CSX 77.54, +0.96, +1.3%) to Buy from Hold.Costco (COST 339.94, -7.06, -2.0%) is bucking the positive trend despite beating EPS estimates and reporting in-line revenue and comparable sales results. Telsey Advisory Group liked what it saw, raising its price target on the stock to $390 from $385 after the report.Reviewing today's economic data:Durable goods orders increased 0.4% m/m in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.9%) following an upwardly revised 11.7% increase (from 11.2%) in July. Excluding transportation, orders were also up 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.0%) following an upwardly revised 3.2% increase (from 2.4%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that order increases were seen across most categories, as manufacturing needs continued to recover from their pandemic depression, yet total orders are still down 11.3% yr/yr (down 3.0%, ex-transportation). ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1817/1140. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2281/1063.12:25 ETDow +44.75 at 26850.19, Nasdaq +107.09 at 10779.38, S&P +13.98 at 3260.57[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.5%, and the Nasdaq is up 1.0% in a tech-driven gain.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 110.46, +2.24, +2.1%) setting the leadership pace with a 2% gain. No other member is up more than 1.0% but neither one is trading lower. Microsoft (MSFT 206.46, +3.25, +1.6%) is another mega-cap in the green.Shares of Peloton (PTON 96.03, +7.53, +8.5%) are up 8.5% in a continuation of the stay-at-home trade that has propelled the stock nearly 400% since March 13.11:55 ETDow +21.93 at 26827.37, Nasdaq +95.79 at 10768.08, S&P +10.84 at 3257.43[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has traded in a tighter range than yesterday, reflecting a lack of conviction amid a host of uncertainties in the market, including politics and the economy. The S&P 500 is up 0.3% and is on track for its fourth straight weekly decline.Some analyst recommendations that stand out today include Amazon (AMZN 3037.28, +18.04, +0.6%) being resumed with an Overweight rating at Piper Sandler and ConocoPhillips (COP 33.27, -0.33, -1.0%) being initiated with an Overweight rating at KeyBanc.Regarding ConocoPhillips, this is the second straight day that analysts have stepped up with positive-minded recommendations on battered cyclical stocks. Recall, Wells Fargo (WFC 23.28, -0.04, -0.2%) and Goldman Sachs (GS 192.74, -2.37, -1.2%) were yesterday's top calls in the financials sector from a pair of analysts.11:30 ETDow +100.03 at 26905.47, Nasdaq +131.12 at 10803.41, S&P +20.02 at 3266.61[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.6% but remains below yesterday's intraday high (3278.70). Transports are having a good day.UPS (UPS 166.41, +5.98, +3.7%) is setting the direction of the Dow Jones Transportation Average (+1.2%) as it trades near all-time highs. FedEx (FDX 249.19, +4.97, +2.0%) follows behind with a 2% gain. Expectations for a busy, and profitable, holiday shipping season have helped both stocks outperform recently.The S&P 500 industrials sector is up 0.7%, as it also gets a boost from a 3.5% gain in Boeing (BA 151.11, +5.09, +3.5%).10:55 ETDow +54.07 at 26859.51, Nasdaq +87.43 at 10759.72, S&P +10.79 at 3257.38[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.4% to trade near session highs. The Nasdaq is up 0.8%, benefiting from the gains in technology and mega-cap stocks.The information technology sector (+0.9%) has assumed the sector leadership, led by Apple (AAPL 110.09, +1.88, +1.7%), Microsoft (MSFT 205.02, +1.89, +0.9%), and NVIDIA (NVDA 500.18, +6.31, +1.3%). Tech has performed relatively well over the past two sessions, which has been viewed as a good sign for the market in the short-term.On the other hand, the energy sector remains the place to avoid despite the contrarian bargains in the space. The sector is down another 1.0% today to extend its weekly decline to 9.6%. Lower oil prices ($40.15/bbl, -0.16, -0.4%) have pressured sentiment.10:25 ETDow -12.43 at 26793.01, Nasdaq +60.85 at 10733.14, S&P +2.99 at 3249.58[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is back in positive territory with a 0.1% gain, following a similar indecisive pattern from yesterday.In corporate news, London bookmaker William Hill (WIMHY 14.72, +3.41, +30.2%) has received separate cash proposals from Caesar Entertainment (CZR 57.02, +4.18, +7.9%) and Apollo Management International LLP. Note, Caesars already owns a stake in William Hill.Elsewhere, cruise line stocks are sporting solid gains today after Barclays upgraded Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH 16.00, +1.37, +9.4%), Royal Caribbean (RCL 62.82, +2.81, +4.7%), and Carnival (CCL 14.40, +0.69, +4.8%) to Overweight.10:00 ETDow -96.74 at 26708.7, Nasdaq -13.68 at 10658.61, S&P -8.04 at 3238.55[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is down 0.2%, while the Russell 2000 is up 0.2%.Shares of Costco (COST 337.75, -9.19, -2.6%) are underperforming the market today despite the company beating EPS estimates. Revenue and total comparable sales were in-line with prior guidance. On a related note, Telsey Advisory Group raised its price target on the stock to $390 from $385.Apple (AAPL 108.81, +0.55, +0.5%) is helping offset some of the broader weakness in the market with a modest 0.5% gain. The stock is down nearly 16% this month, versus a 7.5% decline in the S&P 500 over the same period.09:40 ETDow -114.30 at 26691.14, Nasdaq -21.16 at 10651.13, S&P -12.64 at 3233.95[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices begin the session on a lower note.

The S&P 500 enters the session down 2.2% this week amid a host of uncertainties and downwards momentum.Some of those uncertainties pertain to the political sphere, specifically regarding the dimming hopes for another relief bill before the election and the likelihood that the election results are delayed.

The Nasdaq Composite increased 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 finished flat.The S&P 500 started the day lower by 0.9%, extending the month's pullback and briefly turning negative for the year, before the dip buyers stepped in. By the afternoon, the benchmark index was up 1.3% but sellers regained control on no specific news. The inability to sustain another rebound was disappointing for the bulls but not necessarily bearish.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in positive territory, even as declining issues edged out advancing issues at both the NYSE and Nasdaq. The utilities (+1.2%), consumer staples (+0.8%), and information technology (+0.6%) sectors outperformed in a defensive-minded trade that excluded the health care sector (-0.5%).Generally, investors remained nervous about election volatility, the prospects for another fiscal relief bill, the trajectory of the coronavirus, and U.S.-China relations. On stimulus, House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) will reportedly introduce a $2.4 trillion relief bill, but it's unlikely to have the support of Republicans.Regarding the economy, the labor market remained in poor standing as weekly jobless claims increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000). New home sales, however, rose 4.8% m/m in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) -- its highest rate since November 2006.Interestingly, a pair of analysts turned bullish on some battered financial stocks. Goldman Sachs (GS 195.11, +8.99, +4.8%) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at UBS, and Wells Fargo (WFC 23.32, +0.49, +2.2%) was added to the Fresh Pick List at Robert W. Baird.U.S. Treasuries traded within another narrow range and closed little changed. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 94.33. WTI crude futures gained 0.9%, or $0.37, to $40.31/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:Jobless claims for the week ending September 19 increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000) while continuing claims for the week ending September 12 decreased by 167,000 to 12.580 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial jobless claims remain at stunningly high levels that point to the ongoing challenges U.S. businesses face getting back on a pre-pandemic track. In the same period a year ago, initial jobless claims were 215,000.New home sales in August did something they haven't done since November 2006 -- exceed a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.0 million. Specifically, they rose 4.8% m/m to 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) and were up 43.2% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects strong demand for new homes at more affordable price points, as the South region, which is the largest homebuilding region and features lower average prices, saw sales increase 13.4% m/m.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for August on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +18.9% YTDS&P 500 +0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -6.0% YTDRussell 2000 -13.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1439/1513. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1356/1928.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: September 25, 2020End of Document

For its part, WRK (along with industry peers like Int'l Paper (IP 41.32, +2.11, +5.38%), Packaging Corp (PKG 109.16, +4.89, +4.69%), and Domtar (UFS 26.76, +1.11, +4.33%)) benefit from rumors of a price hike, ILMN continues to bounce of Grail-related weakness, with NOW reaping the benefits of a broader bounce in tech.Conversely, Houston-based oil&gas producer Apache (APA 9.98, -0.92, -8.44%) is again one of the worst-performing names in the index as energy (-0.37%) is again the worst-performing group in the S&P 500.14:00 ETDow +192.16 at 26997.6, Nasdaq +170.91 at 10843.2, S&P +33.02 at 3279.61[BRIEFING.COM] The steady climb in the major averages continued in the last half hour with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (+1.60%) still out front.Gold futures settled $10.60 lower (-0.6%) to $1,866.30/oz, notching its fourth loss in five sessions, amid this week's strength in the greenback.The U.S. Dollar Index sits higher by about +0.3% to $94.64.13:30 ETDow +142.64 at 26948.08, Nasdaq +138.90 at 10811.19, S&P +25.63 at 3272.22[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have marched steady toward session highs in the last half hour with the DJIA (+0.53%) still at the bottom of the standings.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that UnitedHealth (UNH 298.62, +5.96, +2.04%), Intel (INTC 49.77, +0.61, +1.24%), and Honeywell (HON 160.69, +1.93, +1.22%) are outperforming.Conversely, athletic retailer Nike (NKE 122.74, -2.01, -1.61%) sits at the bottom of the index.The DJIA now stands -5.21% lower on the month.12:55 ETDow +96.16 at 26901.6, Nasdaq +121.56 at 10793.85, S&P +19.47 at 3266.06[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.6% to trim its weekly decline, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 1.1% to trade relatively unchanged for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%, and the Russell 2000 is up 0.7%.The trading range has been tighter than yesterday's range, suggesting a general lack of conviction amid ongoing uncertainties that include politics and the economy. Understandably, some investors are distrustful of today's advance given the downwards momentum, and volatility, this month and any tactical activity caused by month-end/quarter-end rebalancing.At this juncture, the S&P 500 information technology sector (+1.3%) is at the leadership position, followed by industrials (+0.8%) and real estate (+0.7%). The energy (-1.1%) and consumer staples (-0.3%) sectors underperform in negative territory.The mega-caps are stepping up today, with Apple (AAPL 110.27, +2.05, +1.9%) and Microsoft (MSFT 206.29, +3.14, +1.6%) trading comfortably higher. Smaller cyclical stocks are also seeing gains following some positive-minded analyst recommendations.Barclays upgraded cruise lines Norwegian (NCLH 16.08, +1.45, +9.9%), Royal Caribbean (RCL 63.80, +3.84, +6.4%), and Carnival (CCL 14.83, +1.09, +7.9%) to Overweight from Equal Weight. The Benchmark Company upgraded Norfolk Southern (NSC 217.62, +3.19, +1.5%) and CSX (CSX 77.54, +0.96, +1.3%) to Buy from Hold.Costco (COST 339.94, -7.06, -2.0%) is bucking the positive trend despite beating EPS estimates and reporting in-line revenue and comparable sales results. Telsey Advisory Group liked what it saw, raising its price target on the stock to $390 from $385 after the report.Reviewing today's economic data:Durable goods orders increased 0.4% m/m in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.9%) following an upwardly revised 11.7% increase (from 11.2%) in July. Excluding transportation, orders were also up 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.0%) following an upwardly revised 3.2% increase (from 2.4%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that order increases were seen across most categories, as manufacturing needs continued to recover from their pandemic depression, yet total orders are still down 11.3% yr/yr (down 3.0%, ex-transportation). ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1817/1140. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2281/1063.12:25 ETDow +44.75 at 26850.19, Nasdaq +107.09 at 10779.38, S&P +13.98 at 3260.57[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.5%, and the Nasdaq is up 1.0% in a tech-driven gain.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Apple (AAPL 110.46, +2.24, +2.1%) setting the leadership pace with a 2% gain. No other member is up more than 1.0% but neither one is trading lower. Microsoft (MSFT 206.46, +3.25, +1.6%) is another mega-cap in the green.Shares of Peloton (PTON 96.03, +7.53, +8.5%) are up 8.5% in a continuation of the stay-at-home trade that has propelled the stock nearly 400% since March 13.11:55 ETDow +21.93 at 26827.37, Nasdaq +95.79 at 10768.08, S&P +10.84 at 3257.43[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has traded in a tighter range than yesterday, reflecting a lack of conviction amid a host of uncertainties in the market, including politics and the economy. The S&P 500 is up 0.3% and is on track for its fourth straight weekly decline.Some analyst recommendations that stand out today include Amazon (AMZN 3037.28, +18.04, +0.6%) being resumed with an Overweight rating at Piper Sandler and ConocoPhillips (COP 33.27, -0.33, -1.0%) being initiated with an Overweight rating at KeyBanc.Regarding ConocoPhillips, this is the second straight day that analysts have stepped up with positive-minded recommendations on battered cyclical stocks. Recall, Wells Fargo (WFC 23.28, -0.04, -0.2%) and Goldman Sachs (GS 192.74, -2.37, -1.2%) were yesterday's top calls in the financials sector from a pair of analysts.11:30 ETDow +100.03 at 26905.47, Nasdaq +131.12 at 10803.41, S&P +20.02 at 3266.61[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.6% but remains below yesterday's intraday high (3278.70). Transports are having a good day.UPS (UPS 166.41, +5.98, +3.7%) is setting the direction of the Dow Jones Transportation Average (+1.2%) as it trades near all-time highs. FedEx (FDX 249.19, +4.97, +2.0%) follows behind with a 2% gain. Expectations for a busy, and profitable, holiday shipping season have helped both stocks outperform recently.The S&P 500 industrials sector is up 0.7%, as it also gets a boost from a 3.5% gain in Boeing (BA 151.11, +5.09, +3.5%).10:55 ETDow +54.07 at 26859.51, Nasdaq +87.43 at 10759.72, S&P +10.79 at 3257.38[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.4% to trade near session highs. The Nasdaq is up 0.8%, benefiting from the gains in technology and mega-cap stocks.The information technology sector (+0.9%) has assumed the sector leadership, led by Apple (AAPL 110.09, +1.88, +1.7%), Microsoft (MSFT 205.02, +1.89, +0.9%), and NVIDIA (NVDA 500.18, +6.31, +1.3%). Tech has performed relatively well over the past two sessions, which has been viewed as a good sign for the market in the short-term.On the other hand, the energy sector remains the place to avoid despite the contrarian bargains in the space. The sector is down another 1.0% today to extend its weekly decline to 9.6%. Lower oil prices ($40.15/bbl, -0.16, -0.4%) have pressured sentiment.10:25 ETDow -12.43 at 26793.01, Nasdaq +60.85 at 10733.14, S&P +2.99 at 3249.58[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is back in positive territory with a 0.1% gain, following a similar indecisive pattern from yesterday.In corporate news, London bookmaker William Hill (WIMHY 14.72, +3.41, +30.2%) has received separate cash proposals from Caesar Entertainment (CZR 57.02, +4.18, +7.9%) and Apollo Management International LLP.

On a related note, Telsey Advisory Group raised its price target on the stock to $390 from $385.Apple (AAPL 108.81, +0.55, +0.5%) is helping offset some of the broader weakness in the market with a modest 0.5% gain. The stock is down nearly 16% this month, versus a 7.5% decline in the S&P 500 over the same period.09:40 ETDow -114.30 at 26691.14, Nasdaq -21.16 at 10651.13, S&P -12.64 at 3233.95[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices begin the session on a lower note.

The Nasdaq Composite increased 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 finished flat.The S&P 500 started the day lower by 0.9%, extending the month's pullback and briefly turning negative for the year, before the dip buyers stepped in. By the afternoon, the benchmark index was up 1.3% but sellers regained control on no specific news. The inability to sustain another rebound was disappointing for the bulls but not necessarily bearish.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in positive territory, even as declining issues edged out advancing issues at both the NYSE and Nasdaq. The utilities (+1.2%), consumer staples (+0.8%), and information technology (+0.6%) sectors outperformed in a defensive-minded trade that excluded the health care sector (-0.5%).Generally, investors remained nervous about election volatility, the prospects for another fiscal relief bill, the trajectory of the coronavirus, and U.S.-China relations. On stimulus, House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) will reportedly introduce a $2.4 trillion relief bill, but it's unlikely to have the support of Republicans.Regarding the economy, the labor market remained in poor standing as weekly jobless claims increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000). New home sales, however, rose 4.8% m/m in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) -- its highest rate since November 2006.Interestingly, a pair of analysts turned bullish on some battered financial stocks.

The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3%, and the Russell 2000 rose 1.6%. The session started mixed, little changed, choppy, and without leadership amid a host of ongoing uncertainties in the market. Those uncertainties, some of which pertain to politics and the economy, weren't cleared up today due to few macro developments, but it appeared the market wasn't going to get dismayed by the unknown.On no specific news, Apple (AAPL 112.29, +4.07, +3.8%), Microsoft (MSFT 207.82, +4.63, +2.3%), and NVIDIA (NVDA 514.95, +21.03, +4.3%) -- to name few technology mega-caps -- assumed their old leadership roles. The gains broadened out to ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors by the close. The top-weighted information technology sector (+2.4%) finished atop the standings with a 2.4% gain, followed by real estate (+2.0%), health care (+1.7%), and consumer discretionary (+1.6%). The energy sector (-0.1%) briefly turned positive late in the day but was unable to close positive, reflecting a lack of investor confidence in the space. The cruise line industry, meanwhile, could be on the verge of an inflection point, according to Barclays. The firm upgraded Royal Caribbean (RCL 64.59, +4.62, +7.7%), Carnival (CCL 15.07, +1.33, +9.7%), and Norwegian (NCLH 16.63, +2.00, +13.7%) to Overweight from Equal Weight on a favorable risk/reward profile. Costco (COST 342.58, -4.42, -1.3%) was a notable exception today despite the company beating earnings estimates and reporting in-line revenue and comparable sales results. On a related note, Telsey Advisory Group raised its price target on the stock to $390 from $385. The U.S. Treasury market remained uneventful. The 2-yr yield finished flat at 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.66%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.3% to 94.59. WTI crude futures shed 0.2%, or $0.09, to settle at $40.22/bbl. Reviewing Friday's economic data:• Durable goods orders increased 0.4% m/m in August (Briefing.com consensus +0.9%) following an upwardly revised 11.7% increase (from 11.2%) in July. Excluding transportation, orders were also up 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.0%) following an upwardly revised 3.2% increase (from 2.4%) in July.The key takeaway from the report is that order increases were seen across most categories, as manufacturing needs continued to recover from their pandemic depression, yet total orders are still down 11.3% yr/yr (down 3.0%, ex-transportation).Looking ahead, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for September, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for July, and the Advance August readings for Intl Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories will be released on Monday. • Nasdaq Composite +21.6% YTD• S&P 500 +2.1% YTD• Dow Jones Industrial Average -4.8% YTD• Russell 2000 -11.6% YTDNASDAQ - 2381 - 934 - 3.7 blnNYSE - 2138 - 831 - 800.0 mlnDJ30 - +358.52 - 27163.96NASDAQ - +241.30 - 10913.59SP500 - +51.87 - 3298.46Piling on the gains, weekly losses almost erased - Sep 25 - 15:25 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now up 1.8% and is making a run to even/positive for the week.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%, and the Russell 2000 is up 0.7%. The trading range has been tighter than yesterday's range, suggesting a general lack of conviction amid ongoing uncertainties that include politics and the economy.

The Nasdaq Composite increased 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.2%, and the Russell 2000 finished flat. The S&P 500 started the day lower by 0.9%, extending the month's pullback and briefly turning negative for the year, before the dip buyers stepped in. By the afternoon, the benchmark index was up 1.3% but sellers regained control on no specific news. The inability to sustain another rebound was disappointing for the bulls but not necessarily bearish.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in positive territory, even as declining issues edged out advancing issues at both the NYSE and Nasdaq. The utilities (+1.2%), consumer staples (+0.8%), and information technology (+0.6%) sectors outperformed in a defensive-minded trade that excluded the health care sector (-0.5%).  Generally, investors remained nervous about election volatility,  the prospects for another fiscal relief bill, the trajectory of the coronavirus, and U.S.-China relations. On stimulus, House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) will reportedly introduce a $2.4 trillion relief bill, but it's unlikely to have the support of Republicans. Regarding the economy, the labor market remained in poor standing as weekly jobless claims increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000). New home sales, however, rose 4.8% m/m in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) -- its highest rate since November 2006. Interestingly, a pair of analysts turned bullish on some battered financial stocks. Goldman Sachs (GS 195.11, +8.99, +4.8%) was upgraded to Buy from Hold at UBS, and Wells Fargo (WFC 23.32, +0.49, +2.2%) was added to the Fresh Pick List at Robert W. Baird.U.S. Treasuries traded within another narrow range and closed little changed. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield decreased one basis point to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 94.33. WTI crude futures gained 0.9%, or $0.37, to $40.31/bbl.Reviewing Thursday's economic data:• Jobless claims for the week ending September 19 increased by 4,000 to 870,000 (Briefing.com consensus 825,000) while continuing claims for the week ending September 12 decreased by 167,000 to 12.580 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial jobless claims remain at stunningly high levels that point to the ongoing challenges U.S. businesses face getting back on a pre-pandemic track. In the same period a year ago, initial jobless claims were 215,000.• New home sales in August did something they haven't done since November 2006 -- exceed a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.0 million. Specifically, they rose 4.8% m/m to 1.011 million (Briefing.com consensus 875,000) and were up 43.2% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects strong demand for new homes at more affordable price points, as the South region, which is the largest homebuilding region and features lower average prices, saw sales increase 13.4% m/m.Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for August on Friday.• Nasdaq Composite +18.9% YTD• S&P 500 +0.5% YTD• Dow Jones Industrial Average -6.0% YTD• Russell 2000 -13.0% YTDNASDAQ - 1356 - 1928 - 4.0 blnNYSE - 1439 - 1513 - 928.0 mlnDJ30 - +52.31 - 26805.44NASDAQ - +39.28 - 10672.29SP500 - +9.67 - 3246.59Load-Date: September 25, 2020End of Document

TikTok resorts to U.S. justice to avoid its banCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 24, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 385 wordsBodyThe TikTok video sharing app, owned by Chinese company Bytedance, has resorted to a Washington courthouse to try to stop the veto with which the Donald Trump Administration threatens. The White House decided last week to order app stores (Google and Apple) to remove the popular app and prevent updates to users who already have it installed. The ban was due to take effect last Sunday, but it has been delayed to Sunday this week.The White House considers TikTok to be a threat to national security. Despite being a California-based American company, it belongs to a Chinese parent company and the U.S. government understands that it is required to share all data it obtains from American users with the Chinese government. Last August, Donald Trump signed an executive order that in practice forced TikTok to negotiate his sale to an American company or cease its activity in the country. The veto extends to the Chinese messaging app WeChat.Months of negotiations, in which the company received a powerful offering from Microsoft, ended last week with an agreement creating a new company, called TikTok Global, based in the US involving 20% of database giant Oracle and supermarket chain Walmart. Last September 19, Trump said he had given his "blessing" to the deal, that his terms guaranteed the safety of TikTok's operations, and that the new company was going to create 25,000 jobs in the U.S.Trump changed his mind on Monday, and announced that he would not approve any agreement in which Bytedance, the Chinese parent company, retained a stake in TikTok. The Chinese parent company would hold 80% of the property until the company goes on the stock exchange, an operation that can last a year.The operation is also complicated by China's side. The Beijing government approved a rule that prevents TikTok from selling its algorithm, the true heart of the company's value, without a license. The company has requested this license.The brief filed in the District of Columbia court asks the judge for a precautionary paralysis of the White House order that may make the country's application disappear on Sunday. TikTok argues that there is no urgency to justify this measure and that it has made "extraordinary efforts to meet changing government demands all the time and alleged national security concerns."Load-Date: September 25, 2020End of Document

Is Banning TikTok & WeChat Downloads This SundayStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 19, 2020 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 675 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyThe ban could also impact USA companies that allow payment via WeChat, since the restrictions prohibit services through theWeChat mobileapp for the goal of transferring funds or processing payments within the U.S.In May, state-run tabloid Global Times reported the measures would target such US companies as Apple Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Qualcomm Inc, while suspending purchases of Boeing Co airplanes.Like most social networking sites, both TikTok andWeChat collect user data, including location and messages to track what kind of targeted ad content is most applicable to them.Its implementation comes just a day after the US Commerce Department stepped up the pressure by ordering a ban ondownloads of videoappTikTok and effectively blocking use ofWeChat, the Chinese super-app.TheTrump administration has ramped up efforts to purge "untrusted" Chineseapps from USA digital networks amid escalating tensions with Beijing on a range of issues from trade and human rights to the battle for tech supremacy.That language closely tracks wording that Beijing has used to repeatedly denounce United States actions against Chinese companies.Since taking office in 2017,Trump has started a trade war with China and banned products from Huawei, a Chinese maker of communications equipment.It covers "foreign enterprises, other organisations and individuals", the ministry said.Additionally, companies that make up the backbone of the internet, such as web hosting services and server networks, will be prohibited from hosting or carryingWeChat internet traffic from Sunday onwards, the Department of Commerce said in a release."While there is significant cause for concern withTikTok's security, privacy, and its relationship with the Chinese government, we should resist a governmental power to ban a popular means of communication and expression".President Trump givesupdates on the potentialTikTok deal.Jose Mourinho hails £65m Tanguy Ndombele after he rescued TottenhamBut the distance they have to travel metaphorically to get back to where they are expected to be is much, much further even than that."China urges the United States to abandon bullying, immediately stop wrongdoing, and earnestly maintain fair and transparent global rules and order. If the United States insists on going its own way, China will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies", the statement reads.Officials saidWeChat's functionality would be affected immediately after the ban takes effect, even though some services might still work.Someone else tweeted: "I still think it's because ofTrump's vengeance againstTikTok for sabotaging his rally. It's a serious restriction on the First Amendment rights of United States citizens and residents", said Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.Subscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.In practice, anyone usingTikTok orWeChat on their phone won't see theapps suddenly disappear. (TikTok is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance.) The deal would also lead to about 20,000 new American jobs, Mnuchin said.WeChat is widely used among Chinese expats to keep in touch with people back home.What does it mean forWeChat users in the US?WeChat has more than 1 billion users and about 19 million daily active users in the U.S. It is especially popular among Chinese students and Americans who have personal or business relationships in China.TikTok is expected to function through November 12, the deadline set under an executive order byTrump, but users would not be able todownloadupdates to the videoapp.TikTok says it has 100 million USA users and 700 million globally. The order follows weeks of wrangling with the company, which recently struck a deal with USA -based software maker Oracle, the details of which have yet to be announced."Trump's decision is likely further to splinter the internet", said Darrell West, director of the center for technology innovation at the Brookings Institution.Load-Date: September 19, 2020End of Document

SoftBank will get an ownership stake in NVIDIA, expected to be under 10%. At first, this may seem like an odd combination but it makes sense when one digs into it.NVDA is known for making graphics chips for videogames, but it's real sweet spot is its data center chips. Its data center segment is seeing booming demand and the recent shift to at-home work/learning is fueling this segment even more. NVDA is also very involved in artificial intelligence (AI) and automation applications.Arm Holdings is a bit different. Arm is not a manufacturing company. It's more of a neutral designer of chips and it licenses its technology to a wide variety of semiconductor companies who then build chips using Arm's designs. Arm's technologies are used in everything from sensors to smartphones to supercomputers. The company's designs power roughly 90% of all smartphones.The combination brings together NVDA's AI computing platform with the vast ecosystem of Arm's CPU. NVDA says the combination will turbocharge Arm's R&D capacity and expand Arm's IP portfolio with NVDA's GPU and AI technology. In the years ahead, trillions of computers running AI will create a new internet-of-things that is thousands of times larger than today's internet-of-people, according to NVDA.There could be some troubles ahead.Arm is known as a neutral provider of technology and Arm's current licensees may not be too thrilled with a competitor owning Arm. NVDA counters this by saying Arm will continue to operate its open-licensing model, it will maintain its customer neutrality and Arm will maintain its name while continuing to be based in the UK. However, this could cause some uneasiness going forward. This deal could face regulatory hurdles as both the US and China will need to sign off on the transaction. With US-China tensions running high and with the US recently blocking Broadcom's (AVGO) bid for Qualcomm (QCOM), China may not approve the deal.Based on the stock reaction today, it's clear that NVDA shareholders are excited about this deal. Assuming the deal goes through and it's not a slam dunk, NVDA would gain massive exposure to the smartphone market and a deal would open up a world of new applications for the company's AI technology.10:11 ETOracle emerges as winner in TikTok deal, but key details still lacking:In a surprising twist of events, Oracle (ORCL) has reportedly emerged as the winning bidder for TikTok's U.S. business. When President Trump ordered China-based ByteDance to sell the U.S. TikTok operations last month, Microsoft (MSFT) quickly surfaced as the front-runner to buy the assets.Last night, however, ByteDance turned down MSFT's offer, choosing instead to hammer out a deal with ORCL.The terms of that deal are very murky, though. In fact, it's not even known whether ORCL is taking a majority ownership position in TikTok. Several reports indicate that the arrangement is set to be more like a partnership than an outright acquisition.Due to the unprecedented circumstances surrounding this forced sale, as well as the mounting tension between the U.S. and China, the path to this clouded outcome has been a winding one.After the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) expressed concerns that TikTok user data was being shared with the Chinese government, President Trump imposed a September 20th deadline for ByteDance to sell the business.Unsurprisingly, China balked at the assertion and updated the country's technology export control rules. Specifically, any company considering selling technology to an outside party must gain permission from the Chinese government. This includes TikTok's proprietary algorithm.This new law threw a wrench in any proposed transaction because TikTok's algorithm is a vital component behind the success and popularity of the app. Specifically, the algorithm uses machine learning to queue up videos and memes that match a user's interests.Without the algorithm, ORCL would have to attempt to recreate it, which would be a time-consuming, and possibly unsuccessful, endeavor. It's also unclear whether CFIUS will approve a deal without the algorithm.There's plenty of uncertainty swirling around this arrangement, but it's clear why ORCL is interested in TikTok. The app, which has 100 mln users in the U.S., is growing by leaps-and-bounds. ByteDance believes TikTok will generate revenue of $6 bln next year, which is enough to significantly move the needle for ORCL. Analysts are currently forecasting that ORCL will post about $40 bln in revenue for FY21.ORCL would house TikTok's data, which is currently stored in Alphabet's (GOOG) cloud. This would allow ORCL to structure and monetize the rapidly expanding data.Traditionally known for on-premise database software, ORCL has shifted its focus to cloud storage and application software in order to spark stronger growth. Bringing TikTok on board would not only accelerate this transition, but it would also diversify ORCL's business by adding social media to the mix.The benefits for ORCL could be substantial. Like other aspects of this deal, it's unknown whether ORCL paid a hefty price to make this transaction happen. A couple weeks ago, reports suggested that TikTok was seeking as much as $50 bln for its U.S. assets.More information should be emerging very soon, so stay tuned.

Feds To Ban TikTok And WeChat Downloads In The US Starting SundayStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 18, 2020 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 572 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyThe U.S. government acknowledges that individuals might find work-arounds to update the apps and that it doesn't intend to haul a person using WeChat before a federal judge, one official said.The company has repeatedly stressed that US user data is stored domestically, with a backup in Singapore, and that it has no ties to the Chinese government.But whileWeChat will effectively be shut down from Sunday in the United States, existing TikTok users will be able to continue using the video-sharing app until Nov 12 - when it would also face a full ban on its U.S. operations.TikTok expressed "disappointment" over the move and said it would continue to challenge President Donald Trump's "unjust executive order".WeChat's dominance means many Western companies that operate in China, from hotel chains to food companies, rely on the app to market their goods there, Kennedy said.In a court filing Wednesday, theTrump administration underscored the complexity of cutting ties withWeChat, a ubiquitous app in China that is also used by many Chinese speakers in the United States, some of whom filed a lawsuit trying to block the government from taking action against the app.Over time, officials said, the lack of updates will degrade the apps' usability. Tencent has at least 250 USA -based employees.The US government is also aware that other apps may see an opportunity to fill the gap left byWeChat andTikTok.Mysterious match-up as giant planet spotted orbiting tiny starThe planet in question is called WD 1856 b and is about the same size as Jupiter and seven times larger than the star it orbits. By using data collected by ground-based telescopes, the team was also able to get an estimate for how massive the planet is.Under the current proposal from Oracle, the US -based company wouldn't actually buyTikTok outright, but instead act as a "security partner" to ensure that user data from Americans wasn't compromised.According to NBC News correspondent Jo Ling Kent, sources say the deal would involveTikTok becoming a global company headquartered in America, withOracle taking responsibility for US operations and user data and ByteDance retaining majority ownership. This shouldn't have an effect on either app elsewhere in the world as even American companies are allowed to deal with ByteDance outside of the US.ByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CGTN.The order also warns that any other company found to be engaging in "WeChat's orTikTok's illicit behaviour" - which, again, is still something we don't have many details about - will face a ban as well.The Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a trade group, said the rule puts an "unnecessary burden on US companies", and that it "puts consumers at risk by cutting them off from software updates including necessary security updates".The long-awaited action againstTikTok, which is owned by ByteDance, andWeChat, owned by Tencent Holdings, intensifies US curbs on Chinese tech as part of a wide-ranging battle over tech betweenWashington and Beijing. Nine out of 10 companies surveyed by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai said the ban would hurt their Chinese operations, should the ban extend to China.Launched by Tencent in 2011,WeChat has become the go-to example of China's capacity to innovate. Chairman and Chief Executive Pony Ma has been a member of the rubber-stamp National People's Congress since 2013.Load-Date: September 19, 2020End of Document

TikTok must be based in the United States and controlled by investors in the same country, according to the White HouseCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 2, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 308 wordsBodyUsa.- According to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the TikTok app must be based in the United States and controlled by investors in the same country, I say on Wednesday the White House official.Last month white house economic Casa Blancaadviser Larry Kudlow said it is clear what role the Chinese government will assume after the agreement, he added that it is unclear what role the Chinese government will assume after the agreement is unclear.Last Sunday, a U.S. judge issued an order preventing Donald Trump's administration from banning downloads and updates from china's TikToksocial network, something that could have happened this midnight, at least until Justice re-utters, as reported by EFE.                                 Judge Carl J. Nichols of the Federal Court of the District of Columbia thus agreed to the request of the Chinese firm's attorneys, who sought a temporary blockade of the possible ban while the two sides face off in court.According to the Oracle and Walmart version - which will control 20% of the future firm - most of the new company will be U.S.-owned, but according to ByteDance, they will control the remaining 80% until their IBRO takes place with an initial public offering within about a year.The version of the agreement offered by ByteDance would therefore not satisfy the terms of Trump's executive order.Nichols' decision definitively brings to Justice a dispute that began in August, when Trump issued an executive order threatening to ban TikTok in the U.S. if the owner firm, China's ByteDance, did not sell its business in the country to U.S. companies.TikTok, which has 100 million users in the United States and 700 million worldwide, is one of the most growing social networks in recent years, and has become the main entertainment for many teens and a marketing channel for major celebrities.  Load-Date: October 3, 2020End of Document

Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, October 20th.Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.Countdown to 2020. The November election is on. Now just two short weeks away. President Trump is headed to Arizona today. Joe Biden is calling a lid on it after -- until after Thursday's debate. And mute buttons for each candidate making an appearance at this upcoming debate Thursday night.All this as new documents appear to show Hunter Biden's signature on the paperwork from a Delaware repair shop where he allegedly dropped off his laptop detailing overseas business deals and payouts to him while his father was vice president.Former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon is here this morning to talk about the very latest on these newest findings and what they mean for the election.Markets this morning are rallying. Take a look at futures indicating a triple digit gain at the start of trading this morning, up 202 points. The Nasdaq is up 91, and the S&P 500 up 26.We're getting earnings from the third quarter. We're just reporting a double beat from Travelers. We're standing by for Phillip Morris, Lockheed Martin and Procter & Gamble. Earnings really driving the story for stocks this week.It was a rough start to the week yesterday, though, because investors were focused on stimulus that never happened. Big technologies also sold off. That dragged down markets. The Dow Industrials were down 410 points, the Nasdaq was down 192 and the S&P lower by 56.We are watching any stimulus talks this morning. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are holding talks as Pelosi's 48 hour deadline for a deal will end today.President Trump's latest endorsement. Why rapper 50 Cent says the president will help him keep his money close to the vest.And let's taco about it. Taco Bell wants to give you a freebie during baseball's biggest game. It's making a buzz this morning.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.European markets this morning are mixed. FT 100 is up 20 points, the CAC quarante is up 27, but the DAX index is lower by 32. As you see, fractional moves there.In Asia overnight, also fractional moves. The best performer was the Shanghai composite in China. And that index was up about 0.5 percent.Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning right now.Fox News has obtained new documents appearing to show Hunter Biden's signature and approving repair work on his laptop computer. That laptop, it also shows his name in the bill to section. The FBI paperwork is also being revealed. That contains serial numbers and hard drives taken into possession from the Delaware repair shop owner. All of this because on that laptop are e-mails that show Hunter Biden's business dealings overseas in China, in Ukraine, Kazakhstan. He was working for a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president and he was getting payouts for introducing people to his father. We have more of that coming up.Over a dozen Republicans are urging Attorney General Bill Barr, meanwhile, to appoint a special council probing former Vice President Biden. I asked John Ratcliffe about that yesterday. We'll keep watching whether or not a special counsel is named.President Trump is headed to Pennsylvania today with First Lady Melania Trump. This is her first rally in more than a year, her first appearance since recovering from the coronavirus.Joe Biden, however, says he's staying off the campaign trail this week to prepare for the Thursday presidential debate, which is going to be a big one.The commission on presidential debates announced a major format change for the final debate. Candidate's microphones will be muted while their rival delivers their opening two minute answer for each of the debate topics.Federal prosecutors unsealed charges against six Russian intelligence operators, accused of some of the biggest cyberattacks in recent years, including the 2016 hacking of the DNC and a set of ransomware attacks costing the global community billions of dollars. Five of the six were added to the FBI's most wanted list. The group known as the Sandworms are considered to be among the most capable and dangerous hacking groups in the world.Breaking news, Procter & Gamble out with its quarterly results.Let's get right to Cheryl Casone with the numbers here.Looks like a beat, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: It is a double beat. And look at that Dow component go. It's up about 2.25 percent. The estimate for earnings per share, $1.42. they came in $1.63. This is home cleaning products, folks. The revenue estimate, $18.38 billion. They came in at $19.32 billion.The company planning to return in cash to shareholders about 15 to 17 billion over the fiscal year. Organic sales up 9 percent for the company. They also saw a lot of strength in their fabric and their home care products. And, again, this is a company that is focused on, of course, keeping your home clean during a pandemic.There is that Dow component higher.Real quick, Maria, Travelers. This is really kind of the barometer for the insurance industry, so I wanted to bring this to you. They did have a nice beat on earnings per share. The estimate was $3.03. They came in at $3.12, $7.55 billion revenue estimate. They came in at $8.28 billion.By the way, they actually booked a little more than $400 thanks to Pacific Gas and Electric out in California, all those fires. They exited bankruptcy. That actually was a cash return to Travelers because they'd been paying out a lot of those policies.So, again, a couple of Dow components we're watching for you this morning. And there's Travelers, up about 1 percent.Maria, back to you.BARTIROMO: And with these moves in the stocks, Cheryl, we got a bump up in the Dow Industrials right now. The Dow up 206 points. This is about the high of the morning as this market is being driven by better than expected earnings.Time for the "Word on Wall Street," top investors watching your money this week.And joining me right now is "The Gartman Letter" Editor and Publisher Dennis Gartman, CFRA Director of Equity Research Ken Leon, and Payne Capital Management President Ryan Payne.Gentlemen, thank you so much for being here.RYAN PAYNE, PRESIDENT, PAYNE CAPITAL MARKETS: Great to be here.BARTIROMO: I want to talk about earnings, but let's get to stimulus first, pushing markets higher this morning ahead of a new deadline for a deal. I'm not sure if any stimulus actually materializes, honestly. I'm not buying it. But the major averages closed near the lows of the day yesterday. The biggest names of technology led the declines. And I guess the sentiment turned around stimulus. The Nasdaq is now in the red for the fifth trading day in a row, marking its longest losing streak in a year.Ryan, your take on stimulus and this deadline and what's driving markets this morning.PAYNE: Yes, I'm with you, I'm not buying this stimulus either. I just don't think it's in the Democrats' interest to pass any bill here before the election.But what amazes me, Maria, is, even with no stimulus, you know, last week we had a -- a rise in coronavirus cases and we had two vaccines that were halted in their testing, is the market continued to go higher. It eked out a positive return last week.We just talked about Procter and Gamble earnings this week. They already came in better than expected. So I think you're just going to see earnings continue to do better than expected. And I think the economy's going to continue to improve without stimulus, which is a great thing. So it's really, really hard not to be bullish here.And I've been a raging bull on your show. I can't help it. And I don't think we're going to get locked down again because I just don't think you can tell Americans to go inside. I don't like to be told what to do and I just think that, you know, we're going to continue to see that economy reopen. And I think that's the narrative that you have to follow here as an investor.BARTIROMO: Yes, I think you're right, that's what's playing out. And we're seeing better than expected numbers from corporate America. Earnings season in full swing. Two Dow components, you just heard reporting before the opening bell, Procter and Gamble and Travelers, better than expected. We are crossing Phillip Morris on the screen right now.You're talking about both of these companies, P&G and Travelers, with a double beat. More than 10 percent of the S&P 500 companies have reported so far.Ken Leon, let's talk about what you're seeing, your reaction to earnings. Give us your models in terms of what kind of growth numbers we're talking about for the earnings season and the third quarter.KEN LEON, DIRECTOR OF EQUITY RESEARCH, CFRA: Well, that's great. So in terms of earnings, it's not going to be an investment worry. It's a question of the reduction of earnings decline, which was 21 percent down for the third quarter. Probably down about 10 to 12 percent in the fourth quarter.And it's the theme of going from red in 2020 to earnings in the black for 2021. And the sectors really tell the story. It's a question whether if the consumer is healthy, consumer discretionary gets stronger in terms of earnings. Additionally, production in the industrial sector. And you know what, Maria, you know, the earnings beats are great but we've got to look to the FANG stocks because investor expectations are so, so high for technology. And I think that really sums up the third to the fourth quarter is not only getting the decline of the red, but earnings beats really helps this market more and supports valuation.BARTIROMO: Yes. And let me just point out that Procter & Gamble, this morning, is raising its guidance for sales for the rest of the year. The stock is up this morning and that's one of the reasons that the Dow Industrials are now at the highs of the morning with a gain of 207 points. Procter & Gamble is a Dow component. That's up about 3 percent.Do you think we're going to see good earnings? It's up one and a third percent, pardon me. Are we going to see good earnings, do you think, in 2021, Ken, real quick?LEON: I think we will. And, again, it's going to be tech (ph) consumers. The ones that will stay in the red is energy and real estate. So the rest of the market, I think, is going to be very strong. And we're going to see positive year over year earnings in 2021 for sure.BARTIROMO: All right.We're also, of course, looking for the election volatility.Dennis, you point out it's not the resident of the White House that matters most, but instead who is at the head of the Federal Reserve.DENNIS GARTMAN, EDITOR AND PUBLISHER, "THE GARTMAN LETTER": Yes.BARTIROMO: Your outlook on monetary policy, it's pretty unanimous though at the Fed, right, that you're going to see rock bottom rates until 2024.GARTMAN: Well, I'm not convinced that we're going to see rock bottom rates until 2024. That's an awful long period of time into the future. To me, long term is next -- until -- often until next Tuesday or so.But let's just say that the Fed has made it abundantly clear that it intends to keep the overnight Fed Funds Rate low for at least a year, maybe two. And I think what you're starting to see is inflationary pressures becoming extent (ph) in the commodity markets. Look at what's going on in the grain markets. Here's crude oil trying to get through $41.50. Gold has been relatively strong. The commodity markets are turning from the lower left to the upper right. And I think at the long end of the curve, that means higher rates at the back end. So instead of having a 157 yield on the 30 year bond, I bet we get to 2 to 2.5 or 3 percent in the next -- course of the next two or three years.So the Fed will remain expansionary, has told us they're going to. Whether they keep overnight Fed Funds Rates through 2024 at 0 percent is another person's guess. But they will stay low for a long period of time but the back end will get higher.BARTIROMO: So should people try, if they're poised to lock in a mortgage, do that sooner rather than later then, Dennis?GARTMAN: Not a question. Absolutely. These are -- these mortgage rates are unbelievable. When I bought my house 25 years ago, I think I had a 9.25 percent yield. Here we're at, what, 2.75, 2.80, 2.90, 3 percent for 30 year mortgages. I think it would be illogical and ill-advised if you didn't lock it in at this point.BARTIROMO: All right, we'll leave it there.Dennis Gartman, Ken Leon and Ryan Payne, great to see you gentlemen. Thank you so much.PAYNE: Thanks, Maria.BARTIROMO: Much more ahead this morning.Coming up, former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon is here to talk about the Hunter Biden corruption reports and a look ahead to the November decision, now exactly two weeks away.North Carolina Congressional Candidate Madison Cawthorn is here. Don't miss that. He's talking about the future of the Republican Party and the 2020 races.Plus, Trump Energy Advisor Harold Hamm on the 2020 race. Why he says a Biden victory would jack up the price of gasoline to $6 a gallon.Joining the conversation all morning long this morning, Dagen McDowell and Brian Brenberg. A lot to talk about with them when we come right back.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: More trade deals for this administration. The U.S. and Brazil announcing a limited trade deal yesterday. The new mini deal will help strengthen regulatory practices and ease commerce between the two countries while aiding a crackdown on corruption.Joining me right now is former State Department senior advisor for the Bush and Trump administrations, former North Korean human rights deputy special envoy, Christian Whiton.Christian, good to see you.You are right there in Brazil right now with the State Department delegation.What can you tell us?CHRISTIAN WHITON, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT SENIOR ADVISER: Well, it's actually led by Robert O'Brien, the national security advisor. Mike Demenka, the deputy U.S. trade representative here -- is here, as is Kimberly Reed, whose the president of the Export Import Bank. So a full court press on trade with, frankly, a country that's been promising for a long time when it comes to U.S. exports and U.S. diplomacy but just hasn't really materialized as an opportunity. And that might be changing. You know, like Donald Trump, in the United States, like Narendra Modi in India, and here with Jair Bolsonaro, the reformist president of Brazil, the unabashedly pro-capitalist president of Brazil, really an opportunity to turn Brazil away from its non-aligned past where they kept Washington at arm's length.BARTIROMO: I know that one of the main reasons for this new pact with Brazil is to thwart China's growing aspirations in South America. That was one of the goals for any mini trade deal.The shot went down in Brazil, but Christian was talking about this effort between the U.S. and Brazil to try to balance or counterbalance China's ambitions there.There you have the top exports to Brazil in 2019.Dagen McDowell, you're looking at a new realization for many countries in terms of how they view China and whether it is Brazil trying to do as much as it can with China -- with the United States, rather, to counterbalance China's ambitions, or the fact that right now 30 countries have banned Huawei and ZTE because of the predatory moves of those companies and the Chinese Communist Party.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: And in terms of trade, this is what we've been talking about for years is the United States locking arms with its trading partners to take on China and offset China's growing strength and dominance of the world, which is exactly what the Communist Party does. This goes directly to doing that.BARTIROMO: All right.Be sure to watch this space because we continue to get more news in terms of the allies of the U.S. being in step with the U.S.' moves against the Chinese Communist Party. You heard Jack Keane earlier and my conversation about China's most recent threats that it will detain American as retaliation for the indictments we saw.Be sure to preorder my new book, "The Cost: Trump, China and American Revival." It is out next week. You can preorder the book right now at thecostbook.com.We'll take a break.When we come back, 2020's economic choice. The financial consequences of a Biden victory and why that's swaying rapper 50 Cent's vote. We're going to take a look at that.Then, owning a piece of rock history. Two of Eddie Van Halen's guitars going up for auction. The price tag is making a buzz this morning.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Joe Biden's tax increases. High earnings in New York and California could face a combined federal and state tax rate of 62 percent. That's under Biden's plans.A new op-ed in "The Journal" this morning is titled "Biden's Public Option" would mean massive tax hikes, focuses on how the middle class will eventually be taxed to pay for a government run health insurance plan. The op-ed reads this, "campaign promises for large new spending programs and no new middle class taxes are easy to make, but the bill will come due at some point and the burden will fall on future taxpayers who will be forced to pay for the broken promises of today's politicians."You know, we talk about this a lot. There was also a story this week earlier, Dagen, on the cost of Biden-omics, which went through the study of Biden's tax, healthcare, energy regulation proposals, predicting $6,500 less in median household income by 2030. He keeps saying he's not going to raise taxes on anybody making more than $400,000. But when you actually peel back the number, many income levels -- most income levels are eventually going to see a tax increase.Your take?MCDOWELL: The top tax rates actually under Biden's plan will be higher than these tax foundation numbers. And I will explain why.But you mentioned that $6,500 less in median household income figure, which comes from the Hoover Institution study. It's about 50 pages. But it will also mean nearly 5 million fewer working Americans and $2.6 trillion less in GDP.If you break down the numbers, part of Joe Biden's plan is he wants to extend the Social Security payroll tax, which is 12.4 percent, to income over $400,000. The current cap being less than $138,000. That would take the top marginal tax rate to 57 percent. If you include the 3.8 percent in Medicare taxes, you add in like, say, California's tax, which is 13.3 percent, and you are looking at a top marginal rate of over 70 percent. And I know that a lot of well-paid and high earning entertainment stars are think -- are really concerned about this.BARTIROMO: Yes. And that's why you're hearing particularly from the black community supporting Donald Trump. Rapper 50 Cent is endorsing President Trump after seeing Biden's proposed tax plan. Ice Cube is also endorsing the president. He actually helped him with the platinum plan, which is making promises to the black community.Brian, your take?PROFESSOR BRIAN BRENBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. Well, you know, the not so well kept secret of the Biden tax plan is eventually it's going to hit the middle class. And the op-ed that we're referring to points out why. The spending that he's proposed doesn't add up. And the question is, how do you actually pay for what it's going to cost to do his public option, to do the education spending, to do the green new deal spending? And either you're going to throw debt through the roof or you're going to have to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it. And that's why everybody ends up paying under this plan.Joe Biden will never admit it because he'll never admit the real cost of his spending. But anybody who cares to add it up can figure it out pretty quickly. That matters for all communities. But the big point here is it doesn't just matter for the rich, it matters for the working class because when those taxes go up for them, when they go up in corporations, we end up paying for it through worse job opportunities and lower income and lower paycheck. This is an issue to everybody.MCDOWELL: Yes, to your point -- to your point, 40 million Americans are employed by pass-through entities who are taxed in the -- based on the individual tax code, not the corporate tax rate.I interviewed 50 Cent once at the New York Auto Show. I call him Curtis Jackson. He told me to call him Curtis -- Curtis, not 50.BARTIROMO: Well, it's interesting to see, you know, somebody of his caliber in the black community coming out and supporting Trump. You see increasing voices from the black community, Herschel Walker, Burgess Owens, obviously running in Utah, Kimberly Klacik in Baltimore, as well as others that we've spoken to on the show.Just want to point out that overall the authors of that Hoover study that you referred to estimate that the Biden agenda, if fully implemented, would reduce full-time equivalent employment per person by about 3 percent and the capital stock per person by 15 percent, GDP by more than 8 percent. So there's also an issue on what the policies do for the recovery and whether or not it's going to create another slow recovery as we saw under President Obama.We'll take a break.When we come back, we're going to get back to expose the corruption that we've been hearing about this week. Former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon is here to talk about the Hunter Biden reports, what it means for the 2020 election.Then, what a steal. Taco Bell wants to give you a freebie during baseball's biggest game. It's making a buzz this morning.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, October 20th.Take a look at markets this morning, 7:30 on the button on the East Coast. We've got a rally underway. Futures indicating a gain of about 200 points on the Dow Industrials. The Nasdaq up 79, and the S&P 500 higher by 25 after Dow components Travelers and Procter and Gamble reported better than expected third quarter earnings this morning. Both stocks are trading up. They are Dow components.We are standing by for Lockheed Martin numbers. As soon as we get -- oh, they're on the screen right now. And we've got a beat on earnings, as you can see, $6.25 a share versus an estimate of $6.09 a share on Lockheed Martin. We'll show you that stock coming up. Revenue is also above expectations on the defense company.Well, a departure this morning from what we saw yesterday on Wall Street. We had a rough start to the week as uncertainty over stimulus and big tech selloffs dragged down market averages. Dow Industrials were down 410 points, the Nasdaq was down 192, and the S&P was lower by 56.European markets this morning are flat. Take a look at the action there with the FT 100 up 12, the CAC quarante up 24, and the DAX index lower by 45.In Asia overnight, markets were mostly higher there, but here, too, fractional moves pretty much across the board.We're showing you the numbers on Lockheed Martin. We have breaking news with the quarterly earnings.Let's get more on what the company is saying about the future.Cheryl Casone right now you with the Lockheed quarter.Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, the future is space when it comes to Lockheed, Maria.The company just coming in with a double beat. And they also just increased their dividend, 260 per share is the dividend that they're going to be paying to their shareholders. But the earnings per share, the estimate was $6.09. They came in at $6.25. That's a strong beat for Lockheed. The revenue, $16.12 billion was the estimate, and the company came in at $16.5 billion.In particular, there's been an analyst going into the call. We're going to be looking for this. There's been a big increase for the third quarter when it comes to space infrastructure. Remember NASA just awarded that $370 million in contracts. And also they said that they've got a backlog of $150.4 billion because, remember, Lockheed, like a lot of companies, had a shutdown in the second quarter and now they're kind of catching up, if you will. And that's actually a really good story.They're also getting -- they're updating their guidance for the year and they're up -- they're giving actually positive guidance for the full fiscal year and they're looking for 2020 net sales, $65.25 million. And, again, it's a -- it's a good outlook for them.But, yes, space systems coming in $2.85 billion in sales. This is satellites. This is missiles. All of that infrastructure. And this is really what's being a good story for Lockheed. And the stock just went into the red as I was talking, Maria.But those are the headlines on Lockheed.Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you so much. We'll keep watching that.Markets pretty strong this morning. But we are turning to more questions for Hunter Biden this morning.Fox News has obtained paperwork appearing to include Hunter Biden's signature from the Mac repair store in Delaware where the former vice president's son allegedly dropped off his laptop and left it there. We've seen e-mails surfacing from that laptop over the past week, which indicate business ties between the Bidens and the governments of Ukraine and China where you have Hunter Biden getting paid out from some of these companies to the tune of tens of millions of dollars, just as his father, the vice president, was negotiating policy with these countries.I spoke with the director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe, yesterday. Our interview went viral because he talked about this not being any part of Russian disinformation and the legitimacy of these e-mails.Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: This e-mail is legitimate?JOHN RATCLIFFE, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: So, Maria, the fact that I know so little about those e-mails and what is apparently on Hunter Biden's laptop underscores the point that I just made, this is not part of some Russian disinformation campaign. The intelligence community has not been involved with Hunter Biden's laptop.Hunter Biden is a U.S. person and he would be subject to any investigation regarding fraud or corruption would be rightfully the jurisdiction of the FBI. So the FBI has had possession of this.What I can say, without commenting on any investigation that they may have into corruption or fraud, is to say that their investigation does not center around Russian disinformation and the intelligence community is playing no role with respect to that.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And, of course, DNI Ratcliffe was pushing back on Adam Schiff, with falsehoods that this is somehow tied to the Kremlin.We can report that Fox News has verified some of these e-mails on that laptop.Joining me right now is former White House Chief Strategist and the host of the popular "War Room" podcast, Steve Bannon.And, Steve, it's great to see you this morning.Tell me what you know about this, this signature on these papers indicate that, in fact, Hunter Biden did sign his laptop and leave it there in that Mac repair store.STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST: This is -- I mean Mike Emmanuel and Fox has done another great job, they've got an unredacted, you know, set of documents and they've proven now that's Hunter Biden's signature. They've got the FBI taking possession of it. They've got the subpoena from the grand jury.You know, and Ratcliffe said something very important. The FBI's had this since December of last year. I believe the president of the United States is going to have a direction conversation with the head of the FBI to say, what is going on here, right? If you had come forward with any of this, one, the president wouldn't have been impeached. The whole country could have focused on the pandemic. And Bernie Sanders would be -- or Elizabeth Warren would be the nominee for the Democratic Party.This shows you once again the FBI getting involved in a presidential election. Questions have to be -- you know, questions have to be answered. This is not about a son's drug problem. This is about a father's national security problem.The Chinese involvement here is inextricably linked with the policies of Joe Biden when he was in charge of the pivot to Asia during the Obama administration. And you've got a whole slew of -- and now with Peter Schweizer, they're coming forward with the 26,000 e-mails they have. You have a set pattern over the last 10 years of the Biden family being involved in, giving access to Chinese Communist Party intelligence assets. OK, Chinese Communist Party intelligence assets with their front as businessmen, right, coming in and getting access to Joe Biden as vice president of the United States. And afterwards, when Joe Biden was prepping his presidential run.This is a scandal of major proportions. And here's how we know it is. The Biden campaign has not come out and denied any of this and they now have Joe Biden in the witness protection program. It is absurd that the media's not all over the fact that basically for the last -- starting from Friday when this came out and Saturday and Sunday and now for the next five days, up until the debate, he's practicing policy? He's supposed to know so much more policy than Donald Trump. That's what he says every -- all day long. He doesn't need to study policy. He's in hiding. And why is he in hiding? He doesn't even want the soft mainstream media asking him any questions about this at all.But I've got to tell him, the forcing function here is going to be debate night. Donald Trump is going to come at this head on because the American people need to see this. And this is why you're seeing the momentum in the Biden campaign slowing. Biden peaked three weeks too early. You're seeing the tide recede right now. You're seeing the tide recede right now. And part of it is that people want answers to this situation with the Chinese Communist Party and his -- and his policies related to shipping factories and shipping manufacturing jobs in places like northeast Pennsylvania to China.BARTIROMO: Yes.Well, I do think it's extraordinary that there seems to be this cover-up underway from the FBI to the media. I mean Christopher Wray, you're right, was sitting on this. You have this at the FBI headquarters for a year. November, December '19. And then there was, just a month and a half later, an impeachment trial for President Trump where they were accusing him of wrong doing in Ukraine. You would think that the FBI, getting possession of this, with all of these documents indicating business back and forth, that somebody needed to raise their hand, bring this to Congress, bring this to the impeachment trial so people would know.And you mentioned that Biden has not responded. We have "The Wall Street Journal" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, the co-author of "The Cost," new book out next week, James Freeman writes this, this morning about the media coverage of the Hunter Biden story in his new piece, "Have the Bidens Denied the Story Yet?" He writes this, "some media outlets have chosen to focus their reporting on whether some journalists were afraid to touch the Biden e-mail story before "The Post" published it unless and until former Vice President Joe Biden or a member of his family wants to argue that the e-mails are fakes. Isn't there a responsibility for all journalists to acknowledge "The Post" reporting and demand answers?"Steve, this was at the same time that a sitting vice president was negotiating policy with the Chinese communist government, with officials in Ukraine, and his son is taking payouts. The media doesn't want to touch it. It's absolutely extraordinary to me that the FBI and the media could undergo -- could be undergoing this pretty much cover-up.BANNON: Maria -- Maria -- Maria, this is all -- this is also not about Hunter. And it's not a conspiracy. Remember, I'm not a conspiracy theory guy. But there are also no coincidences. I think the law of unintended consequences here is the mainstream media backing off this and talk about Russia disinformation. And social media shutting this story down is actually making it bigger and it's making it bigger to those people who matter.Low -- mid and low information voters that are kind of making their mind up of whether even to go to the polls. This is not about persuasion. It's about getting people out to vote.I think in areas like northeast Pennsylvania and Ohio, they're coming to the conclusion that the father was involved. It's not about Hunter Biden. The 10 percent equity stake is Joe Biden's. Joe Biden uses Hunter Biden as a bagman, uses his brother, James, as the front man to do this. This is about Joe Biden. He's got a national security problem. He's been compromised by the Chinese Communist Party, our greatest enemy, existential threat. And the people who put this plague out onto the Chinese people and the people throughout the world -- 40 million people are infected because of the Chinese Communist Party. Joe Biden's in business with them. Joe Biden's had 25 hours of meetings with Xi. He's never come forward with any of it.Donald Trump is going to force this out on Thursday night into a national and global TV audience. Joe Biden's not prepared for that.BARTIROMO: Yes.BANNON: His campaign's got him totally in hiding, in a witness protection program. The media's played softball, and this is where it's all going to come out that he's not prepared to be president, he's not prepared to be commander in chief. Donald Trump is going to expose him for the complete and total phony he is.BARTIROMO: Yes, but will President Trump be able to do that Thursday night? You saw the new rules from the commission on presidential debates. They say each person's going to have their microphone muted. First this debate was about foreign policy. Now they're changing it. It may not be about foreign policy given now that we have this information.I mean what's going on with the commission on presidential debates? And will President Trump be able to shine a spotlight on this story?BANNON: First -- first -- first, though, from the beginning -- from -- from the beginning, the commission's been a complete joke. And I've advocated just throwing them aside and just go one on one with the campaigns.However, muting -- you're not going to able to mute Donald Trump's voice and Donald Trump's righteous indignation about what the nation needs to hear. You're not going to stop Donald J. Trump from doing that. Donald Trump is going to expose Biden for the phony he is, the lie -- he's lied consistently about that, OK? And I want Joe Biden to have his two minutes to answer.Remember, they're not putting Joe Biden forward at all. Why? Because they know Joe Biden can't confront this. It's all -- he's been lying -- he's been lying for years. And now the lies have been exposed. And there's much more stuff coming out. There's much more stuff coming out on the -- on access to Chinese communist intelligence assets, intelligence operatives, who they've been in business with.BARTIROMO: Yes.BANNON: There's also other activity that's coming out that's total depravity, that's going to come forward. It's been checked out by independent law enforcement. It's all going to come out.BARTIROMO: OK. And you think it will come out in the next two weeks?BANNON: No, I think it's going to come out in the next 24 to 48 hours is when I think it's going to come -- it's going to be all there so Joe Biden's going to have to defend it in front of a global TV audience on Thursday night.BARTIROMO: Wow. OK. We'll be watching for that.Steve, thank you so much.The debate's going to be so important. We, of course, will be there and we're going to be covering it right here on Fox Business.Steve Bannon, great to see you. Come back soon.I just want to ask our viewers, want to divert to another subject here. Have you gotten your mammogram? We're going to talk with one of the leading producers of mammograms to tell you what's been going on during this shutdown and pandemic.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.An alarming impact of COVID-19. A new report shows cancer screenings have been declining steeply since the beginning of this pandemic because of the number of newly identified patients with any of the six major cancers has fallen by 46 percent. People are skipping their annual screening appointments because they're in a pandemic and they're just putting it off.Joining me right now is the CEO of Hologic, Steve MacMillan, which is the producer of leading mammography machines, among others.Steve, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for being here.Tell me more about this alarming trend. What are you seeing out there?STEVE MACMILLAN, CEO, HOLOGIC: Sure. Thanks so much for having us, Maria.You know, if you take a step back and you think about the incredible progress that we've really made over the last 20 or 30 of years, right, back when I was a kid and, you know, we had black and white TV, no cell phones, the TV has the little rabbit ears. You know, when you heard the word "cancer," somebody, a neighbor, a family member had, you know, breast cancer, it was equated with a death sentence. And we've made so much progress because of the early diagnosis.And so the annual mammogram and, for that matter, the annual, you know, pap test, they have dramatically improved our ability to identify the cancer early and then you can treat them. And what's happened since the pandemic is clearly, especially in that March through June period, but it still hasn't come back, just in March to June it was estimated about 285,000 women put off their screenings. And the major thing we have to do is get people in early, when you can pick it up early and it's not nearly as deadly, then you can treat it and do all -- you know, basically keep people healthy. So that's what's a shame right now is people push these things off.BARTIROMO: Well, that's right, Steve. And October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. So that's why we wanted to talk about this now. We want to make sure our viewers are keeping up with their mammograms, among others.How is Hologic encouraging patients to come back into the office, keep up with annual screenings amid the pandemic fears? And tell me about your product line, Steve, because I know that you've got among the most sophisticated screeners out there.MACMILLAN: Sure.You know, we are -- we are the ones that invented the 3-D mammogram. So it is by far the best at detecting early cancers and also eliminating the false positives. So, you know, our technology, we have been the leader. And as a leader in the industry, we've really undertaken two big initiatives to try to get women back in. First off, we've used Sheryl Crow, who has been a partner with us for about five years now and a tremendous spokesperson and partner with a Back to Screening Campaign that we kicked off in July. And we've been working it with local cities and hospitals to really encourage people to come back. And we have seen some nice resurgence but still nowhere near all the way back.We also just this month, in recognition of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, kicked off a major campaign with the Black Women's Health Initiative and also an organization, a non-profit called RAD-AID, that basically provides a lot of mammograms to particularly lower income folks in conjunction with Mary J. Blige as our spokesperson, also really boosting the awareness. Because the other thing you tend to see in these things is, women often put the rest of their family first.BARTIROMO: Right.MACMILLAN: And so they might be getting the kids taken care of and, right now, as you know, with people working from home, you have a lot of women putting everybody else ahead of themselves and not having their tests done.BARTIROMO: Yes.And, Steve, let me ask you real quick, we only have a couple of seconds here. How significant can a potential cyst or tumor grow in a year that you've put off that mammogram, that you may miss something in just one year because you're deciding, well, I'm in a pandemic, I'm going to forget this year and go next year?MACMILLAN: It can be very significant. And I'll come right from personal experience. My own mother was diagnosed first with breast cancer in 1997. Luckily, they got it very early. So we were able to deal with it. She was - - had a recurrence a few years ago. Again, because she's been doing her annual mammogram, they were able to catch it. You wait a year, it can be very different consequences.BARTIROMO: Yes.MACMILLAN: And that's what people -- and the same with cervical cancer, you know? So it really is so important to stick with those.BARTIROMO: Yes.MACMILLAN: And anybody that's put it off, don't put it off to next year. Get it scheduled. Get back in there.BARTIROMO: Yes.Steve, thanks for sharing the personal story. We so appreciate it. And thanks for your leadership. Thank you, sir. Steve MacMillan.We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Time for the "Morning Buzz."First up, amped up for the auction. Musical talent wasn't the only thing Eddie Van Halen had going for him on stage. His personalized guitars got people amped up too. Now, following the passing of the guitar legend, some of his iconic guitars are going up for auction. They could hit six figures.Dagen, you jumping in to put in an offer here?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Not yet.So, Eddie Van Halen did customized these guitars himself with tape. They're iconic, obviously. But you don't know right now how much supply is out there. One of these guitars up for auction is from a Shreveport, Louisiana, oyster house owner. So if Eddie Van Halen was signing these things and like handing them out around the globe, there could be a glut of them hitting the market. So you overpay now potentially. That's my business wisdom as a Van Halen fan.BARTIROMO: Oh, wow, I like it. That is good insight there.How about this, Taco Bell and baseball. Once again Taco Bell partners with the MLB, bringing back their steal a base, steal a taco deal. The deal offers a free taco if there's a stolen base during the World Series.

TikTok sees a light of hope in America with OracleCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 15, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 650 wordsBodyThe U.S. government will this week consider a "proposal" alliance between Chinese group ByteDance and American Oracle, to try to resolve the dispute over the popular TikTok video platform, which Donald Trump wants to close if it doesn't pass into the hands of an American firm."We received a weekend proposal that includes Oracle as a trusted technology partner, with many national security recommendations," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at CNBC.Mnuchin gave no details as to how the Partnership between Bytedance and Oracle, specializing in business software and services, would form.Oracle confirmed that it had submitted a proposal but did not disclose its content.Meanwhile, a TikTok spokeswoman said the idea "could solve security issues" that unsettle the Trump administration."This proposal would allow us to continue to support our community of 100 million people in the United States who like TikTok (...) as well as the hundreds of thousands of small business owners and creators who have TikTok to develop," he added.Trump, who has been accusing the popular social network of alleged espionage on behalf of China for months, signed decrees to force ByteDance to quickly sell TikTok's activities on American soil."We're going to discuss it in the Cfius committee (foreign investment, ndlr) this week, then we'll make a recommendation to the president and review it with him," the Treasury secretary said.He added that they will also have "with Oracle over the next few days" about data security."I don't want to go into the details of the negotiation, I'll just say that one factor that has always been critical to us is national security, ensuring that technology on American phones is secure," insisted Mnuchin, who mentioned "great trust in Microsoft and Oracle."A connoisseur of the case told The Wall Street Journal that the agreement will not be "probably structured as a sale," while some media outlets citing Chinese sources speak on Monday of a "privileged technology society" and not of a sale of TikTok's U.S. activities.CNBC also evoked the possibility of Oracle taking a minority stake in TikTok's capital.It remains to be known whether this kind of alliance would leave Trump satisfied.Time is running because the deadline went from September 15th to September 20th, that is, next Sunday.TikTok has already complained about justice against the U.S. government in this case.Oracle's stock price was suspended shortly after opening on Wall Street on Monday. After re-established, it ended with a 4.32% up to close.Microsoft was interested in buying TikTok's U.S. operations. Supermarket group Walmart, another giant, had partnered with Microsoft in this acquisition attempt that was rejected Sunday by ByteDance.- The Chinese move -"We thought Microsoft wanted to buy TikTok only with its main algorithm, a condition in which the Chinese government and ByteDance did not want to give in," Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securites, said in a note.In late August, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce amended its list of technologies with export limitations or prohibitions, which now includes artificial intelligence technologies such as those that have made TikTok successful, a platform on which videos are shown to users more according to their tastes than their contacts.ByteDance made it known that it will "strictly respect" Beijing's new rules, i.e. obtaining an export licence from the authoritiesChinese.In August, the app surpassed 2 billion downloads worldwide and claims to be present in more than 200 countries. In the United States, the social network claims to have 100 million monthly users.The war over TikTok comes as part of a broader deterioration in relations between the two major world economies for months, with the United States and China launching harsh recriminations in the commercial, human rights or coronavirus pandemic.Dt-jul/mr/gma/mr/gm/ldaLoad-Date: September 16, 2020End of Document

Four key days in pulse by TikTok control in the U.S.CE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 23, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 754 wordsBody"They're buying a lot, and if we find out they don't have full control, then we're not going to approve the deal."Donald Trump PRESIDENT OF THE U.S.TECN-@TECNOSFERAETJust over a week after the agreement between TikTok and US technology giant Oracle is known, the picture is still uncertain and variable because of the White House's position on this issue. U.S. President Donald Trump had given an ultimatum for China's social network to be sold for "national security" reasons, as a condition of continuing to operate in the United States. And in that context the agreement was reached with Oracle. On Saturday, the representative noted the pact as a success, ensuring that the social network "would have nothing to do with China" and "will be totally safe." But just two days later, the president indicated that he would not approve the agreement if ByteDance, the company to which TikTok belongs, maintained control over it. This again created total uncertainty regarding the future of the app, which has until next Sunday, September 27 as a deadline not to be blocked in the United States. The agreement On the night of Sunday, September 13, just days before the first deadline the U.S. government had given for TikTok to have U.S. capital, it was known that the cloud solutions and development company Oracle prevailed in the bid on Microsoft to keep the social network's operations in the United States. It's a career that began after Trump added to the social network in August in its trade dispute with China, ensuring that it was banning TikTok in the United States, where the app has more than 100 million downloads, for the possibility, according to the representative, that the Chinese government would use it to spy on its users' information and that would violate the privacy of Americans. Once the alliance was known, Oracle went out to confirm that the proposal had already been submitted to the U.S. Treasury Department in order to get approved and stated that it will act "as a technology provider." No further details were discussed at the time. Still, Over the weekend President Trump gave new details and stated that the well-known Walmart chain of warehouses is also within the agreement and would strengthen the business side, while Oracle would become TikTok's new cloud provider. This would create a new entity, called TikTok Global, which would generate, according to Trump, 25,000 new jobs with a possibly Texas headquarters and of which, between Oracle and Walmart, would have a joint stake of 20 percent. The two companies would pay a total of $12 billion for their shares if they accepted ByteDance's valuation of $60 billion for TikTok. Within what was established, it was determined that the board of directors would be made up of five people, four of whom would be Americans, and would have As director Doug McMillon, walmart's chief executive. Even in a joint statement, the two U.S. companies disclosed that TikTok pledged $5 billion in U.S. Treasury taxes to "create an educational initiative to develop and deliver an online video curriculum." In addition, Oracle will have full access to review TikTok source code and updates to ensure that the company's Chinese matrix does not use backdoors to collect data or spy on U.S. users of the application. However, as known so far in the agreement, ByteDance could end up owning up to 80 percent of TikTok Global, which would include application operations in the U.S. and the U.S.the rest of the world, excluding China. The turn may be one of the reasons President Trump said he could reverse his tentative approval of what was agreed between TikTok, Oracle and Walmart, as he said in recent days that he expects Chinese influence to be diluted with a future public offering from the new company. "It's going to be controlled, totally controlled by Oracle, and I guess they'll go public and buy the rest. They're buying a lot, and if we find out they have no full control, then we're not going to approve the deal," the U.S. representative said. Add to this some versions of Chinese media that have required that Beijing would reject the agreement "because it would jeopardize China's national security, interests and dignity." And the pointing by several experts that the agreement does not fully cover the concern of national security or the protection of information for which Trump initially called for banning TikTok. So far, all we have to do is wait for the next position of the US representative and if he gives, now he does, green light.Load-Date: September 24, 2020End of Document

How Oracle ended up with TikTokCNN WireSeptember 14, 2020 Monday 4:57 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 959 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  TikTok is making the corporate technology company Oracle its business partner in the United States. It's a deal that would tick a lot of boxes for the beleaguered short-form video app, including what is potentially its biggest hurdle of all: getting President Donald Trump on its side. "We can confirm that we've submitted a proposal to the Treasury Department which we believe would resolve the Administration's security concerns," TikTok said in a statement. Oracle confirmed it was part of the proposal as a "trusted technology provider." There are still a lot of unknowns about the agreement. A source familiar with the matter told CNN Business that the partnership was meant to satisfy the Trump administration's national security concerns about TikTok --- Trump has demanded the app be sold, or else shut down in the United States --- and it was not described as an outright sale. But California-based Oracle is a notable partner, given cofounder Larry Ellison's ties to the Trump administration. He's one of the few Silicon Valley tech moguls to back Trump. The billionaire hosted a campaign fundraiser for Trump in February and in April joined a White House advisory group working to revive America's economy. The US president has already indicated he would support a deal between Oracle and TikTok."I think Oracle is a great company and I think its owner is a tremendous guy, a tremendous person," Trump said late last month after the Financial Times reported that Ellison was "seriously considering" a deal with TikTok. "I think that Oracle would be certainly somebody that could handle it." 'Political considerations'TikTok resorted to Oracle "mainly out of political considerations," said Shirley Yu, visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and founder of an eponymous company that assesses strategy, business, and political risk for companies working in China. "Oracle's Ellison is a much closer ally to President Trump than Microsoft [cofounder] Bill Gates. In order for a no-sale option to be considered by the White House, Oracle stands the best chance," she said.James Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, pushed back against the notion that Oracle's apparent victory was driven by Ellison's cozy ties to Trump. (The frontrunner, Microsoft, said Sunday that it lost its bid for the app.)"Oracle has done a good job lobbying the White House on cloud and their record in security. That probably helped them. I don't think it's Trump rewarding his friends," said Lewis.Instead, Oracle might win by default. The deal on the table does not appear to involve TikTok's coveted artificial intelligence algorithm, according to Chinese state-run media CGTN, who cited anonymous sources saying that ByteDance will not give the app's "source code" to any US buyers. The broadcaster also pointedly mentioned that ByteDance was not selling TikTok's US operations.ByteDance's ability to retain the app's technology could make the tie-up more palatable to Beijing regulators, according to Cameron Johnson, adjunct faculty instructor at New York University in Shanghai and partner at consulting firm Tidal Wave Solutions. But that may have killed the Microsoft deal, according to Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities."We believe Microsoft would only buy TikTok with its core algorithm which the Chinese government and ByteDance was not willing to budge," he said in a note to investors Monday morning.Last month, Beijing introduced new rules governing the sale of certain kinds of technology to foreign buyers. Government officials updated an export control list to include data processing, speech and text recognition --- the kind of tech that is used by TikTok. China might see the Oracle partnership "as a win-win," said Johnson. "They won't give up the key ingredients [of TikTok], they're not forced to give everything away and they get an infusion of cash for a big Chinese tech company." Hosting TikTok's US data Like Microsoft, TikTok could be a big get for Oracle, depending on how the terms of the partnership shake out. "Microsoft, they have games and LinkedIn, but Oracle has nothing in the social space," Johnson said. Oracle's chops when it comes data and cloud security could also help allay fears in Washington. The 43-year-old company is a major player in cloud infrastructure and data storage solutions. Cloud services accounted for 74% of the company's $9.4 billion in revenue for the three months that ended in August. The Trump administration alleges that TikTok poses a national security concern because it gathers vast swaths of data from American users, which could be accessed by the Chinese Communist Party. TikTok has denied those allegations. The company has said its data centers are located outside of China and that none of that data is subject to Chinese law. Reporting suggests that Oracle won't be able to buy TikTok outright, but given its expertise in data and cloud security, it could become the US host of TikTok data. "Oracle has incredible data and cloud security," said Johnson, so the US national security establishment may determine that "as long as [US data] is here, it's fine.""Based on early reports and how they are characterizing this as not an 'outright sale' and calling Oracle a 'trusted tech partner,' this has likely turned into a deal about Oracle's cloud, and storing US-based TikTok users' data in Oracle's data center," said Brad Haller, a director in the mergers and acquisitions practice at national consulting firm West Monroe. The deal still needs to gain approval from the Trump administration. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Center for Democracy & Technology Issues Public Comment on Citizenship & Immigration Services Proposed RuleTargeted News ServiceOctober 16, 2020 Friday 11:09 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 6260 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, Oct. 16 -- The Center for Democracy and Technology has issued a public comment on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services proposed rule entitled "Collection and Use of Biometrics by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services". The comment was written on Oct. 12, 2020, and posted on Oct. 13, 2020:* * *The Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT) is a nonprofit advocacy organization dedicated to advancing the rights of the individual in the digital world./1We seek to limit unwarranted governmental intrusions on privacy for U.S. and non-U.S persons alike. We respectfully submit these comments urging the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to withdraw proposed rule USCIS Docket Number USCIS-2019-0007 Collection and Use of Biometrics by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. If implemented, the rule would dramatically expand the persons subject to biometric data collection, the purposes for which biometrics are collected, and the types of biometrics DHS could compel from U.S. and non-U.S. persons./2Among the many changes in this massive proposal, DHS would:/3* Dramatically expand the universe of people who could be subject to biometrics collection, authorizing the collection of biometrics from a broad array of immigrants and U.S. citizens, including: "any applicant, petitioner, sponsor, beneficiary, or individual filing or associated with a certain benefit or request,";/4* Expand the scope of biometric information to be collected, allowing DHS to collect iris scans, facial images (including facial images specifically for facial recognition, as well as photographs of physical or anatomical features such as scars, skin marks, and tattoos), palm prints, and, in some cases, DNA test results, including partial DNA samples;/5 and* Subject immigrants to an ominous regime of "continuous vetting:" at any point during the years-long (oftentimes decades-long) process of becoming a U.S. citizen, DHS can demand updated biometric information from them, and can periodically require their U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident relatives to resubmit information as well./6This proposal is breathtaking in scale and impact. It will double the population from which DHS may seek sensitive personal information, it will cost millions of dollars every year to implement, it will introduce further delays into an already backlogged immigration system, and it risks eroding the privacy rights of millions of people in the United States. DHS has not provided the public, including CDT, enough time to properly comment on the many implications this rule if implemented would have on privacy, the protection of civil rights and the exercise of civil liberties. The agency has proffered weak justifications for why this massive data collection scheme is necessary or wise. It spends little ink on protections that might be afforded the data collected, leading to the possibility that few protections would be put in place. The proposal is also seemingly divorced from reality: at a time in which Congress, state legislators and the public are recognizing the need to be thoughtful about biometric data collection, DHS is barreling full steam ahead. We fear that if this proposed rule is implemented as written, immigrants and their loved ones would face a Hobson's choice: forgo family reunification, protection from oppressive governments, protection from abusers, and a path to stability, or forgo a great deal of privacy, security and respite from the watchful eyes of government. For these many reasons we respectfully submit that this rule should be withdrawn.I. DHS failed to provide the public a meaningful opportunity to review and comment on this proposed rule.Typically, an agency should allow a comment period of at least 60 days following publication of a proposed rulemaking./7Without explanation, DHS arbitrarily limited the comment period for this of all proposed rules to an inadequate 30 days. Where agencies are instructed to provide at least 60 days for response, a proposal of this scale and complexity certainly demands even more time than that. The proposed rule, nearly 90 pages in length, dramatically expands who will be subjected to biometrics collection, how long and how frequently the government could demand their information, and what type of information the government can collect about them. If implemented, it will have a seismic impact on the lives of millions of immigrants and their U.S. citizen and lawful permanent resident relatives.Substance aside, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has strained the regular operation of nonprofits, and the lives of the public. In recognition of these challenges, members of both the House of Representatives and Senate wrote to the Office of Management and Budget requesting that additional time be afforded for the public to engage with the rulemaking process stating that "[t]he right of the American people to meet with federal agencies and comment on proposed actions is invariably affected by the ongoing pandemic."/8Instead, DHS ignored this admonishment from Congress, ignored routine rulemaking practice, and ignored over 100 organizations that requested additional time to grapple with the sweeping changes the department has proposed./9Based on this procedural consideration alone, we urge that this proposed rule be withdrawn.II. If enacted the proposal would be a significant intrusion into the privacy of millions of immigrants, lawful permanent residents, and U.S. citizens.Currently USCIS collects photographs, fingerprints and signature data from immigrants filing for a benefit. The proposed rule would authorize DHS to collect additional types of biometrics, from more persons, for a longer period of time. It "flip[s] the current construct from one where biometrics may be collected based on past practices, regulations, or the form instructions for a particular benefit, to a system under which biometrics are required for any immigration benefit request unless DHS determines that biometrics are unnecessary."/10DHS estimates that biometrics collection will increase to 6.07 million people, from 3.9 million currently./11The proposed rule is a significant intrusion into the privacy of millions in the United States.a. The purposes for which DHS seeks biometric data are generally overbroad and vague, and raise significant concerns that those who seek an immigration benefit, or seek to sponsor a family member for one, risk being placed under the specter of long-term surveillance.i. Overbroad and vagueDHS seeks to compel biometric data for overly broad purposes that are so vaguely described that the individuals compelled to disclose information would not have an adequate sense of how their information may be used by the government. And indeed, the vagueness makes it difficult to provide comment on how DHS may more narrowly tailor its collection, if less intrusive alternatives would suit its purposes, or provide any other kind of constructive feedback./12For example, DHS seeks to clarify that it may seek biometric data from immigrants, U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents for: "[i]dentity enrollment, verification, and management in the immigration lifecycle; national security and criminal history background checks to support determinations of eligibility for immigration and naturalization benefits; the production of secure identity documents; and to perform other functions related to administering and enforcing the immigration and naturalization laws."/13Biometric data is easily repurposed and vulnerable to function creep. If DHS proposes to compel more of it, from more persons, for new purposes, the department has an obligation to be more explicit about the applications to which it will be put, and to reasonably limit those applications. The last few years have demonstrated that for example, with respect to government databases of facial images, the public and political representatives were shocked that an image provided for purposes of getting a state driver's license, or a US passport, could end up in the possession of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Customs and Border Protection, for purposes of criminal investigation and traveler identification respectively./14 Such surprise should not occur again.ii. Enhanced and continuous vettingOne of the more troubling elements of the proposal is DHS's request for comment on the appropriateness of biometric data collection for purposes of enhanced and continuous immigration vetting described as follows:"Under continuous vetting, DHS may require aliens to be subjected to continued and subsequent evaluation of eligibility for their immigration benefits to ensure they continue to present no risk of causing harm subsequent to their entry. This rule proposes that any individual alien who is present in the United States following an approved immigration benefit may be required to submit biometrics unless and until they are granted U.S. citizenship. The rule further proposes that a lawful permanent resident or U.S. citizen may be required to submit biometrics if he or she filed an application, petition, or request in the past, and it was either reopened or the previous approval is relevant to an application, petition, or benefit request currently pending with USCIS."/15Continuous vetting raises serious human rights concerns and paves the way for discriminatory surveillance of predominantly people of color. Demanding that immigrants and U.S. citizens submit to needlessly invasive biometrics collection is, as described below, a serious and unnecessary infringement upon privacy rights. Potentially requiring them to submit to this invasive collection repeatedly is entirely unjustifiable--and indeed, DHS doesn't even attempt to justify repeated demands for sensitive biometric information, other than citing to President Trump's discriminatory Executive Order No. 13780, Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States (Mar. 9, 2017). Far from keeping the United States safe, this rule, if implemented, will allow DHS to demand sensitive information of immigrants at any time in the years-long (sometimes decades-long) process of naturalization. It will also, as described below, chill the freedom of speech and association of immigrants and U.S. citizens association if they are concerned that the U.S. government may be paying them specific investigatory interest./16b. The collection of biometric data threatens the right to privacy, security, and anonymity. If enacted, the rule would chill the speech of immigrants and U.S. citizens subject to data collection impacting their civic participation in the United States.The collection of facial images, iris scans, voice prints, fingerprints, and DNA is a great burden on privacy./17As information that can be used to identify an individual, the government's possession of biometric data can threaten an individual's ability to participate in society anonymously. This includes what they say, where they go, and with whom they associate. For example, if the government were to possess the types of biometrics contemplated in this proposal, a water bottle thrown away at a protest, facial image collected on a CCTV camera pointed at a mosque or synagogue, or phone call made to a relationship advice radio talk show could be associated with an individual. This could in turn reveal an individual's political beliefs, religious beliefs, and sexual orientation as well as a potentially sensitive personal matter such as infidelity. The stakes for privacy, civil rights and civil liberties are great.It is surprising then, that the proposed rule pays little attention to data privacy, or how this collection will impact the exercise of fundamental rights. For example, in a discussion of costs privacy is raised and dismissed quickly: "[t]here could be some unquantified impacts related to privacy concerns for risks associated with the collection and retention of biometric information, as discussed in DHS's Privacy Act compliance documentation. However, this rule would not create new impacts in this regard but would expand the population that could have privacy concerns."/18The proposed rule does not state explicitly where the data would be stored, how long it would be subject to retention, and with whom it can be shared. If it is stored in the major database that houses other DHS biometric data, it will be subject to overly permissive data sharing and retention./19Furthermore, as discussed above, the purposes for which DHS seeks to compel biometric data are so broad to create the impression that any data individuals provide an agency within DHS will be widely accessible to other federal and state agencies, and that DHS itself might use the data for all manner of surveillance./20Given the breadth of the proposed rule's language and its lack of assurances about privacy, security or limitations on use, the immigrants and U.S. citizens subject to data collection may be chilled from full participation in various aspects of society. For immigrants not yet citizens in particular, a chilling of participation in civic society is particularly damaging as they lack eligibility to vote to change policies. The only way then to express a preference for a policy is through participation in protest activity, organizing, and other manifestations of political expression. If this activity is chilled, immigrants are then effectively precluded from agitating for changes that might benefit themselves or others for whom they care in society. This would be an intolerable cost that strongly cautions against implementation of the proposed rule as written.c. The data DHS seeks to collect is vulnerable to data breach and unauthorized use.Given the sensitivity of the information DHS is seeking to compel and store, it's important to think about not only the uses to which it will be put in the United States, but also what other entities might do if they obtain this information. The rule does not explicitly state where DHS plans to store the vast amounts of biometric data it will collect. We can make some informed assumptions. Currently, DHS biometric data is stored in IDENT (Automated Biometric Identification System),/21 but going forward DHS biometric data will be stored in DHS's new Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology (HART) database./22Both will be an attractive target to foreign adversaries and bad actors. These bad actors will likely have plenty of time to try their hand. While the proposed rule fails to address data retention schedules for the various collections proposed, data in IDENT is retained for 75 years./23Unfortunately the U.S. federal government has repeatedly failed to keep individuals' biometric data secure. The Office of Personnel Management breach in 2015 resulted in the disclosure of sensitive information about 22.1 million people, including 1.1 million sets of fingerprints./24And most recently at DHS, a database of 184,000 facial recognition images collected by Customs and Border Protection in Texas was hacked and misused./25After this breach of a US Government system, at least 19 of the images were posted on the dark web. In a report on the incident, the DHS Inspector General found that CBP did not satisfy its own security obligations, thereby creating the situation that led to the data breach, and the Inspector General acknowledged that "this incident may damage the public's trust in the Government's ability to safeguard biometric data."/26Unlike passwords or even social security numbers, biometric information cannot be changed if it is compromised in a data breach. Once a person's biometric information is obtained by an unauthorized party, it is obtained irrevocably. In the hands of a third party entity, this data could result in genetic discrimination for the data subject in the US or for their family members abroad, identity fraud, or other harms. The risk to immigrants is particularly great if sensitive information about them is disclosed to the very government they are fleeing, and a rejected application for relief or an immigration benefit forces their return.The lesson from these data breaches caution against unnecessary data collection on the front end, but certainly against retaining data for longer than it is needed. Again, data retention was not discussed in the proposal. DHS should withdraw the proposed rule to address these glaring deficiencies in the document. Barring that, DHS must set stricter retention schedules than exist now in key DHS databases.III. DHS fails to demonstrate that the collections are necessary.The proposed rule makes clear what DHS wants, but not what the agency needs. DHS claims that biographic data is too inaccurate and susceptible to identity fraud. DHS repeatedly asserts that biometric collection is necessary to prevent fraud without attempting to quantify how widespread or frequent this phenomenon is, or how the asserted fraud is perpetuated. DHS appears to be seeking to expand the types of biometrics it collects because the FBI is collecting additional types of biometrics./27Simply because the FBI is collecting additional information does not mean DHS needs to, or should, or can. DHS does not explain why biographic data or the submission of fingerprints fail to sufficiently enable a criminal check with the FBI.IV. If enacted this proposal will chill people from applying for benefits and prevent individuals from sponsoring their family members.If put into place, these additional obligations will make it more difficult for immigrants and their sponsors to apply for immigration benefits. There are practical constraints: the new fees owed USCIS associated with biometric processing, as well as the time and travel required to appear for a biometrics appointment at a collection center. But the concern about living under perpetual government scrutiny is likely to chill many from seeking consequential immigration benefits. As discussed above, the data DHS collects is generally subject to overly permissive data-sharing regimes, and the data is retained indefinitely.V. Policy headwinds should caution DHS against moving forward with this proposal because of the inadequate policy framework around the use of the biometric information that would be collected.Bulk collection of biometric data without a framework to prevent the erosion of fundamental rights--as proposed in the draft rule--is not in line with today's policy discussions. Ironically, the examples of biometric surveillance from abroad that have animated these conversations in the United States are mirrored by DHS in this proposal./28Indeed, the United States recently condemned the involuntary collection of DNA from, and its use for surveillance and repression of, disfavored classes by the Chinese government in Xinjiang province./29One of the many items on which DHS solicits feedback is the department's use of facial images to include the development of a facial recognition system for "fraud, public safety or criminal history background checks, and national security screening and vetting."/30The on-going and very active debate in the US about the government's use of facial recognition technology is by itself a clear illustration of just how out of step this proposal is.Government testing and private testing of popular commercial facial recognition algorithms (including those used by the federal government) have exposed the existence of undemocratic demographic effects--specifically the fact that the technology produces disparate rates of accuracy when used on images of people of color, and women as compared to white persons and men./31Additionally there are significant concerns that the technology can result in mass unchecked surveillance eroding the right to anonymity in public,/32 and may exacerbate systemic racism in policing./33In light of these concerns, Congress has held numerous hearings reviewing existing federal facial recognition technology programs in which members have discussed the need to press pause on the technology or subject it to limits./34Members have introduced legislation that would impose a moratorium on use/35 and to regulate the technology's use./36Some cities have banned the use of the technology./37And in light of protests against systemic racism, a number of technology companies that would be vendors of facial recognition technology have committed to not selling the technology to law enforcement in the absence of a human rights respecting framework regulating the technology's use./38Indeed, DHS's existing use of the technology has not evaded this scrutiny and criticism. The House Committee on Homeland Security held two hearings at which representatives lambasted DHS and CBP officials for their failure to ensure that Americans could exercise their right to opt out of the biometric-entry exit system and voiced concerns about preserving equality of experience in airport screening./39And when the hack of CBP's database of facial images took place, members of Congress voiced significant concern about the future of the collection program. In June of 2019, U.S. Senator Edward Markey called on DHS to halt its use of facial recognition technology and stated that the hack of CBP's data "raises serious concerns about the Department of Homeland Security's ability to effectively safeguard the sensitive information it is collecting." He also stated, "Malicious actors' thirst for information about U.S.identities is unquenchable, and DHS must keep pace with emerging threats."/40Additionally, the Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, Representative Bennie Thompson, said, "We must ensure we are not expanding the use of biometrics at the expense of the privacy of the American public."/41The collection of other biometric data without an adequate policy framework raises similar concerns. The lesson from this recent history should not be to move quickly forward with a biometric collection and screening proposal absent a framework in which to address privacy and equality concerns--certainly not when regulators are currently contemplating how to reign in unchecked surveillance.For all of these reasons we respectfully urge you to withdraw this proposal. We welcome the opportunity to answer any questions about these comments and to engage further with you as the Department considers how to respect the privacy rights of immigrants and their loved ones.Questions about these comments can be directed to CDT's Mana Azarmi, at mazarmi@cdt.orgRespectfully submitted,Center for Democracy & Technology* * *Footnotes:1/ Center for Democracy & Technology, www.cdt.org/about.2/ 85 Fed.

Reg. 56338, 56350.11/ Id. at 56364.12/ There are some limited exceptions to the overbroad nature of the proposed rule. USCIS for example requests feedback on the collection of voice prints to cut down on the time needed to verify the identity of an individual who contacts a call center. There is an incredible backlog at USCIS for processing applications, which keeps individuals and their loved ones living in limbo as they await final resolution. Technology may help USCIS process applications more efficiently. Unfortunately, DHS limited the time for substantial engagement with discrete pieces of this proposal. That said, it is not clear why alternatives to voice prints would not suffice, such as the disclosure of an A-number over the phone. Additionally, if the voice print would be subject to overly permissive data sharing and repurposing, it is a high cost for a gain that could likely be achieved through less intrusive means, including more hiring. 85 Fed.

Reg. 56338, 56352.16/ Such concern would arise example, if the biometric data were to be used in a manner akin to USCIS's existing Continuous Immigration Vetting tool, which "automates and streamlines the process of notifying USCIS of potential derogatory information in Government databases that may relate to individuals in USCIS systems, as new information is discovered."

Hunter Biden's Business Dealings Created 'Counterintelligence And Extortion Concerns,' Senate Report SaysThe Daily CallerSeptember 23, 2020 Wednesday 11:00 AM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; politicsLength: 1291 wordsByline: Chuck Ross, Investigative Reporter, chuck@dailycaller.comChuck Ross is a reporter at The Daily Caller.Author ImageBodyLink to Image• Hunter Biden's financial dealings with Ukrainian, Russian and Chinese businesses created potential “criminal financial, counterintelligence and extortion concerns,” according to a report by two Senate committees. • The report details a series of wire transfers between Biden and a businessman with extensive ties to the Chinese Communist Party.  • The report, written by the Senate Homeland Security and Senate Finance committees, also states that State Department officials repeatedly raised concerns about Hunter Biden's work for Burisma Holdings.• One official testified that he told Joe Biden in October 2015 that his son's links to Burisma “enabled Russian disinformation efforts.”U.S. banks flagged suspicious financial transactions between Hunter Biden's firms and Russian and Chinese nationals, including a businessman with extensive ties to the Chinese Communist Party, according to a highly anticipated report released Wednesday by two Republican-controlled Senate committees.The report asserts that the wire transfers, which total in the millions of dollars, raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest involving Biden, as well as “criminal financial, counterintelligence and extortion concerns.”The report, which The Daily Caller News Foundation obtained ahead of its release, also states that State Department officials expressed reservations in 2015 and 2016 about Biden's links to Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company that has been dogged by bribery allegations.One official, Amos Hochstein, told the Senate Homeland Security and Senate Finance committees that he said to then-Vice President Joe Biden in October 2015 that Hunter Biden's position on the board of Burisma “enabled Russian disinformation efforts and risked undermining U.S. policy in Ukraine.”Hunter Biden, now 50, joined Burisma's board of directors in April 2014, shortly after his father, Joe Biden, took over as the Obama administration's chief liaison to Ukraine.One of the administration's goals was to help Ukraine fix its problems with corruption. But but State Department officials questioned whether the younger Biden's work for Burisma posed a problem because the company's owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, was under investigation for money laundering and extortion.George Kent, who served as deputy chief of mission to Ukraine through 2018, testified that Zlochevsky was an “odious” oligarch who likely paid a $7 million bribe to a Ukrainian prosecutor general in December 2014, months after Hunter Biden joined Burisma's board, according to the report. (RELATED: 'You Don't Get More Politically Connected': Participants In Securities Fraud Scam Touted Links To Hunter Biden)Emails cited in the report show that Kent raised Burisma's issues with corruption to other State Department officials. Kent also told the committees on July 24, 2020, that he said to Joe Biden's national security staff in February 2015 that Hunter Biden's role at Burisma “could create the perception of a conflict of interest.”Kent told Joe Biden's staff that “someone needed to talk to Hunter Biden, and he should [step] down from the board of Burisma,” according to the report.Hochstein and Kent's warnings went unheeded, the Senate report says. Joe Biden avoided publicly criticizing Burisma or Zlochevsky, and Hunter Biden remained on Burisma's board until his father announced his presidential campaign in April 2019.The report says that Burisma paid a consulting firm controlled by Hunter Biden and Devon Archer, his business partner and fellow Burisma director, more than $3.5 million from May 2014 to February 2016. Burisma sent nine wire transfers from January 2016 to November 2016 totaling $752,054 to Biden's law firm, Owasco, according to the report.The report does not produce any direct evidence of wrongdoing on Hunter Biden's part. But Republicans say the documents paint a troubling picture of Biden receiving “millions of dollars from foreign sources as a result of business relationships that he built during the period when his father was vice president of the United States and after.”The report says that several transactions involving Biden-controlled firms were flagged for “potential criminal financial activity,” including wire transfers that Biden sent to his uncle, James Biden, and payments that he received from a mysterious Chinese businessman believed to have ties to the People's Liberation Army (PLA).The report focuses on millions of dollars in wire payments that Hunter Biden's firms received from Ye Jianming, the founder of CEFC China Energy Co., and Gongwen Dong, a U.S.-based associate of Ye's.According to Republicans, Ye has “extensive” connections to the Chinese government.He reportedly served as deputy secretary for the China Association for International Friendly Contacts (CAIFC), a front group for the PLA. A report from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission in 2011 said that CAIFC has “dual roles of intelligence collection and conducting People's Republic of China propaganda.”The Senate report says that on Aug. 4, 2017, a subsidiary of Ye's company called CEFC Infrastructure Investment (US) LLC, wired $100,000 to Owasco, the Biden law firm.A month later, on Sept. 8, 2017, Hunter Biden and Gongwen Dong applied for a $100,000 line of credit under a shell company they formed called Hudson West III LLC, according to the Senate report.Biden, his uncle James, and James's wife, Sara Biden, accessed the account through credit cards, and spent $101,291 on what Republicans call “extravagant items,” including plane tickets, hotels, restaurants and items at Apple stores.The wires were “identified for potential financial criminal activity,” the report says.According to the report, CEFC Infrastructure Investment wired $5 million to the bank account for Hudson West III on Aug. 8, 2017. Of that, nearly $4.8 million was wired to Biden's law firm over the next year.The committees relied on confidential Treasury Department records for details about the transactions. The records are not fully described in the report, but Republicans refer to committee requests for Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), which banks are required to file with the Treasury Department when they spot suspicious transactions.The report also flags wire transfers that Biden received from Elena Baturina, a Russian billionaire who was married to Yuri Luzhkov. Luzhkov served as Moscow's mayor until his death in 2010.The report states that Baturina wired $3.5 million on Feb. 14, 2014, to a bank account for Rosemont Seneca Thornton LLC, which Hunter Biden co-founded with Archer, his business partner, the year before.Baturina transferred another $241,797 to a bank account for Rosemont Seneca Thornton from May-December 2015, according to the report.“These transactions were identified because of Baturina's reported criminal activity,” the report states.The report also refers to potential payments from Biden to women from Russia and Eastern Europe who may have had links to “prostitution or human trafficking ring[s]” in Eastern Europe.“These foreign nationals have questionable backgrounds that have been identified as being consistent with a range of criminal activities, including but not limited to organized prostitution and/or human trafficking, money laundering, fraud, and embezzlement,” according to the Republicans.The alleged payments are not detailed in the report.Joe Biden's presidential campaign did not respond to an email seeking comment.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The ridiculous agreement by TikTok that fails in all respectsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 29, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 871 wordsBodyThere's only one thing worse than successful political blackmail on business and that's a failed political blackmail on business. But that's where we seem to be heading as Donald Trump threatens to end TikTok's activities in the United States.The U.S. president not only trampled on due process in government and legal dealing with TikTok's business, nor did he fulfill his earlier promise to ban China's popular viral video application in the United States, as a federal judge yesterday blocked the entry into force of any ban.Rather, Trump gave his preliminary blessing to an absurd deal that would give Oracle and Walmart a combined 20 percent stake in a new U.S.-based company, TikTok Global, while demanding that he contribute $5 billion to an AMERICAN education fund (about which TikTok knows nothing) and seek a IBRO.Trump prides himself on the "art of negotiation," but this arrangement has the entire artistic structure of an abstract spray painting by Jackson Pollock.There are good reasons to worry about TikTok's activities in democratic societies, beyond its ability to attract teens to wiggle. While many of its 100 million users in the US view the app as harmless entertainment, TikTok has already deleted videos on sensitive topics such as Sinkiang and Tibet.Like all Chinese companies, ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, operates on the vagaries of the Communist Party; the other side of any Chinese censorship is propaganda. If desired, TikTok can set its sights on users in disputed states in the US to drive—or undermine—a particular agenda or candidate.If the main concern about TikTok is national security, then it makes more sense to ban it altogether, just as happened in India. If we live in a world of information warfare, then it matters who controls the platforms.The details of the agreement have not been clarified, but, as it is, it circumvents many of these national security concerns. It is true that the data will be kept on US servers, and Oracle will have a monitoring function, but ByteDance will retain control of the most important algorithms that provide content to its users and the Chinese government has already noted that it does not want to share this technology. ByteDance will also maintain an 80 percent stake in TikTok Global.Moreover, as Sinan Aral, co-director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Digital Economy Initiative, argues, U.S.-owned technology platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are still open to manipulation by evil foreign powers.As he describes in his book The Hype Machine, Russian misinformation reached at least 126 million people on Facebook in the 2016 elections and remains rampant today. This is a systemic failure that must be addressed, not a threat to national security that can be eliminated by an executive order.The broader problem with the TikTok agreement is the harmful politicization of companies. "Intervening to decide winners and losers at the level of individual companies and individual agreements sets a very dangerous precedent," says Aral.The suspicion must be that Trump does not want to alienate TikTok users in the US by banning the application completely so close to the presidential election but, at the same time, publicly beating a Chinese company has a political purpose.Trump also favors his corporate industry friends at Oracle and Walmart, while touting that TikTok will create an additional 25,000 jobs in the US, mainly in Texas, aRepublican state.However, such arbitrary interventionism can be retaliated against abroad. Good luck protecting Apple and Microsoft's business interests in China. Don't be surprised if the European Union sets its sights on US technology firms in their quest to defend technological sovereignty. It should also provide another reason for the British government to think twice before allowing Nvidia to gobble up Arm and become another pawn on the US geopolitical chessboard.Undoubtedly, Beijing treated many foreign technology companies badly while cutting off its domestic market, but the United States will not get over it by becoming more like China,It is likely to succeed in increasing the stakes in the strengths that made the US the most innovative economy for so long: the free flow of people, ideas and technologies that gave Silicon Valley the big boost, open markets, and adherence to the rule of law.MicrosoftLaunch AzureMicrosoft, the technology giant, launched a new platform called Azure, which operates in the cloud and is designed for telecom operators to build 5G networks faster.BenefitsThis platform will reduce infrastructure costs, greater flexibility to add on-demand services, and use artificial intelligence to automate operations.More competitionThe multinational technology company's decision will increase competition for current 5G service providers such as Nokia and Ericsson.5G networksThe Developer of Windows and Office entered the competition for 5G following the purchase of cloud networking companies Affirmed Networks and Metaswitch earlier this year.AssociationsThe company has already partnered with telecom operators such as Verizon and AT&T; and network equipment firms such as Samsung and Mavenir to use or sell the new platform.Load-Date: September 30, 2020End of Document

President Donald Trump was reluctant during a press conference Wednesday for China's ByteDance to retain a majority in the new company, which will move the overall operations of the U.S. app but would leave Oracle and the rest of partners with a minority stake.As the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg advance, the Trump Administration wants U.S.-based investors, including Oracle, which also include General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital, and Walmart, to have a majority stake in the new U.S.-based company that will take over TikTok. Until now, according to leaked and unreleased information officially, ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese matrix, would have a priority position at the new entity, which nominates Oracle as a "trusted technology" provider.In this way, Larry Ellison's company will work with TikTok to have application data around the world processed independently by Oracle and Americans to be managed and stored in the US to address national security concerns.The new TikTok entity would have independent oversight and be managed outside of ByteDance. However, the Chinese company will maintain control of the powerful algorithm. As part of its proposal, ByteDance would allow Oracle to review TikTok's source code and software to ensure that there are no backdoors that allow the Chinese government or other entities to access the data.The plan presented to the Trump Administration would be generating friction. Senate Republicans have already stated that the proposal between ByteDance and Oracle fails to achieve the goals set by the White House tenant and maintains concerns about the Chinese government's possible access to U.S. user data in the future.Trump himself said Wednesday that he did not like the idea of ByteDance holding a majority stake in TikTok. "Conceptually, I can tell you that I don't like it", adding that you had not been informed about this part of the proposal. It also noted that it would have more information on the agreement during Thursday' day.In these circumstances, according to the WSJ, both Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other U.S. officials and investors try to ensure that the U.S. ownership stake in the new company exceeds 50%. Currently 40% of ByteDance is owned by U.S. investors, led by Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic. Just under 25% is held by Zhang Yiming, the company's founder, and about 20% is held by ByteDance employees. Approximately the other 20% is held by non-U.S. investors. Under the new structure expected by U.S. officials, all Of ByteDance's assets would go to the new US-based company. Oracle and Walmart would also become investors and along with other U.S. investors would surpass more than 50% ownership. In fact, efforts would be made to further increase U.S. participation by posing a possible I.D. of the new US-based company.commentsforum0WhatsApp  FacebookTwitter  Linkedin       Load-Date: September 17, 2020End of Document

Secretary of Defense Issues Remarks at Artificial Intelligence SymposiumTargeted News ServiceSeptember 11, 2020 Friday 7:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2077 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of Defense's Office of the Secretary issued the following remarks on Sept. 9 by Secretary Mark T. Esper at an AI Symposium on Sept. 9:* * *Hello, I'm Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, and it's a privilege to join you today as part of the Defense Department's AI Symposium. I want to thank Nand Mulchandani and his team at the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, or JAIC, for organizing this important event...AND for bringing together the best and brightest minds in the Department who are working to accelerate the adoption of critical emerging technologies.Today, I'd like to speak to you about why the United States must continue to lead the way in the responsible and ethical development of artificial intelligence - and more specifically, why the Department of Defense must remain at the forefront of the military application of this game-changing technology.History informs us that those who are first to harness once-in-a-generation technologies often have a decisive advantage on the battlefield for years to come. I experienced this firsthand during Operation Desert Storm, when the United States' military's smart bombs, stealth aircraft, and satellite-enabled GPS helped decimate Iraqi forces and their Soviet equipment.In today's era of great power competition, as new technologies alter the character of warfare, we must stay ahead of our near-peer rivals - namely China and Russia. Our National Defense Strategy guides us in doing just that, as we modernize the force and protect our competitive advantage across all domains: air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace.Thanks to our largest Research and Development budget in the Department's history, we are accelerating the development of critical technologies that will enable us to outpace our strategic competitors and maintain our military overmatch. But, unlike advanced munitions or next-generation platforms, artificial intelligence is in a league of its own, with the potential to transform nearly every aspect of the battlefield, from the back office to the front lines. That is why we cannot afford to cede the high ground to revisionist powers intent on bending, breaking, or reshaping international rules and norms in their favor - to the collective detriment of others.In 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that whichever nation leads in AI will be the "ruler of the world." He ordered his government to develop a national AI strategy, and called for increased investments. His intent is to employ any possible advantage to expand Russia's influence and chip away at the sovereignty of others.We saw this with Russia's incursion into Ukraine, when Russian forces used a sophisticated and well-coordinated combination of unmanned aerial vehicles, cyberattacks, and artillery barrage to inflict severe damage on Ukrainian forces. Since then, Moscow has announced the development of AI-enabled autonomous systems across ground vehicles, aircraft, nuclear submarines, and command and control. We expect them to deploy these capabilities in future combat zones.Likewise, the Chinese Communist Party recognizes the transformational power of AI, and openly declares its intentions to be the world leader by 2030.The People's Liberation Army regards AI as a "leapfrog" technology, which could enable low-cost, long-range autonomous vehicles and systems to counter America's conventional power projection. At this moment, Chinese weapons manufacturers are selling autonomous drones they claim can conduct lethal targeted strikes. Meanwhile, the Chinese government is advancing the development of next-generation stealth UAVs, which they are preparing to export internationally.If there is any doubt as to how the CCP would wield AI to influence its agenda abroad, look no further than how it uses this capability at home. Beijing is constructing a 21st century surveillance state designed to wield unprecedented control over its own people. With hundreds of millions of cameras strategically located across the country and billions of data points generated by the Chinese Internet of Things, the CCP will soon be able to identify almost anyone entering a public space, and censor dissent in real time. More troubling is the fact that these systems can be used to invade private lives, leaving no text message, internet search, purchase, or personal activity free from Beijing's tightening grip.As we speak, the PRC is deploying - and honing - its AI surveillance apparatus to support the targeted repression of its Muslim Uighur population. Likewise, pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong are being identified, seized, imprisoned, or worse, by the CCP's digital police state - unencumbered by privacy laws or ethical governing principles. As China scales this technology, we fully expect it to sell these capabilities abroad, enabling other autocratic governments to move toward a new era of digital authoritarianism.The contrast between American leadership on AI and that of Beijing and Moscow couldn't be clearer. We are pioneering a vision for emerging technology that protects the U.S. Constitution and the sacred rights of all Americans. Abroad, we seek to promote the adoption of AI in a manner consistent with the values we share with our allies and partners: individual liberty, democracy, human rights, and respect for the rule of law, to name a few.Indeed, we approach AI as we have other high-tech breakthroughs throughout our Department's history - with rigorous standards for testing and fielding capabilities, and the highest ethical expectations. Technology may constantly change, but our commitment to our core values does not.In February, we became the first military in the world to adopt ethical principles for the use of AI, based on core values such as transparency, reliability, and governability. These principles make clear to the American people - and the world - that the United States will once again lead the way in the responsible development and application of emerging technologies, reinforcing our role as the global security partner of choice.To build on this foundation, we are designing a comprehensive strategy to train and educate all DoD personnel - from AI developers to end-users - so that everyone understands their role in accelerating the Department's Digital Modernization Strategy.Over the last six months, for example, the Department has stood up a Responsible AI Committee that brings together leaders from across the enterprise to foster a culture of AI ethics within their organizations. In addition, the JAIC has launched the Responsible AI Champions program, a nine-week training course for DoD personnel directly involved in the AI delivery pipeline. We plan to scale this program to all DoD components over the coming year.Further, the JAIC, in partnership with the Defense Acquisition University and the Naval Postgraduate School, will launch an intensive six-week pilot course next month to train over 80 defense acquisition professionals of all ranks and grades. These trainees will learn how to apply AI and data science skills to our operations. With the support of Congress, the Department plans to request additional funding for the Services to grow this effort over time and deliver an AI-ready workforce to the American people.As the Defense Department builds a digital security architecture to promote responsible and ethical AI development, we are also shaping new international norms for the use of this technology. Next week, the JAIC will launch the first-ever AI Partnership for Defense, to engage military and defense organizations from more than 10 nations, with a focus on incorporating ethical principles into the AI delivery pipeline. Over the coming year, we expect to expand this initiative to include even more countries, as we create new frameworks and tools for data sharing, cooperative development, and strengthened interoperability.We have come a long way since establishing the JAIC two years ago. Today, more than 200 talented civil service and military professionals work diligently to accelerate AI solutions, and deliver these capabilities to the warfighter. From helping the Joint Force organize, fight, and win at machine speed, to enhancing wildfire and flood responses through computer vision technology, the JAIC is utilizing every aspect of artificial intelligence as a transformative instrument at home and abroad.The JAIC is also lowering technical barriers to AI adoption by building a cloud-based platform to allow DoD components to test, validate, and field capabilities with greater speed, at greater scale. The goal is to make AI tools and data accessible across the force, which will help synchronize projects and reduce redundancy, among many other benefits.As an example of the tectonic impact of machine learning on the future of warfighting, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) recently conducted its third and final F-16 combat simulation between an AI-controlled system and an experienced Air Force fighter pilot. The AI agent's resounding victory demonstrated the ability of advanced algorithms to out-perform humans in virtual dogfights. These simulations will culminate in a real-world competition involving full-scale tactical aircraft in 2024.To be clear, AI's role in our lethality is to support human decision-makers, not replace them. We see AI as a tool to free up resources, time, and manpower so our people can focus on higher priority tasks, and arrive at the decision point, whether in a lab or on the battlefield, faster and more precise than the competition.For instance, AI is advancing automated chemistry for a host of national security applications, including the continuous manufacturing of critical pharmaceuticals and the development of novel propellants for spacecraft engines. These advances free up time for our scientists and researchers to focus on next-generation innovation, rather than countless tests and experiments.Furthermore, through DARPA's Spectrum Collaboration Challenge, we are demonstrating the power of machine learning to improve spectrum usage through autonomous collaboration, which has enormous implications for future military and commercial networking, especially with 5G.Lastly, to fully realize the potential of AI across the Defense Department, we are committed to reforming outdated policies, divesting from legacy systems, modernizing our acquisition practices, and strengthening our partnerships across industry and academia.Decades ago, the federal government supplied the bulk of research and development funding for many of the Department's most important hardware capabilities. Today, the private sector leads the way in software. We need to be fast followers of our industry partners, and work hand-in-hand with them to develop AI at the speed and scale needed to stay ahead of the competition.During the Department's coronavirus response, for example, the JAIC worked alongside industry to develop a predictive analytics tool that helped U.S. Northern Command manage supply chains and identify hotspots with the greatest need. And, in academia, the Army AI Task Force at Carnegie Melon University, and the Air Force AI Accelerator, sit at the crossroads of higher education, industry, and defense, rapidly prototyping cutting-edge innovation. Ultimately, these kinds of solutions are vital not only for our Department of Defense missions, but also for the good of the American people.With each generation come new technologies that fundamentally alter the way we think about, plan, and prepare for war. AI is one such breakthrough with boundless potential - for good or for ill. However, unlike our competitors, we commit to using these capabilities to preserve peace, promote prosperity, respect rights, and maintain the free and open order that benefits all nations.As the epicenter of groundbreaking innovation, the United States will once again lead the way in developing and governing emerging technologies. We will stay true to our core values and principles. We will remain the global security partner of choice. And together with our allies and partners, we will defend the international rules and norms that have secured our rights and our homeland for generations.Thank you for your time, and thank you for all that you do to ensure the Department of Defense remains the standard of excellence, at home and abroad.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7230262 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 11, 2020End of Document

Rep. McHenry: Democrats' Unworkable Bill Does Nothing to Stop CCP's Human Rights AbusesTargeted News ServiceOctober 1, 2020 Thursday 8:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 624 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Patrick McHenry, R-North Carolina, ranking Republican member of the House Financial Services Committee, issued the following news release on Sept. 30:Today, Democrats are pushing through H.R. 6270, the Uyghur Forced Labor Disclosure Act of 2020, in an attempt to appear "tough on China" for political gain. This messaging bill has already been proven unworkable and will only hurt U.S. public companies and does nothing protect the Uyghur people from the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) human rights abuses.The top Republican on the Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets Subcommittee, Bill Huizenga (MI-2), led the Republican opposition to H.R 6270. Watch Ranking Republican Huizenga's floor remarks here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV5jDwJOli4Excerpts from Ranking Republican Huizenga's floor remarks as prepared for delivery:"Mr. Chair, Republicans are unwavering in our support to hold China accountable for the human rights violations that are occurring in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, or XUAR."In fact, I would remind my colleagues that we passed H.R. 6210 last week on a bipartisan basis to address these human rights violations. Moreover, to date, the Trump Administration has taken significant action to punish human rights violators in the Region, including recent sanctions and additions to the Commerce Department's Entity List."..."The framework of this bill is deeply flawed. First, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has no foreign policy expertise. The SEC's three-part mission is to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation. The Treasury and State Department handle the sanctions regime. We should, instead, be working with both the State Department and the Treasury to hold bad actors accountable, not the SEC."..."This bill's framework has been proven disastrous. Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act mandated disclosures relating to the use of conflict minerals that originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country. Implementation of Section 1502 cost billions of dollars--Democratic estimates put it over $7B--and the provisions led to devastating job losses for Africans."The top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, Patrick McHenry (NC-10), offered a Motion to Recommit to reaffirm that sanctions are the appropriate tool to stop China's persecution of the Uyghur people. Sanctions target the bad actors that are committing human rights abuses against Uyghurs and it would be illegal for any US firm--public or private--to do any business with a sanctioned entity.Watch Ranking Republican McHenry's floor remarks here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXE1oBateUAExcerpts from Ranking Republican McHenry's remarks as prepared for delivery:"Republicans stand with the Trump Administration against communism and the global threat the Chinese government poses, while Democrats have excused the Chinese Communist Party's actions for years."Just last year we offered House Democrats an opportunity in our Committee to stand up against the Chinese Communist Party and stand up for the human rights of religious minorities when we considered the reauthorization of the US Export-Import Bank."Instead of joining us, Democrats voted to allow companies owned by the Chinese Communist Party to receive U.S. taxpayer subsidies. Subsidies that support the very people committing these human rights atrocities to which they are now all of a sudden opposed."..."A vote for this amendment says that we are serious about ending the human rights atrocities that are being committed by the Chinese Communist Party against the Uyghur people."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7251951 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 1, 2020End of Document

Department of Education Issues Oct. 30 Education Review NewsletterTargeted News ServiceOctober 31, 2020 Saturday 9:47 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2729 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of Education issued the following Education Review newsletter on Oct. 30:Foreign Influence in Higher EducationLast week, during an event held in person and broadcast live, Secretary DeVos issued a report detailing the massive failure of many American colleges and universities to disclose more than $6.5 billion in funding and resources from foreign sources, including China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. Section 117 of the Higher Education Act (HEA) requires institutions of higher education to report foreign gifts and contracts. Yet, over the course of this last year, the Department has uncovered billions in unreported financial ties (press release and Section 117 page)."The threat of improper foreign influence in higher education is real. Our action today ensures that America's students, educators, and taxpayers can follow the money," the Secretary said. "Transparency in foreign funding of higher education is not just something I think is important. It's the law. For too long, enforcement of that law was lax, but not anymore."After four decades of pervasive non-compliance by colleges and universities, this report -- produced by the Department's Office of the General Counsel (OGC) -- empowers Americans with the information they deserve about the current relationships between taxpayer-supported institutions and foreign actors, who may not have the best interests of students at heart. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations described foreign spending on U.S. institutions as "a black hole" because schools "routinely" fail to comply with the law, and foreign money can come with strings attached that might compromise academic freedom.Among the report's major findings:* Huawei, the Chinese technology giant supported by the Chinese Communist Party, had financial ties to nearly all the investigated institutions. Huawei targets its funding to issues key to national security, such as nuclear science, robotics, and online cloud services.* Two Chinese companies are working with one American university on a research project involving crowd surveillance and predictive behavior technology, which the Chinese government could harness for nefarious purposes.* A university accepted a $25,000 sponsorship from Kaspersky Government Security Solutions, a cybersecurity company with suspected ties to the Russian government, to host a cybersecurity conference.* A large donation by a Saudi prince to a university empowered the Saudis to push an ideological-driven narrative through the teaching and learning done on specific topics relevant to the Middle East.* Two universities failed to accurately account for foreign funding of their campuses in Doha, Qatar, in part by the Qatari government. The Qatari Foundation exerted its influence to stifle free speech.In June, the Secretary unveiled an online portal to make it easier for institutions to report foreign gifts and contracts valued at more than $250,000. To date, that portal has recorded more than 7,000 transactions, totaling $3.8 billion. Some 60 of the schools that have filed through the portal so far had not submitted any reports between 1986 and June 2020, and their disclosures alone totaled $350 million for the July 31, 2020, reporting period.Connecting With the FieldWith visits, calls, and virtual showcases, Secretary DeVos and Department senior officials are promoting safely reopening schools and expanding educational options for students and families.On October 16, the Secretary toured two Iowa apprenticeship programs: Vermeer Manufacturing's program in Pella (joined by Governor Kim Reynolds) and Dordt University's program in Sioux City (video).Next, on October 19, the Secretary delivered a keynote address at Hillsdale College in Michigan.Then, on October 20, the Secretary spoke about the need to transform and adapt K-12 education during this time of COVID-19 as part of the Milken Institute Global Conference.This week, traveling across the American South, the Secretary participated in a roundtable discussion with Kentucky Pastors in Action in Louisville; visited Florida Virtual School headquarters in Orlando (joined by State Commissioner of Education Richard Corcoran); toured Belton Preparatory Academy and Anderson Institute of Technology in South Carolina (joined by Deputy Secretary of Education Mitchell Zais and State Superintendent of Education Molly Spearman); and participated in a roundtable discussion with Black Led Schools of Choice in Fayetteville, North Carolina.Separately, Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education Frank Brogan and Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration (delegated the duties and responsibilities of the Assistant Secretary for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services) Mark Schultz hosted almost a dozen virtual showcases. Brogan featured Hills-Beaver Creek Independent School District in Minnesota; St. Timothy Christian Academy in Plano, Texas; University Charter School in Livingston, Alabama; Fort Huachuca Accommodation Schools in Arizona; Avon Local Schools in Ohio; Havasu Preparatory Academy in Lake Havasu City, Arizona; and Pima Unified School District in Arizona. Schultz featured Spectrum Charter School in Monroeville, Pennsylvania; Brehm Preparatory Academy in Carbondale, Illinois; and statewide vocational rehabilitation services in Iowa and South Carolina.An Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) Back to School Success Stories page offers testimonials written and submitted by parents, teachers, school officials, and community members sharing their positive experiences with bringing students back to school (see local media coverage of one story).Also, the Department continued its social media campaign spotlighting educators who have successfully transitioned back to school this fall (see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11).Pandemic-Related NewsOn October 23, the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services (HHS) provided an update on the school mask initiative in support of President Trump's safe reopening of schools. As of last week, 110 million masks had been deployed. Distribution of adult-sized masks is complete; child-sized masks are being distributed as soon as they are manufactured.Also on October 23, the Department of Education released a Parent and Family Digital Learning Guide, a resource to help parents and guardians understand how digital tools can provide tailored learning opportunities, engage students with course materials, encourage creative expression, and enrich the educational experience. The guide has advice and best practices about topics such as how to leverage flexibilities and innovations of technologies and digital tools, like accessibility options, to meet the unique needs of every learner; steps parents can take to keep their children safe online and foster safe digital behavior, like accessing security features on a child's device, tracking log-on information, and monitoring videoconferencing; how competency-based learning, which measures a student's knowledge of a subject rather than time spent on the subject, can harness technology for the benefit of students; and simple primers on major federal laws governing student privacy and safety. This publication is the first in a series that will also provide digital learning knowledge and resources to educators and school leaders.The Department's Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE), Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), and Institute of Education Sciences (IES) have developed "Welcoming Safe and Supportive Learning Environments" -- resources to support teachers and school and district leaders. These resources include School Climate Improvement, Creating a Safe and Respectful Environment in Our Nation's Classrooms, Mindfulness in Education: An Approach to Cultivating Self-Awareness That Can Bolster Kids' Learning, Returning to School During and After Crisis, and Supporting Students with Disabilities at School and Home. Similar resources are available at OESE Resources, the Center on Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS), the National Center for Pyramid Innovations, and IES COVID-19 Evidence-Based Resources.OSEP also issued a new questions-and-answers document about implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part C Provision of Services in the current COVID-19 environment.And, the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) issued a new questions-and-answers document regarding the administration of the State Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) Services and American Indian Vocational Rehabilitation Services (AIVRS) programs under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and Business Enterprise programs under the Randolph-Sheppard Act during the pandemic.School Ambassador FellowshipApply now for the Department's 2021-22 School Ambassador Fellowship Program. This program enables outstanding teachers, principals, counselors, psychologists, social workers, and other school-based professionals interacting with students on a daily basis to bring their expertise to the Department and expand their knowledge of the national dialogue on education. In turn, fellows facilitate the learning and input of other educators and community members. As in previous years, applicants may choose to apply as Washington Fellows -- a full-time appointment, where fellows are based in residence at the agency's headquarters in Washington, D.C. -- or as Campus Fellows -- a part-time appointment, where fellows collaborate with the agency while maintaining their regular school responsibilities in their home communities. The application closes January 11, 2021, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time. (Note: Over 130 educators from across the nation have participated in this highly competitive year-long fellowship experience, and the Department regularly seeks the feedback of those within the Ambassador Alumni Network.)NAEP Results: Grade 12According to the most recent results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), the average reading score for the nation's twelfth-grade students declined between 2015 and 2019, and there was no statistically significant change in twelfth-graders' average mathematics score over the same time period. "The decline in twelfth-grade reading scores resembles the declines in fourth- and eighth-graders' reading scores, where we saw the largest declines among the lowest-performing students," noted National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Associate Commissioner of Assessment Peggy Carr. "There is an urgent need for research into this phenomenon, which we have now observed in multiple reading assessments, in the NAEP U.S. history assessment, in the NAEP geography assessment, and in some of our international assessments. This pattern of decline concentrated among lower-performing students -- across grades and across subjects -- is a troubling indication that too many students are falling behind."Compared to 1992, reading scores in 2019 improved only for the highest-performing students -- those at the 90th percentile. The score for twelfth-graders performing at the 75th percentile in 2019 was not measurably different from 1992. However, the scores for lower- and middle-performing students (10th, 25th, and 50th percentiles) declined compared to 1992, with the largest decrease (20 points) seen among the lowest-performing students (10th percentile). And though there was no statistically significant change in the overall average math score since 2015, scores declined for lower-performing students (10th and 25th percentiles) (press release and NAEP home page).The NAEP reading and math assessments were administered to 52,100 twelfth-graders from public and private schools nationwide between January and March 2019. (Note: Secretary DeVos issued a blunt statement on the results.)Odds and Ends* Federal Student Aid (FSA) is currently in the process of sending electronic messages to 2020-21 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA(R)) filers and parents of dependent 2020-21 FAFSA filers who have not submitted the 2021-22 FAFSA form. The goal of this fall campaign is to remind customers that the 2021-22 FAFSA form is available and should be completed as soon as possible for those planning to attend college between July 1, 2021, and June 30, 2022.* New on the Homeroom blog: "The Parent's Guide to Filling Out the FAFSA Form."* Signed into law five years ago (2015), the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) extended flexibility to states in education and laid out expectations of transparency for parents and communities (video).* OSEP released its latest "OSEP Fast Facts" on children ages 3-5 served under Part B, Section 619 of the IDEA.* Secretary DeVos announced 10 principals from 2020 National Blue Ribbon Schoolsas this year's recipients of the Terrel H. Bell Award for Outstanding School Leadership. Named for the second U.S. Secretary of Education, these awards honor principals for their outstanding work and the role they play in guiding their students and schools to excellence, often under challenging circumstances.* The Secretary also announced additional funding for the Federal Work Study (FWS) Experimental Site, an initiative that expands earn-and-learn opportunities for students by removing the barriers to off-campus jobs, allowing students to work more hours and institutions to pay for work-based learning such as apprenticeships, externships, and clinical rotations (fact sheet). Initiated in February, FWS at 190 institutions has incentivized student work opportunities that provide a paycheck and meaningful skills training aligning with students' future work goals.* When submissions closed earlier this month, the Rural Tech Project had received 63 proposals from 34 states, representing schools and school districts that serve between 15 and 7,500 students, for technology education programs. A review panel of experts across disciplines is the first to evaluate submissions and will advance the leading proposals to the judging panel.* IES Director Mark Schneider's recent blog post, "Introducing Operation Reverse the Loss," presents preliminary ideas for speeding up the IES machinery to identify, scale up, and verify the effectiveness of interventions that show promise in reversing learning loss for students at the greatest risk.Quote to Note"We have been very methodical about our rulemaking and regulatory moves to do everything according to law, so that if there are changes, they have to be done by law as well."Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos (10/19/20), from a roundtable at Hillsdale College in MichiganUpcoming EventsAmong other education-related observations, November is National Homeless Youth Awareness Month, National Native American Heritage Month, and National Veterans and Military Families Month.Schools are encouraged to invite U.S. military veterans into their classrooms around Veterans Day (November 11). Veterans can share their experiences and teach students lessons about the history and significance of the federal holiday, helping students reflect upon the importance of the ideals of liberty, freedom, and democracy.International Education Week (November 16-20), a joint initiative of the Departments of Education and State, celebrates the benefits of international education and exchange worldwide.Credits, Subscribe & UnsubscribeED Review is a product of the U.S. Department of Education Office of Communications and Outreach, State and Local EngagementTo be added or removed from distribution or submit comments (we welcome your feedback!), please contact Managing Director Adam Honeysett at (202) 401-3003 or Adam.Honeysett@ed.gov Or, visit http://www2.ed.gov/news/newsletters/edreview/.This newsletter contains hypertext links to information created and maintained by other public and private organizations.

Demonstration, virtual space held for Breonna TaylorCardinal Points: SUNY College at PlattsburghOctober 2, 2020 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: ARCHIVE; Pg. 1Length: 550 wordsBodyZoe Nguyen l Cardinal PointsBy Mataeo SmithTikTok lives to see another day - for now.In August, the Trump Administration took a hiatus from blaming China for COVID-19's deadly rampage throughout the United States to focus on TikTok. Apparently, it's more important to impede China's alleged security breaches than containing an omnipresent virus.Trump's impetus to ban TikTok, compared to containing COVID-19, is night and day. This man was ignoring the Center for Disease Control experts, refused to increase testing - because apparently, more tests reveal more positive cases - and attempted to reopen the country on Easter Sunday about three weeks into lockdown.We all know the real reason, however. Gen Z is a force to be reckoned with in terms of TikTok. Within TikTok's plethora of content lies liberal TikTok: a land where abortions should be free and Breonna Taylor's killers should be brought to justice. Gen Z formed a plan to purchase Trump rally tickets to guarantee a skeleton crowd. You'd think Trump would attack them on Twitter, but sadly he's more childish than we'd thought. Banning TikTok would silence Gen Z and eradicate an app where he's called out on his BS.Since his executive order to ban the app Aug. 6, Trump has threatened Apple and Google with fines up to $20 million, as well as supposed prison time for its workers. He also insisted the app halt all updates in the U.S preceding the ban Nov. 12.Government representatives argued TikTok was an "immediate danger" to national security given its ownership by Bytedance, a chinese multinational internet technology company. The U.S couldn't risk American user data being in the hands of the chinese government, despite Bytedance's assurance that American user data is kept stateside.CNN reported TikTok was supposed to be taken off the Google Play and Apple store Sept. 20, but TikTok hired lawyers who refuted the ban would be unconstitutional and a violation of due process.A federal judge ruled to block the ban on downloads for the app hours before restrictions were to fall into place. TikTok was granted only a temporary injunction, so it's too early to celebrate our coveted app overcoming orange donny and his cronies."The ban would have been an extraordinary action at the very time when the need for free, open and accessible communication in America is at its zenith," John Hall, one of TikTok's attorneys, told CNN.It's relieving to know Mr. grab them by the p-y will half-ass his way through an illness ravaging American cities, but will do his best to banish a Chinese app for our safety. Though the ban was supposed to distract his critics from the pandemic and wash a few specs of dirt from his name, the other half of people think he might be trying to scath China as part of his agenda to accept minimal blame for the pandemic. Donald Trump is concerned only about salvaging his seat in the White House after this acrid mess of a year.China is not the reason more than 200,000 people in the U.S have died of COVID-19. China is not the reason why face masks are now as common as underwear. China is not the reason why unemployment has reached woefully high levels since the great depression. That orange monster is, but he refuses to take any of the blame. Stay away from TikTok.Also remember to vote Nov. 3.Load-Date: October 2, 2020End of Document

Disney cannot decide on what it wants 'Mulan' to beThe Tech: Massachusetts Institute of TechnologySeptember 17, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: ARTS; Pg. 1Length: 1008 wordsByline: Joanna LinBody• Facebook• Twitter• Reddit• Email• PrintMulan (Liu Yifei) wields her father's sword in the midst of battle.Courtesy of Walt Disney StudiosMulan Directed by Niki Caro Screenplay by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Lauren Hynek, Elizabeth Martin Starring Liu Yifei, Donnie Yen, Tzi Ma, Jason Scott LeeDisney's Mulan has been through a lot of controversy in the past year. From lead actress Liu Yifei's public support of the Hong Kong police, to the pushing back of the release and hefty price tag of $30 beyond a Disney+ subscription, and to flaunting an all-Asian cast while keeping the positions of influence for a white director and writers, there are a lot of reasons why many people have decided to boycott the movie. Like other Disney live-action remakes, Mulan opted for more realism than the animated film. Mushu is gone, the iconic soundtrack is missing, and Li Shang has morphed into a barely-there love interest, Honghui (Yoson An). Yet, the movie comes off as a fantasy film instead, with Mulan being born with magical qi, the new shapeshifting witch Xianniang (Gong Li), and a phoenix spirit who leads Mulan along her path. Most strikingly, Mulan doesn't know who its audience is supposed to be. Disney could have honored the audience with which the original cartoon resonated most, Asian-Americans (and indeed, it did not resonate with the Chinese audience), by highlighting Chinese-American actors who could have benefited more from the publicity than actors already famous in China. They also would not have risked the backlash of filming in Xinjiang and thanking a Chinese government agency in the credits, given that most of the historical scenes were filmed in constructed sets in New Zealand anyway. On the other hand, knowing that Chinese moviegoers bring in more profit, Disney could have committed to a movie for the Chinese public. In that case, they could have made the movie in Mandarin (or at least provided Chinese subtitles) and discarded elements of the animated original that were not well-received 22 years ago, as two other Chinese adaptations of Mulan's story released just this year have done. Instead, Disney's Mulan oscillates between these two opposing motivations, satisfying neither the Asian-American nor Chinese viewers.Another mark the movie misses is cultural accuracy, despite the effort to make it a more researched adaptation. A blatant blunder in this movie is the misuse of the idea of qi (or chi, per the English subtitles) throughout this film. qi represents energy that flows in everyone, not just men and some especially gifted women, like Mulan and Xianniang. It is not something that is strong or weak, but something that is cultivated through practice.A second example of a gauche reference is when Mulan tells her family about two rabbits she saw in a field. While it does tie to the final line of the historical ballad about how male and female rabbits are indistinguishable while running (a metaphor for how men and women are indistinguishable in battle), its placement and delivery are awkward, with no context provided before or afterwards. Putting the political controversy and cultural faux-pas aside, Mulan does not hold its own as an action movie. As a PG-13 movie, the barbarity of killing is impossible to show, leading to lackluster depictions of war. The large battle scenes are few and far between, making the nearly two-hour movie a drag to watch. The side characters Yao (Chen Tang), Ling (Jimmy Wong), and Po (Doua Moua) barely play a part in the movie. They are reduced to one conversation during a meal, in which Ling talks about the woman with whom he was matched, and the rest of them begin to objectify women for their looks and cooking skills. When Mulan describes her "ideal woman", who is intelligent and courageous, no one takes her seriously. The conversation only moves on when Honghui jumps in, not to support her, but to take a jab at Yao's ego.Furthermore, characters do not act logically, with Xianniang letting Mulan escape to alert the capital when she easily could have killed her on the spot, and General Tung changing his mind about executing Mulan instantly after his subordinates stand in solidarity with her. The dialogue is stilted and unnatural, sounding like neither a period piece nor modern language. The Hua family's reactions to both Mulan's departure and arrival, which should be deeply emotional, read more like indifference. In the beginning of the movie, there is no setup for a happy family life together, with Mulan spending the majority of her time being dressed up or alone. When she leaves in the middle of the night, Mulan does not even stop to look at her sleeping family, as she walks out of the temple of her ancestors. After Mulan returns to her village, she shares just one hug each with her sister, mother, and father, before the Emperor's Guard arrives. While it may be more accurate to the reserve in familial interaction in Chinese culture, it leaves the heart wanting more.Perhaps the worst tragedy in Mulan is replacing the message of hard work with the importance of being born special. In the ballad, as well as the 1998 film, Mulan is an ordinary girl, who just wants to protect her father. She shows up to training camp with other equally incompetent soldiers, and they learn the art of war together through hard work. That character development can't exist in the new Mulan, because she already has all the skill she needs to win the war. The new moral of the story, one that will pervade the lives of this generation's Asian-American children, is that you are either born special, like Mulan, or not, like her inconsequential sister Xiu (Xana Tang), whose most defining trait is her fear of spiders.• Tags• critic's notebookPlease enable JavaScript to view thecomments powered by Disqus.• The Tech• 84 Massachusetts Ave, Suite 483• Cambridge, MA 02139-4300• 617.253.1541• Home• News• Opinion• Arts• Sports• Campus Life• Science• About Us• Past Issues• Policies• Advertising• Donate• Our Staff• Join The Tech• Contact Us• Facebook• Twitter• © 2020 The TechLoad-Date: September 17, 2020End of Document

Within hours of being blocked by Donald Trump, TikTok filed a complaint in Washington courtCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 19, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 455 wordsBodyThe TikTok app,which "by president's indication" Donald Trump will be blocked from Sunday, September 20, filed a last-minute complaint with a Washington federal court in an attempt to stay active in the country.TikTok and parent company ByteDance argue that they are being attacked for political reasons and that efforts to keep them away from U.S. phones are a violation of their first amendment rights.After weeks of rumors and speculation, Commerce issued an order friday blocking additional downloads of the service from Google and Apple app stores. The order will also apply to Chinese courier WeChat.The order will not affect people who have already downloaded the apps to their phones, but will prevent users from receiving updates.TikTok has approximately 100 million active users in the United States and has surprised U.S. officials who are concerned that user data will fall into the hands of the Chinese government.A commitment agreement to allow Microsoft to purchase TikTok platforms in the United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand failed when companies were unable to accept the terms."ByteDance let us know today that they would not sell TikTok's U.S. operations to Microsoft," the company reported in a statement last week."At the president's direction, we have decided on meaningful action to combat the evil collection of personal data from Americans from China – something that was raised in a motion approved by the U.S. Senate so that there is no Chinese app on government phones? while promoting our values and the norms of democracy," said US Trade Secretary Wilbur Ross.Ross confirmed the ban for WeChat and TikTok from next Sunday. "The Chinese Communist Party demonstrated that it uses this app to threaten national security, foreign policy, and the American economy,"the official added. In the case of WeChat, on the other hand, it will be banned entirely from Sunday.TikTok, Walmart and Oracle: "It would be fantastic"US President Donald Trump on Saturday evoked a possible "fantastic" deal with Oracle and Walmart concerning the activities of the Chinese TikTok app on U.S. soil."I think it's going to be a fantastic deal," Trump said. "Ihave given my blessing to the agreement. If they concrete it will be great, but also."TikTok users will be able to use that platform until November 12, a lapse that would potentially allow TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, and a U.S. company to safeguard appease Washington's concerns.For the Trump administration, this is the only way to protect Americans' data. To that, Beijing reacted this Saturday by calling the US decision "intimidation," shortly before establishing a mechanism that would allow it to sanction foreign companies.Source: agenciesLoad-Date: September 20, 2020End of Document

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE REMARKS FOR DOD ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYMPOSIUM AND EXPOSITIONStates News ServiceSeptember 9, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 2054 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the United States Army:As prepared for delivery by Secretary of Defense Dr. Mark T. EsperHello, Im Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, and its a privilege to join you today as part of the Defense Departments AI Symposium. I want to thank Nand Mulchandani and his team at the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, or JAIC, for organizing this important eventAND for bringing together the best and brightest minds in the Department who are working to accelerate the adoption of critical emerging technologies.Today, Id like to speak to you about why the United States must continue to lead the way in the responsible and ethical development of artificial intelligence and more specifically, why the Department of Defense must remain at the forefront of the military application of this game-changing technology.History informs us that those who are first to harness once-in-a-generation technologies often have a decisive advantage on the battlefield for years to come. I experienced this firsthand during Operation Desert Storm, when the United States militarys smart bombs, stealth aircraft, and satellite-enabled GPS helped decimate Iraqi forces and their Soviet equipment.In todays era of great power competition, as new technologies alter the character of warfare, we must stay ahead of our near-peer rivals namely China and Russia. Our National Defense Strategy guides us in doing just that, as we modernize the force and protect our competitive advantage across all domains: air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace.Thanks to our largest Research and Development budget in the Departments history, we are accelerating the development of critical technologies that will enable us to outpace our strategic competitors and maintain our military overmatch. But, unlike advanced munitions or next-generation platforms, artificial intelligence is in a league of its own, with the potential to transform nearly every aspect of the battlefield, from the back office to the front lines. That is why we cannot afford to cede the high ground to revisionist powers intent on bending, breaking, or reshaping international rules and norms in their favor to the collective detriment of others.In 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that whichever nation leads in AI will be the ruler of the world. He ordered his government to develop a national AI strategy, and called for increased investments. His intent is to employ any possible advantage to expand Russias influence and chip away at the sovereignty of others.We saw this with Russias incursion into Ukraine, when Russian forces used a sophisticated and well-coordinated combination of unmanned aerial vehicles, cyberattacks, and artillery barrage to inflict severe damage on Ukrainian forces. Since then, Moscow has announced the development of AI-enabled autonomous systems across ground vehicles, aircraft, nuclear submarines, and command and control. We expect them to deploy these capabilities in future combat zones.Likewise, the Chinese Communist Party recognizes the transformational power of AI, and openly declares its intentions to be the world leader by 2030.The Peoples Liberation Army regards AI as a leapfrog technology, which could enable low-cost, long-range autonomous vehicles and systems to counter Americas conventional power projection. At this moment, Chinese weapons manufacturers are selling autonomous drones they claim can conduct lethal targeted strikes. Meanwhile, the Chinese government is advancing the development of next-generation stealth UAVs, which they are preparing to export internationally.If there is any doubt as to how the CCP would wield AI to influence its agenda abroad, look no further than how it uses this capability at home. Beijing is constructing a 21st century surveillance state designed to wield unprecedented control over its own people. With hundreds of millions of cameras strategically located across the country and billions of data points generated by the Chinese Internet of Things, the CCP will soon be able to identify almost anyone entering a public space, and censor dissent in real time. More troubling is the fact that these systems can be used to invade private lives, leaving no text message, internet search, purchase, or personal activity free from Beijings tightening grip.As we speak, the PRC is deploying and honing its AI surveillance apparatus to support the targeted repression of its Muslim Uighur population. Likewise, pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong are being identified, seized, imprisoned, or worse, by the CCP's digital police state unencumbered by privacy laws or ethical governing principles. As China scales this technology, we fully expect it to sell these capabilities abroad, enabling other autocratic governments to move toward a new era of digital authoritarianism.The contrast between American leadership on AI and that of Beijing and Moscow couldnt be clearer. We are pioneering a vision for emerging technology that protects the U.S. Constitution and the sacred rights of all Americans. Abroad, we seek to promote the adoption of AI in a manner consistent with the values we share with our allies and partners: individual liberty, democracy, human rights, and respect for the rule of law, to name a few.Indeed, we approach AI as we have other high-tech breakthroughs throughout our Departments history with rigorous standards for testing and fielding capabilities, and the highest ethical expectations. Technology may constantly change, but our commitment to our core values does not.In February, we became the first military in the world to adopt ethical principles for the use of AI, based on core values such as transparency, reliability, and governability. These principles make clear to the American people and the world that the United States will once again lead the way in the responsible development and application of emerging technologies, reinforcing our role as the global security partner of choice.To build on this foundation, we are designing a comprehensive strategy to train and educate all DoD personnel from AI developers to end-users so that everyone understands their role in accelerating the Departments Digital Modernization Strategy.Over the last six months, for example, the Department has stood up a Responsible AI Committee that brings together leaders from across the enterprise to foster a culture of AI ethics within their organizations. In addition, the JAIC has launched the Responsible AI Champions program, a nine-week training course for DoD personnel directly involved in the AI delivery pipeline. We plan to scale this program to all DoD components over the coming year.Further, the JAIC, in partnership with the Defense Acquisition University and the Naval Postgraduate School, will launch an intensive six-week pilot course next month to train over 80 defense acquisition professionals of all ranks and grades. These trainees will learn how to apply AI and data science skills to our operations. With the support of Congress, the Department plans to request additional funding for the Services to grow this effort over time and deliver an AI-ready workforce to the American people.As the Defense Department builds a digital security architecture to promote responsible and ethical AI development, we are also shaping new international norms for the use of this technology. Next week, the JAIC will launch the first-ever AI Partnership for Defense, to engage military and defense organizations from more than 10 nations, with a focus on incorporating ethical principles into the AI delivery pipeline. Over the coming year, we expect to expand this initiative to include even more countries, as we create new frameworks and tools for data sharing, cooperative development, and strengthened interoperability.We have come a long way since establishing the JAIC two years ago. Today, more than 200 talented civil service and military professionals work diligently to accelerate AI solutions, and deliver these capabilities to the warfighter. From helping the Joint Force organize, fight, and win at machine speed, to enhancing wildfire and flood responses through computer vision technology, the JAIC is utilizing every aspect of artificial intelligence as a transformative instrument at home and abroad.The JAIC is also lowering technical barriers to AI adoption by building a cloud-based platform to allow DoD components to test, validate, and field capabilities with greater speed, at greater scale. The goal is to make AI tools and data accessible across the force, which will help synchronize projects and reduce redundancy, among many other benefits.As an example of the tectonic impact of machine learning on the future of warfighting, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) recently conducted its third and final F-16 combat simulation between an AI-controlled system and an experienced Air Force fighter pilot. The AI agents resounding victory demonstrated the ability of advanced algorithms to out-perform humans in virtual dogfights. These simulations will culminate in a real-world competition involving full-scale tactical aircraft in 2024.To be clear, AIs role in our lethality is to support human decision-makers, not replace them. We see AI as a tool to free up resources, time, and manpower so our people can focus on higher priority tasks, and arrive at the decision point, whether in a lab or on the battlefield, faster and more precise than the competition.For instance, AI is advancing automated chemistry for a host of national security applications, including the continuous manufacturing of critical pharmaceuticals and the development of novel propellants for spacecraft engines. These advances free up time for our scientists and researchers to focus on next-generation innovation, rather than countless tests and experiments.Furthermore, through DARPAs Spectrum Collaboration Challenge, we are demonstrating the power of machine learning to improve spectrum usage through autonomous collaboration, which has enormous implications for future military and commercial networking, especially with 5G.Lastly, to fully realize the potential of AI across the Defense Department, we are committed to reforming outdated policies, divesting from legacy systems, modernizing our acquisition practices, and strengthening our partnerships across industry and academia.Decades ago, the federal government supplied the bulk of research and development funding for many of the Departments most important hardware capabilities. Today, the private sector leads the way in software. We need to be fast followers of our industry partners, and work hand-in-hand with them to develop AI at the speed and scale needed to stay ahead of the competition.During the Departments coronavirus response, for example, the JAIC worked alongside industry to develop a predictive analytics tool that helped U.S. Northern Command manage supply chains and identify hotspots with the greatest need. And, in academia, the Army AI Task Force at Carnegie Melon University, and the Air Force AI Accelerator, sit at the crossroads of higher education, industry, and defense, rapidly prototyping cutting-edge innovation. Ultimately, these kinds of solutions are vital not only for our Department of Defense missions, but also for the good of the American people.With each generation come new technologies that fundamentally alter the way we think about, plan, and prepare for war. AI is one such breakthrough with boundless potential for good or for ill. However, unlike our competitors, we commit to using these capabilities to preserve peace, promote prosperity, respect rights, and maintain the free and open order that benefits all nations.As the epicenter of groundbreaking innovation, the United States will once again lead the way in developing and governing emerging technologies. We will stay true to our core values and principles. We will remain the global security partner of choice. And together with our allies and partners, we will defend the international rules and norms that have secured our rights and our homeland for generations.Thank you for your time, and thank you for all that you do to ensure the Department of Defense remains the standard of excellence, at home and abroad.Load-Date: September 10, 2020End of Document

ByteDance can't keep control of TikTok in agreement: TrumpCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 21, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 513 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he could rescind his tentative approval of an agreement between Oracle Corp. and ByteDance to create a new U.S.-based TikTok service, which calls into question the deal, as Chinese state media showed reluctance in Beijing.In an interview on Fox News on Monday, Trump said he would not approve the deal if the Chinese company retains control of TikTok. However, he also indicated that he hoped that Chinese influence would be diluted by a future public offering from the new company."They will have nothing to do with the company, and if they have involvement, we just won't make the deal," Trump said, referring to ByteDance, owner of TikTok. "It's going to be controlled, totally controlled by Oracle, and I guess they'll go public and buy the rest. They're buying a lot, and if we find out they have no full control, then we're not going to approve the deal."Shortly after Trump's comments, Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the State of China-affiliated Global Times, tweeted that Beijing would likely reject the agreement "because it would jeopardize China's national security, interests, and dignity."The Global Times is a tabloid newspaper run by People's Daily, the Communist Party's flagship newspaper. Hu's tweets are closely followed after successfully forecasting the Chinese government's previous measures, although his statements sometimes do not reflect official policy.ByteDance was pressured to reach an agreement on TikTok in August, when Trump threatened to ban the application in the U.S. over national security concerns about the service's data collection. After Microsoft Corp. made a proposal for a full purchase, ByteDance instead turned to Oracle's offering, in which the Chinese parent company will maintain a strong majority stake.ByteDance could end up owning up to 80% of TikTok Global, which would include the application's operations in the U.S. and the rest of the world, excluding China.On Friday, Trump said he had approved the deal with Oracle and WalMart Inc. "as a whole."Under the current proposal, there will be five seats on the board of directors of TikTok Global. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon will become a director, the retailer said in a statement. TikTok Global is likely to be based in Texas and will "at least" hire 25,000 people, Trump said.TikTok's assessment was an imminent question following the Washington and Beijing crash over negotiations. The service for the U.S. market alone is estimated to be worth between $20 billion and $50 billion, or even more.TikTok Global intends to hold an initial public offering within 12 months, Said Oracle and Walmart.Oracle will have full access to review TikTok source code and updates to ensure that the company's Chinese matrix does not use backdoors to collect data or spy on the 100 million U.S. users of the app, according to people familiar with the matter. The US software giant has assured that it can protect TikTok user data from foreign influence.Original Note:Trump Says ByteDance Can't Keep Control of TikTok in Oracle Deal©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: September 22, 2020End of Document

Decision 2020 Report: Policy Implications for the Emergence of Artificial IntelligenceTargeted News ServiceOctober 10, 2020 Saturday 9:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1482 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: STANFORD, California Body(TNSRes) -- The Hoover Institution issued the following news release:In the twentieth edition of the Decision 2020 Report, Hoover fellows assess the economic, national security, and geopolitical implications of innovations in artificial intelligence (AI).AI a New Measure of Global CompetitivenessSenior Fellow John Villasenor argued that countries that maintain an overreliance on legacy infrastructure will face increasing challenges in sustaining global competitiveness."Why?" Villasenor asked readers. "Because geopolitics is determined in large part by many of the same domains that AI is poised to revolutionize."He explained that AI technology presents enormous economic growth opportunities because it can vastly improve efficiency in such sectors as agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, and trade. He added that AI will also force a change in thinking about how nations manage their security challenges and adapt their militaries.Villasenor contended that while China has shrewdly bet on AI as a key component of its economic growth, the US still remains a global AI leader with an ecosystem of companies pioneering such technology, including Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. The US government, he added, has also invested billions in developing AI infrastructure, and universities have bolstered the research and teaching on the subject in efforts to maintain and enhance America's advantage in AI human capital.Villasenor maintained that America's biggest challenge as a competitor in the AI domain is the threat of burdensome government regulation that reduces individual incentive and slows the engine of innovation."Maintaining AI preeminence is a multi-decade endeavor--a far greater time scale than the term lengths of elected officials," Villasenor explained. "This lowers the incentives to implement AI-focused policy strategies that might take several years or more to bear fruit."The Promise and Peril of AI InnovationIn an interview published by Stanford News, James Timbie, a Hoover distinguished visiting fellow and Stanford-trained physicist, explained that though society as a whole will benefit from increased productivity and lower costs as a result of artificial intelligence and advanced robotics, research indicates that half of all US workers will be adversely effected in the near term.He believes that in some cases machines will replace the jobs of manufacturing workers, drivers of heavy transport, and even educated and well-paid workers including tax preparers, radiologists, software engineers, paralegals, and financial analysts.In other fields, such as medicine and education, the labor force will be transformed with skilled humans working in close coordination with machines."Machines would continue to do the computational work they do well, while leaving other tasks to humans who see the big picture and have interpersonal skills," Timbie explained.Timbie said that the current technical revolution is unfolding at an even faster rate than in the last two centuries, a pace that will enable the creation of more national wealth, but that will also lead to greater income inequality.Timbie said that the best way to adjust to these evolving economic realities is not to provide guaranteed basic income, as some policy makers and social scientists have advocated. Rather, his view is that society should help support people in developing skills for new types of jobs."There is no shortage of work that needs to be done. . . . There are potential opportunities for displaced workers with appropriate training," Timbie said. "The rapid pace of change reinforces the benefit of a habit of life-long education."Rules of Engagement for AIIn an article for the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, Herbert S. Lin, the Hank J. Holland Fellow in Cyber Policy and Security, wrote (https://thebulletin.org/2017/09/will-artificially-intelligent-weapons-kill-the-laws-of-war/) that the emergence of AI-integrated weapons systems and their numerous capabilities may cause a dilemma for state actors in determining whether to comply with the laws of war.Lin asked readers to assume opposing militaries have the same technological capabilities and equal numbers of fielded systems that engage in combat. By this assumption, Lin argued, one can deduce that the advantage would be for the combatant that practices less restraint on the use of force and does not comply with their country's laws and international treaties.As an example, Lin provided a lesson from World War II, when German U-boat commanders violated Article 22 of the 1930 London Naval Treaty, which forbade the sinking of neutral civilian merchant ships. Since many of these merchant ships carried war materials, the Germans were not providing warnings before attacks, because they believed it reduced their operational effectiveness especially if those ships were armed.Furthermore, Lin explained, at the Nuremberg trials following the war, a tribunal ignored these violations because Great Britain and France had also been engaged in unrestricted submarine warfare."As the history of unrestricted submarine warfare demonstrates, humanitarian motivations were ignored when observing those restrictions compromised combat effectiveness," Lin said. "It's not unimaginable that a similar fate might await the laws of war when AI-enabled weapons become ubiquitous."The Emerging AI Challenge from ChinaThe Hoover Institution's new director, Condoleezza Rice, provided opening remarks on Tuesday, September 29, to a Hoover-partnered virtual conference about the Chinese government's application of artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge technologies, arguing that they pose a unique and far greater challenge than Soviet military ambitions during the Cold War."[China has] pushed its own technological frontiers by a very determined desire to be the leader," Rice said.She maintains that for authoritarians like the Chinese Communist Party, an unrestrained application of such technology allows them to "dream big." Beijing has not only created an Orwellian state apparatus that oppresses its people and leaves them no place to hide but also aims to export this mode of governance and interfere in the political affairs of democracies across the world.A lack of institutional constraints, Rice holds, provides the CCP and other authoritarians strategic advantages over the free world. However, she cautions that Americans should avoid imitating China and surrendering its democratic values to meet this challenge."We need to have a concerted effort on behalf of free peoples to make sure that the digital authoritarians don't win," Rice said. "They can't win the race for this technology, because whoever wins this race is going to have a leg up on shaping the international system."More on the Policy Implications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Other Emerging TechnologiesWatch the entire virtual conference The Rise of Digital Authoritarianism: China, AI, and Human Rights (https://www.hoover.org/events/rise-digital-authoritarianism-china-ai-human-rights)," co-presented by the Hoover Institution, the Stanford's Global Digital Policy Incubator, the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, and the Human Rights Foundation.Read Beyond Disruption: Technology's Challenge to Governance (https://www.hoover.org/research/beyond-disruption-technologys-challenge-governance), by James Timbie, Jim Hoagland, and George P.

U.S. Department of Education Uncovers Vast Underreporting of Foreign Gifts and Contracts by Higher Education InstitutionsTargeted News ServiceOctober 22, 2020 Thursday 9:10 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 592 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of Education issued the following news release on Oct. 20:U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos unveiled a report today detailing the massive failure of many colleges and universities to disclose more than $6.5 billion in funding and resources from foreign sources including China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. Section 117 of the Higher Education Act requires institutions of higher education to transparently report foreign gifts and contracts, yet over the course of the last year, the Department has uncovered billions in unreported financial ties."The threat of improper foreign influence in higher education is real. Our action today ensures that America's students, educators, and taxpayers can follow the money," said Secretary DeVos. "Transparency in foreign funding of higher education is not just something I think is a good thing; it's the law. For too long, enforcement of that law was lax, but not anymore."After four decades of pervasive noncompliance by colleges and universities, this landmark report produced by the Office of the General Counsel empowers American taxpayers with the transparency they deserve about the relationships between taxpayer-supported institutions and foreign actors, who may not have the best interests of students at heart. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations described foreign spending on U.S. schools as "a black hole" because colleges and universities "routinely" fail to comply with the law, and reported foreign money can come with strings attached that might compromise academic freedom.Major findings of the report include:* Two universities failed to accurately account for foreign funding of their campuses in Doha,Qatar, which are funded in part by the Qatari government. The Qatari Foundation exerted its financial influence to stifle free speech.* Huawei, the Chinese technology giant supported by the Chinese Communist Party, had financial ties to nearly all the investigated institutions. Huawei targets its higher education funding to issues important to national security such as nuclear science, robotics, and online cloud services.* Two Chinese companies are working with one U.S. university on a research project involving crowd surveillance and predictive behavior technology, which the Chinese government could potentially harness for nefarious purposes.* A large donation by Prince Alwaleed bin Talal to Georgetown University empowered the Saudis to push a particular ideologically-driven narrative through the teaching and learning done on specific topics relevant to the Middle East.* One university accepted a $25,000 sponsorship from Kaspersky Government Security Solutions, a cybersecurity company with suspected ties to the Russian government, to host a cybersecurity conference.In June, the Secretary unveiled a new online portal (https://ifap.ed.gov/electronic-announcements/062220ReminderRprtOwnerContrlContrctsGiftsForeignSrc) to make it easier for schools to report foreign gifts and contracts valued at more than $250,000.

Samsung returns to the race for 5GCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 12, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1195 wordsBodyFor years, Huawei's biggest rivals in the telecommunications equipment market – Finland's Nokia and Ericsson group in Sweden – had their headquarters away from the group. But now, a credible competitor looking to venture into the global race to implement 5G emerged closer to home: Samsung Electronics. The Seoul-based group has long lagged behind its global peers when it comes to telecommunications equipment. In the minds of investors and analysts, Samsung's networking business has been a distant and additional occurrence to its main revenue engines: computer chips, smartphones and displays.But there are growing signs that it is ready to play a relevant role, driven by the confluence of 5G deployments around the world and the growing pressure from allied U.S. (US) governments to block Huawei, the industry's largest participant. In the 5G gameSamsung's progress was underlined in September when it obtained a $6.6 billion (mdd) contract with US group Veri-zon to supply 5G radio access network (RAN) equipment to the US operator until the end of 2025, which added its credibility as a serious competitor in the network business."Samsung's latest achievement with Verizon could change the rules of the game," said Stefan Pongratz, a 5G expert at Dell'Oro Group.Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia still dominate the global market in the network equipment business, and together have a 70 to 80% stake, estimated. But Samsung has started to gain ground.In the general telecommunications equipment market, which includes previous iterations such as 4G, Samsung's market share nearly doubled over the past two years to around 3%, according to Dell'Oro. But in the new 5G mobile infrastructure market, its market share in the middle of this year was between 10 and 15%.Samsung, which did not want to comment, is already capitalizing as several countries increase investment in 5G. Outside Of South Korea, it reached agreements in the US with Sprint, AT and US Cellular; with KDDI in Japan; with Telus and Videotron in Canada and Spark in New Zealand.m{1046333}The opportunityThe race to print 5G —the world's fifth generation mobile network, which is touted as critical to advances in industrial automation, driverless cars and the co-sas Internet—is expected to stimulate annual investment with more than 235,000 mdd on average through 2035, according to IHS Markit. The US and China are projected to invest more than $1 billion in 5G-related capital and research and development expenditures over 16 years."We are at an early stage of the 5G era," said Ian Fogg, senior analyst at the British research group Open-signal. "There's still a lot at stake."Donald Trump's administration's pressure on Huawei provoked criticism in many countries about his reliance on the Chinese group's kit, both for central networks and hardware, such as base stations, and antennas that make up RAN, which connect the devices to those networks.According to Dell'Oro data, telecom operators in at least 14 countries are re-evaluating or reviewing their reliance on Huawei's RAN portfolio, including 2G, 3G and 4G equipment. Countries, including Australia, Brazil, Germany and the United Kingdom, account for about 33.3% of ran's global market."Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung are be-nephiting the growing geopolitical uncertainty," Pongratz said.Given doubts about Huawei's ability to accessspecific technology and foreign markets, a key selling point for Samsung is its secure supply chain. The Korean group's 5G business has little exposure to China, instead manufacturing its network equipment in South Korea and Vietnam while producing other key components, such as its 5G modem chip, in the US.The outstanding problemsSamsung is used to fighting for the top spot in global technology ratings, but by comparison, its telecommunications operation is relatively small.While the company has been developing related technology for more than 40 years, several previous attempts to grow its networking business failed after it focused on a number of wireless technologies that quickly became obsolete.Woojune Kim, head of global sales for Samsung's network business, told a UK Parliament committee in July: "I could say we're betting on the wrong horse."In recent years, the group has been intensitive to 5G, spending more on research and taking a more active role in developing industry standards and protocols that apply to new network technology.Earlier this year, Samsung was behind Huawei alone in patents declared 5G, according to ip property group IPlytics. The problems Nokia faces today with the quality of its products in the early stages of 5G gave the South Korean group a greater boost, analysts said.But competition will be fierce as companies compete for billions of dollars in investments. Fogg noted that previous changes in network equipment technology caused periods of turmoil as telecommunications groups switch equipment suppliers, companies consolidate, and former operators stay in the way.Choosing 5G equipment suppliers "is not a simple equation," he said."Basically, you have to make an assessment of his future. You have to think about the reliability of the life of the contract."Some carriers that change Huawei's legacy equipment might favor Ericsson and Nokia because they are better able to supply equipment from 2G to 5G, unlike Samsung, analysts suggest. Samsung's answer is that there are few benefits of having a "úni-ca RAN", and argues that it is faster and no less secure for network operators to overlay 4G and 5G technology on legacy 2G and 3G networks.Another criticism expressed by analysts is that Samsung, traditionally focused on hardware manufacturing, suffers from poor service offerings as part of its networking business, hampering its capacity in areas such as network design, testing, optimization, and software.According to people close to the company, the group took steps to remedy this by acquiring TeleWorld Solutions, a Virginia-based network service provider, in January this year, and by launching a wave of engagements for its service team.Huawei: beaten but not knocked outUp now, Samsung's 5G business set its sights on network operators primarily in advanced economies, particularly in Asia, Western Europe and North America.The company also believes it is strongly positioned in India after obtaining a contract to develop the 4G network for Reliance Jio, despite wider pressure from New Delhi to use domestic technology.These are also mainly markets where there is pressure on governments to block Huawei due to persistent fears about the company's ties to the chinese government and army.Butthat still leaves large swaths of the global market, including many emerging economies, where governments ignored US concerns.Samsung, Nokia and Ericsson face the prospect of competing with the Chinese group in Africa, where Huawei developed a dominant position in much of the continent, according to analysts.Samsung notes that there are markets where it cannot compete with Huawei. "They're just a very tough competitor. When you go to tenders, we've often seen offers that don't seem to make sense in price," Kim said in July.m{1046329}Load-Date: October 13, 2020End of Document

Briefing.com: Story Stocks (R)Briefing.comSeptember 14, 2020 Monday 10:12 AM ESTCopyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc. All rights reserved.This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.Length: 580 wordsBodyStory Stocks (R)Updated: 14-Sep-20Quotes at time of story, top stories today: 10:1110:11 ETOracle emerges as winner in TikTok deal, but key details still lacking:In a surprising twist of events, Oracle (ORCL) has reportedly emerged as the winning bidder for TikTok's U.S. business. When President Trump ordered China-based ByteDance to sell the U.S. TikTok operations last month, Microsoft (MSFT) quickly surfaced as the front-runner to buy the assets.Last night, however, ByteDance turned down MSFT's offer, choosing instead to hammer out a deal with ORCL.The terms of that deal are very murky, though. In fact, it's not even known whether ORCL is taking a majority ownership position in TikTok. Several reports indicate that the arrangement is set to be more like a partnership than an outright acquisition.Due to the unprecedented circumstances surrounding this forced sale, as well as the mounting tension between the U.S. and China, the path to this clouded outcome has been a winding one.After the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) expressed concerns that TikTok user data was being shared with the Chinese government, President Trump imposed a September 20th deadline for ByteDance to sell the business.Unsurprisingly, China balked at the assertion and updated the country's technology export control rules. Specifically, any company considering selling technology to an outside party must gain permission from the Chinese government. This includes TikTok's proprietary algorithm.This new law threw a wrench in any proposed transaction because TikTok's algorithm is a vital component behind the success and popularity of the app. Specifically, the algorithm uses machine learning to queue up videos and memes that match a user's interests.Without the algorithm, ORCL would have to attempt to recreate it, which would be a time-consuming, and possibly unsuccessful, endeavor. It's also unclear whether CFIUS will approve a deal without the algorithm.There's plenty of uncertainty swirling around this arrangement, but it's clear why ORCL is interested in TikTok. The app, which has 100 mln users in the U.S., is growing by leaps-and-bounds. ByteDance believes TikTok will generate revenue of $6 bln next year, which is enough to significantly move the needle for ORCL. Analysts are currently forecasting that ORCL will post about $40 bln in revenue for FY21.ORCL would house TikTok's data, which is currently stored in Alphabet's (GOOG) cloud. This would allow ORCL to structure and monetize the rapidly expanding data.Traditionally known for on-premise database software, ORCL has shifted its focus to cloud storage and application software in order to spark stronger growth. Bringing TikTok on board would not only accelerate this transition, but it would also diversify ORCL's business by adding social media to the mix.The benefits for ORCL could be substantial. Like other aspects of this deal, it's unknown whether ORCL paid a hefty price to make this transaction happen. A couple weeks ago, reports suggested that TikTok was seeking as much as $50 bln for its U.S. assets.More information should be emerging very soon, so stay tuned. For the moment, it appears that ORCL is on the verge of making a game-changing deal.Briefing.com Note: Shares of ORCL are currently halted.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: September 14, 2020End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 39 of 343Word on Wall Street; Campaigning on the Economy; Proposed Vaccine Roll Out; Business Struggles Amid Pandemic  Page 41 of 343TikTok fate in the balance as judge weighs app store ban  Page 44 of 343Ant Group raises $34 billion in world's largest IPO  Page 47 of 343At UN, Trump raps China for virus as US deaths top 200,000  Page 49 of 343White House trade director: Trump to talk tough on China in Dayton  Page 52 of 343AP: Oracle and TikTok struck a deal.
