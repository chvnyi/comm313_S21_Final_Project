The new normal in Chinese jobs: head coverings, constant cleaning and absolute vigilanceCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 14, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1115 wordsBodyBMW workers take the temperature themselves three times a day and send the results via an internal chat app. Foxconn, the electronics giant, asks his employees to wash their hands before and after handling documents. A ride-sharing driver cleans your car daily and sends video testing to your headquarters.The world needs rules and standards for workplaces after coronavirus and China is the first testing lab.Three months after authorities virtually shut down the country to stop the outbreak, employees have returned to work to revive the vast growth machinery without causing another outbreak. If Chinese factories and offices succeed without further contagion, they could serve as a model for US President Donald Trump and other leaders looking to get their economies back on track.Many of the new rules in the workplace are obvious: the use of disinfectants, sketch covers and keeping the distance among colleagues, but some are committed to monitoring and pressuring employees in ways that workers in other countries consider unacceptable, including the use of government-backed applications for health surveillance. At the same time, local authorities have established a combination of rules that differ from city to city and have confused business.Everyone agrees on one thing: there will be no return to normal after the pandemic.At BMW Brilliance, the partnership with a Chinese manufacturer, about a quarter of the workers continues in their homes (Giulia Marchi for The New York Times)"Life will never be the way it was again," said Johann Wieland, ceo of BMW's joint venture in China, which employs more than 20,500 people. "That's what we need to learn."Larger companies are asking their workers to change their daily personal habits as well as their behavior in the workplace. Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics giant that makes iPhones and other Western branded equipment in large Chinese factories, has advised its workers in an information leaflet to avoid public transportation and better walk, bike or drive.Foxconn has also recommended that employees push elevator buttons cautiously, wash their hands before and after handling documents, and eat their lunch at staggered times. They have been told that buses and boardrooms must be ventilated and have the windows open.BASF, the German chemical giant, launched its own air bus policy. During the early days of this new policy, workers wore extra layers of clothing to protect themselves from cold air.Employees are closely monitored. If company supervisors identify a worker with a fever at the front door, that person is taken to a hospital and his colleagues are quarantined. Managers also work with local government officials to determine whether an employee has traveled by plane or train with a infected person."I think it would be almost impossible to do so without the help of the authorities," said Brad Morrison, senior vice president of operations and head of construction at BASF.The drivers of Didi Chuxing, a transport app, they've put up plastic screens to protect themselves (Giulia Marchi for The New York Time)However, rules shifting from place to place have tangled logistics and supply chains. Although restrictions have eased since China drastically limited movement across the country at the start of the outbreak, local authorities continue to erect temporary barriers, especially in places where sporadic contagion has emerged.Within BASF's facilities, the standards are uniform. Everyone uses head-coverings. Surfaces are cleaned frequently. In the cafeteria you can not sit more than one person at a table and these have been rearranged to look in one direction. Some boardrooms have been converted into temporary places to eat to avoid crowds.The staff who handle machinery or press buttons work inside the plant. The rest is communicated by radios from the outside. Laboratories and plants hold shifts A and B. Face-to-face communication is not allowed in shift transfer."These measures are logical," Morrison said. "It's a small sacrifice to be able to operate your own plants."To stay safe, many workers use government-approved health code features recently built into some of China's most popular smartphone apps, such as Alipay and WeChat. The health code feature is one of the first services created to measure an employee's risk of contagion and tracks a person's travel to determine whether they have been in areas with high levels of contagion, although the creators and the Chinese government have not revealed all the details about how it works. When requested by health workers, police officers or security personnel, the person displays a red, yellow, or green code.JD.com workers register their entry with an app on their smartphone reporting the user's calculated risk of contagion using a QR code, at the company's headquarters in Beijing on May 11, 2020. (Giulia Marchi/The New York Times)The State Administration for Market Regulation, a regulatory body for trade rules, is creating a unified health data platform for citizens' information that is collected during the outbreak. However, the system, which would use QR codes, is still in its infanus and has already filed flaws.Liu Nan doesn't take any chances. Liu owns two roast beef restaurants in Jiamusi, northeast China, and he asks his customers to display their smartphone health codes before entering."Some people complain that other restaurants aren't that strict," said Liu, who named his restaurant Chunli Jia, after his wife. "But we have to keep telling them that we want to make sure our restaurants areinsurance."At JD.com headquarters in Beijing, elevators have been rescheduled to stop only on designated floors to limit worker interaction. They also have marks that indicate where people should stand.Employees enter the office in two shifts. Many continue to work from home full-time.There are special trash cans for sketch covers, disposable handkerchiefs and food containers. The dining room is closed. Workers are encouraged to ask the cafeteria for their food online and pick it up on different floors. The office building is disinfected three times a day.BMW Brilliance, BMW's joint venture with a Chinese automaker, has similar policies at its Beijing headquarters, where about three-quarters of employees are going to work these days."The biggest challenge is the enormous economic and social pressure we face that forces us to open up and relax measures too soon," said Wieland, the ceo of the joint venture."People want to get back to normal, and everyone has to learn and understand that we have to behave more consciously."Keith Bradsher collaborated with this report.(c) The New York Times 2020Load-Date: May 15, 2020End of Document

Moulton's backing of resolution against China faces backlashThe Salem News (Beverly, MA)March 26, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 The Salem NewsDistributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength: 886 wordsByline: Ethan Forman, The Salem News, Beverly, Mass.BodyMarch 26--     Mar. 26--SALEM -- U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Salem, is taking heat from his 6th District Democratic primary challengers and others on social media for cosponsoring a resolution condemning the Chinese government's handling of the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.Moulton is a lead co-sponsor with U.S. Rep. Jim Banks, R-Indiana, of a resolution that condemns the Chinese government's "serious mistakes in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak." The resolutions claims things were worsened when China suppressed information about the disease, went after journalists, spread propaganda and blamed the U.S. military for the pandemic.Critics say the resolution is mistimed and could create a backlash against Asian Americans during a pandemic in which there have been numerous reports of anti-Asian incidents and violence at a time when President Donald Trump insists on using the phrase "Chinese virus" to describe the novel coronavirus."This is not the time for an elected representative to be thinking about China," said Democratic primary challenger Jamie Zahlaway Belsito, in a statement. "The fight against this virus is right here.""President Trump's failure to act when action was urgently needed has left thousands of American lives at risk," said Democratic challenger Angus McQuilken, also of Topsfield, in a statement. "This resolution won't save a single one of those lives, or put a single American back to work. It is simply a Republican attempt to distract, divide and promote xenophobia."When reached, Rockport Democratic challenger D. Nathaniel Mulchay pointed to his statement and a letter he sent to members of Congress which he posted to Twitter."The resolution by 40 Republicans, joined by a sole Democrat, Rep. Seth Moulton, is not only racist and (xenophobic), it goes against the very recommendations of the (World Health Organization and the CDC who had determined any such statement would endanger the lives of Americans and anyone in the world who is of Asian descent," Mulchay.In an interview, Moulton defended his decision to cosponsor the resolution as the only Democrat so far to sign it as of Wednesday.Moulton said it's important to hold accountable authoritarian regimes "especially because it helps us hold President Trump accountable when he takes a page out of their playbook. If you look at what China has done here, starting this disinformation campaign, kicking out journalists, attacking minorities, these are all things Trump has done himself."That includes spreading disinformation about the spread of the coronavirus and attacking reporters who ask tough questions, Moulton said. Trump, he added, is not doing enough to condemn assaults against Chinese Americans who came to the United States "because they believe our values, not the values of the Chinese Communist Party.""Now is not the time for our representative to spend valuable time and energy assessing and assigning fault during the evolving coronavirus situation," Belsito said. "I would prefer to see Mr. Moulton focusing all of his energy on how to help constituents here at home, rather than grandstanding during a critical time of need," said Belsito, an advocate for better mental health services for women and families and a Salem State University trustee."Instead of focusing on the economic recovery bill, or holding the president's feet to the fire on his tragically slow response to the coronavirus, Seth Moulton is spending his time teaming up with House Republicans to provide cover to this president for his failures of leadership," said McQuilken, a cofounder of the Massachusetts Coalition to End Gun Violence.Moulton said he shared his challengers' concerns about xenophobia long before he co-signed the resolution.Moulton, a Marine Corps. veteran of the Iraq War, took exception to China blaming the U.S. military for the spread of the coronavirus.The resolution states that the Chinese foreign minister claimed COVID-19 "originated in the United States and that the United States Army brought the virus to Wuhan to wage biological warfare on China.""I'm always going to stand up for our troops when they are being blamed for something that they didn't do," Moulton said. He said he has not only received criticism online, but support from pro-Democracy advocates in China and Hong Kong.Moulton said he spoke with U.S. Rep. Judy Chu, D-California, chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, who called him after he signed on to the resolution to express her concerns for Asian Americans."And, a number of colleagues who have reached out have said they don't disagree with anything in resolution, they're just expressed concerns about the time, but the facts are what they are," Moulton said."I have yet to receive a single complaint from anyone about any particular thing in the resolution," Moulton said.According to Moulton's spokesman Tim Biba, Moulton has signed on to a resolution condemning anti-Asian sentiment and attacks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The resolution cites a rise in hate crimes against those of Asian descent, with a study showing more than 400 cases between Feb 9 and March 7 of this year.___ (c)2020 The Salem News (Beverly, Mass.)

Shenzhen, China's great metropolis of technologyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 23, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 552 wordsBodyToday, Shenzhen, which was a fishing village, is a city of more than 13 million people located in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong; it is also one of the fastest growing cities in the world, and one of the first places on the planet in scientific investment. What happened to make such a major change happen?The history of this new Shenzhen began in 1980, when the Chinese government decided to establish the country's first special economic zone there. Since then, the city has attracted entrepreneurs and investments from the rest of the world, and has achieved unprecedented economic, industrial, urban and technological development.According to Sina Finance's 10-strongest Chinese city base in 2019, Shenzhen topped the list. The capital of China, Beijing, and the Shanghai financial center took second and third place on the list.According to the sustainable development plan published by the city 2017-2030, Shenzhen seeks to become a world-class innovative city in terms of sustainable development by 2030. To that end, local government has formulated many preferential policies to ensure that the city attracts more talent, including more generous grants and allocations and better scientific research conditions. Thanks to programs implemented by the Chinese government, it has become one of The most emerging cities in China, playing a leading role in the technology and creative industries sector. It's even known as China's "Silicon Valley."The management of the city is completely intelligent, it has a unified, open and intelligent control system, the brain of the city, which is known as the Longgang Operations Center (LOC). In real time, it receives data on transport, emergencies, public safety, among many other variables.Cradle of large global companiesSome famous companies from various industries, such as Huawei, ZTE, DJI, BYD or Tencent, have been born in Shenzhen. Communication is one of the important fields of high-tech. Two of the world's four communication giants are Shenzhen, number one Huawei and fourth place ZTE.In the civilian drone sector, DJI pays more attention to research and innovation, accounting for more than 70% of the global drone market. DJI products not only enter common life, but also play a role in the military and agricultural fields.In turn, the Internet industry focuses on technological innovation, according to the latest data, so far, the number of Tencent patent applications in major countries around the world exceeds 30,000, and the number of authorized patents is steep on 10, 000. Tencent ranks second in the world after Google.In the automotive industry, as the leader in new energy vehicles, BYD has fully independent intellectual property rights and its products have been sold worldwide, such as Germany, United Kingdom, Chile, Argentina, India, etc.It is undoubtedly the most active city for private Chinese companies, but the public counterpart is as much or more powerful.In February 2019, the Chinese central government published the overall development plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay Area. The area consists of the two special administrative regions and nine other cities in Guangdong Province, of which Shenzhen is one of them. In the future, the Area will become the largestinnovation and services around the world.Load-Date: March 24, 2020End of Document

Suspected espionage and stolen plans: how the Chinese brand that threatens Tesla with cheaper cars emergedCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 16, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1738 wordsBodyHe Xiaopeng was driving three Tesla models when he decided to take on California's new auto giant. He had managed to sell his UCWeb software company to Alibaba for about $4.3 billion and set out on the adventure by joining Xpeng Motors. Now, nearly three years later and even in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, the Chinese emerges as a potential nemesis of Elon Musk: it offers electric and autonomous vehicles, designed for an aspirational middle class with a cutting-edge technological endowment. That is to say: the same but cheaper, and under the suspicion of having used spies to build replicas of the systems that cemented the success of the American company.Xpeng has two models on the market. The SUV G3, competition with the Tesla Model X, and the recently launched P7, which comes with potential to stand up to the Model 3, the world's best-selling electric car during 2019. Only in China were the activities reopened after the most complex stage by the Covid-19, the Asian manufacturer presented this large saloon at a very tight price, with advanced autonomous driving technology and a range of more than 700 kilometers.The Tesla Model 3 sold 300,000 units in 2019 and was a candidate for Auto of the Year.Streamed and with no audience present in the auditorium, Xiaopeng introduced to the world the benefits of its new product, prepared for a level 3 autonomous driving, as explained by the manufacturer itself, equating Tesla vehicles.The P7's artificial intelligence platform is very powerful. The SoC (meaning 'System on Chip, or integrated system on chip) of the vehicle is capable of performing 30 billion calculations in a second. A capacity needed to process the information obtained through its 12 ultrasonic sensors, 5 radars and 13 cameras spread throughout the car. It also has an indoor camera, located on the steering wheel, with facial recognition capability.The P7 will have a base price of 240,000 yuan, about $34,000 at the current change. The most expensive version costs 370,000 yuan, which at the current change is approximately $52,500. To put it back in context, the Tesla Model 3 starts at 299,050 yuan ($42,300) and reaches $419,800 in the Model 3 Performance ($60,000) version. In all cases the price includes subsidies from the Chinese government. Thus, Asians offer prices ranging from 12.5 to 20 percent lower than Americans.The interior of the P7, dominated by the screen on the board, the heart of the car commands. (Xpeng)The Xpeng P7 will be available with two motorizations: the rear-wheel drive version has an electric motor with 258 horsepower. The most powerful version features two engines, all-wheel drive and a power of 430 hp and 655 Nm of torque, allowing you to climb from 0 to 100 km/h in 4.3 seconds. It also has Brembo brakes and adaptive suspension, and in its design the aerodynamics were taken care of: the resistance coefficient is only 0.236.The lithium-ion battery has 80.9 kWh of useful capacity and in the rear-wheel drive version allows you to approve 706 kilometers of autonomy.The Xpeng G3, the SUV that competes with the Tesla Model X.Inside, drivers will find a minimalist style reminiscent of the Californian model, with a huge touch screen that makes the functions of instrument panel and infotainment system. The latter features voice recognition technology, a long list of applications and a Snapdragon 820 processor. Other highlights include a steering wheel with a camera to monitor the driver, ambient lighting, premium audio system and optional Nappa leather seats.The enemy in the mirrorThe Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling electric vehicle on the planet over the past year, thanks in part to the success of the Chinese market. To this end, Musk launched the Shanghai-based Gigafactory 3, which became a production benchmark that even plans to replicate in the United States and Europe. But with the emergence of the Xpeng P7 doubts arise about the success that the American brand could have in China.I've Xiaopeng (center) at the G3 presentation. (Reuters) (CHINA STRINGER NETWORK/)Xiaopeng resembles a scaled Asian version of Musk. At the P7's presentation he was seen wearing an expensive dark suit, shirt without a tie, and with a fluid loquacity. As does south African, who is 15 centimetres higher (1.88 vs. 1.73 meters), he is six years older (48 and 42) and a amassed fortune 30 times that of Chinese: $35.5 billion for the founder of Tesla and XSpace, and $1.2 billion for Chinese, as revealed by Forbes magazine.The Chinese entrepreneur is a Salieri de Musk: he sold his internet company for billions of dollars and then bet on an electric vehicle startup, frequently posting about it on social media. He owns Tesla Inc. shares, manages his cars and seeks to consolidate himself as a manufacturer in Asia. Everything the South African does.The way he managed to become a threat maintains a controversial halo. Xiaopeng is the target of Musk's anger, and his company, Xpeng Motors, is at the center of the trade deal demands filed by Tesla and Apple.Elon Musk, in 2019, when he presented the Cybertruck in California. (Robert Hanashiro/)The scandal with Apple was high. A Chinese professional, Xiaolang Zhang, was arrested on charges of stealing secret information and even some pieces of hardware while working for that company. Zhang had been hired in 2015 and was immediately assigned to Project Titan, Apple's initiative to build an autonomous driving system. The engineer designed and tested circuit boards used in the project's sensors.The complaint states that Zhang was absent for a month to attend to family matters in China, namely the birth of his son. Upon his return, he met with some supervisors for informals who would abandon the Apple project to go to Xpeng.One of the supervisors noted that Zhang was "evasive" during the last meeting, soApple's security team decided to conduct an investigation to make sure the employee's activity was in order. After researching Zhang's movements, it was discovered that shortly before leaving the company his activity in the data network had increased exponentially. From his job, he had access to a wealth of information about Project Titan, all of which were confidential. The suspicious move was confirmed when he attempted to catch a flight to China with a ticket purchased at the last minute, and it was at that moment that he was arrested.That's how Xpeng introduced the P7. (Infobae)A second Chinese citizen, Jizhong Chen, was also accused by the FBI of stealing data from Project Titan. Apple's team discovered that The Asian had on their computer "more than two thousand files containing sensitive and proprietary Apple material, including manuals, schematics, and diagrams." They also found "hundreds" of photographs of computer screens with sensitive company information, including some that were clearly from their own laptop, a way to get around the company's internal monitoring systems.The two former Apple employees were arrested in the midst of the escalation of the China-U.S. trade war, unleashed in March 2018. Both Zhang and Chen face charges that could determine ten years in prison and a $250,000 fine.The case that Tesla reports, for the time being, has not passed the stage of Musk's media rage, to which Xpeng responds that there is a cloak of racism about that accusation. The focus is on Guangzhi Cao, a former Tesla worker, who is targeted for the alleged theft of a source code from the Autopilot (the brand's autonomous driving system) and handed it over to the competition.Musk, in 2020 in Shanghai, when he began delivering the Model 3s in China. (Reuters) (ALY SONG/)The defendant was one of forty employees of the firm with access to that code. At the time Tesla claimed that as early as 2018 Cao began uploading full copies of the Autopilot source code to his iCloud account. And soon after he resigned from the Californian company to return to his country to work at Xpeng. It is believed that you immediately deleted 120,000 files from your work computer and disconnected your personal iCloud account; In addition, it was repeatedly introduced on Tesla's secure networks to remove your browser history.In this way, Xpeng could have had unlimited and illegal access to a technology cost hundreds of millions of dollars and several years to develop. The former employee confessed to having downloaded some of the Autopilot's source code, although he claimed to have removed it before leaving Tesla and never given it to the Chinese automaker.Xpeng reported not knowing of any crime committed by Cao, and again relied on respect for intellectual property rights. Beyond the Fact that the Asian company promised to undertake an internal investigation to clarify the situation, the fact that the interface of its autonomous driving system was identical to that of the Autopilot triggered all the alarms.The similarity to its own system, and Apple's antecedent, lead Tesla to raise its voice more in these times. "The greater the similarity between the two cases, the less likely it is that these similarities can be dismissed as mere coincidences, and the more likely they are to be the result of planning and coordination," they saidAmerican.The allegations are part of the trade war unleashed by Donald Trump and Xi Jinping.Xpeng responded by hinting that Tesla's statements are racist, while the US company demands that its rival publish its source code and documents relating to the hiring of Cao and former Apple's engineer. "Tesla's latest demands have crossed the line, rummaging through our IP and tarnishing our reputation along the way with misrepresentations and innuendos. Tesla's attempt to engage two Chinese engineers is to sell speculation and stereotypes."Born in Huangshi, Hubei Province, the son of an electrical engineer head of a state cement machinery factory, He Xiaopeng is now enjoying the lights set in his new product, a threat to Tesla. And he's looking for a self-made promise: if he gets Xpeng to become a viable manufacturer of electric vehicles, he'll give away an exploration boat that can break the ice and investigate the polar seas.I KEPT READINGThe incredible story of a Ferrari of Saddam Hussein's son who survived the dictator's furyBetween skill and suspicions of cheating: how Tesla did to assert more than Ford and General Motors togetherThe historic feat of the Jewish racing driver who beat the NazisLoad-Date: May 17, 2020End of Document

The controversial theory of a Chinese diplomat: says the U.S. Army brought the coronavirus to WuhanCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 13, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 562 wordsBodyInitially accused of taking time to react to the pandemic, Beijing now counterattacks by implying - without scientific evidence - that the coronavirus could be of foreign origin. This was hinted at by a prominent Chinese official after claiming that the U.S. Army could have brought the virus to China, thereby ruling it from originating in the city of Wuhan, as thought.Zhao Lijian, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, mentioned this hypothesis on Thursday night, resuming the conspiracy theories circulating online. The official posted to its more than 300,000 followers on Twitter a video of Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), addressing a congressional committee on March 11, where the possibility of having people who died with influenza in the U.S. were actually able to die of the new Covid-19 coronavirus. However, this could not be verified because they were only tested for influenza."CDC Director Robert Redfield admitted that some Americans who apparently died from influenza were able to test positive for the new coronavirus in posthumous diagnosis," said Zhao on Twitter, a social network that is curiously blocked China."The CDC was caught on the spot. When did patient zero start in the U.S.? How many people are infected? What hospitals? Maybe it was the U.S. Army that brought the epidemic to Wuhan. The U.S. owes us an explanation!" the Chinese Foreign Ministry official said.According to CNN, Redfield's video was also posted on Twitter by other Chinese state media outlets, including the national CCTV network and the Global Times.Following comments by Zhao, another Foreign Ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, acknowledged that there were "varied opinions" on the origin of the virus in the international community. "China always sees this as a scientific issue, which must be approached scientifically and professionally," he said, avoiding questions about whether Zhao's tweet represented the official position of the Chinese government.But in recent days several Chinese officials have slipped the possibility that the coronavirus did not originate in a Wuhan market, as stated by the director of the Chinese center for disease control and prevention, Gao Fu, at the beginning of the crisis , in December.On 27 February, one of the largest respiratory disease specialists in China, Zhong Nanshan, also questioned where the coronavirus came from. "The infection was first detected in China, but the virus may not have originated in China," Zhong said at a news conference.According to France Presse, this hypothesis has been taken up by Beijing, which even accused Washington and the foreign press of using the term "Chinese virus" to "imply an origin without any foundation or evidence." "Some media outlets want China to take full responsibility," Zhao Lijian said as early as March 4.In fact, on Thursday, Hua Chunying, head of Zhao who heads the Information Department of China's Foreign Ministry, tweeted a link to Redfield's testimony, saying it was "absolutely wrong and inappropriate to call this the Chinese coronavirus," according to CNN.In Washington, National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien accused China of "having lost the world for two months" bytry to end the now pandemic. The regime of President Xi Jinping called these words "extraordinarily immoral and irresponsible."Load-Date: March 14, 2020End of Document

FBI arrests researcher for NASA who allegedly failed to report ties to ChinaCNN WireMay 13, 2020 Wednesday 3:52 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 744 wordsDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  Federal agents have arrested an Arkansas professor who allegedly failed to disclose his ties to Chinese entities during the course of securing funding for a NASA research project, the Justice Department announced. Simon Saw-Teong Ang, 63, of Fayetteville, was arrested by FBI agents on Friday and charged with wire fraud, according to a criminal complaint and affidavit obtained by CNN.Authorities alleged Ang, an electrical engineering professor and researcher at the University of Arkansas-Fayetteville (UA) since 1988, defrauded NASA and the university "by failing to disclose that he held other positions at a Chinese university and Chinese companies" in violation of conflict of interest policies, according to an FBI special agent's affidavit in support of the complaint. "Ang made false statements and failed to report his outside employment to UA, which enabled Ang to keep his UA job as well as obtain [US government] research funding," according to the affidavit filed in US District Court for the Western District of Arkansas. As part of his research, authorities said Ang received several grants and contracts from federal agencies, including NASA. The affidavit states that, while working for the university, "Ang's close ties to the Chinese government and employment with numerous Chinese companies would have made him ineligible to receive grants issued by United States government agencies." CNN reached out Tuesday to an attorney representing Ang for comment. An initial court appearance was held Monday.University is 'actively cooperating' with the investigationJohn Thomas, a spokesperson for the university, said in a statement to CNN, "Simon Ang has been suspended without pay from his responsibilities with the university and the university is actively cooperating with the federal investigation in this matter."The FBI affidavit says authorities discovered Ang's alleged ties to Chinese interests after a university employee attempted to identify the owner of a hard drive that was placed in lost-and-found at a campus library. While reviewing the contents of the hard drive, which were later turned over to the FBI, the affidavit says, the employee discovered an email exchange between Ang and a visiting researcher from Xidian University in Xi'an, China. In the September 2018 email discussion, Ang wrote that things were becoming difficult for him because of the current political climate, according to the affidavit. "You can search the Chinese website regarding what the US will do to Thousand Talent Scholars," Ang wrote, according to the complaint, adding, "Not many people here know I am one of them but if this leaks out, my job here will be in deep troubles (sic)." According to the FBI, those associated with China's Thousand Talents program are individuals who work or study outside of China in high-priority research fields. While not traditional spies, investigators say they are nevertheless collecting research information sought by Chinese authorities. Fraud charge"While mere participation in a talent plan is not illegal," said John Brown, senior FBI national security executive, in congressional testimony last year, "investigations by the FBI and our partner agencies have revealed that participants are often incentivized to transfer to China the research they conduct in the United States, as well as other proprietary information to which they can gain access, and remain a significant threat to the United States."According to the criminal complaint, Ang did disclose his participation in one Thousand Talents Scholar program to the university in 2014, but failed to report his involvement in other programs between 2012 and 2018. While the FBI's reference to the Thousand Talents Scholar program pertains to an area typically worked by the agency's counterintelligence investigators, the federal charge spelled out in the criminal complaint against Ang relates to wire fraud rather than espionage. In particular, authorities allege Ang committed fraud in 2016 by facilitating the submission of a proposal to NASA for a contract worth more than half a million dollars, without disclosing potential conflicts of interest associated with his hidden involvement with Chinese entities. His proposal was ultimately selected by NASA. If convicted, federal officials say, Ang faces a statutory maximum punishment of 20 years in prison.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

What Trump's Twitter Feed Tells Him About the CoronavirusPolitico.comMarch 13, 2020 Friday 11:46 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1556 wordsHighlight: The president follows 47 accounts on Twitter. Here are the five main things they're saying about the pandemic.BodyIn the weeks since the coronavirus outbreak first reached the United States, @realDonaldTrump has launched a barrage of more than 50 tweets on the growing pandemic, initially offering a rosy assessment of the growing health crisis-assuring Americans that it will "all work out well," that the outbreak was spreading "very slowly in the U.S." and that it's "very much under control"-even as the death toll rose and the number of cases ballooned. In recent days, Trump has taken a more serious tone about the crisis, advocating for policy responses and travel bans, but even the news conference announcing his national emergency declaration ended with a jaunty exclamation point.That's Trump himself. But what about his Twitterverse?The president follows only 47 accounts on Twitter, a collection of family members, conservative pundits, administration officials and Trump-brand properties. Even as health experts and mainstream reporters have grown increasingly anxious about the White House's response to the coronavirus pandemic-and have taken to using their own Twitter accounts to share hand-washing videos and urgent warnings from doctors overseas-when Trump opens his own Twitter feed, he scrolls through something very different.The picture Trump sees, in a nutshell: That the coronavirus crisis is someone else's fault (China, Joe Biden, etc.), that he's doing a great job responding to it, and that a Trump-hating media is just fanning the flames. "The American people have seen once again that President @realDonaldTrump has no higher priority than the health and safety of the American people," tweeted Vice President Mike Pence."Remember Democrats Pushed Impeachment While Coronavirus Spread," Donald Trump Jr. tweeted on Friday morning, with a link to a Breitbart column. "@realDonaldTrump will use every tool available to protect the American worker as he safeguards the health of all," tweeted Ivanka Trump on Tuesday. As Trump faces the biggest public health crisis of his presidency, a reading of dozens of tweets from the president's favorite Twitter users over the past week shows his allies shaping Trump's feed into five main coronavirus narratives:Narrative #1: This is China's faultWhile Trump has come under increased pressure to respond more forcefully to the outbreak, his allies have taken to Twitter to frame the coronavirus as a foreign threat that spiraled out of control because of a bungled international response. "Remember, China initially REFUSED to allow the CDC into Wuhan," conservative activist and conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec said in a post retweeted into the president's feed by his son Donald Jr. "Inside China's high-stakes campaign to smear the United States over coronavirus," read the headline of a Fox News article in the president's feed. "POTUS was right to restrict travel from China in January, and now there is more evidence that @realDonaldTrump made the right call restricting travel from Europe, too," tweeted Ronna McDaniel, chair of the Republican National Committee. "President Trump must take China on here-they created this health crisis, now they're claiming America is to blame. Typical communist ploy. #Wuhancoronavirus," tweeted Fox News personality Laura Ingraham. Narrative #2: Joe Biden would be worseThe president's allies were also quick to dogpile on 2020 Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden, who was vice president during the 2009 H1N1/swine flu pandemic and 2014 Ebola epidemic. Even so, former President Barack Obama has remained relatively unscathed by attacks in the Trump Twitterverse, which remains focused on Biden. "When Biden was vice president, swine flu infected 61 million Americans and killed 12,000," Ryan Saavedra, a reporter with the conservative online outlet the Daily Wire, wrote in a post retweeted into Trump's feed. A few hours later, Trump himself took a swipe at Biden, blaming the former vice president for the deaths of thousands of people during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. "President @realDonaldTrump acted early and decisively... His every move has been aimed at keeping Americans safe, while Joe Biden has sought to capitalize politically and stoke citizens' fears," tweeted Kayleigh McEnany, the Trump campaign's national press secretary, quoting the campaign's communications director. "When @JoeBiden was faced with a public health crisis on H1N1, he pushed the panic button and the White House had to cover it," read a message retweeted by Donald Jr. Other tweets in the president's news feed framed recent comments from Biden opposing xenophobia as opposition to Trump's temporary ban on travel from China. "If Biden had been in charge, more Americans would have contracted the virus faster," a Trump campaign account tweeted.And in response to a Biden speech in which the former vice president criticized the president for labeling COVID-19 a "foreign virus," Laura Ingraham tweeted: "Yeah, Joe! Let's throw open our borders, our airports, our ports to anyone and everyone-that will really stem the infection rate!"Narrative #3: Trump is doing a great jobCritique of Trump's handling of the coronavirus crisis is largely absent from his Twitter feed. Instead, his allies have heaped praise on the administration's response. "Deeply impressive extraordinary partnership of America's best and brightest business & government gathered at White House under leadership of @realDonaldTrump & @VP," tweeted Fox News personality Geraldo Rivera after Friday's national emergency declaration. "They and we are going to kick #Corona's ass.""This is a very good call," conservative political commentator Eric Bolling tweeted on Friday in response to reports that Trump was planning to declare a national emergency. "This is the leadership @realDonaldTrump was elected to provide," tweeted Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, after the president's Oval Office address on Wednesday night. "Acting early & decisively he put the U.S. on much better footing than other nations in handling the coronavirus.""President Trump is exactly right: 'smart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow,'" tweeted Congressman Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican close to the White House. "The President's actions are proactive and decisive. This is exactly what we need to keep Americans safe and healthy." And a tweet from Eric Trump shared simply the headline of an adulatory New York Post column: "Trump passes coronavirus test with flying colors." Narrative #4: The media is fueling the panic...The president's eldest son, Donald Jr., has led the Trump Twitterverse's charge against the mainstream press's coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. In his posts and retweets, he's accused news outlets of stoking panic and helping China spread propaganda."That the US media is trying to run with the Chinese propaganda that 'China bought us time' is a new low even for them," Donald Jr. tweeted in response to a New York Times op-ed. "F-you!""The media has thrown everything at [Trump] and none of it has stuck," said YouTube personality Dave Rubin in a tweet shared by Donald Jr. "So now they have a vested interest in spreading panic, rejoicing over market drops and sewing general chaos.""This Chinese propaganda about the origin of the coronavirus is being directly amplified and aided by the U.S. media, which is censoring anyone who notes the Wuhan origin of the coronavirus," said Mike Cernovich, a right-wing activist and conspiracy theorist, in a post retweeted by Donald Jr. "CNN is literally taking its talking points from the Chinese government," read another Cernovich tweet shared by the president's son.Other accounts followed by the president sounded a similar tone."Erring on the side of maximum transparency is a good thing for the White House given the mass hysteria being stoked by the partisans in media and politics with [the] goal of affecting the election," tweeted Laura Ingraham. "I just want to stress to politicians and the media to stop using [coronavirus] as a tool to politicize things and to scare people," White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a tweet shared by McDaniel. "It's not responsible. This is not the time for this."Narrative #5: ...but there's no reason to panic!During a March 4 phone call with Sean Hannity, Trump falsely implied the coronavirus outbreak was not as bad as the seasonal flu-an idea he may have picked up from his Twitter followers, who have downplayed the virus' threat."They say the mortality rate for Coronavirus is higher than the flu," tweeted Fox News host Jeanine Pirro. "Consider though that we have a flu vaccine and yet in 2019, 16,000 Americans died from the flu. Imagine if we did not have that vaccine. The flu would be a pandemic." "The word 'pandemic' is scary, but as @drsanjaygupta points out, it doesn't speak to mortality rates, only to global scope of infection," Ingraham tweeted in late February. "As @CDCgov notes, actual mortality rates or coronavirus is very low."On Friday morning, Ingraham tweeted a link to an article headlined: "Coronavirus: Facts vs. Panic," which stated "most people who get coronavirus have mild or no symptoms" and "most around the world diagnosed from January-March 1 have already recovered." "Great time to fly if not in at-risk population!" Ingraham wrote Friday from the aisle seat of a Chicago-bound United flight.Load-Date: March 16, 2020End of Document

Here's How The Media Is Pushing Chinese Propaganda And Talking PointsThe Daily CallerMarch 23, 2020 Monday 10:48 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: MEDIALength: 636 wordsByline: Shelby Talcott, Media Reporter, shelby@dailycaller.comRetired college and professional athlete, big fan of dogs and mimosas without the OJ, sarcastic New Yorker at heart.Author ImageBodyLink to ImageMedia pundits and publications have not only pushed Chinese propaganda amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, but praised the country as well for how it has handled the virus.All of this comes despite numerous recorded events showing how China made early attempts to downplay the threat of the virus. If authorities in China acted three weeks earlier, coronavirus cases may have been reduced by 95% and its worldwide spread may have been limited, according to one March study.Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian has often used American media outlet's reporting on the novel coronavirus to push Chinese propaganda, a Fox News article noted. Zhao has peddled Chinese propaganda about the virus on Twitter. He            suggested in a March 12 tweet that the “US military brought the epidemic to Wuhan.”Zhao furthered Chinese propaganda by claiming on March 22 that the “US CDC admitted some #COVID19 patients were misdiagnosed as flu during the 2019 flu season. 34 million infected & 20,000 died. If #COVID19 began last September, & US has been lack of test ability, how many people would have been infected? US should find out when patient zero appeared.”The spokesman has also consistently tweeted or re-tweeted various articles from American news websites about the virus, Fox News reported. Zhao has re-upped articles from The Washington Post, The New York Times and CBS News.In one example, Zhao re-tweeted an article published March 20 by USA Today about President Donald Trump's use of the phrase “Chinese Virus.” This article cites race and global health experts who allege that this term contributes to xenophobia.China has repeatedly pressured the president against using the term, despite official state media first calling it the “Wuhan Virus.”            Numerous outlets have repeated this talking point, bashing            Trump for calling the virus by where it originated. Some of these media sources even used the phrases themselves before adopting China's propaganda. China has reacted to the outbreak of coronavirus in Italy by sending aid. The US has reacted by suspending flights. Who is the superpower? https://t.co/TsM3Eu7KR7 - Anne Applebaum (@anneapplebaum)            March 12, 2020“China Bought the West Time. The West Squandered It,” one NYT op-ed article is headlined.Meanwhile, NYT reporter Donald McNeil spoke to MSNBC's Rachel Maddow and praised China on March 12. He said that China has had “enormous success in beating down its epidemic.”Maddow later shared a clip of the segment and headlined it “How coronavirus testing works in a country that take the problem seriously.” How coronavirus testing works in a country that takes the problem seriously. pic.twitter.com/NaYZcDND9o - Maddow Blog (@MaddowBlog)            March 13, 2020MSNBC's Chuck Todd also pushed Chinese propaganda by suggesting that “China's authoritarian ways did prevent this.” (RELATED: Top WHO Official Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Won Election With China's Help. Now He's Running Interference For China On Coronavirus)“How uncomfortable is it that perhaps China's authoritarian ways did prevent this?” according to Todd. “Meaning, had China been a free and open society, this might have spread faster?”China appears to continue its attempt to spread misinformation into the American media as the novel coronavirus threat grows. A Sunday report, for example, indicated that the country has not been truthful with its coronavirus numbers.Over 43,000 people who tested positive for the novel coronavirus by the end of February were omitted from China's confirmed case numbers, Chinese government data indicates. The data was obtained by the South China Morning Post.This is just the latest in a series of reports highlighting China's apparent attempts to cover-up and misinform the public about the virus.Graphic People wearing facemasks as a preventive measure against the COVID-19 novel coronavirus walk at the Olympic park in Beijing on March 23, 2020.

South Korea will remain in the second position in terms of government funding. Europe, on the other hand, is projected to be the second dominant region. It generated USD 244.8 million intelligent transportation system market revenue in 2018. This growth is attributable to the rising implementation of ITS in the U.K. for public transportation.

Arkansas professor accused of not disclosing ties to ChinaAssociated Press Financial WireMay 12, 2020 Tuesday 2:11 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 253 wordsDateline: LITTLE ROCK, Ark. BodyLITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) - The University of Arkansas has suspended an electrical engineering professor without pay after he was arrested on an allegation that he failed to disclose that he had close ties with the Chinese government and Chinese businesses.Simon S. Ang, 63, of Fayetteville, Arkansas was arrested Friday on a wire fraud count after failing to make the disclosure on an application for a NASA grant, according to a statement Monday from the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office in Little Rock, Arkansas.A federal complaint says such materially false representations to NASA and to the university led to numerous wire messages that facilitated a scheme to defraud. A university spokeswoman said the school suspended Ang and is cooperating with federal investigators.Ang remained in the Washington County Detention Center in Fayetteville without bond. Jail records do not list an attorney for the professor. If convicted, Ang could be sentenced to 20 years in prison.The FBI has been reaching out to colleges and universities across the country as it tries to stem what American authorities portray as the wholesale theft of technology and trade secrets by researchers tapped by China. The breadth and intensity of the campaign emerges in emails The Associated Press obtained through records requests to public universities in 50 states. The emails underscore the extent of U.S. concerns that universities, as recruiters of foreign talent and incubators of cutting-edge research, are particularly vulnerable targets.Load-Date: May 12, 2020End of Document

All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 407 wordsByline: Christian Datoc, Senior White House Correspondent, christian@dailycaller.comBodyLink to ImagePresident Donald Trump stopped short Wednesday of outright accusing the Chinese government of lying about its own coronavirus statistics and denied seeing an alleged report put together by a United States intelligence agency accusing China of underreporting data.The news broke of the alleged intelligence report earlier in the day Wednesday. The report itself was said to have been delivered to the White House last week.Link to ImageU.S. President Donald Trump speaks at the press briefing room.

WHILE DEMOCRATS SPIN FICTION, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS LEADING THE NATION TO ADDRESS THE CORONAVIRUSStates News ServiceMarch 18, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 6211 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Republican National Committee:Democrats and the media are so desperate to undermine the Trump Administration's response to the coronavirus that they will ignore the facts to spin fiction to the American publicDEMOCRATS AND SOME IN THE MEDIA ARE SO DESPERATE TO ATTACK PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT THEY HAVE PUSHED DEBUNKED QUOTES AND DOCTORED VIDEO CLIPS CONCERNING THE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSEFiction:Democrats are claiming President Trump referred to the Coronavirus as a "hoax", including leading Democrat Presidential Candidate Joe Biden who released a doctored video misrepresenting the President's statements on the virus.The Facts:Biden's video chops out nearly a minute between two soundbites.According to a Washington Post fact check "the full quote shows Trump is criticizing Democratic talking points and the media's coverage of his administration's response to Coronavirus . He never says that the virus itself is a hoax ."President Trump was correct to be critical of Democrat smears as multiple fact checks criticized their misleading claims about the administration's response to coronavirus.Fiction :Some media members were quick to accuse President Trump of xenophobia and bigotry because he and his administration referred to the coronavirus as "foreign" "Chinese" or "the Wuhan Coronavirus."The Facts:Scores of media members have used those terms to refer to the origin of the virus.CNN's national security correspondent, Kylie Atwood, reported that the rhetoric was part of a conscious effort to push back on Chinese propaganda that falsely blamed the U.S. military for spreading the virus.THE PRESIDENT'S CRITICS HAVE ACCUSED PRESIDENT TRUMP OF LYING ABOUT PRIVATE SECTOR COORDINATIONFiction:When President Trump announced a partnership with Google to streamline testing for the coronavirus, news outlets dismissed his comments as false .The Facts:Google's CEO called President Trump to apologize for "confusion created by the media" and the company put out a press release substantiating the announcement regarding a national website.DEMOCRAT CRITICS HAVE PUSHED FALSEHOODS IN ORDER TO PAINT THE ADMINISTRATIONS RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS THREAT IN A NEGATIVE LIGHTFiction:Democrats and their media allies' central talking point has been to falsely accuse President Trump of having a "slow" response to the coronavirus.The Facts:The Trump Administration was ahead of the curve implementing a Coronavirus Incident Management System two days before Chinese officials confirmed the outbreak .Fiction:In another falsehood designed to paint President Trump as dismissive of the coronavirus threat, Joe Biden said that Trump turned down testing kits from the World Health Organization.The Facts:The World Health Organization " never offered to sell test kits to the United States " and all other developed countries with advanced research capabilities developed their own tests.Fiction:The New York Times reported that President Trump discouraged governors by telling them to try to get 'respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment' yourselves."The Facts:President Trump authorized governors to buy medical equipment directly in addition to those they would be getting from the federal government if they felt it would be faster.President Trump has worked to support state and local officials and even governors of deep blue states like New York and California have praised his efforts.IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE DEMOCRATS HAVE ALSO MISREPRESENTED THE ADMINISTRATIONS' PREPAREDNESS FOR THE CRISISFiction:Democrats claim that President Trump cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control.The Facts:According to PolitiFact , "it's not accurate to say that Trump 'cut' funding for the Centers for Disease Control."Fiction:Democrats are accusing President Trump of firing the NSC team in charge of pandemic response.The Facts:In May 2018, Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer, Senior Director of Global Health And Security, the NSC team responsible for pandemic response, was not fired but left the administration and the team he headed was reorganized.Tim Morrison , Former Senior Director for Counterproliferation and Biodefense on the NSC, wrote an Op-Ed refuting "specious" allegations that President Trump dissolved the office at the White House in charge of pandemic preparedness during his tenure.Fiction:Some have claimed President Trump shut down the Global Health Security Agenda.The Facts:The Funding has nothing to do with the Trump Administration . The Global Health Security Agenda was largely funded by a $600 million a supplemental package passed in 2015 after the Ebola crisis and the money was running out.In fact, these programs were never even defunded and, by March 2018,Congress had nearly doubled its funding for the Global Health Security Agenda.DESPERATE TO POLITICIZE THE CORONAVIRUS, DEMOCRATS AND THEIR MEDIA ALLIES HAVE PUSHED FALSE QUOTES AND DOCTORED VIDEO CLIPS TO ATTACK PRESIDENT TRUMPIn Early March, Joe Biden Posted A Doctored Video That Was Edited To Show President Trump Said The Coronavirus Was A "Hoax;" This Video Was Immediately Shot Down By Fact Checkers As False Despite Mainstream Media Running ItAt A Rally In South Carolina On March 2, President Trump Accused Democrats Of Politicizing The Coronavirus Outbreak Arguing The False Narrative That His Administration Had Fumbled Response Efforts Was Another In A Long Of Hoaxes Pushed By Democrats To Smear The Trump Administration. "The kerfuffle began at the rally in North Charleston, South Carolina when Trump accused the Democrats of 'politicizing' the coronavirus outbreak. 'Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that, right?' he said. 'Coronavirus, they're politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, 'How's President Trump doing?' They go, 'Oh, not good, not good.' They have no clue. They don't have any clue. They can't even count their votes in Iowa.' Then the president, who often dismissed special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation as a hoax, continued, 'They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They'd been doing it since you got in. It's all turning. They lost. It's all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.' Trump went on to praise his administration for taking 'the most aggressive action in modern history to prevent the spread of this illness in the United States,' referring to travel restrictions on foreign nationals who recently visited China." ( FactCheck.org , 3/3/20)A Day Later, Joe Biden Tweeted A Video That Makes It Seem Like President Trump Was Calling The Disease Itself A Hoax By Editing Out Nearly A Minute Between The Two Clips, Eliminating The Context That Makes It Clear President Trump Was Not Talking About The Virus Itself. "In a video tweeted March 3, Joe Biden's campaign made it look like President Donald Trump called the 2019 coronavirus outbreak a 'hoax' The video cycles through a slew of soundbites from Trump. One clip shows the president's Feb. 28 rally in North Charleston, S.C. 'Coronavirus - this is their new hoax,' Trump is pictured saying. The video makes it seem like Trump is calling the disease itself a hoax, which he hasn't done. The words are Trump's, but the editing is Biden's. During the North Charleston rally, there was nearly a minute between when Trump said 'coronavirus' and 'hoax.'" ( PolitiFact , 3/15/20)PolitiFact Rated Biden's Video "False." "Biden's video is inaccurate. We rate it False." ( PolitiFact , 3/15/20)The Washington Post : "The Full Quote Shows Trump Is Criticizing Democratic Talking Points And The Media's Coverage Of His Administration's Response To Coronavirus. He Never Says That The Virus Itself Is A Hoax." "The full quote shows Trump is criticizing Democratic talking points and the media's coverage of his administration's response to coronavirus. He never says that the virus itself is a hoax, and although the Biden camp included the word 'their,' the edit does not make clear to whom or what Trump is referring." ( The Washington Post , 3/13/20)Three Days After The Washington Post Debunked The Claim, MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell Said On His Show That "Just Over Two Weeks Ago, Donald Trump Called The Coronavirus A Hoax." LAWRENCE O'DONNELL: "Just over two weeks ago, Donald Trump called the Coronavirus a hoax. That was his word, 'hoax.' The President of the United States accused the news media of overreacting to the Coronavirus. Today, standing on the White House Press Briefing Room Stage with the President of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci said this." (MSNBC's "The Last Word With Lawrence O'Donnell," 3/16/20)Just A Day After The Washington Post Fact Check, CNN White House Correspondent Boris Sanchez Said "Trump Called The Response About The Gravity Of The Virus A Hoax." BORIS SANCHEZ: "President Trump has been giving regular updates to the public about coronavirus, but -- and this is a major but -- the information that he gives isn't always accurate. He often downplays the threat and he contradicts statements he or his own advisers have previously made. Case in point. Two weeks ago, Trump called the response about the gravity of the virus a hoax. It's not." (CNN's "Newsroom," 3/14/20)Trump Was Right In His Assessment Of The Democrats' Narrative And Multiple Fact-Checkers Have Criticized Democrats' Misleading Claims About The Trump Administration's Response To CoronavirusThe Associated Press Headline: "Democrats Distort Coronavirus Readiness." "AP FACT CHECK: Democrats Distort Coronavirus Readiness." ( The Associated Press , 2/26/20)FactCheck.Org Headline: "Democrats' Misleading Coronavirus Claims." "Democrats' Misleading Coronavirus Claims." ( FactCheck.org , 3/3/20)THE MEDIA WERE SO QUICK TO JUMP AT THE CHANCE TO CALL PRESIDENT TRUMP RACIST FOR REFERRING TO THE VIRUS AS "FOREIGN," "CHINESE," OR THE "WUHAN VIRUS" THAT THEY FORGOT THEY HAD BEEN USING THE TERM AS WELLMedia Members Were Quick To Accuse President Trump Of Xenophobia And Bigotry Because He And His Administration Referred To The Coronavirus As "Foreign" "Chinese" Or "The Wuhan Coronavirus"Salon Cited President Trump's Rhetoric Around The Virus, Calling It "Foreign" Or "Chinese" As Proof Of His Xenophobia And Bigotry. "Donald Trump and his agents are using xenophobia, nativism, bigotry, and racism to distract the American people from his administration's failure to respond to the coronavirus crisis. For example, the Trump regime has called the novel coronavirus 'the Chinese virus' and the 'foreign flu.'" ( Salon , 3/18/20)Following His March 11th Press Conference On The Coronavirus, CNN Chief White House Correspondent Jim Acosta And Primetime Host Chris Cuomo Slammed President Trump Saying That Referring To The Virus As A "Foreign Virus," Or "Wuhan Coronavirus" Was Xenophobic And An Excuse To "Put Blame Somewhere Else." CNN'S JIM ACOSTA: "The other thing, Chris, and I think we should point out, at one point, during this address, the President referred to the Coronavirus as a 'Foreign virus.' That - that, I think, was interesting because as I was talking to sources, earlier this evening, one of the points that the President wanted to make tonight, wanted to get across to Americans, is that this virus did not start here, but that they're dealing with it. Now, why the President would go as far as to describe it as a 'Foreign virus,' that is something we'll also be asking questions about. "But it - it should be pointed out that Stephen Miller who is an immigration hardliner, who advises the President, is of one of his top domestic policy advisers, and speechwriters had-" CNN'S CHRIS CUOMO: "Right." ACOSTA: "--was a driving force in writing this speech." CUOMO: "Right." ACOSTA: "And I think it's going to smack - it's going to come across to a lot of Americans as smacking of xenophobia-" CUOMO: "Right." ACOSTA: "--to use that kind of term in this speech, Chris." CUOMO: "Well, look, sometimes we can answer the questions. And the answer is he's doing it to put blame somewhere else. We've seen over the last few days, McCarthy, and others, saying the 'Chinese Coronavirus,' the 'Wuhan Coronavirus.' We get that." (CNN's "Cuomo Primetime," 3/11/20)Scores Of Media Members Used Those Terms And CNN's National Security Correspondent Reported That The Rhetoric Was Part Of An Effort To Push Back On Chinese Propaganda That Blamed The U.S. Military For Spreading The VirusIn Late January, Acosta Referred To The Virus As "Wuhan Coronavirus" In A Tweet. "CNN International: Authorities in Beijing have cancelled all large-scale Chinese New Year celebrations in an effort to contain the growing spread of Wuhan Coronavirus." ( Twitter Feed , 1/23/20)"Several" CNN Anchors And "Numerous Journalists From MSNBC, CNBC, PBS News, And CBS News" Referred To The Virus As "Wuhan Coronavirus" And "China's Coronavirus." "However, weeks leading up to the coronavirus outbreak, as the Media Research Center demonstrated in a video on Thursday, several CNN anchors and reporters referred to it as the 'Wuhan coronavirus' and 'China's coronavirus' Numerous journalists from MSNBC, CNBC, PBS News, and CBS News were also heard using similar terminology."

KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: "Yes, and a new development in these tensions just today. The Chinese Ambassador to the U.S. was summoned here to the State Department by a top state official for the region, Assistant Secretary Stilwell. I have been told by folks in this building that they're furious with the Chinese government that's because just as you said John, they are now claiming that potentially the U.S. military could be to blame for the Wuhan virus which originated as we know in Wuhan China. We have seen the U.S. pushed back on that disinformation. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo even called it the Wuhan virus just last week to make sure that folks knew where the epicenter of this virus really is. We also heard President Trump earlier this week call it a foreign virus. They want to make the case that this originated in China and that's the reason that they summon the Chinese Ambassador here to the State Department today." (CNN's "Inside Politics," 3/13/20)THE PRESIDENT'S CRITICS HAVE ACCUSED PRESIDENT TRUMP OF LYING ABOUT PRIVATE SECTOR COORDINATIONWhen News Outlets Reported It Was Not True That Google Was Developing A Website To Streamline Coronavirus Testing, The Company's CEO Was Forced To Confirm That President Trump's Announcement Was True And They Would Be Developing A WebsiteOn March 13, President Trump Said That Google Was Rolling Out A Coronavirus Website "To Determine Whether A Test Is Warranted And To Facilitate Testing At A Nearby Convenient Location." PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: "I want to thank Google. Google is helping to develop a website. It's going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location. We have many, many locations behind us, by the way. We cover the - this country in large part. So the world, by the way - we're not going to be talking about the world right now. But we cover very, very strongly our country. Stores in virtually every location." ( White House , 3/13/20)That Same Day, CNN Reported That 'Google Will Not Be Publishing A National-Scale Website For Coronavirus Testing Anytime Soon, Contrary To Claims Made By President Donald Trump." "Google will not be publishing a national-scale website for coronavirus testing anytime soon, contrary to claims made by President Donald Trump during a Friday news conference. Instead, a health-focused subsidiary owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet, intends to launch a small-scale website next week to begin to triage California-based patients. The website will aim to serve a broader population only 'over time' -- not 'very quickly,' as Trump said." ( CNN , 3/13/20)Google CEO Sundar Pichai Called President Trump To Apologize For "Confusion Created By The Media" And The Company Put Out A Press Release Substantiating What President Trump Had Said Regarding National Website. "Trump said CEO Sundar Pichai called him to apologize after confusion created by the media while holding a piece of paper showing Google's statement on Twitter. 'I want to thank the people at Google and Google communications because as you know, they substantiated what I said on Friday,' Trump said Sunday. 'The head of Google, who's a great gentleman, called us and he apologized. I don't know where the press got their fake news, but they got it someplace. But as you know, this is from Google. They put out a release and you guys can figure it out yourselves. And how that got out, and I'm sure you'll apologize. But it would be great if we could really give the news correctly. It would be so, so wonderful.'"

"Google now says it is working with the government on the creation of a national website containing information about coronavirus symptoms and testing information. 'Google is partnering with the US Government in developing a national website that includes information about COVID-19 symptoms, risk and testing information,' the company said in a series of tweets Saturday evening."

"Even after it became clear that the coronavirus outbreak was becoming a global threat in January, the Trump administration has been slow to prepare and react. The common refrain among experts is that other countries' actions, such as China's draconian measures, gave the US a bit of time to do something, but the federal government has failed to get even the basics right in that time." ( Vox , 3/14/20)Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Said The Trump Administrations Response To Coronavirus Was "Slow And Halting." "While President Trump is playing fast and loose with the facts, and blaming everyone not named Donald Trump-Congress is taking responsibility and acting like the adult in the room. The Trump admin's response to coronavirus has been slow and halting. Congress is taking action." ( Twitter Feed , 3/4/20)Axios; President Trump Was "In Denial About The Virus For Weeks." "Behind the scenes: The president and some of his team were in denial about the virus for weeks, portraying it as just an overhyped winter flu.

"Last week, Zhong Nanshan, one of China's most highly regarded epidemiology experts and the leader of the National Health Commission's task force on the epidemic, said officials had identified a coronavirus by Dec. 31 and took too long to publicly confirm human-to-human transmission."

"Mr. President, you had a teleconference with the nation's governors today." PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: "Yeah." QUESTION: "and in that teleconference, you told them if they need things like respirators or masks, to try to get it on their own. What did you mean by that?

Because the governors - you know, during normal times, the governors buy a lot of things not necessarily through federal government. If they're able to get ventilators, respirators, if they're able to get certain things without having to go through the longer process of federal government - we have stockpiles now and we're ordering tremendous numbers of ventilators, respirators, masks.

Chinese social network WeChat closes account that defamed USCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 26, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 474 wordsBodyBeijing, 26 May (EFE).- The social network WeChat - the Chinese equivalent of WhatsApp - ordered the closure of an account that vilified the United States in the midst of a government campaign to remove "illegal and false information" from the Internet, the local press reported today.According to the South China Morning Post, the decision comes at a time when the Asian country is trying to curb disinformation in the networks but would aim to mitigate the current disputes between Washington and Beijing.One of the last posts on the account, called Zhidao Xuegong ("Academic Forum for Supreme Truth"), stated that "coronavirus has killed a million people in the U.S.", and that "the bodies of the deceased were "very likely to be processed into frozen meat, beef or fake pigs, or they could process it as meat for burgers and hot dogs.""Cannibalism has existed before in the U.S., and just a few decades ago Americans ate black, Indian, and Chinese," writes the author of the text, nicknamed "Mr. Cloud."The article received more than 100,000 views, according to the source.Other entries from the same account, which had millions of followers, claim that "learning English makes you stupid."The account would have been created by Chinese ultranationalist groups in collusion with entrepreneurs seeking to take economic advantage of bad relations between China and the United States, according to several experts cited by the newspaper.In addition, the closure comes shortly after China's Cyberspace Administration - the country's top cyber authority - launched an eight-month campaign last Friday to remove "illegal and false information" from the Internet, he adds."From the point of view of the Chinese government or Internet regulators, it is important to suppress some extreme expressions and positions. They can have a lot of impact," says one of the experts cited."The bill has been closed because it went too far and could be counterproductive," Professor Zhan Jiang of Beijing University of Foreign Studies tells the newspaper.Chinese company Tencent, creator of WeChat, closed the bill and others related to "inventing facts, stoking xenophobia and deceiving people," the newspaper adds.In addition, the company closed another 2,500 accounts for "misleading content" and about 20,000 for posting "fake news" since the coronavirus outbreak began.New legislation to regulate Chinese cyberspace came into force on 1 March that turns the spread of rumors into a crime, although sometimes the regime considers "rumors" to deviate from "official truth" or not positive enough.One of the articles in that legislation calls for a avoid "inappropriate comment" on natural disasters, serious accidents and other disasters, and recalls that "it is illegal to publish information that spreads rumors and disturbs the economic and social order."Load-Date: May 27, 2020End of Document

INDONESIA PROBES DEATH OF SIXTH MAN LINKED WITH CHINESE FISHING BOATSStates News ServiceMay 26, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 742 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A 26-year-old Indonesian died aboard a Pakistani boat last week, two months after being removed from a Chinese ship after suffering health problems indicative of forced labor, officials and activists said, bringing to six the number of deaths linked to Chinese fishing boats since December.On Tuesday, Indonesia's foreign office said it was coordinating with police and other agencies to investigate the May 22 death of Eko Haryanto at sea near Pakistan. He and a fellow Indonesian reportedly were transferred to the Pakistani boat in March by the captain of the Xianggang Xinhai, the Chinese boat, after Eko complained about his ailing hands, according to Destructive Fishing Watch (DFW), an Indonesian activist group."The minister has coordinated with relevant institutions and National Police's General Crimes Unit to investigate the case," Teuku Faizasyah, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Eko's body was taken to a hospital in Karachi after he died at sea, and the ministry was planning to return his body and repatriate the other Indonesian, Hamdan, as soon as coronavirus-related travel restrictions were lifted, Teuku said."Hamdan is now at the Indonesian Consulate General shelter in Karachi, while Eko's body is still in the hospital," Teuku said.Death reported to complaint centerHamdan reported Eko's death through the Fisher Center Tegal, a complaint center coordinated by DFW in Central Java province. In his report, Hamdan provided a video that showed Eko unable to move his right hand."The video showed that he was having symptoms of paralysis such as stroke, where he could not move his right hand, plus depression and severe stress. Based on the initial screening, there was forced labor," Mohammad Abdi Suhufan, the coordinator of DFW, told BenarNews, referring to a viewing of the video.Eko and Hamdan worked more than 12 hours a day on the Chinese boat and Eko was ordered to keep on working although he had complained about a pain in his hands, Abdi said.The pair had worked aboard the Xianggang Xinhai since November 2019, according to DFW. Both men were promised a monthly salary of U.S. $300 (4.4 million rupiah) but had not been paid, Hamdan alleged in his complaint to DFW.The two had been recruited for the Chinese boat by PT Mandiri Tunggal Bahari, the same Indonesian manpower recruitment firm allegedly involved in the case of Herdiyanto, an Indonesian crewman who died on a Chinese fishing boat, Luqing Yuan Yu 623, and whose body was tossed into Somali waters on Jan. 23 a week after his death, Abdi said."The government should make sure PT Mandiri Tunggal Bahari takes full responsibility for Eko's death," Abdi said.During the past two weeks, Indonesian police have named five people from four local agencies who were allegedly recruiting workers for two Chinese fishing boats, the Luqing Yuan Yu 623 and Long Xin 629, as suspects in human trafficking. Police have arrested all five but they have not filed charges under the country's anti-human trafficking laws.Authorities opened the case into Herdiyanto's death after a video, which showed his body being thrown overboard off Luqing Yuan Yu 623, had circulated on social media, while a second video showed him being assisted by three other people because he could not walk.Central Java police were conducting the probe into PT Mandiri Tunggal Bahari, said Ferdy Sambo, director of the general crimes unit at the national police, without going into detail.Police launched the probe into the Hediyanto case after the Indonesian government earlier this month complained to the Chinese government about the deaths of four other Indonesians who had allegedly worked in harsh conditions as crew member on Chinese fishing boats. Bodies of three of those four were allegedly thrown overboard, a crew member said in an interview with South Korean media.On May 10, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi condemned the alleged mistreatment of the four Indonesian sailors, and said she had been told they were forced to work at least 18 hours a day. Indonesia and China were launching a joint investigation into the allegations of abuse, Retno said at the time.On Tuesday, officials at the Chinese embassy in Jakarta could not be immediately reached to answer questions about Eko's death.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: May 27, 2020End of Document

Sens. Cruz, Scott, Colleagues Introduce Bill to Protect COVID-19 Vaccine Research From Communist ChinaTargeted News ServiceMay 22, 2020 Friday 8:01 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1017 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, issued the following news release:U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.), along with Sens. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) introduced the COVID-19 Vaccine Protection Act to prevent the Communist Chinese Party from stealing or sabotaging American COVID-19 vaccine research. The bill requires a thorough national security evaluation and clearance by the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation of all Chinese student visa holders taking part in activities related to COVID-19 vaccine research.This legislation comes as U.S. officials warn American firms to safeguard their research against China and others known for stealing U.S. technology. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Britain's National Cyber Security Center recently issued a statement saying hackers are "actively targeting organizations ... that include healthcare bodies, pharmaceutical companies, academia, medical research organizations, and local government." The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also issued a recent public service announcement warning organizations researching COVID-19 of likely insider threat targeting and network compromise by China."The same Chinese Communist Party that covered up the coronavirus outbreak also routinely engages in state sponsored theft of intellectual property," Sen. Cruz said. "We cannot allow China to steal or interfere with American research and development of a vaccine. I'm proud to join my colleagues on this important measure to protect American medical innovation and will continue working to counter China's aggression.""Communist China is responsible for the Coronavirus pandemic, and their lies and misinformation cost American lives," Sen. Scott said. "We cannot let Communist China off the hook for this, and we absolutely cannot allow Communist China to steal or sabotage any American research efforts related to the Coronavirus vaccine. The COVID-19 Vaccine Protection Act protects American efforts to create a vaccine as we work to end this pandemic.""I know firsthand China doesn't play fair from building a business for 38 years, and their failure to operate on-the-level regarding COVID-19 has caused untold global devastation," Sen. Braun said. "Requiring a thorough national security evaluation and clearance for those taking part in COVID-19 vaccine research who hold visas from China is a small measure we can take to help ensure the safety of our research efforts.""The Chinese Communist Party is notorious for stealing American technology to make up for China's pitiful inability to self-innovate," Sen. Blackburn said. "We will not stand idly by and watch them steal American vaccine research through spies posing as students, which is why I have led efforts to eliminate Confucius Institutes on college campuses. As we race to find a cure for a virus that has killed nearly 100,000 Americans, we need confidence that the CCP does not harm U.S. efforts to create a vaccine.""Communist China has a long history of intellectual property theft. As our universities and colleges help find a COVID-19 vaccine, it's imperative we don't let China continue to steal our information," Sen. Ernst said. "We can do that by ensuring our top law enforcement agencies are helping our higher education institutions protect their research.""Communist China has hacked into American systems to steal research and technology for decades," Sen. McSally said. "Now, Americans are waking up to China's adversarial actions on many fronts with the coronavirus. Our bill aims to protect the United States' COVID-19 vaccine research from China's ongoing attempts to steal our science and harm Americans.""The Chinese Communist Party wants to steal or sabotage the vaccine for the pandemic it caused," Sen. Cotton said. "The federal government ought to investigate Chinese nationals taking part in vaccine research to prevent this spying, which follows the same playbook Beijing uses to steal our research in other fields of study."The COVID-19 Vaccine Protection Act:* Requires a thorough national security evaluation and clearance by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of State, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of all Chinese student visa holders taking part in activities related to COVID-19 vaccine research, who are currently in the United States before issuing any new student visas to nationals of the People's Republic of China (PRC).* Requires DHS, in consultation with State Department, DOJ, FBI, CISA, USCIS, ODNI and HHS, to complete an enhanced vetting of nationals of the PRC currently in the U.S. as nonimmigrants under F, J, or M student visas to determine if any student visa holders are a national security threat.* Once the review is complete, authorizes DHS secretary, in consultation with all the above agencies, to continuously monitor all nonimmigrant student visa holders (F, M, J) who are nationals of the PRC while in the U.S. and are engaged in, or have access to, the research of any potential COVID-19 vaccine or COVID-19 related material.* Requires a briefing to Congress on the results of the review.Since the first reports of the coronavirus outbreak in January, when Sen. Cruz called for a travel ban to and from China, Sen. Cruz has called for a fundamental reassessment of the U.S.-China relationship, introducing legislation to hold China accountable for the type of medical censorship that allowed the coronavirus to go global, to combat China's propaganda campaign in the U.S., to counter Chinese espionage, and to end U.S. dependence on China for life-saving medical supplies and rare earth elements and critical minerals used to manufacture our defense technologies.

China Hits Back at U.S. After FBI Accuses Beijing of Hacking Virus ResearchNewsweek.comMay 13, 2020 Wednesday 5:33 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 503 wordsByline: Daniel VillarrealHighlight: "Making up such rumors is convenient for the US government so that US politicians can dodge their own culpability and failures," China's state-run newspaper wrote.BodyThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Tuesday said that the Chinese government has been trying to steal coronavirus research data from the U.S. In response, Chinese state-run newspaper Global Times said the U.S. government has "totally lost their minds."People's Republic of China-affiliated "cyber actors and non-traditional collectors... have been observed attempting to identify and illicitly obtain valuable intellectual property (IP) and public health data related to vaccines, treatments, and testing from networks and personnel affiliated with COVID-19-related research," the FBI and CISA said in a joint statement.The federal agencies said they would reveal additional technical details regarding the alleged threat in the coming days. For now, they've advised health care, pharmaceutical, and research sectors working on coronavirus to "maintain dedicated cybersecurity and insider threat practices" in order to keep out potential hackers and cyber-thieves.The FBI and CISA advised COVID-19 research organizations that press attention about their work will lead to increased interest and cyber activity. These groups should patch all internet-connected servers, software processing internet data and other systems for critical vulnerabilities, the agencies said.They also suggested that U.S. organizations should actively scan web applications for unauthorized access, modifications, or anomalous activities, as well as improve users' credential requirements and require multi-factor authentication.Newsweek reached out to the FBI for further information. This story will be updated with any response.In response, Global Times reporter Li Qingqing wrote an op-ed which said that warnings about Chinese government hackers lacked "substantial evidence to support the accusation," adding, "The despicable war of words is a publicity stunt by certain crank politicians.""The COVID-19 pandemic is still raging across the world, especially in the US," Li wrote. "If any country dares to hack other countries' labs and steal research results into vaccines, it would be an act against all humanity.""Making up such rumors is convenient for the US government, so that US politicians can dodge their own culpability and failures, and instead allegedly hold China accountable for COVID-19 spread in the US,"Near the end of the op-ed, the writer said there's a possibility that the U.S. will in fact hack China's labs and steal its research into coronavirus vaccines and treatments."China needs to take precautions," it concluded.This isn't the first time the Global Times has criticized the U.S. response to the ongoing epidemic. In an April 13 op-ed, editor-in-chief accused President Donald Trump of "real international hooliganism," "dereliction of duty" and "extreme nationalism." The editor predicted that the Democratic party would soon expose Trump somehow, bringing an end to the coronavirus-era U.S. "propaganda war" against China.Link to ImageGraphic China coronavirus laboratoryMisha Friedman/GettyMirimus lab scientists preparing to test COVID-19 samples from recovered patients on April 8, 2020 in Brooklyn, New York City.

Agencies also said China Telecom's U.S. operations could allow Chinese government entities to "engage in malicious cyber activities that allow economic espionage and disruption and diversion of U.S. communications."Last year, two U.S. senators asked the FCC to review china Telecom and China Unicom's authorizations to operate in the United States.Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer and Republican Sen.

The young woman, suspecting a xenophobic attitude on the part of the troops and seeing how other people were inside the premises, asks if the restriction is for everyone or if only she does not let it pass. Individuals, with thermometers in hand, do not give explanations.As that dialogue unfolds, the victim watches another person enter without problems and tells another lady, white-skinned, what was happening. The latter edded with her and tried to engage in a conversation with the officers, asking them why that person could not enter. An officer beckoned her that she could enter but did not explain why the other woman could not do it. Clearly it was because of his skin color.The moment they don't let a woman of color into a shopping mall in ChinaThis is not the only case of discrimination in China. Thiam, a Guinean student, told the AFP news agency that he tested negative but that police demanded that he was quarantined, although he had not left Guangzhou since the outbreak began in January. "All the people I've seen are African. The Chinese can move freely. But when you're black you can't go out," he said.Denny, a Nigerian merchant expelled from his apartment, explained that he spent several days on the street before police officers finally quarantined him to a hotel. "Even if we give negative to COVID-19, the police do not allow us to stay in our apartment. They don't give reasons," he said.On Thursday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Zhao Lijian, acknowledged "misunderstandings" in prevention measures in Guangzhou. "The Chinese government treats all foreigners in China in the same way (...) and has zero tolerance for discriminatory words and acts," he said at a press conference. It also urged local authorities to "improve their working mechanisms and methods".African communities are discriminated against in China (REUTERS/Mike Hutchings) (MIKE HUTCHINGS/)US denounce China's xenophobia towards AfricansThe United States strongly denounced last Saturday the "xenophobia of the Chinese authorities towards Africans" claiming to be victims of discrimination in the city of Guangzhou after positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in the Nigerian community. These cases have created suspicions against the African community in the great metropolis of southern China.Several Africans said they were driven from their homes and then rejected in hotels."Abuse and mistreatment of Africans living and working in China unfortunately recalls how hollow the partnership between the People's Republic of China and Africa is," a US State Department spokeswoman told the AFP."At a time when we should support each other to overcome a pandemic that Chinese officials have irresponsibly concealed from the world, Beijing is dedicated to throwing African students into the streets without food or shelter," he lamented."It is unfortunate, but not surprising to see this kind of xenophobia on the part ofChinese authorities towards Africans. Everyone who observes Chinese projects in Africa knows this kind of unfair and manipulative behavior," he added.The United States has been denouncing China's lack of transparency at the start of the epidemic in late 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, and argues that this attitude delayed the backlash of the rest of the world and cost the lives of thousands of people.MORE ON THIS TOPIC:Everything you need to know about coronavirusThe UK recorded 888 new coronavirus deaths and total balance reached 15,464 deathsA new study suggests that coronavirus is not as deadly as we thoughtLoad-Date: April 19, 2020End of Document

Congress' Asian Pacific American caucus chair: It's dangerous for Trump to call coronavirus 'the Chinese virus'CNN.comMarch 21, 2020 Saturday 5:58 PM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 721 wordsByline: By Veronica Stracqualursi, CNNBodyThe chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American caucus on Saturday said it is "dangerous" for President Donald Trump to continue referring to Covid-19 as the "Chinese virus" at a time when misinformation has led to racist and xenophobic attacks against Asian Americans or anyone in the US who looks East Asian."It is dangerous for him to continue calling it the Chinese coronavirus," Rep. Judy Chu, a California Democrat and the first Chinese American woman elected to Congress, told CNN's Victor Blackwell on Saturday. "He is creating more xenophobia every single time he does that. And we can see the results in what's happening to Asian Americans across this country."LISTEN:Â The Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction PodcastThe congresswoman pointed to recently reported incidents of violence against Asian Americans, including a woman wearing a mask assaulted at a New York City subway station, a teenage boy in Los Angeles County beaten up by bullies who accused him of having coronavirus, and a family of four in Texas stabbed while trying to buy groceries amid the pandemic. "So it's a very serious situation, especially in a time of heightened emotion," Chu told Blackwell Saturday.CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.While Trump began using the term during news briefings on coronavirus this month -- and the incidents mentioned by Chu date to as early as the beginning of February -- some Republican lawmakers and administration officials earlier referred to Covid-19 as the "Chinese coronavirus," "the Chinese virus," or "the Wuhan virus" after the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave the official terminology for the virus.Trump has repeatedly called coronavirus "the China virus" or "the Chinese virus" during White House news briefings this month on the pandemic instead of using the official name from WHO and the CDC. And the President again referred to the virus that way during a Saturday briefing with reporters. After consulting with medical experts, and receiving guidance from the World Health Organization, CNN has determined the terms are both inaccurate and is considered stigmatizing.The President has defended his use of the term, denying it's racist or stigmatizing."It's not racist at all, no, not at all. It comes from China, that's why. I want to be accurate," Trump said on Wednesday.Trump claims he's using the term because the Chinese government has attempted to blame the virus on US soldiers. CNN previously reported that a prominent Chinese official has promoted a conspiracy theory that the US military could have brought the novel coronavirus to China and that it did not originate in the Chinese city of Wuhan."China was putting out information, which was false, that our military gave this to them. That was false. And rather than having an argument, I said I had to call it where it came from. It did come from China. So, I think it's a very accurate term," Trump said Tuesday, adding, "I think saying that our military gave it to them creates a stigma."WHO announced on February 11 that it would be referring to the novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan, China, as Covid-19."Some people are worried about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantine," the CDC website says.The website adds that stigma "is associated with a lack of knowledge" about how Covid-19 spreads, "a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths."The CDC's advice to help stop stigma: "Communicating the facts that viruses do not target specific racial or ethnic groups and how COVID-19 actually spreads can help stop stigma."In 2015, the WHO issued best practices for naming new human infectious diseases that advised avoiding the use of geographic locations.The organization acknowledged that the name "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome," or MERS, "has had unintended negative impacts by stigmatizing certain communities or economic sectors.""This may seem like a trivial issue to some, but disease names really do matter to the people who are directly affected," Dr Keiji Fukuda, the then-assistant director-general for WHO's health security, said in a statement at the time.Load-Date: March 21, 2020End of Document

And Congressman we are --DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: great to see you -- Maria.STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to be here.REP. JEFF VAN DREW (R-NJ): Good to be here.BARTIROMO: And -- of course, Steve Forbes as well joining us this morning. Congressman Jeff Van Drew -- let me ask you about opening New Jersey. Is that your number one priority right here?VAN DREW: It is my number one priority; I think we can do it better. I think we can do it a little, a bit faster yet be careful, be circumspect in how we do it. You know, there's no reason you can't be careful and appropriate and yet at the same time really get businesses going.We say it is about time. We don't want to wait too long.BARTIROMO: Yes.VAN DREW: We don't want the cure to be actually worse than the disease.BARTIROMO: Yes. We are feeling that in New York as well with today's "New York Post" headlines as well, which we have been showing.We'll talk more about that this hour. We're happy you're here with us -- Congressman Van Drew. Thank you.Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning meanwhile, the coronavirus still gripping the world. Globally there are more than five million people infected with COVID-19.The largest outbreak is here in the United States with more than 1.5 million confirmed cases.President Trump is headed to key battleground state of Michigan today to visit a Ford plant that has been repurposed to make ventilators -- all part of his national tour to thank businesses helping during the coronavirus pandemic.Let's take a look at Ford premarket this morning and it is down one and two-thirds percent at $5.40 a share on Ford.At least three people hurt, one critically after a gunman opened fire last night at a popular outdoor mall in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale.

Danny Hammond pick up the win, celebrating with a smiling face mask in pit row.But it wasn't all smiles. Kyle Busch (ph) spinning out Chase Elliot as he pushed for the lead.And Michael Cohen set to be released from prison today amid concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. President Trump's former lawyer was set to be released from the upstate New York facility next November. He will serve the remainder of his term at home.Joining me right now is Harvard Law professor emeritus, former criminal defense attorney for O.J. Simpson and the author of "Trumped Up: Criminalization of Politics Endangers Democracy". Alan -- it's great to see you this morning. Thanks very much for being here.ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR EMERITUS, HARVARD LAW: Thank you so much.BARTIROMO: So let me ask you first about Michael Cohen. Your reaction to now his rest of the term being served from home.DERSHOWITZ: It's the right decision. Whatever you may think of what Cohen did, he wasn't sentenced to death and he wasn't sentenced to disease. He was sentenced to incarceration. And he's not violent. He's not dangerous. And so common sense and compassion require that he be allowed to serve his sentence at home.The problem is that there are other people in prison today, I represent a guy who's almost 80 years old, white collar offender. He's not been not released. Others have been released. Michael Avenatti has been released. People who are quite sick haven't been released.The policies of the Department of Prisons are somewhat arbitrary. And we need a consistent approach. Everybody who is serving a sentence for a white collar offense, who is not dangerous, and who's subject to getting the disease and is vulnerable should be allowed to go home at least pending the end of the pandemic. Then if they have long sentences they can go and complete their sentences. But these are not death sentences. So I think the decision to release him is the right decision.BARTIROMO: But, you know, it brings up another issue though. Something that we have been railing about on this program and that is all the inmates being released in New York -- Alan. And, you know, a lot of these inmates they are released because Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo want to make Rikers Island -- they want to shut that down. And they want to make the prison system just a lot smaller with much lower capacity. But the problem is they are coming out and they are committing more crimes than they're being forced to come back in.DERSHOWITZ: Yes.BARTIROMO: Is there culpability there?DERSHOWITZ: I agree.BARTIROMO: You let out an inmate because of this no-bail reform law which made no sense, by the way, and then he comes out or she comes out, commits another crime. Is anybody culpable for that?DERSHOWITZ: Well, I think first people to be let out, those who are white collar offenders, those who have no risk recidivating, those who are in their 70s and 80s. And the question about whether you let somebody out who's been in for burglary or for robbery have some much, much, much harder question because they're in a balance of risks. You're balancing the risks to innocent civilians versus the risks to them.BARTIROMO: Yes.DERSHOWITZ: But we have to start with people who pose no danger at all. And I think that's the right and sensible approach.BARTIROMO: Ok. Let me ask you about former vice president Joe Biden, back under the microscope this morning. The president of Ukraine is calling for an investigation into the leaked phone conversation between Biden and his predecessor. And it links American aid to the removal of a top Ukrainian prosecutor. We've got it on tape.Meanwhile, the Senate Homeland Security Committee has approved subpoena power over a consulting firm linked to Burisma Holdings. That, of course, the Ukrainian national gas company where Hunter Biden served on the board - - Alan. Your reaction to all of this.DERSHOWITZ: Well, I think an investigation is appropriate. I think he'll be cleared. As I argued in front of the Senate -- just because there is a quid pro quo doesn't make it criminal.There was a quid pro quo here. Biden obviously said -- you can hear it on the tape -- we will release a billion dollars if you fire the corrupt prosecutor. That was quid pro quo.But, as I said in front of the Senate, which was misunderstood by CNN and others quite deliberately, the fact that it is a quid pro quo doesn't make it a crime or impeachable. It has to be an illegal quid pro quo. And I don't see anything illegal about the vice president of the United States conditioning aid on firing a corrupt prosecutor.We condition things all the time. Quid pro quos are part of the way we conduct our foreign policy. So I think everything should come out. There should be investigations of the recording of the son.Let the facts fall where they may. But I'm not in favor of weaponizing the criminal justice system against either Democrats or Republicans or presidential candidates or their children unless there's clear evidence of crime and I don't see any clear evidence of crime here.BARTIROMO: Yes. We've seen enough of the politicization of the intel agencies in 2016. That's for sure.DERSHOWITZ: Right.BARTIROMO: But what about any wrongdoing with regard to Hunter Biden and Burisma knowing that he travels on Air Force Two with then-vice president Joe Biden and when he came home received that $1.5 billion for his hedge fund?DERSHOWITZ: I think that is worth looking into as long as we apply a single standard to everybody. We have to ask the same question of every relative of every public figure.BARTIROMO: Yes.DERSHOWITZ: And we have to create standards that are applicable in the future. But let's not make crimes out of sins. If there are sins here, the public has the right to judge and assess them.But there is a big distinction between sins and crimes. That was the essence of what I have argued from the beginning of this administration.BARTIROMO: Very good assessment. Let me ask you this the only man ever convicted in a U.S. Court for a role in the September 11th attacks now says he is renouncing terrorism, al Qaeda and the Islamic state -- Alan. He said that he would like you or Rudy Giuliani to represent him. Your reaction to what we are hearing here.DERSHOWITZ: Well, he hasn't reached out to me. If he truly and sincerely wants to help victims and testify against other terrorists which is what he says he wants to do, I'm certainly willing to talk to him.I don't know how serious his crime is. People who are serving long prison terms often decide that they were wrong in an effort to try to get better conditions or release. But look, we are part of a tradition both religiously and civically where we forgive if people make true, true, true confessions and rehabilitation. So I'm open to talk to him or anybody else who wants to help innocent people.BARTIROMO: All right. You're open to it.Alan -- we will be watching the developments.DERSHOWITZ: Always.BARTIROMO: Thank you -- sir. It is good to see you this morning.Alan Dershowitz joining tell us there.DERSHOWITZ: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We'll take a break.When we come back, a quick look at the markets. Gamco Investors chairman Mario Gabelli is here this morning. We're going to talk about how he's allocating capital in this market. Down 118 points now on the Dow.And then the future of movie theaters. The stunning number of people who prefer to watch their flicks at home. Wait until you hear this.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Markets are pointing to a lower opening this morning. As you can see, Dow Industrials down 116 points. We've got the weekly jobless claims out in 15 minutes' time. It is expected to show another 2.4 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits in the last week. That would bring the total number of Americans unemployed filing for benefits since the shutdown began to nearly 39 million -- huge number.Joining me right now is Gamco Investors chairman and CEO, Mario Gabelli. And Mario -- I hope you are staying safe and strong at home. Thanks very much for being here this morning.Tell us how you see this pandemic shutdown and its impact on markets.MARIO GABELLI, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, GAMCO INVESTORS (via telephone): Thank you -- Maria. Good morning to you and all that are listening.Basically we do the same thing over the last 50 or 60 years we look with a microscope specific companies and then we look with a telescope on what the world is going to do. So we are looking at sort of first half of 2021 after the election and looking at what we think will another round of fiscal stimulus.Jay Powell is doing a great job in the hypersonic use of the monetary tools. And we think the economy will make comparisons easy. However short term -- Maria, the second quarter numbers are going to be starting coming out in the middle of July through the middle of August. The market is going to focus on that. We are going to see how big the wave is. So I kind of look at the stock market, as a W with a swoosh at the end.The benefit of what is going on today is an extended economic recovery before they start cutting back substantially. And then the question is what happens in 2021 as you have to deal with the macro of fiscal simulation that's being put in place on a global basis.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: So Mario -- I think what I hear you saying is you do think then that the economy comes back, in fairly you know --(CROSSTALK)GABELLI: Yes, Maria -- I followed the auto industry in the 60s. The conglomerates the monetary policy -- what are the leading economic indicators? What are lagging? And what is coincidental.You know, certain sectors will come roaring back. There's no car sales now so they're going to look a better on a global basis.Oil prices have come back from virtually negative to $33 a barrel. But that still is very low relative to the past three years. So that helps the economies of Europe, China, Japan, the United States, even though we produce oil, we (INAUDIBLE) and energy consume.Now I think things just falling in shape, the psychology over the next 60 to 90 days you've got some issues. They're speed bumps.BARTIROMO: Speed bumps -- so how would you be allocating capital then? Do you think that you want to be investing in areas like the auto sector?(CROSSTALK)GABELLI: No. Look -- Maria 90 days ago we had March madness canceled. You know, we had the supply chain. We had human pandemics. We have shutdowns. We will have what is the catalyst that everyone is looking, for vaccine and basically at the short term just common sense practices.And I believe things like sports will come back, not the way we know them but basically you will start seeing baseball. They will have a detail with baseball players and you'll start seeing games, much the way you have in South Korea or Taiwan which two people in attendance but it will great for the day part that you are home and the parts in which the games are taking place.You start with golf; you're seeing it with other sports like NASCAR. So we're looking at owning a baseball team over the next two or three years, we think that's great.We're buying the Atlanta Braves, we're buying a basketball team with Madison Square Garden that's public now. So there is a lot of things we focused on.BARTIROMO: So you're buying teams. You're really going deep in sports.Let me bring Steve Forbes in here. Steve -- what do you think of that -- what Mario is here talking about buying a sports team and continuing to invest in the sports area. Even as live sports have been shut down.FORBES: Well, I think he is right. When we get a vaccine, people are going to hanker to go back to a baseball stadium, get that beer and hot dog and whatever else.And in terms of buying a sports team like the Atlanta Braves, or whatever the kind of team -- that's a childhood fantasy of everyone who follows a sport like baseball -- so I'm glad that he's in that position to do it.GABELLI: No, no, no -- wait. Steve -- my clients are buying it.FORBES: Ok. Well, then your clients are buying it but they're going to give you a good seat at the game, I'm sure. So it's a dream come true.(CROSSTALK)GABELLI: -- daughters used to buy 100 shares of Atlanta Braves as simple as BATRA (ph) and you can pay $20 so that's going to be sold for $40 in two or three years.FORBES: Good. Sounds like a good deal. My daughters are going to be after me for that.GABELLI: I am delighted to --BARTIROMO: Real quick. Mario -- before you go, I just want to ask you about some of the names that you own that are actually really benefiting from the stay at home. I mean we are doing more online buying than ever before. Telehealth, tele-educating -- tell me where you are on Amazon and some of the companies that have actually seen a huge boost in sales as a results of this shutdown.GABELLI: Well, that's a great question -- Maria.You know, a hundred years ago we've been talking about Henry Ford industrial revolution. Today we're talking about the digital revolution. How -- which companies will benefit, which will be hurt. Telemedicine is obviously -- you know, when we own some (INAUDIBLE) located right in that in backyard from our Greenwich office.And basically the question is which companies are hurt and which are helped. clearly the question of real estate and what part of real estate and what helped is those that have vendors to the auto industry that will benefit when the cycle improves and have components on the EDP (INAUDIBLE).But Maria -- we also have to be sensitive to the world. How do we do renewable energy, how do we get watch companies. That wind solar cyber security which is very important in the end --(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: ok.GABELLI: If you're going to do battery power and so one.So we like Avan (ph) grid, we like Next Area energy partners. We like the companies that those are involved with on a global basis. It's a very interesting time to be investing.BARTIROMO: Wow -- interesting. Your finding opportunities throughout all of this.Mario -- good to talk with you this morning. Please come back soon. We will see you soon -- Mario. Mario Gabelli joining us there from (INAUDIBLE).GABELLI: And happy fifth anniversary. Take care.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much -- Mario. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Well, it is a frightening future for movie theaters. A new study finds a stunning 70 percent of movie goers now prefer to watch new movies from home instead of seeing them in a theater citing health and safety fears.A full 10 percent say that they will never set foot into a movie theater again. An uptick of 4 percent for March.Jeff Van Drew in New Jersey -- we are being taken back to the future with the resurgence of drive-in theaters. Tell us about that.VAN DREW: That's actually been a lot of fun. New Jersey environment has the only remaining and now there is going to be some new ones as well. But he only remaining original drive-in movie theater. And actually is very popular because you can stay in your car. You can bring your food with you.The governor has allowed that after a lot of lobbying. And I think people are going to enjoy that a great deal, because they do want to get out of the house.I think what you are saying is generally true with the technology we have today we practically have with sound and the picture. We have you know very wide screen (INAUDIBLE) so we pretty much have a movie theater in our home.But right now, I think some people really do want to get out.BARTIROMO: Yes. You know, Jeff -- I'm going to take a break. But when we come back I want to ask you about the conversation taking place right now in Congress, about how things look different, and how business will look different given the shutdown.But let's take a short break. We've got Congressman Jeff Van Drew with us this morning.Initial jobless claims are out in about three minutes' time. We'll have the numbers and analysis right after this.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday May 21. We are awaiting initial jobless claims out any moment now.Ahead of the number's futures are pointing to a decline at the start of trading. Down 108 points on the Dow Industrials. The expectations call for weekly jobless claims to be 2.4 million for the last week. And that would bring the total number for the last nine weeks all the way up to 39 million. This is pretty much expected in the market. We are going to get a tough number. The number should be coming out any minute and it may very well move markets if it's worse than that. Let's get right to Cheryl Casone, she's got the claims.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: We've got a few things here. So, claims coming in right about at the estimates. The estimate was for a jump of 2.4 million, we got 2.43 million. It was 3 million the previous week, so it's a little bit of a drop from last week. We've got to take the good news where we can find it, guys. Continuing claims, though, coming in 25.073, continuing claims. And we were looking for a jump there and that's about what we got. Also, we're looking at Philadelphia Fed numbers coming out right now, the Business Index coming out 43.1 versus April's 56.6, 43.1 is worse than expected for the Philadelphia, that's south New Jersey, it's Eastern Pennsylvania, that's Delaware, that's kind of the business survey there.But again, that is the story with the initial claims, so now we're up to let's see if I can do some quick math here, we're up, we're pushing 39 million claims in total. Well off the record that we got the week of March 28, and again we did get a bit of a revision, 2.68 for last week, but those are the initial claims and not much movement in the futures, we're down 109 right now for Dow Jones futures. A little bit of, tiny bit of pressure that we're looking at right now Maria.BARTIROMO: Alright, it was pretty much in line with estimates, at 2.4 million. That was really what the estimate was, so no big movement in market. Cheryl, thank you for that. Dagen, your take on this. We're up to 39 million, or close to it, but again, it's pretty much what the markets were expecting.MCDOWELL: Yeah, I'm doing the math. I'm trying to figure out what percentage of the, that is roughly 24 percent of where the labor force was, going into this pandemic shutdown. So, to put that in perspective, you've got in a matter of eight weeks, excuse me, nine weeks, nearly 39 people, filing for unemployment benefits.That means that on one, almost one out of four working Americans has filed for jobless benefits, filed for unemployment. And you see these numbers, these numbers are still extremely high. What is going on is a lot of these state unemployment systems are still struggling to process these claims. I know people who started filing in early April in New York state and they still haven't been able to get jobless benefits. They couldn't get PPP money. That was a disaster. They tried to go on unemployment, and here you are. These numbers are devastating. And I say this all the time, but literally people who've been put out of business overnight, they've been knocked out of their sturdy jobs overnight and they're left lining up, particularly here in New York City, it goes back to the New York Post cover.BARTIROMO: Yeah.MCDOWELL: They are lining up at food banks trying to feed their families. There is devastation coast to coast. Particularly here in these large cities. This has got to end. This has got to end. These businesses have to be allowed to operate.BARTIROMO: That is why we have an economy, it was self imposed on us, Steve Forbes, you're reaction to all of this, and that is why you've got people calling for this shutdown to end. All 50 states now, having some phase of reopening this week. Steve Forbes.FORBES: Yeah, I think that's got to be stepped up. We have to do more of what Colorado has done. What Florida is doing very good in opening their economies up. But those numbers, devastating though they are, don't include the self employed, who are now allowed to file for unemployment claims, but they're not counted in this number. And so we know the so called gig economy, and we have tens of millions of people who are working as independent contractors. So the hurt is out there.And this underscores, Maria, what this campaigns going to be about. How do we get this economy back on track as we reopen? Are we going to go the European Socialist way? Are we going to go the low tax, low burdens on business way? To get the deregulation, what Trump did the other day on deregulation is absolutely going to be helpful to the economy. It couldn't be more stark than this and these numbers underscore, how do we get them lower. European way or the American way?BARTIROMO: Yeah. Well, you make a really good point in terms of that deregulation move Steve. And Jeff Van Drew, this is the same playbook that the president used back in 2017 with his economic policy to try to get us back and that was tax cuts, deregulation and, of course, he wanted to redo trade deals, and unlock the spigot on energy.VAN DREW: And we've just got to open up. I mean, I don't know that anybody should be surprised that what's happened here. We closed all our businesses down, basically, except the most essential businesses. So, how could we be surprised? We knew this was going to happen. To be honest with you, I would have liked to have seen this done in a different way. I think there were a lot of compromises that could have been here. You know we can have spacing. We can have masks. We can make sure that older people are staying inside, that the debilitated and the sicker people are staying inside.But there are a whole lot of other folks that could have been working their businesses in a modified way and we still can be doing that. And my argument in New Jersey is we're not moving fast enough. You can be careful, you can be methodical, you can be medical, but you've got to move faster. That is really a big problem and I think the president's the guy that can do it because if we really do cut taxes, if we really do cut red tape, if we really incentivize, you know, business and the economy, we can do this and we can come back. I believe eventually, as he says, stronger than ever. But we've really go to work at it.BARTIROMO: Yeah.VAN DREW: But nobody should be surprised at where we are now. We did this to ourselves.BARTIROMO: Right. Exactly. Well, look. Speaking of some of the topics that we've been talking about. We have breaking news right now on the Chinese company delisting news. Breaking moments ago, Baidu is reportedly considering delisting from the NASDAQ to boost its valuation. This comes after NASDAQ's decision to remove Lucken Coffee shares amid fraud claims and the US Senate yesterday passing a bill not allowing companies to be publicly listed in the United States without proving that they are not under the control of a foreign government and allowing the auditors to ensure that they are following US law and our accounting rules. My next guest says that he thinks we should be willing to lose all of these Chinese listings until they follow the law. Joining me right now on the phone is Muddy Waters Capital Founder and Chief Investment Officer Carson Block.Carson, thanks very much for being here and for weighing in this morning. This is an important story for, certainly for me and for this program. Chinese companies have raised as much as $3 trillion dollars in our equity and debt markets, just in the last couple of years. If you take all those companies off these exchanges, that's going to be a big loss of business for the major exchanges, NASDAQ, New York, and our capital markets in general. Does that bother you?CARSON BLOCK, CEO AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, MUDDY WATERS CAPITAL: Well, it's no secret, Maria, that the interest of the exchanges are not necessarily the same as the interest as individual investors. And I think that when you look at these Chinese companies that list in the US that have raised trillions of dollars, many of which are committing fraud. I mean, let's call a spade a spade. Over the past 15 years, US investors have been systemically defrauded by China based issuers and nobody has gone to prison for it, so I believe that this continues in droves to this day. So that when they're allowed to do that, well the exchanges are benefitting because they get their listing fees, and there's trading volume, so the exchanges clip their tickets on that, but individual investors lose out when these things blow up in thought.BARTIROMO: Yeah.BLOCK: And even if they don't yet blow up, if they're giving us fake information, they are stealing our money. But yet nobody has been held accountable, materially, for this yet.BARTIROMO: Yeah, it's pretty unbelievable actually, and Chinese companies refuse to submit to audits by the Public Accounting Auditing Oversight Board. That's required by law for all companies to have these audits. And likewise, they refuse to disclose corporate financials. That's what we saw with Lucken and Lucken plummeted and investors lost almost everything. They also refused to disclose materials that are risk to the sheer value and corporate reputation of their companies and those Americans investing in them. Do you believe that this will, in fact, mean increasing Chinese companies being pulled from our exchanges?BLOCK: Well, I certainly hope so. Because, look, Maria, it's actually a little bit worse than you just mentioned. It's been against the backdrop of all this growing skepticism, in Congress, and you know, by the president, toward Chinese companies, last year, China went ahead and revised its securities law, and that law went into effect this year. And there's a new article in there that says that no Chinese company that issues securities overseas may provide information to a foreign regulator without the express permission of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. So, you know, there was an unwritten rule beforehand, that Chinese companies were just going to give the finger to the SEC and the DOJ, but it's now written.BARTIROMO: Yeah.BLOCK: They have upped the ante in this and I really don't think it's out of bounds for us to reciprocate, but no I do not feel like the US market will lose out.BARTIROMO: You know what, it's funny. They keep upping the ante. You know, they keep upping the ante, Carson. Remember when we were getting real aggressive on the intellectual property theft, technology companies in the United States. This was a year ago. What does Beijing do? The Communist Party puts its own rules in place that force all companies to turn over all technology to the, and use only Chinese technology companies, so that the Chinese Communist Party can continue to steal intellectual property and not get caught. And then in the middle of the pandemic, when nurses and doctors everywhere needed protective equipment, the PPE, what is the Chinese Communist Government do?They put new rules in place that make it harder to export those products to America and anywhere in the world. You have to go through the CCP. So, again, every time they sense they're up against the wall they put new rules in place to ensure that the Communist Government is very much in control. So, we're going to be watching this. There are at least 60 bills in Congress that are holding China accountable and we are on it, we've been on it from the beginning.I've got to ask you about GSX, because GSX is pushing back against accusations by you. Saying your company quote lacks a basic understanding of its business after your assessment that at least 70 percent of GSX's users are bots, robots and the education companies quote a near total fraud. What do you want to say, why do you think GSX is lying about their business and what can you tell us about this story? The premarket right now Carson is down 4 1/2 percent already.BLOCK: Sure, well, why they're lying at this point is because there's no downside to continue lying. The Chairman is worth on paper three close to four billion dollars, so he has significant expenses to lie. Yeah, this company is, this company is a zero. I mean, there's very little real business there. In terms of the, oh you don't understand our business. Look, we've been exposing fraud from China for ten years. We have 60 listings of these things. And every single one of them started their reply with Muddy Waters doesn't understand our business. We do, the business is securities fraud. We understand it very well, and that's what GSX is.BARTIROMO: And Carson, isn't it true, I mean, we've reported on this a lot, and that is civil military fusion in China. Isn't it true that Chinese companies, under the law, they have to follow civil military fusion, meaning any activity they have, any innovation that they get, technology that come up with, has to first go to the military. It has to be looked at by the military to see if it can be used there. Because the military is their supreme priority. They want to be the number one superpower in the world, not just economically, militarily. And this should concern the entire world.BLOCK: Yeah, and that also, first of all, at the end of the day, there's no such thing as a purely private company, or private actor in China. They all must do the bidding of the government even if their chairman wishes to do otherwise, which they don't because they kind of live and breathe at the grace of the CCP. But you know that also gets back to the whole point about the listings. I mean, we helped capitalize some of these companies so that they can, what, acquire our best technologies from Silicon Valley?BARTIROMO: That's right.BLOCK: And give them to the CCP, I mean that's a major issue. I mean, it's kind of like their taking our money in order to usurp technological and strategic advantage from us. It just, it makes no sense that we continue to play this game on this level.BARTIROMO: Yeah, which is why the president has now pulled back the idea that they are going to invest 10 percent of the thrift fund into the MSCI Index, which is loaded with Chinese companies that are building tanks and other equipment that may very well be used against us, or other countries in the future. Carson Block, thanks very much. We appreciate getting your insights on this important topic.BLOCK: Thanks.BARTIROMO: We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Despite widespread economic turmoil caused by COVID-19 the videogame industry is hitting a new high. Americans spending more on video games in the first quarter of 2020 than in any quarter in history to the tune of nearly $11 billion dollars as players stuck at home turn to video games for entertainment. Joining me right now is the head of Xbox gaming, Phil Spencer. Phil, great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us. Assess the environment for us. What kind of an uptick are you seeing in user engagement and consumer spending right now?PHIL SPENCER, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF GAMING, HEAD OF XBOX, MICROSOFT: Yeah, just like you said, people are at home. They're looking for ways to connect to their friends and their family. We're seeing incredible growth on Xbox Live. We're seeing products like Minecraft, with just massive usage. You've seen our partners, publishing partners out there talk about their earnings and the business results. Gaming is having a moment. It's a time where people are using the activity to connect with friends. It's really great.BARTIROMO: Yeah, it's interesting because the other day we had on Palmer Luckey who, of course, founded Oculus, and then sold it to Facebook for $5 billion, but now he's running Andural Industries. Also he founded this drone company, military company, which works with the military and he told us that right now because of the shutdown and COVID-19 worries, even the military is using video games to teach people how to drive tanks.SPENCER: You know, we've seen with Minecraft, Minecraft is our biggest game, we've sold over 200 million units of Minecraft. You know, makes it like if it was its own country, I think it would be a top ten country in the world. People are using Minecraft for virtual graduations right now. Using in ways to connect. I mean, Xbox Live, which is our social network, in the last two months alone, we've had over 270 million new friendships created over 220 different countries and territories. You know, it's just a great way for people to stay connected, to use the technology, to connect to new friends and family and as you said, put it uses that maybe it wasn't even originally built for.BARTIROMO: Yeah, you've said though, that the video gaming industry will start seeing the effects of coronavirus next year, right? How do you see that happening? Tell us how that may play out.SPENCER: Yeah, video game production is much like high end movie production, high end TV production now. Hundreds of people coming together to build these very elaborate, very expensive productions that are triple A video games today. And it is a collaborative process. Process like motion capture where people are getting in a studio and capturing animation together. Symphonic work that we do. The teams have done incredible work to be able to work remotely and make the progress that we've had. We've got great games shipping. Minecraft Dungeons is shipping next week. There's a great that allows people to play together, but definitely it will have an impact on production for some games, and where they are in the schedule. And I think you'll see that play out over the next two years. But I will say there's a lot of content in the market for people to play. Games are very durable. It's not just about the next newest game that people play. People are playing games from their youth. They're playing games with their friends. So, while we might see a slowdown in new releases, I'm not at all worried about the engagement that we see on the platforms.BARTIROMO: Yeah.SPENCER: Because people just love to play the games from their youth.BARTIROMO: I could see that. Yes, good stuff Phil. Great to talk with you this morning. Thank you so much. We'll be watching. Phil Spencer. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Summer fast approaching and during this COVID-19 pandemic, more Americans may be hitting the roads, steering an RV instead of flying to their summer vacation destination. Jeff Flock is taking a look. He's live this morning in Burns Harbor, Indiana. Jeff.JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: It's going through the roof, Maria, and we thought we'd just test one out for ourselves. I'm in a Minnie Winnie, this is a Minnie Winnebago and maybe you see it's pretty roomy out there. This is made available to us by our friends at Camp-Land RV in Burns Harbor, Indiana. Apparently, across the country there's tremendous interest in RV's and in renting them. Listen to one dealer we talked in the middle of Kansas who says it's just nuts right now.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DARYN ANDERSON, GENERAL MANAGER, OLATHE FORD: So, in the last 30 days for sure, we're actually tracking the best month of entire history. Our rentals are in the same boat. They're actually tracking the best year in their history and we've been doing rentals now for about six years.(END VIDEO CLIP)FLOCK: So, how do you rent an RV? Well, there's a couple of different ways. There's something called RV America. You can try that. Your local dealer may rent. And then there's something called RV share. And take a look at what you can get there. It's a little bit like the Airbnb of RV'ing. We found on there, near Chicago now, because that's kind of where we are, a 2008 Ford Sunseeker, you can get that for $79 a night. An Airstream Flying Cloud, you can get that for $109, and I leave you with a big one, Maria, you'd probably want this one, it's the Thor Motor Coach, Axis Motor Coach, you get that for, I think it's $230, I believe. People renting RV's so they take the hotel with them. All sanitized, all clean, very good. I leave you with the open road.BARTIROMO: That is amazing. They look so gorgeous Jeff. Really nice. The inside of that RV.FLOCK: Yeah very nice.BARTIROMO: Beautiful. Burns Harbor, Indiana. Jeff Flock. Thank you, Jeff. More Mornings with Maria right after this.BARTIROMO: All right, it's been a great show. I wish you a great day everybody.Load-Date: May 21, 2020End of Document

Continue reading UK government reverses course on Huawei s involvement in 5G networksConservative members of the United Kingdom s government have pushed Prime Minister Boris Johnson to draw up plans to remove telecom equipment made by the Chinese manufacturer Huawei from the nation s 5G networks by 2023, according to multiple reports.The decision by Johnson, who wanted Huawei s market share in the nation s telecommunications infrastructure capped at 35 percent, brings the UK back into alignment with the position Australia and the United States have taken on Huawei s involvement in national communications networks, according to both The Guardian and The Telegraph.The debate over Huawei s role in international networking stems from the company s close ties to the Chinese government and the attendant fears that relying on Huawei telecom equipment could expose the allied nations to potential cybersecurity threats and weaken national security.Originally, the UK had intended to allow Huawei to maintain a foothold in the nation s telecom infrastructure in a plan that had received the approval of Britain s intelligence agencies in January. This is very good news and I hope and believe it will be the start of a complete and thorough review of our dangerous dependency on China,  conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith told The Guardian  when informed of the Prime Minister s reversal.As TechCrunch  had previously reported, the Australian government and the U.S. both have significant concerns about Huawei s ability to act independently of the interests of the Chinese national government. The fundamental issue is one of trust between nations in cyberspace,  wrote Simeon Gilding, until recently the head of the Australian Signals Directorate s signals intelligence and offensive cyber missions.  It s simply not reasonable to expect that Huawei would refuse a direction from the Chinese Communist Party. Given the current tensions between the U.S. and China, allies like the UK and Australia would be better served not exposing themselves to any risks from having the foreign telecommunications company s technology in their networks, some security policy analysts have warned. It s not hard to imagine a time when the U.S. and China end up in some sort of conflict,  Tom Uren of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) told TechCrunch.  If there was a shooting war, it is almost inevitable that the U.S. would ask Australia for assistance and then we d be in this uncomfortable situation if we had Huawei in our networks that our critical telecommunications networks would literally be run by an adversary we were at war with. U.S. officials are bound to be delighted with the decision. They ve been putting pressure on European countries for months to limit Huawei s presence in their telecom networks. If countries choose to go the Huawei route it could well jeopardize all the information sharing and intelligence sharing we have been talking about, and that could undermine the alliance, or at least our relationship with that country,  U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told reporters on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, according to a report in The New York Times.In recent months the U.S. government has stepped up its assault against the technology giant on multiple fronts. Earlier in May, the U.S. issued new restrictions on the use of American software and hardware in certain strategic semiconductor processes. The rules would affect all foundries using U.S. technologies, including those located abroad, some of which are Huawei s key suppliers.At a conference earlier this week, Huawei s rotating chairman Guo Ping admitted that while the firm is able to design some semiconductor parts such as integrated circuits (IC), it remains  incapable of doing a lot of other things.  Survival is the keyword for us at present,  he said.Huawei has challenged the ban, saying that it would damage the international technology ecosystem that has developed to manufacture the hardware that powers the entire industry. In the long run, [the U.S. ban] will damage the trust and collaboration within the global semiconductor industry which many industries depend on, increasing conflict and loss within these industries. See Campaign:https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/28/how-huawei-is-dividing-western-nations/Contact Information:Jonathan ShieberTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: May 25, 2020End of Document

Chinese Firms Say Coronavirus Vaccine Will Be Ready by End of 2020Newsweek.comMay 31, 2020 Sunday 9:53 AM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 527 wordsByline: Benjamin FearnowHighlight: Two Chinese companies working directly under state supervision say they will be ready to mass produce a coronavirus vaccine by as early as December 2020, pushing the pace of the 100 labs working worldwide to develop a safe COVID-19 treatment.BodyTwo Chinese firms working directly under state supervision say they will be ready to mass produce a coronavirus vaccine by as early as December 2020, pushing the pace of the more than 100 labs working worldwide to develop a safe COVID-19 treatment.China's Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and the Beijing Institute of Biological Products announced they are entering Phase II of clinical trials in which 2,000 volunteers received vaccinations last week. A May 29 post on the Chinese social media platform WeChat highlighted the country's researchers having five coronavirus vaccines currently in human testing trials.As Reuters reported Saturday, the Chinese labs are working under the direction of the Communist Party of China's State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC).Formed in 2003 during a massive merging of Chinese industries, SASAC reports directly to China's state council and reports having $26 trillion in assets and an annual revenue of $3.6 trillion. The Wuhan Institute and Beijing Biological Products received approval from the Chinese government to move to Phase II clinical trials in mid-April.Newsweek reached out to the Chinese embassy in Washington Sunday morning for additional details about coronavirus vaccine development updates.Officials at the Beijing Institute of Biological Products said they are preparing their production line to manufacture 100 million to 120 million doses, according to the firm's post. Both Chinese research centers said the vaccine could potentially not be ready for distribution until early 2021. Sinopharm Group Chairman Liu Jingzhen told Chinese state media outlets on Friday that 180 volunteers had reached antibody levels resistant to the coronavirus with a 100 percent protective rate.Western scientists cast doubt on China's coronavirus vaccine claims over the weekend, with Dr. Peter Hotez of Baylor College telling MSNBC Sunday morning that any vaccine developed before the middle of next year would be setting an all-time "speed record." But last week the U.S. director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Anthony Fauci, said a vaccine could be ready as early as November. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has fast-tracked vaccine trials to speed up the process.Researchers at the Beijing-based biotech company Sinovac told Sky News Saturday they are in preliminary talks to hold final Stage 3 trials in the United Kingdom. "Yes, yes, it must be successful...99 percent [sure]," Sinoac researcher Luo Baishan told the British news outlet.The Geneva-based International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) held a Thursday virtual conference that discussed the "daunting" challenges the industry faces in producing a safe vaccine on a global scale. IFPMA Director Thomas Cueni said there are currently 10 vaccines in development worldwide and the ultimate intention is to produce it for any and all countries."We have a deep sense of responsibility in that we need to ensure no-one is left behind," Cueni said Thursday. "The notion of an equitable and affordable vaccine is a truly important one."Link to ImageGraphic globe vaccineiStockStock image.

US to alert Chinese hackers looking to hack COVID-19 vaccine studiesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 11, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 344 wordsBodyWashington will issue a public alert on allegedly China-linked hackers attempting to hack US investigations into developing a coronavirus vaccine, two local newspapers reported on Monday.The FBI (federal police agency) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plan to issue a warning about Chinese hackers, at a time when government and private initiatives are in a race against time to get a vaccine against evil, US newspapers The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times reported.Asked about those reports, President Donald Trump didn't confirm them, but he said. "? What else is there again with China?, tell me. I'm not happy with China.""We're watching her closely," he added.Several U.S. officials reportedly accuse cyber hackers of being linked to the Chinese government. The warning will be issued in the coming days.The possible warning adds to previous alerts and reports accusing hackers backed by the governments of Iran, North Korea, Russia and China of malicious activities related to the pandemic and including the dissemination of fake news about scientistsIn Beijing, foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian rejected these accusations, claiming that his country strongly opposes cyberattacks."We are leading global research for treatment and a vaccine for COVID-19," said the minister said it is "immoral" to attack China with rumors and slander in the absence of "evidence."The United States has a long difference with China, which it accuses of industrial espionage. The issue of intellectual property defense was at the heart of the long-running trade war between the two powers.But this new accusation could further cloud much-damaged relations since the emergence of the new coronavirus in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.Donald Trump's administration accuses Chinese authorities of delay in alerting the world to the epidemic, of having disguised its spread and making up figures, and so they believe they are "responsible" for the planetary spread, which has led to an unprecedented economic crisis around the world.pmh/an/gm/lluLoad-Date: May 13, 2020End of Document

Trump Administration Slaps 24 Chinese Companies With New Trade RestrictionsNewsweek.comMay 22, 2020 Friday 6:34 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 485 wordsByline: Asher StocklerHighlight: This is the second move from the Department of Commerce in the past week to clamp down on U.S. exports to China.BodyThe U.S. Department of Commerce Friday afternoon escalated the Trump administration's trade dispute with China, walling off exports to two dozen mainly Chinese entities it believes act as procurers for the country's military.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement that the impending move will "demonstrate our commitment to preventing the use of U.S. commodities and technologies in activities that undermine our interests."The Commerce Department announced it plans to act against 24 business entities based in China, Hong Kong or the Cayman Islands—a haven for tax avoidance—that represent a "significant risk" of supporting Chinese military supply chains.The companies include various technology and research firms, such as CloudMinds, based in Beijing, which operates cloud-enabled robotic systems, and Qihoo 360, also in Beijing, which develops antivirus software.A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., did not return a request for comment from Newsweek.The department will add the companies to its Entity List, a section of the federal body of regulations outlining which foreign entities are prohibited from being sold American goods or technologies without the issuance of a special license to the exporter.The regulations specify key products that the Department of Commerce controls under this licensing regime that could implicate national security, foreign policy or nonproliferation concerns. They place a substantial focus on so-called "dual use" items which may be sold for civilian use but could have military applications as well.This is the second move from the Department of Commerce in the past week to clamp down on U.S. exports to China, further rattling a trade standoff between the two countries that had been subsumed by the coronavirus pandemic.Last Friday, the department announced a new rule seeking to restrict the ability of Huawei—China's crown jewel telecommunications company—to access critical inputs. The action was prompted by what Ross described as an evasion of earlier restrictions when the company was added to the Entity List in May 2019.According to Ross, Huawei had attempted to sidestep the designation by in-sourcing more of its manufacturing process. The rule, which will take effect in September, moves to limit this by preventing foreign plants enabled by U.S. technology from producing chips designed by Huawei without a license.However, the presumption is that the license would be denied.In response to that announcement, the state-run Global Times cited a source close to the Chinese government as threatening "countermeasures" against prominent U.S. corporations such as Apple and Boeing."China will launch rounds of endless investigations on those firms, just like swords hanging over their head," one "insider" told the outlet. "It will dampen investors' confidence and squeeze their income in the Chinese market."Link to ImageGraphic CloudMindsGABRIEL BOUYS/AFP/GettyThe Cloud Pepper robot by CloudMinds stands at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona on February 25, 2019.

COVID-19 FUELING ANTI-ASIAN RACISM AND XENOPHOBIA WORLDWIDE NATIONAL ACTION PLANS NEEDED TO COUNTER INTOLERANCEStates News ServiceMay 12, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 3230 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK, N.Y. BodyThe following information was released by Human Rights Watch:Governments should take urgent steps to prevent racist and xenophobic violence and discrimination linked to the Covid-19 pandemic while prosecuting racial attacks against Asians and people of Asian descent, Human Rights Watch today. On May 8, 2020, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that "the pandemic continues to unleash a tsunami of hate and xenophobia, scapegoating and scare-mongering" and urged governments to "act now to strengthen the immunity of our societies against the virus of hate."Government leaders and senior officials in some instances have directly or indirectly encouraged hate crimes, racism, or xenophobia by using anti-Chinese rhetoric. Several political parties and groups, including in the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Greece, France, and Germany have also latched onto the Covid-19 crisis to advance anti-immigrant, white supremacist, ultra-nationalist, anti-semitic, and xenophobic conspiracy theories that demonize refugees, foreigners, prominent individuals, and political leaders."Racism and physical attacks on Asians and people of Asian descent have spread with the Covid-19 pandemic, and government leaders need to act decisively to address the trend," said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director. "Governments should act to expand public outreach, promote tolerance, and counter hate speech while aggressively investigating and prosecuting hate crimes."The UN committee responsible for monitoring compliance with the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which 182 countries have ratified, has recommended that governments adopt "national action plans against racial discrimination." Plans should lay out specific approaches to combat racism and discrimination, from enhanced policing of hate crimes to public messaging and education programming encouraging tolerance. Governments need to take urgent action to adopt new action plans to address the wave of Covid-19 racism and xenophobia.Since the outbreak of the pandemic, Asians and people of Asian descent have been targets of derogatory language in media reports and statements by politicians as well as on social media platforms, where hate speech related to Covid-19 also appears to have spread extensively. US President Donald Trump's use of the term "Chinese virus" and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's use of "Wuhan virus" may have encouraged the use of hate speech in the US. Although by late March Trump stepped back from using the term and issued a tweet in support of "our Asian-American community," he has not directed any specific governmental response toward protecting Asians and people of Asian descent.The governor of the Veneto region of Italy, an early epicenter of the pandemic, told journalists in February that the country would be better than China in handling the virus due to Italians' "culturally strong attention to hygiene, washing hands, taking showers, whereas we have all seen the Chinese eating mice alive." He later apologized. Brazil's education minister ridiculed Chinese people in a tweet suggesting that the pandemic was part of the Chinese government's "plan for world domination."Increases in racist rhetoric have coincided with increases in racist attacks. Since February, Asians and people of Asian descent around the world have been subjected to attacks and beatings, violent bullying, threats, racist abuse, and discrimination that appear linked to the pandemic.In Italy, the civil society group Lunaria since February has collected over 50 reports and media accounts of assaults, verbal harassment, bullying, and discrimination against people of Asian descent. Human rights and other groups in France, Australia, and Russia have also told Human Rights Watch of Covid-19-related attacks and harassment of people of Asian descent.In the UK, Asian people have been punched in the face and taunted, accused of spreading coronavirus. Two women attacked Chinese students in Australia, punching and kicking one and yelling "Go back to China" and "you fucking immigrants." Two men attacked a Chinese-American in Spain and beat him so badly that he was in a coma for two days. A man with a knife attacked a Burmese family in Texas.In Africa, there have been reports of discrimination and attacks on Asian people accused of carrying coronavirus, as well as foreigners generally, including in Kenya, Ethiopia, and South Africa. In Brazil, the media have reported harassment and shunning of people of Asian descent.In some instances, governments have imposed strict lockdowns that indiscriminately affect only foreign workers without providing adequate health care, financial assistance, or other services that many workers now need to survive. In early May, the Malaysian authorities carried out mass raids to detain refugees and migrant workers, suggesting without basis that the migrant community and Rohingya refugees were responsible for the spread of Covid-19.Across the Middle East, persistent racist rhetoric in public discourse against foreign workers intensified after several Covid-19 outbreaks occurred in densely populated segregated areas for foreign workers, most of whom are Asian.Discrimination against Chinese people has also been reported in South Korea, Japan, and Indonesia.Discrimination hasn't been limited to Asians or people of Asian descent. In India and Sri Lanka, where leaders have done little to stop rising anti-Muslim discrimination in recent years, many apparent Covid-19-related cases of attacks and discrimination against Muslims have been reported. In Myanmar, ultra-nationalist leaders have used the pandemic to justify threats and hate speech against Muslims.In Guangzhou in China, there have been growing numbers of cases of racial discrimination against Africans. Guangzhou authorities have forced Africans and people of African descent to quarantine or demanded that building owners evict them from apartments or hotels."Repeatedly and publicly condemning racism is an important part of any government's response to the coronavirus," Sifton said. "Governments also need to adopt special public education initiatives, strengthen policing of hate crimes, and offer support to communities victimized by discrimination and racially motivated attacks. Social media companies should robustly monitor online space to prevent or mitigate the spread of hate speech and xenophobic content."Country-Specific CasesUnited StatesAnti-Asian incidents have continued in the US since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, with numerous media reports in February and March about attacks and discrimination linked to Covid-19. By late April, a coalition of Asian-American groups that had created a reporting center called STOP AAPI HATE said it had received almost 1,500 reports of incidents of racism, hate speech, discrimination, and physical attacks against Asians and Asian-Americans.In one typical incident, a Chinese-American reported "I was on the phone with my mom speaking in Mandarin when a woman walked by and yelled 'get this corona virus chink away from me,' directed at me."At least 125 of the incidents reported were physical attacks. Among the reported incidents: "A truck drove by and threw a [fast food franchise] drink on my back and yelled 'Hey chink, you're fucking nasty.'" In another, an Asian-American waiting for a bus said a man:began berating me. I ignored him ... [then] an object of substantial weight was thrown at me with high velocity missing me but impacting the side of the bus with a sickening 'thwack.' Instantly, I sobered to an awareness in the amount of trauma the object would have caused if it had struck my head.The group also reported hundreds of cases in which Asian-Americans were harassed in public or barred from businesses or transportation, yelled at in supermarkets, accused of "bringing coronavirus" to the US, or refused transport in car services like Uber or Lyft.On May 4, the Anti-Defamation League released a list of near-daily incidents of racist attacks and cases of harassment from January through early May. For instance, on May 3, a stranger shouted at an Asian man on the New York subway "You're infected China boy, you need to get off the train" and then attempted to pull the man out of his seat.From March through early May, there were numerous public reports of violent physical attacks on Asian Americans including in California, Minnesota, New York, and Texas. NextShark, a website focused on Asian-American news, only received a few messages per day before the pandemic about cases involving anti-Asian bias; now it receives dozens.Senior members of several Asian-American and other nongovernmental organizations have told Human Rights Watch that many members of the Asian-American community they work with have experienced abuse or harassment, or know someone who has.The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other federal agencies have not taken any specific actions to address the rise in racist attacks and discrimination, although several state and local governments have set up hotlines and directed authorities to investigate cases of attacks or discrimination.United KingdomSeveral violent attacks against people of Asian descent were reported when the Covid-19 outbreak began in the UK in February, including several physical attacks or beatings.In early May, Sky News reported that data it had obtained through Freedom of Information requests to various regional UK police forces showed at least 267 anti-Asian hate crimes recorded across the country between January and March. In many jurisdictions, the figures for the first three months of 2020 were higher than all of 2018 or 2019. The figures from the British Transport Police between January and March, for instance, showed anti-Asian (or "anti-Chinese") hate crime incidents matching the total number of complaints during all of 2019.Stop Hate UK, an anti-racism group, reported in March that it had received increasing numbers of calls or reports of "racism, discrimination, and verbal abuse, arising from perceptions that they are members of the Chinese community."The senior-most UK police official responsible for hate crime nationally has stated publicly that police forces are monitoring anti-Asian hate crime and take such crimes seriously. In a recent release of crime statistics generally during the Covid-19 outbreak, however, police authorities focused on crime decreasing generally, without noting the rise in anti-Asian hate crime or indicating steps they are taking to stop it.Several of the country's local police forces did not provide information to the Sky News Freedom of Information requests about Covid-19-related hate crimes. This raises concerns about whether they are collecting data on anti-Asian hate crimes and whether they are monitoring and disaggregating hate crime by ethnicity, despite clear official guidance to do so.RussiaOn about February 20, after Russia banned Chinese citizens from entering the country, the state-owned transport company Mosgortrans began ordering drivers of public transport in Moscow to report Chinese passengers to the police. Staff stopped many passengers perceived to be Asian and asked for identification and the number of their metro pass to track their movements. The Chinese embassy sent a letter to the Moscow government on February 24 asking them to take steps to stop the discriminatory practice. During the last week of February, well before Moscow was placed under lockdown, police raided several locations to identify Chinese citizens and force them into quarantine, regardless of their travel histories.The Russian group SOVA, which monitors xenophobia and racism, told Human Rights Watch that there had been increased attacks against Asians since February. It also reported a "wave of insulting and racist commentary directed at Chinese people and natives of Central Asia on social media" in relation to Covid-19.A media report by Lenta on March 29 detailed several accounts, including cases of people yelling at Asians or Central Asians on the subway or in public, asserting that "the Chinese brought coronavirus to this country." Through March, there were also reported incidents of discriminatory actions against Asian-looking people in Nizhnevartovsk, Ekaterinburg, Tatarstan, and Makhachkala, among other places.AustraliaA spate of cases of racist abuse and attacks and vandalism against people of Asian descent have been reported across the country since the outbreak of Covid-19. For example, there were reports in late March in Sydney of cases in which "Death to dog eaters" was painted in front of an Asian man's house and of people screaming racist abuse at two sisters, calling them "Asian dogs" who "brought Coronavirus here" and "dumb whore."Near Melbourne, also in late March, a Chinese-Australian family's suburban home was targeted with racist vandalism three times in the space of a week: on March 20, the family found the words "COVID-19 China die" spray painted on the door of their garage. Late the following night, an unidentified person threw a large rock though one of their windows. On March 29, the door of their garage was again spray painted, this time with the words "leave and die."On April 15, 2 women in a group attacked 2 female Chinese students at Melbourne University, yelling racist statements such as, "Go back to China" and "you fucking immigrants." One of the women repeatedly punched one of the students in the head and, after pushing her to the ground, kicked her in the torso several times.A survey focusing on Covid-19-related racism against Asians and Asian-Australians recorded 178 incidents during the first two weeks of April countrywide. The survey, by the community group Asian Australian Alliance, has received about 12 reports a day since April 2, ranging from racial slurs to physical assault. The majority of racist incidents reported 62 percent were against women. Australia's Human Rights Commission also reported a spike in complaints about racist attacks. The Australian National University created a "prejudice census" to better collect information about the surge of incidents linked to Covid-19.Prime Minister Scott Morrison has criticized Covid-19-related racist attacks, telling Australians to simply "stop it." Alan Tudge, Australia's acting minister for immigration and multicultural affairs, also strongly condemned the rise in racist attacks, and a Labor parliament member, Andrew Giles, and other opposition leaders have called for the government to restart a national anti-racism campaign.IndiaHate speech against Muslims, already a serious and growing problem since the election of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2015, increased in connection with the spread of Covid-19.In April, social media and WhatsApp groups were flooded by calls for social and economic boycotts of Muslims, including by BJP supporters. Several physical attacks on Muslims have also occurred, including of volunteers distributing relief material, amid falsehoods accusing them of spreading the virus deliberately.Hate speech against Muslims appears to have grown after Indian authorities announced that a large number of Muslims had tested positive for Covid-19 after attending a mass religious congregation in Delhi, organized by the international Islamic missionary movement Tablighi Jamaat. BJP officials fanned the flames by calling the Jamaat meeting a "Talibani crime" and "CoronaTerrorism." Some mainstream media supportive of the BJP have used terms like #CoronaJihad, causing the hashtag to go viral on social media.The situation grew so serious that the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a statement of caution, noting that "it is very important that we do not profile the cases on the basis of racial, religious, and ethnic lines."Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not explicitly condemned hate speech against Muslims, but tweeted "COVID19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language, or borders before striking. Our response and conduct thereafter should attach primacy to unity and brotherhood. We are in this together." But Indian authorities at the national and local level have not taken adequate steps to stem the increasingly toxic atmosphere or conduct adequate investigations of attacks where appropriate.Sri LankaSeveral government officials have made stigmatizing public comments about Sri Lanka's minority Muslim community in the context of the pandemic, as hate speech has been reported across the country. This includes claims that Muslims are responsible for deliberately spreading the pandemic, along with calls for boycotts of Muslim businesses. Muslim organizations wrote to the government on April 12 to draw attention to an increase in hate speech in Sri Lanka.The Sri Lankan government issued a rule on March 27 that anyone who dies from Covid-19 complications must be cremated, which is at odds with Islam religious practice. The WHO has said that cremation should be "a matter of cultural choice and available resources," and is not necessary to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Four UN special rapporteurs issued a communication on April 8 finding that the rule was a violation of freedom of religion and also drawing attention to anti-Muslim hate speech and the stigmatization of Muslims who had tested positive for Covid-19. A Muslim man, Ramzy Razeek, who wrote against the cremation rule on Facebook, received death threats. When he complained to the police, he was arrested on April 9.International Legal ObligationsThe International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination obligates countries to "condemn racial discrimination" and undertake measures aimed at "eliminating racial discrimination in all its forms and promoting understanding among all races" while undertaking "not to sponsor, defend, or support racial discrimination by any persons or organizations." Countries need to "prohibit and bring to an end, by all appropriate means ... racial discrimination by any persons, group, or organization" and "discourage anything which tends to strengthen racial division."The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), set up to monitor the treaty's provisions, has stated in a general recommendation on combating racist hate speech that "[f]ormal rejection of hate speech by high-level public officials and condemnation of the hateful ideas expressed play an important role in promoting a culture of tolerance and respect." The CERD committee recommends that governments undertake "information campaigns and educational policies calling attention to the harms produced by racist hate speech," and that training for police and legal systems is "essential" to foster "familiarization with international norms protecting freedom of opinion and expression and norms protecting against racist hate speech."Given the upsurge in anti-Asian and other racism and xenophobia related to the Covid-19 pandemic, all governments should adopt new action plans to address emerging forms of discrimination and xenophobia tailored to the new and changing circumstances, Human Rights Watch said. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights outlined best strategies for adopting action plans in a set of guidelines released in 2014.Load-Date: May 13, 2020End of Document

ARMY OF PRC TWITTER BOTS PEDDLES DISINFORMATION ABOUT VIRUS ORIGINSStates News ServiceMarch 30, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 908 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:China has set up multiple fake bot accounts on Twitter using Radio Free Asia's logo and descriptions to tweet fake news in recent months, including allegations that the coronavirus came from the U.S., a recent investigative report has found.The tweets are sent by accounts using the RFA logo, but named after various regions of China, for example "Radio Free Guangdong," or "Radio Free Anhui."They churn out tweets that reflect the official line of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, including the rumor that the coronavirus pandemic originated in the United States and not in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.The public interest journalism website ProPublica said it had tracked more than 10,000 suspected fake Twitter accounts since August 2019 that have been part of a "coordinated influence campaign with ties to the Chinese government."The report's co-author Jeff Kao said the hijacking of visual identifiers from legitimate accounts to impersonate them is a hallmark of Beijing's social media campaigns."They changed one of the letters in the Twitter handle and they were posting political messages that were in line with the Chinese government's views," Kao told RFA."They have very few real followers, but what they were tweeting would get like 100 likes or 20 retweets, and I think that was another tactic that they were trying out," he said.For example, a recent post in English reported on aid the Chinese government recently provided to Italy, and was sent by the Twitter handle @RNA_Chinese."[The account] appears to have been an attempt to fool the casual reader into believing it was coming from the U.S. government-funded broadcaster Radio Free Asia (@RFA_Chinese)," the report said.Hacked, repurposed accountsOther accounts tweeting pro-China propaganda were actually once genuine, but had been repurposed after they were hacked, the ProPublic report said."They included a professor in North Carolina; a graphic artist and a mother in Massachusetts; a web designer in the U.K.; and a business analyst in Australia," it said."Suspected Chinese operatives have stepped up their efforts in recent days, according to private messages shared with ProPublica, offering influential Chinese-speaking Twitter users cash for favorable posts," it said.The article said the fake accounts are tailored to different audiences, but the Chinese-language posts were likely aimed at influencing the "millions of ethnic Chinese" who don't live in mainland China.In August and September, Twitter announced that it had suspended more than 5,000 suspected Chinese state-controlled accounts and banned around 200,000 accounts that hadn't yet been fully activated.ProPublica said it wrote computer programs to document millions of interactions between the 10,000 suspected fake accounts and trace an interrelated network of more than 2,000."The true scale of the influence campaign is likely much bigger; our tracking suggests that the accounts we identified comprise only a portion of the operation," it said."We found a pattern of coordinated activity among the fake accounts that appeared to be aimed at building momentum for particular storylines," it said.Among the storylines were the smearing of the Hong Kong protest movement as "rioters" and "separatists," and praise lavished on the city's police as they used unprecedented amounts of violence to crack down on largely peaceful protesters.Yang Jianli, founder of the Washington-based human rights group Citizen Power, said he has been targeted by hackers backed and directed by the Chinese state, although their companies may be nominally listed as private."The authorities use a lot of private companies to carry out operations like this, and many are willing to provide this service to the Chinese government," Yang said."Clearly these companies benefit from being under the aegis of government power and privilege," he said.Efforts not effectiveKao said the fake accounts aren't convincing enough yet to be effective, however."It's hard to say that any minds will change ... because the accounts look so fake," he said. "But I think the message was definitely reaching the people that it was trying to reach."There are strong links between the Chinese Twitter bots and a Beijing-based internet marketing company called OneSight, as many of the fake accounts had liked its tweets.The company recently won a U.S.$175,000 contract to boost the Twitter following of the state-run China News Service, an arm of the Chinese Communist Party's outreach and influence arm, the United Front Work Department.On Jan. 29, OneSight announced a new app that tracked virus-related information, and tweeted that it would "transmit the correct voice of China" to the world, just six days after Beijing imposed a lockdown on Wuhan."The influence network suddenly shifted its focus to the coronavirus epidemic," ProPublica said.A spokesperson for Twitter declined to comment specifically when contacted by ProPublica."Using technology and human review in concert, we proactively monitor Twitter to identify attempts at platform manipulation and mitigate them," the spokesperson said in a statement."If we identify further information campaigns on our service that we can reliably attribute to state-backed activity either domestic or foreign-led, we will disclose them."Reported by Jia Ao for RFA's Mandarin Service.

Sen. Cruz: How Chinese Censorship Led to a Global PandemicTargeted News ServiceApril 13, 2020 Monday 8:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 454 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: HOUSTON, Texas BodySen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, issued the following news release:As the coronavirus pandemic continues to impact communities in Texas and all across the country, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, released a new video, 'Coronavirus Coverup: How Chinese Censorship Led to a Global Pandemic.' First reported in the Dallas Morning News, the new video highlights the role of the Chinese Communist Party in silencing medical experts who tried to warn the world about this dangerous disease, using the World Health Organization - whose own mission is to "disseminate public health information of international significance" - to parrot Chinese propaganda, and allowing the initial outbreak in Wuhan to become a global pandemic.WATCH: Coronavirus Coverup: How Chinese Censorship Led to a Global Pandemic (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFZZAZdNU1I&feature=youtu.be)Throughout his Senate career, Sen. Cruz has focused on China's human rights violations and censorship, not only because of the need to liberate the Chinese people from the Communist Party, but also because they put America and the rest of the world at risk.In the video, Sen. Cruz reaffirmed his commitment to holding Chinese officials accountable for their culpability in covering up the coronavirus outbreak, saying:"For the eight years I've been in the Senate, I've every year made standing up to China and strengthening America against China a top national security priority. Our priority now needs to be the immediacy of defeating this pandemic. Once we defeat it, there needs to be serious, careful inquiry into what the hell happened, how could it have been stopped, and how could we have saved all of the lives that are being lost right now."As Dallas Morning News' Todd Gillman, who first reported the video, wrote:"'There needs to be accountability. There needs to be a reckoning - assessing what exactly was China's culpability,' [Cruz] said. Cruz cited China's well-documented initial cover as reason for suspicion, and asserted that threats to cut off medical supplies could amount to an act of war.""The Chinese government [...] aggressively covered up and hid the Wuhan outbreak" and tried to silence medical experts who sounded an alarm. 'There is a very real possibility that we could have stopped this outbreak" and averted the huge cost in lives and jobs worldwide,' he said."Click here (https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=5034) to learn more about Sen.

US resin export boom fading on COVID-19 pressuresJournal of CommerceApril 14, 2020 Tuesday 6:27 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Commonwealth Business Media All Rights ReservedLength: 1593 wordsByline: Hugh R. Morley, Senior Editor | Apr 14, 2020 2:27PM EDTBodyhttps://www.joc.com/sites/default/files/field_feature_image/ResinsApril142020.jpg [caption caption="US resin exports grew in all of the biggest resin-importing countries in 2019 except China and Hong Kong in 2020. Photo credit: Shutterstock.com."][/caption]After two years of double-digit export growth, analysts expect US resin exports to drop in 2020 as plummeting oil prices make foreign producers more competitive with US manufacturers and global demand for resins drops due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Demand for resins, which are used to make plastics, is expected to decline as countries shut down their economies to fight COVID-19, said Joel Morales Jr., executive director of polyolefins for North America at IHS Markit, parent company of JOC.com. And the drop in US resins exports could be severe if oil prices remain low or continue to fall, he said.IHS Markit predicted in April that US resin exports would decline by 82,000 TEU or about 9 percent in 2020 compared with last year, primarily due to a precipitous drop in global oil prices caused by downward pressure on demand from COVID-19 and a refusal by OPEC and Russia to cut production. US resin exports in 2020 totaled 872,995 TEU, according to PIERS, a sister company of JOC.com within IHS Markit. The impact of oil prices on US resins stems from their manufacture with low-cost shale gas produced in the Gulf Coast region using a byproduct, ethane, as a feedstock or raw material. With high oil prices, that makes US-made resin cheaper than that made by foreign producers using feedstocks from oil.Oil prices have plummeted since the beginning of the year, with global benchmark Brent crude hitting a 20-year low of $24.74 on April 1. The oversupply will be mitigated somewhat by an April 12 agreement forged by the United States, Russia, and Saudi Arabia in which 23 countries committed to collectively withholding 9.7 million barrels of oil a day from global markets.IHS Markit's prediction of a loss of 82,000 TEU in resin exports in 2020 was made before the April 12 accord. If oil is priced below $20 a barrel, it "absolutely challenges and changes the equation in the near term of North American competitiveness," said Morales. In that scenario, much of the demand formerly served by the US resin sector would be picked up by Asian producers, he said. However, that could change if the price of oil rises as oil producers cut back on production, he said. IHS Markit expects the oil price to dip below $20 a barrel in May but to average over $30 a barrel for the year, which will still hurt the competitive edge of US resins producers but not nearly to the same extent, Morales said.The oil price decline adds to the already uncertain outlook for US resin exports as global economies shut down amid the fight against the coronavirus, which IHS Markit expects to reduce demand for resins. At the same time, the US resin sector faces a rise in Chinese production of resins. And the US sector continues to feel the effects of the 25 percent tariff that China levied on resins in August 2018 as part of the trade war with the US, although an interim agreement in January offers hope that US resins to China could go up again.[caption caption="Click to enlarge" align="right"][/caption]A decline in resin exports would be a swift turnaround for US producers, who saw US resin exports increase in 2019 and 2018, by 29.4 percent and 12.7 percent, respectively, despite the Chinese tariffs, according to PIERS figures. But monthly resin export growth was already decelerating steadily through 2019 and the start of 2020. While the monthly volume through most of 2019 was 20 to 35 percent above the same months in 2018, exports in January were just 12.9 percent over the year earlier.     Even with a possible decline in US resin exports, resin plants scheduled to open in 2020 will do so, Morales said. Existing US resins plants are located mostly along the Gulf Coast, fueled by access to low-cost shale gas produced in the region, and so are the new plants. The LyondellBasell Equistar plant in Laporte, Texas, opened in the first quarter of this year, and Sasol in Lake Charles, Louisiana, and Formosa Plastics Corp. in Point Comfort, Texas, are set to open in the third quarter, Morales said. But four others planned to begin construction in 2021 could be delayed, and plants planned for 2022 and beyond could be canceled entirely, Morales said.Ports optimistic for 2020 growthDespite the expected slowing of growth rates, industry executives say they have yet to feel any downturn in demand for US-made resins.Export volumes handled by Vinmar Group, a global marketing and distribution company that specializes in resin exports, are up so far this year compared with the same period in 2019, and the company expects that trajectory to continue, said Alessandro Menezes, the company's director of transportation."Bookings are strong," Menezes said, adding that the company's biggest concern is "the tight vessel space capacity due to blank sailings pushed by softening of the import demand."Roger Guenther, executive director at the Port of Houston Authority (POHA), which handled about half of all US resins exports in 2019, said that given the high quality of resins produced in the region and the rapid increase in port resin exports in 2019, he doesn't anticipate a near-term decline. Resin exports through Houston increased 52.4 percent to 432,417 TEU in 2019, over 2018, PIERS figures show. "And who knows how long the price of oil is going to stay where it's at," Guenther said.The Port of New Orleans, which handles the third-largest volume of US resin exports, is also optimistic that resin exports will stay strong. Resin exports through the port, which handled 10.6 percent of total US resin exports in 2019, grew 4.4 percent in the first quarter of 2020 compared with the same period last year, according to port spokesperson Jessica Ragusa. That's well below the 35.6 percent increase to 92,739 TEU for the full year in 2019.Ragusa noted that the full impact of the coronavirus on oil demand - and prices - is still unclear. "It's hard to forecast how quickly demand that was lost due to a slowing of global manufacturing will return to normal levels," she said.But M. Can Fidan, vice president of business development for MTS Logistics, a New York-based non-vessel operating common carrier (NVO) that specializes in shipping resins, said he has already seen a small drop in orders due to the oil price cut and the impact of COVID-19. "We have a few customers who advised us that their buyers are sourcing cargo from some other place," said Fidan, who works with traders who buy US resins and sell them around the world.Global shift in US resin exports[caption caption="Click to enlarge" align="right"][/caption]While the oil price drop could cut US resin exports, the "phase one" trade deal between the US and China signed in January could pave the way for some resurgence in US resin exports to China.The nearly two-year trade war between the US and China that began in 2018 included several waves of US tariffs on imports from China, and counter tariffs placed on US-made goods, including on resins. Under the January agreement, China agreed to cut its tariff on US exports of the resin polyethylene from 30 percent to 27.5 percent, and the Chinese government later allowed Chinese companies from March 2 to apply for a waiver from the remaining tariffs on polyethylene, according to Chemical Week, a JOC.com sister publication within IHS Markit.Growth in US resin exports was widespread globally, with only two destinations reporting declines in inbound US volume in 2019. China and Hong Kong, which together account for about 13.5 percent of US resin exports, saw imports of US-made resins decline 4.1 percent and 8.7 percent, respectively, according to PIERS.The Chinese tariffs also had a direct impact on resin exports from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which together exported more US resins in 2019 than any US port except Houston. Combined, the two ports accounted for 10.7 percent of US resins exports in 2019, and representatives of both ports told JOC.com the tariffs contributed to the 1.5 percent drop in resin exports to 94,145 TEU in 2019, as reported by PIERS.Marcel van Dijk, marketing manager at the Port of Los Angeles, said that although volume of resins exported to China declined, those losses were offset in large part by "a huge increase in resin exports to Southeast Asia in 2019."Resin exports increased to the remainder of the 20 largest importers of US resins, in most cases by double digits, PIERS figures show. The largest proportional increases in the import of US-made resin occurred in Malaysia, where volumes skyrocketed 185 percent to 38,628 TEU in 2019. US resin exports to Vietnam surged 118.7 percent to 19,966 TEU, and Singapore experienced a 49.7 percent increase in imports of US resins to 9,639 TEU. All three are emerging economies that either import resins to meet growing domestic demand or import them for supply to other Asian countries, Morales said, adding that this growth was likely unrelated to the US-China trade war.Exports of US resins to Belgium, the second-largest importer of US resins and a gateway to Europe for US producers, increased 23.9 percent year over year to 69,504 TEU in 2019, as producers sought to sell more there to make up for the decline in Chinese exports, Morales said.Contact Hugh R.

Trump Administration Appears To Have Stalled On Punishing China - Here's What They Have And Haven't Done So FarThe Daily CallerMay 18, 2020 Monday 12:45 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 906 wordsByline: Christian Datoc, Senior White House Correspondent, christian@dailycaller.comBodyLink to ImagePresident Donald Trump has promised for weeks to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for its role in allowing coronavirus to spread across the globe, but he has yet to invoke options often reported as being considered for punishing China.The administration has, however, moved against China in three distinct ways.The first involves the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), a pension fund for government employees. Trump and Department of Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia directed the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, which oversees TSP, “to immediately halt all steps associated with investing” assets in Chinese companies. The move would block more than $40 billion from being invested in China.Link to ImageWASHINGTON, DC - MAY 17: US President Donald Trump talks to the media after landing on the south lawn of the White House on May 17, 2020 in Washington, DC. Asked by the media if he had seen President Obama's graduation remarks the night before, Trump said he had not and added, “...he was an incompetent president, that's all I can say.” (Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)The second action centered around Chinese technology company Huawei, a longtime target of the administration. This past Friday, the Department of Commerce announced that all U.S. semiconductor manufacturers must obtain a specific license to sell equipment to Huawei. The U.S. produces more than half of the global semiconductor equipment, and the move comes on the heels of a March decision to block Huawei's access to U.S.-produced computer chips.Finally, the FBI is actively investigating several hackers backed by the Chinese government for attempting to steal coronavirus vaccine research.“These actors have been observed attempting to identify and illicitly obtain valuable intellectual property (IP) and public health data related to vaccines, treatments, and testing from networks and personnel affiliated with COVID-19-related research,” the FBI said in a statement. “The potential theft of this information jeopardizes the delivery of secure, effective, and efficient treatment options.”Still, Trump has yet to sign an executive order centered on regaining control of the United States' medical supply chain from China, championed by White House Director of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Peter Navarro. Multiple news reports over the past two months have claimed an imminent signing on such an order, with the most recent suggesting this past Friday as a target date, yet one senior White House official told Daily Caller, “no clue,” when asked if Trump will soon take similar executive action.“The Navarro EO has been 'happening' for two months and hasn't seen the light,” the official concluded.A second White House official told Daily Caller that economic uncertainty was forcing the White House to slow play an executive order and would prefer for Congress to take the lead in legislating prospective punishment for China.Link to ImageUS President Donald Trump (L) sits with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (C) and China's President Xi Jinping as they attend a meeting on the digital economy at the G20 Summit in Osaka on June 28, 2019. (JACQUES WITT/AFP via Getty Images)Reporting from Daily Caller and other outlets claimed the White House was weighing several other options for holding China “accountable.” Those options included canceling debt obligations to China, revoking China's sovereign immunity to allow for lawsuits against Beijing, and imposing new tariffs, but administration officials and the president have shot down many of these options. (RELATED: White House Investigating Ways To Hold China 'Accountable' For Coronavirus Spread, Senior Aides Claim)Larry Kudlow and Kevin Hassett, the White House's two top economic advisers, vehemently denied reports that the U.S. could cancel parts of its debt obligations to China.“The full faith and credit of U.S. debt obligations is sacrosanct, and that includes, by the way, maintaining the dollar as the world's reserve currency,” Kudlow said of the idea. Hassett flat out stated the administration would never consider defaulting on any of its debt.Trump himself has also dodged questions on new raising tariffs against China in recent days. Before leaving for Camp David on Friday, he said “I don't want to talk about it,” before adding the Phase 1 U.S.-China trade deal has “lost a little bit of flavor.” Those comments came after the White House recommitted to the Phase 1 deal, despite experts            suggesting that China will not fulfill its purchasing requirements for 2020.“They're a little slow on the commodity purchases. I think that has to do with market and economic conditions,” Kudlow said Friday of China's lower than expected agricultural purchases. “But with respect to the trade deal, it is continuing absolutely.”The Trump administration's most glaring inconsistency on China involves the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the lab facility in Wuhan, China, that some believe to be the origin of coronavirus.Both Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated in April they had seen “conclusive” evidence the virus accidentally leaked out of the lab, but both have since walked back those claims. Trump originally said the administration would release a report on the lab leak theory during the first week of May, yet dodged during an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Sunday when asked if he will release the aforementioned information.Graphic BERLIN, GERMANY - APRIL 26: Street art shows US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping wearing protective mask and kissing at a section of the former Berlin Wall at Mauerpark during the novel coronavirus crisis on April 26, 2020 in Berlin, Germany.

How Chinese people came together when separated by quarantine, creating hope, humor and artThe Conversation - United StatesMarch 18, 2020 Wednesday 12:08 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights ReservedLength: 1008 wordsByline: Belinda Kong, Professor of Asian Studies, Bowdoin CollegeHighlight: The human spirit is tested during difficult times, but a scholar already has found examples of how people found ways to support one another in China. Other countries have shown similar resilience.BodyFear and blame appear to be fast becoming Americans' defining emotions around COVID-19. Headlines seem to offer either worst-case estimates or            government leaders' mutual accusations.Amid the bewildering figures and contradictory political narratives, it is important to recall that numbers and governments are abstractions - whereas people actually live with and through disease. By fixating on the former, we risk losing sight of the human dimensions of epidemic life.As a scholar researching the cultural aspects of the 2003 SARS epidemic, I too initially focused on            geopolitics and biosecurity. But what I discovered in addition - rarely discussed but vitally humanizing - were the vibrant forms of everyday communal life generated by SARS at its very epicenters.Under conditions of obligatory isolation and social distancing, common people invented new kinds of sociality and new genres of epidemic expressions. With COVID-19 now even more than SARS, the Chinese internet and social media offer a cornucopia of examples of epidemic communities brought together by heart, humor and creativity.Pandemic solidarityOne early set of viral videos surfaced in Wuhan just five days into the city's lockdown. On the night of Jan. 27, residents shouted "jiayou" - literally "add oil," meaning "hang in there" or "don't give up" - out their apartment windows, in a spontaneous burst of solidarity. It was a demonstration of collective strength and defiance, of people's refusal to be quelled by the virus and the quarantine, and their desire to cheer each other on.One of these clips, uploaded onto YouTube by the South China Morning Post, has received over a million hits, with netizens from numerous Asian countries echoing "Wuhan jiayou!" in encouragement. Indeed, the refrain has flourished into a rallying cry among an international public on social media, despite the Chinese government's attempts to            co-opt it as a slogan for ethnonational patriotism.Pandemic careThis spirit of reciprocal support extends to the care of animals. The Wuhan lockdown has stranded tens of thousands of residents outside the city, leaving an estimated 50,000 pets trapped in unattended homes. Through social media, some pet owners connected with Lao Mao ("Old Cat"), who heads a team of volunteer animal rescuers in Wuhan. These rescuers now roam the city and sometimes break into deserted homes to            feed abandoned cats and dogs.Outside Hubei, other animal lovers likewise help those stuck inside the province look after their pets at home. These tales of animal caretaking, even in times of human crisis, can usefully offset perceptions of Chinese culture as simply one of cruel and unbridled animal consumption.Another unexpected focal point for communal care is the face mask. Across China, masks have become a powerful vehicle for enacting goodwill, generosity and fellowship during the epidemic. In one viral video from Anhui, an anonymous Good Samaritan was captured on surveillance camera            dropping off 500 masks at a local police station. As he hurried away, two officers ran outside to salute him.This video in turn inspired the Hong Kong-based singer G.E.M. (Gloria Tang/Deng Ziqi) to compose "Angels," a song that garnered            nearly 600,000 hits within the first day of its upload. A tribute to ordinary people's small acts of fortitude and kindness during the outbreak, the music video opens with the Anhui clip and then splices together other moving scenes, including a train employee gifting a mask to an elderly woman passenger and a man distributing free masks to travelers in an airport abroad.Pandemic humorThis creative energy has also spurred China's folk humor culture. In locked-down sites across the country, social media is spawning a new genre of quarantine humor. On Weibo, WeChat and Douyin, memes of quarantine boredom and stir-craziness proliferate. Netizens record themselves singing the lockdown blues by rescripting classic tunes,            fishing from home aquariums,            playing mahjong with plastic bags over their heads,            playing solo mahjong,            playing living-room badminton and            choreographing wacky dance moves.People also showcase their creative flare in donning protective gear and venturing out to neighborhood convenience stores and parks in inflatable costumes of T-Rex dinosaurs,            green aliens and            Christmas trees. When they run out of face masks, some half-jokingly substitute with            bras, sanitary pads, and orange rinds.As Manya Koetse reports from Beijing, these social media trends allow people to "mock neighbors, their friends or family, or even themselves in the extreme and sometimes silly measures they are taking to avoid the coronavirus." But more than mockery, the very sharing of these memes is a constructive and healing social act. In times of high stress and distress, to sustain these virtual communities is to deliver shared recognition, concern and laughter.This is not to say that China's epidemic experience is solely lighthearted or affirming. Yet neither does life at epicenters have to be apocalyptic, defined by epic heroes and villains or horror scenarios of collapse and conflict.Indeed, in other countries that have since become COVID-19 epicenters, social media offer similarly inspiring examples. Frontline health workers in Iran dance in hospital hallways to buoy their patients as well as themselves, and            Italians in lockdown sing from their balconies to boost each other's morale - in turn prompting a string of "Italy jiayou" videos from Chinese netizens.Collectively, these chronicles attest to the idea of pandemic resilience - the possibility that disease outbreaks can be lived through with empathy, ingenuity and sheer human ordinariness.[Get the best of The Conversation, every weekend.Sign up for our weekly newsletter.]Belinda Kong received funding from the NEH and the Andrew W.

GOP memo urges anti-China assault over coronavirusPolitico.comApril 24, 2020 Friday 9:52 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 504 wordsHighlight: The Senate Republican campaign arm distributed the 57-page strategy document to candidates.BodyThe National Republican Senatorial Committee has sent campaigns a detailed, 57-page memo authored by a top Republican strategist advising GOP candidates to address the coronavirus crisis by aggressively attacking China.The memo includes advice on everything from how to tie Democratic candidates to the Chinese government to how to deal with accusations of racism. It stresses three main lines of assault: That China caused the virus "by covering it up," that Democrats are "soft on China," and that Republicans will "push for sanctions on China for its role in spreading this pandemic.""Coronavirus was a Chinese hit-and-run followed by a cover-up that cost thousands of lives," the April 17 memo states.The document urges candidates to stay relentlessly on message against the country when responding to any questions about the virus. When asked whether the spread of the coronavirus is Trump's fault, candidates are advised to respond by pivoting to China. "Don't defend Trump, other than the China Travel Ban - attack China," the memo states.Republicans have indicated they plan to make China a centerpiece of the 2020 campaign. Trump's reelection campaign recently released a web video painting Joe Biden as cozy with the authoritarian country. The pro-Trump super PAC America First Action has launched several TV commercials tying Biden to China.Advisers to the president say polling shows China-focused attacks would be effective, and the reelection campaign has weighed a major TV ad campaign focused on the topic.The NRSC memo shows that Republicans are also eager to make China an issue in down-ballot races. It was distributed by the Senate GOP campaign arm, though it was not explicitly drafted by or for the committee. It was authored by the political consulting firm of Brett O'Donnell, a veteran Republican strategist who has advised Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton. Jesse Hunt, an NRSC spokesman, said: "We routinely send campaigns different documents and sources of information dozens of times per week. That's the role of the party committee, especially in these volatile times." O'Donnell declined to comment.The memo includes guidance on what Republican candidates can say when asked whether blaming China for the pandemic incites racism. Candidates are urged to respond by saying that, "No one is blaming Chinese Americans. This is the fault of the Chinese Communist Party for covering up the virus and lying about its danger. This caused the pandemic and they should be held accountable.""No one has suffered more from the murderous Communist Chinese Party dictatorship than the people of China," the memo adds. "We stand with them against their corrupt government that caused this pandemic."The GOP's planned China-focused assault, however, is complicated by Trump's occasional praise for President Xi Jinping. The liberal organization American Bridge recently launched a commercial which plays a clip of the president praising Xi and declares that Trump "gave China his trust."Load-Date: April 26, 2020End of Document

China, U.S. on 'Brink of New Cold War' Over Coronavirus, Hong Kong: BeijingNewsweek.comMay 25, 2020 Monday 5:44 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 579 wordsByline: Benjamin FearnowHighlight: China and the United States are veering toward a "new Cold War," Beijing's foreign minister warned just one day after Hong Kong protests reignited.BodyChina and the United States are veering toward a "new Cold War," Beijing's foreign minister warned just one day after Hong Kong protests reignited.China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Sunday said "political forces" in the U.S. are influencing the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The communist Chinese government on Friday announced new national security laws aimed to suppress such protests by banning behaviors loosely classified as treason and subversion. Wang chastised U.S. leaders during a press conference during the annual National People's Congress meetings in which Beijing lawmakers addressed their top 2020 concerns: national security issues involving the Hong Kong protests and economic growth in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic."Some political forces in the U.S. are hijacking the China-U.S. relations and pushing our two countries toward a 'new Cold War'," the Chinese foreign minister said. "This dangerous attempt to turn back the wheel of history will undo the fruits of decades of long cooperation between the two peoples."Tensions between the world's two largest economies have increased as the Trump administration has derided China's response to the coronavirus epidemic's origins and the two countries have gone tit-for-tat on business sanctions hampering international trade power. On Sunday, White House National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien said Hong Kong could lose trade status with the U.S. and other worldwide financial hubs if the proposals made by Beijing lawmakers Friday go into effect."I can't see how Hong Kong remains an Asian financial center if the Chinese Communist Party implements its national security law," O'Brien said Sunday on Face the Nation.Wang repeatedly criticized seemingly subversive U.S. political forces of trying to undermine mainland China's rules. Earlier this month, the FBI said it was investigating attempts by Chinese hackers to steal U.S. research into a coronavirus vaccine."China has no intention to change, still less replace, the United States," Wang said before a selected group of journalists. "It's time for the United States to give up its wishful thinking of changing China and stopping 1.4 billion people in their historic march toward modernization ... [American politicians] are taking U.S.-China relations hostage."Wang, who is China's former Ambassador to Japan and director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, continued: "This dangerous attempt to turn back the will of history will undo the fruits of decades-long China-U.S. cooperation, dampen America's own development prospects, and put world stability and prosperity in jeopardy."The rift between the world's most powerful economies has increased global trade speculation the U.S. is inching toward a closer relationship with India. China's state-run Global Times publication ran an editorial Monday saying Western media is amplifying criticism of Beijing's Hong Kong restrictions. The piece said such laws will work under China's controversial "one country, two systems" principle which has unofficially been applied in the past toward Macau, Taiwan and Tibet.Newsweek reached out to the Chinese embassy in Washington for additional details Monday afternoon.Speaking at the opening day of the People's Congress meeting this past week, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said of the proposed anti-democracy protest legislation, ""We will establish sound legal systems and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security."Link to ImageGraphic china us relations cold warANDREA VERDELLI / Stringer/Getty ImagesChina's Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Sunday said "political forces" in the U.S. are influencing the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.Load-Date: May 29, 2020End of Document

Rep. Smith: China's Continued DeceptionTargeted News ServiceMay 16, 2020 Saturday 8:22 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 888 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Jason Smith, R-Missouri, issued the following Capitol Report column:The Chinese government continues to stall all international efforts to find the origin of the coronavirus. In January, Chinese officials said they were zeroing in on the source of the outbreak and that it was "only a matter of time" before it was identified. Now, nearly four months later, no new information has come out of China and the country is rejecting all calls for an international investigation. From the start, China has tried to shield its communist government from any responsibility for the coronavirus pandemic they've caused. First, they claimed that the virus was brought to Wuhan by U.S. soldiers, which has been dismissed as pure fiction by scientists and the rest of the international community. Now, it appears they have spent more time destroying evidence than sharing their scientific findings. Perhaps that is why they have continued to look to the United States for answers, most recently without our permission.Just this week, in a stunning move, U.S. investigators released a statement detailing how Chinese hackers have been targeting American universities, pharmaceutical, and other health-care organizations to steal intellectual property related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines. They concluded that "the potential theft of this information jeopardizes the delivery of secure, effective, and efficient treatment options." Unfortunately, this is just the latest action by China during this crisis that threatens the health and safety of the American people. China's desperation to find an actual cure to this disease has gotten so bad they are now undermining their own claims of self-sufficiency. Instead of relying on their own "experts" to find a solution to the problem they've created, they've resorted to something they've done for years: steal from the genius of American innovation. This desperate act proves to the world that China's counterfeit achievements will never beat America's authentic innovation, growth, and development.Thankfully, unlike previous administrations that turned a blind eye towards China, President Trump has been committed to holding the communist regime accountable for their deception and destruction. When China threatened to stop shipping medical supplies to the United States, President Trump continued to stand strong. He invoked the Defense Production Act to ensure ventilators, masks, and other crucial supplies were being produced in America. He also brought China back to the negotiating table, securing a deal to rebalance our trading relationship that includes $80 billion in U.S. agriculture purchases over two years, a major victory for farmers in southern Missouri. This week, to support the President's efforts and our farmers in southern Missouri, I led lawmakers on the U.S. House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee in calling for China to comply with their agricultural purchases agreed to in the Phase One agreement. The Ways and Means Committee is the only committee in the U.S. House of Representatives that has oversight of our nation's trade policies, and I have used my position on the full committee and its trade subcommittee to be actively involved in advising the Trump Administration on these negotiations.Yet, while I've been working with the Trump Administration to strengthen America's position against China, Speaker Pelosi refused to join us and instead wasted months on fabricated investigations to impeach Donald Trump. Now, given another opportunity to hold China accountable, she has decided to hold a vote on her $3 trillion wish list legislation that has no chance of becoming law. Worse, instead of including pro-growth policies to help hardworking families get back on the path to achieving the American Dream and reopening the country, she stuffed her bill full of proposals to stifle innovation and grow the government's control of people's lives. She's wasting tens of millions of dollars alone on a pointless study investigating global warming's impact on the coronavirus. Whether it's expanding unemployment benefits to keep people from returning to work, propping up failed Obamacare policies, allowing the federal government to permanently control all elections, or providing a get-out-of-jail-free card for convicts, this bill undermines the values of the people of southern Missouri who respect the individual rights and freedoms that the United States was founded upon and of which our Constitution and the Bill of Rights safeguard.In southern Missouri, we protect the individual's ability to decide their own destiny and their ability to work hard to make a future. Unfortunately, while these used to be timeless values that were shared by all Americans, the radical Left in this country has sought to undermine the American people's faith in our unalienable rights given to us by God. Whether it's working with the Trump Administration to hold China accountable or working against the Establishment and liberals in the U.S. Congress, I'm honored to be fighting for limited government and our individual liberty to allow southern Missouri families to control their own destiny. I'm proud and glad to live in a state that still cherishes and honors those sacred values.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7115425 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 16, 2020End of Document

President of US-China Business Council explains impact of coronavirus, trade war at Duke summitThe Duke Chronicle: Duke UniversityMarch 3, 2020 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 811 wordsByline: Chris KuoBodyWhat happens when you bring a former rock band guitarist together with a former U.S. ambassador?Duke's China-U.S. summit did just that, organizing a spotlight conversation Feb. 29 between Kaiser Kuo, former member of the rock band Tang Dynasty and current host of the Sinica Podcast, and Craig B. Allen, former U.S. Ambassador to Brunei Darussalam and current President of the U.S.-China Business Council. In a live recording of a Sinica episode, Kuo interviewed Allen regarding recent developments in the global economy and U.S.-China trade relations.COVID-19, the novel coronavirus that has wreaked havoc in China and has begun to infect other parts of the globe, loomed large over the conversation. Allen acknowledged the unpredictability of the virus's long-term effect on the global economy."I don't know what will happen in Korea. I don't know what's going to happen in Nigeria. I don't know what's going to happen," he said. "This is not only a China issue anymore."The speakers also examined the current economic impact of the global pandemic on both the demand and supply sides of the international market. On the demand side, the coronavirus has dampened confidence and stifled demand, particularly in the tourism and retail sectors.According to Allen, the coronavirus has also disrupted the supply chain for many companies, causing warehouse closures, borders tightening and more red tape for businesses wanting to reopen.Commenting on the Trump Administration's response to the coronavirus's arrival on U.S. soil, Allen urged caution given the complexity of dealing with such a novel threat. He paraphrased a line from the ancient Chinese military handbook, "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu: "If you know your enemy and you know yourself, you'll win a hundred battles."In our fight against the coronavirus, "we don't know the enemy," he said.But Allen also emphasized that the situation provides a chance for the global community to join hands."This is an opportunity for robust U.S.-China cooperation for the benefit of both of our peoples," Allen said. "Let us seize it."The speakers also discussed the fallout of the U.S.-China trade war that arose after the Trump administration imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, provoking retaliatory measures from the Chinese.They described the effects of this trade conflict as "decoupling": reduced interdependence between the two countries, as evidenced by a 17% decline in U.S. exports to China and an 80% decrease in Chinese investment in the U.S., Allen said. In the wake of reduced imports from the United States into China, European and Japanese investors swooped in to capture the market demand, as seen in a 20% increase in their exports to China.Get The Chronicle straight to your inboxSignup for our editorially curated, weekly newsletter. Cancel at any time.Despite these costs, both Kuo and Allen recognized that problems in U.S.-China economic relations had begun to fester long before the outbreak of the trade war. These issues derived in part from the changing dynamics between the countries."The China we knew 20 years ago is not the China that we face today," Allen said. He described the Great Recession of 2008 as a turning point in which China recognized its ascendance in the world economy.Allen spoke of how in 2008 Wang Qishan, China's current vice president, had said to Hank Paulson, then U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, "You were my teacher...we aren't sure we should be learning from you anymore."Since then, China has often diverged from global norms established in the World Trade Organization, creating challenges for American companies seeking a presence in China. Such companies, particularly those in the technology sector, deal with problems of intellectual property theft and have to compete with state-owned, subsidized companies.As a result, American companies have expressed frustration over the lack of a "level playing field" for their businesses, Allen explained. The Trump Administration's tariff policy was intended to coerce China into creating a trade agreement that would level that playing field.It has succeeded in doing so, at least in part. Kuo and Allen discussed the recent Phase One trade agreement that Chinese and U.S. officials signed on Jan. 15. Although Allen described the agreement's benefits for financial and agricultural sectors, he also acknowledged "thorny" issues such as the Chinese government's subsidization of companies and its technology policy that will have to be thrashed out in a Phase Two agreement.Ultimately, he said, a recoupling between China and U.S. on trade will require officials to navigate a "complex chess board" involving bilateral, multilateral and regional cooperation.K. J. Chen, a senior in Pratt, said the discussion provided him with information that will guide him as he chooses whether to start a business in China or the U.S.Load-Date: March 3, 2020End of Document

US STATE DEPARTMENT URGED TO INTERVENE IN CASE OF UYGHUR JAILED AFTER JOINING VISITOR PROGRAMStates News ServiceMay 18, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1468 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The U.S. State Department is facing increasing calls to pressure China to release a Uyghur entrepreneur who was sentenced to 15 years in prison after he visited Washington to take part in the agency's International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP).Ekpar Asat, a 34-year-old businessman who created a successful Uyghur social media platform called Bagdax, traveled to the U.S. in February 2016 to join a three-week journalism training as part of his acceptance to the IVLP, which he had applied to at the encouragement of the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.While engaged with the IVLP, which the State Department says has trained more than 225,000 foreign nationals since it was established in 1940, Asat and eight others met with a number of journalists at several institutions in Washington and five U.S. states.He also met with his older sister, 36-year-old Reyhan Asat, who was finishing a Master of Laws program at Harvard Universitythe first Uyghur to study law at the school. She said that he had been inspired by the IVLP and had secured a visa to return with their parents in May of that year to watch her graduate and stay for the summer.However, weeks after Ekpar Asat returned home to Urumqi, the capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), his family canceled their planned trip to the U.S. and he went missing in April.It was only in January this year that the Chinese Embassy in Washington acknowledged that Ekpar Asat had been sentenced to 15 years in prison on charges of "inciting ethnic hatred" after Ambassador Cui Tiankai was sent a bipartisan letter from seven U.S. lawmakers on Reyhan Asat's behalf, urging China to release him.Reyhan Asat told RFA's Uyghur Service that while her brother is innocent of the charges against him, even if he had "incited ethnic hatred" a normal sentence would have been three years in prison, while a maximum punishment would carry 10 years."This doesn't even follow their own law ... A 15-year sentence doesn't make sense here," she said.Instead, Reyhan Asat believes her brother, who she said regularly worked to improve ties between Uyghurs and majority Han Chinese, was targeted for taking part in the IVLP.'Unable to verify'The State Department must take a more active role in securing Ekpar Asat's release, she added, suggesting that the agency should be raising the profiles of program participants as added protection for their well-being if they risk persecution back home."I hope that the State Department puts my brother's case on their agenda and that they invite [Cui Tiankai] to discuss his immediate release," she said."What I mean to say is that they must join Congress and we must work quickly to save my brother. The State Department must take immediate responsibility for its own role in this."In a recent statement, State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said her agency is "closely tracking" Ekpar Asat's case, adding that it had "raised his case directly" with the Chinese government and "will continue to do so.""Unfortunately, due to tight [People's Republic of China] controls on information, we have been unable to independently verify his current status and whereabouts, but we consistently press the PRC for this information whenever we raise his case," she said.She also urged Beijing to "immediately release all those arbitrarily detained" in the XUAR, including an estimated 1.8 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities believed to have been detained in a vast network of some 1,300 internment camps in the region since April 2017.While Beijing initially denied the existence of the camps, China last year changed tack and began describing the facilities as "boarding schools" that provide vocational training for Uyghurs, discourage radicalization, and help protect the country from terrorism.But reporting by RFA and other media outlets indicate that those in the camps are detained against their will and subjected to political indoctrination, routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers and endure poor diets and unhygienic conditions in the often-overcrowded facilities.While Ortagus did not comment on Ekpar Asat's participation in the IVLP or whether it could be the reason he was targeted, other State Department officials have made the claim that there is no direct evidence that taking part in the program directly led to his disappearance.Ekpar Asat is not the first Uyghur to have disappeared after participating in activities organized by the State Department. Ababekri Muhtar, founder of the Misranim website, was also imprisoned in April 2016 after meeting with then-U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke during Locke's 2014 visit to the XUAR and later visiting the U.S. on a two-week tour set up by the agency.Urgent action appealLast week, London-based rights group Amnesty International issued an "urgent action" appeal to Chinese President Xi Jinping on Ekpar Asat's behalf, calling for his immediate and unconditional release and, pending his release, urging authorities to allow him access to his family and a lawyer of his choice.Francisco Bencosme, director for Amnesty's Asia-Pacific advocacy, told RFA the Uyghur entrepreneur had been "doing what he was supposed to do" and generally displaying loyalty to the Chinese government."But it seems like the only thing he did wrong was participate in the State Department International Visitor Leadership Program, which should not be reason enough for him to go missing and for him to be sentenced as unjustly as he did," he said."And obviously, he's still missing, and it's heartbreaking to see his family still asking for his release. It's clear that it's part of a larger campaign against Uyghurs and other ethnic Muslims by the Chinese government."Bencosme said Amnesty is concerned that Ekpar Asat was sentenced secretly and that he was targeted despite being "a model citizen.""Given that he is an alumni of the IVLP program, and also that it's part of a larger serious concern and human rights issue that's going on in China, his case and all the other cases need to be elevated at the highest levels of the State Departmentit should be at the forefront of our U.S.-China policy," he said."It's not just the State Departmentit also needs to be elevated by the White House, all the way to the top. The President of the United States needs to raise this with President Xi, because nobody should be arbitrarily detained or lack justice simply for participating in a cultural exchange program."'Take responsibility'Washington-based Uyghur attorney Nury Turkel told RFA that if Ekpar Asat's case goes unresolved, it would amount to a stain on the IVLP, adding that the onus is on the State Department to secure his release."Now it's understood that there's a relationship between Ekbar Asat's case and the U.S. State Department, and it's the first such case for which there is proof," he said."If the U.S. government had not brought this man here, it's possible to say that he might not have been imprisoned. If the State Department were to take responsibility and try to resolve this, if they were to have the intention to resolve this, if nothing else they should be able to get him out of prison."Mass incarcerations in the XUAR, as well as other policies seen to violate the rights of Uyghurs and other Muslims, have led to increasing calls by U.S. officials to hold Beijing accountable for its actions in the region, including from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, and several lawmakers.Last week, the U.S. Senate passed the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020 that would sanction Chinese government officials responsible for arbitrary incarceration, forced labor and other abuses in the XUAR and requires regular monitoring of the situation there by U.S. government bodies, once signed into law by President Donald Trump.U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, the author of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act in the House of Representatives, said he was seeking quick passage of the bill, which he called "an important bipartisan statement recognizing that the mass surveillance and internment of Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities is unconscionable and we cannot be silent when faced with such horrific atrocities.""The situation in the Xinjiang region has become even more dire since the legislation was first introduced, with systematic forced labor now allowing the Chinese government and companies to profit from mass detention. If we are truly committed to stopping these atrocities, passing this legislation has to be a starting point, not our last word or action," he told RFA.Reported by Jilil Kashgary and Alim Seytoff for RFA's Uyghur Service.

Ex-White House Drug Spokesman Bob Weiner: China Must Prove Virus Didn't Start In Wuhan Lab Or Shut It Down; 2000 Viruses Being Studied at Wuhan Lab. Which Could Be Next, Weiner Asks on John Fredericks Radio ShowPR NewswireMay 6, 2020 Wednesday 5:00 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 627 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON, May 6, 2020 BodyPR Newswire In a radio interview Tuesday on the John Fredericks Show, former White House Drug Spokesman Robert Weiner asserted, "China must prove the Covid-19 virus didn't start in its Wuhan lab or shut it down."Weiner, who issued a statement with senior policy analyst Ben Lasky, asked Fredericks, "With 2000 viruses being studied at the Wuhan lab, which could be the next to escape or be released?"Link to show:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDcILUZfjPIWeiner said, "When addressing rumors that Coronavirus started in a Chinese biolab, Four-Star Gen. Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, "US intelligence is taking 'a hard look.'" Now, President Trump and Secretary of State Pompeo are saying U.S, Intelligence is investigating the Wuhan lab as the possible source of Covid-19.Weiner pointed out that the Washington Times reported on March 30 that the Wuhan, China biolab had isolated more than 2,000 new viruses, including Covid-19. Weiner said, "It turns out that the Wuhan Institute of Virology is 1/4 mile from the 'wet market' that US Intelligence earlier believed began the virus.  The Chinese removed pages from its website linking its researchers to studying the virus."  While President Trump said, "We are investigating." and "I'm not happy with China," he also said he expects the $250 billion recent US-China trade deal to succeed. Weiner told Fredericks, "The situation reminds us of fears after 9/11 over possibility of a Chinese, Russian, or other country's biological 'dirty bomb' that could slowly envelope the West.  Milley on April 14 said it's likely 'natural. Trump since said he thinks it's a "horrible mistake."  Weiner points out, "The Chinese government has shown they are not open with anything critical."Weiner asserted. "If they need to temporarily shut down the Wuhan lab and announce it to give the world peace of mind, so be it. Are three million cases and 200,000 deaths so far, not far worse than even Russia's Chernobyl, which AEA said caused 4000 deaths and the Russians shut down?""It's not about politics. Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives must admit that Trump's signature issue from before his presidential campaign has been forcing China into the open and stopping their campaigns against Western trade, intellectual property—and safety.  Democrats since Richard Gephardt's presidential campaign of 2004 have crusaded against the Chinese economic and safety assaults on the U.S.Weiner added, "Trump is not wrong that the World Health Organization (WHO) stuck with Chinese propaganda that Coronavirus is not dangerous." On January 14, the WHO tweeted, "Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission."  Weiner pointed out that "Trump, Dr. Anthony Fauci of NIH and many others believed the WHO at the outset."Weiner concluded, "The U.S. and all nations must join to persuade China to mandate facts and protect the world's health. If powerful tools including trade and even military operations like ship and air movements over Asia's oceans are needed, now is the time.""How safe do we now feel with 2000 viruses being studied with no world oversight in the Wuhan lab? Which virus is next?"

The origin of the virus? China denies to be the epicenter and suggests other theoriesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 13, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 650 wordsBodyThe Chinese government quarantined the city of Wuhan because of the COVID-19 epidemic, but claims that the new coronavirus does not necessarily come from China, and does not hesitate to draw inspiration from plotist theories.Having recorded more than 80,000 pollution and 3,000 deaths on its territory since December, China has for several weeks seen a sharp setback of the epidemic, which has spread instead to more than a hundred countries, where it has left 1,700 Deaths.The communist regime, initially accused of delaying reacting to the epidemic, now counterattacks by implying -- without scientific evidence -- that the coronavirus could be of foreign origin."It may have been the U.S. military that brought the epidemic to Wuhan," a spokesman for Chinese Foreign Ministry Zhao Lijian said on Twitter on Thursday night."America must be transparent! And you must publish your data! America owes us an explanation," he added.Zhao is not based on any scientific study. On Friday, he simply tweeted links to two articles on the Global Research website, known for spreading thesis plotists.Chinese sourceHowever, Beijing had clearly designated a Wuhan market earlier this year as the cradle of the epidemic, when the virus would have been transmitted from one animal species to another, before contaminating man."We now know that live animals sold in a fish market are the source of the virus," said at the end of January, the head of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, following the quarantine of Wuhan.The virus responsible for COVID-19 "was unknown before the outbreak that began in Wuhan in December 2019," recalls the World Health Organization (WHO).Genetic analysis of samples from the new coronavirus extracted in several countries reveals a common source in China, Explains to AFP Christel Donnelly, professor of epidemiology at Imperial College London."It's not about accusing a particular country," he says.But for researcher Yun Jiang of Australia's national university, "by sowing doubts in people's minds about the origin of the virus," China "tries to evade responsibility in the epidemic."'Lab Rats'The Chinese authorities have been accused of concealed the epidemic in its early days. Wuhan police actually reprimanded doctors who have been alerted since December.The death of one of these doctors in February spawned an unprecedented movement of social media rage against President Xi Jinping's regime.Weeks later, Zhong Nanshan, one of the country's largest respiratory disease specialists, issued an assumption: "The epidemic made its appearance in China, but it does not necessarily originate in China."This hypothesis has been taken up by Beijing, which even accused Washington and the foreign press of using the term "Chinese virus" to "implyorigin without any foundation or evidence.""Some media outlets want China to take full responsibility," Zhao Lijian said as early as March 4.According to some of the theories circulating on Chinese social media, the U.S. delegation of the World Military Games, an October competition in Wuhan, could have brought the virus to China.In his tweet, Zhao Lijian released a video of the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stating to Congress that some Americans believed to have died of the flu were carriers of the new coronavirus."CDC caught in blatant crime. When did patient zero appear in the United States? How many people have been infected?" wrote Zhao.These theories have a big impact on Chinese social media."Do Americans use the peoples of the world as lab rats for viral biochemistry experiences?" an internet user is questioned on the Weibo network.In Washington, National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien accused China of "losing the world for two months" as it attempts to end the epidemic.Beijing called these words "extraordinarily immoral and irresponsible."(13/03/2020)Load-Date: March 14, 2020End of Document

THE CLOCK IS TICKING: CHINA'S H-20 STEALTH BOMBER IS COMINGStates News ServiceMay 22, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1572 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for the National Interest (former the Nixon Center):Here's What You Need To Remember: The crescendo of publicity surrounding the H-20 indicates the PLAAF believes the plane will soon be ready enough to show to the publicand international audiences. Once revealed, analysts will pour over the aircraft's geometry to estimate just how the stealthy it really is, looking for radar-reflective Achilles' heels such as exposed engine inlets and indiscrete tail stabilizers.In October 2018, Chinese media announced that the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) would publicly unveil its new H-20 stealth bomber during a parade celebrating the air arm's seventieth anniversary in 2019.Prior news of the H-20's development had been teased using techniques pioneered by viral marketing campaigns for Hollywood movies. For example, the Xi'an Aviation Industrial Corporation released a promotional video in May 2018 pointedly imitating Northrop Grumman's own Superbowl ad for the B-21 stealth bomber, portraying a shrouded flying wing bomber in its final seconds. Later, the silhouette of a possible new bomber appeared at a PLAAF gala. This comes only two years after PLAAF Gen. Ma Xiaotian formally revealed the Hong-20's existence.If the H-20 does have the range and passable stealth characteristics attributed to it, it could alter the strategic calculus between the United States and China by exposing U.S. bases and fleets across the Pacific to surprise air attacks.Only three countries have both the imperative and the resources to develop huge strategic bombers that can strike targets across the globe: the United States, Russia and China. Strategic bombers make sense for China because Beijing perceives dominance of the western half of the Pacific Ocean as essential for its security due to its history of maritime invasion, and the challenge posed by the United States in particular. The two superpowers are separated by five to six thousand miles of oceanand the United States has spent the last century developing a network of island territories such as Guam, foreign military bases in East Asia and super-carriers with which it can project air and sea power across that span.Xi'an Aviation, the H-20's manufacturer, also builds China's H-6 strategic jet bombers, a knockoff the 1950s-era Soviet Tu-16 Badger which has recently been upgraded with modern avionics, aerial refueling capability and cruise missiles in the later H-6K and H-6J models. Beijing could easily have produced a successor in a similar vein, basically a giant four-engine airliner-sized cargo plane loaded with fuel and long-range missiles that's never intended to get close enough for adversaries to shoot back.Recommended: What Will the Sixth-Generation Jet Fighter Look Like?Recommended: Imagine a U.S. Air Force That Never Built the B-52 BomberRecommended: Russia's Next Big Military Sale - To Mexico?Recommended: Would China Really Invade Taiwan?Alternately, analyst Andreas Rupprecht reported that China considered developing a late-Cold War style supersonic bomber akin to the U.S. B-1 or Russian Tu-160 called the JH-XX. This would have lugged huge bombloads at high speed and low altitude, while exhibiting partial stealth characteristics for a marginal improvement in survivability. However, such an approach was already considered excessively vulnerable to modern fighters and air defense by the late twentieth century. A Chinese magazine cover sported a concept image of the JH-XX in 2013, but the project appears to have been set aside for now.Instead, in the PLAAF elected to pursue a more ambitious approach: a slower but far stealthier flying wing like the U.S. B-2 and forthcoming B-21 Raider. A particular advantage of large flying wings is they are less susceptible to detection by low-bandwidth radar, such as those on the Navy's E-2 Hawkeye radar planes, which are effective at detecting the approach of smaller stealth fighters.While China's development of stealth aircraft technology in the J-20 and J-31 stealth fighter was an obvious prerequisite for the H-20 project, so apparently was Xi'an's development of the hulking Y-20 'Chubby Girl' cargo plane, which established the company's capability to build large, long-range aircraft using modern computer-aided design and manufacturing techniquesprecision technology essential for mass producing the exterior surfaces of stealth aircraft.According to a study by Rick Joe at The Diplomat, Chinese publications began speculating about the H-20 in the early 2010s. Postulated characteristics include four non-afterburning WS-10A Taihang turbofans sunk into the top of the wing surface with S-shaped saw-toothed inlets for stealth. It's worth noting that the WS-10 has been plagued by major problems, but that hasn't stopped China from manufacturing fighters using WS-10s, with predictably troubled results.The new strategic bomber is expected to have a maximum un-refueled combat radius exceeding 5,000 miles and payload between the H-6's ten tons and the B-2's twenty-three tons. This is because the H-20 is reportedly designed to strike targets beyond the "second island ring" (which includes U.S. bases in Japan, Guam, the Philippines, etc.) from bases on mainland China. The third island chain extends to Hawaii and coastal Australia.In a U.S.-China conflict, the best method for neutralizing U.S. air power would be to destroy it on the ground (or carrier deck), especially in the opening hours of a war. While ballistic missiles and H-6 bombers can already contribute to this with long-range missiles, these are susceptible to detection and interception given adequate forewarning. A stealth bomber could approach much closer to carrier task forces and air bases before releasing its weapons, giving defenses too little time to react. An initial strike might in fact focus on air defense radars, "opening the breach" for a follow up wave of less stealthy attacks.The H-20 will also likely be capable of carrying nuclear weapons, finally giving China a full triad of nuclear-capable submarines, ballistic missiles and bombers. Though the H-6 was China's original nuclear bomber, these are no longer configured for nuclear strike, though that could change if air-launched nuclear-tipped cruise or ballistic missile are devised. Beijing is nervous that the United States' limited ballistic missile defense capabilities might eventually become adequate for countering China's small ICBM and SLBM arsenal. The addition of a stealth bomber would contribute to China's nuclear deterrence by adding a new, difficult-to-stop vector of nuclear attack that the U.S. defenses aren't designed to protect against.Some Chinese publications also argue that the H-20 will do double-duty as a networked reconnaissance and command and control platform similar to U.S. F-35 stealth fighters. This would make sense, as China has developed a diverse arsenal of long-range air-, ground- and sea-launched missiles, but doesn't necessarily have a robust reconnaissance network to form a kill-chain cueing these missiles to distant targets. Theoretically, an H-20 could rove ahead, spying the position of opposing sea-based assets using a low-probability-of-intercept AESA radar, and fuse that information to a firing platform hundreds or even thousands of miles away. The H-20 could also be used for electronic warfare or to deploy specialized directed energy.The crescendo of publicity surrounding the H-20 indicates the PLAAF believes the plane will soon be ready enough to show to the publicand international audiences. Once revealed, analysts will pour over the aircraft's geometry to estimate just how the stealthy it really is, looking for radar-reflective Achilles' heels such as exposed engine inlets and indiscrete tail stabilizers. However, external analysis cannot provide a full assessment, because the quality of the radar-absorbent materials applied to surfaces, and the finesse of the manufacturing (avoiding seams, protruding screws, etc.) has a major impact on radar cross-section.It is worth bearing in mind, however, that an H-20 seeking to slip through the gauntlet of long-range search radars scattered across the Pacific to launch CJ-10K cruise missiles with a range of over nine hundred miles would not require the same degree of stealth as an F-35 intended to penetrate more densely defended airspace and launch small diameter bombs with a range of 70 miles.Analysts forecast the H-20's first flight in the early 2020s, with production possibly beginning around 2025. If the H-20 is judged to be of credible design, the Pentagon in turn will have to factor the strategic implications of China's stealth capabilities, and will likely seek to field implement counter-stealth technologies which formerly have been mostly vaunted by Russia and China. The publicity which the often-secretive Chinese government is according the H-20 also indicates Beijing's hope the bomber will serve as a strategic deterrent to foreign adversarieseven before its first flight.Sebastien Roblin holds a master's degree in Conflict Resolution from Georgetown University and served as a university instructor for the Peace Corps in China.

Trump threatens to break ties with China over pandemic and rules out talking to XiCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 14, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 512 wordsBodyU.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday hardened his rhetoric against China by claiming that he will not speak to his counterpart Xi Jinping and threatening to cut bilateral ties, because of the way Beijing handled the Covid-19 pandemic.Tensions between the world's largest powers skyrocketed at the expense of the coronavirus pandemic, which Trump has described as a "Chinese plague.""I have a very good relationship (with Xi), but it's just that right now I don't wantto talk to him," Trump told Fox Business, saying he's "very disappointed" by The Chinese pandemic management.Asked whether the United States could retaliate, Trump gave no details but warned in a threatening tone: "There are many things we could do. We could do things. We could cut off every relationship.""If we did, what could happen?" said Trump. "We'd save 500 billion if we cut the whole relationship."Tensions between the United States and China have escalated in recent weeks due to exchanges of accusations about the origin of the new coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed the lives of 300,000 people.Trump has said Beijing covered up the true scale of the outbreak, which originated in late 2019 in the city of Wuhan in central China, allowing its spread.The Asian giant's government denies that accusation, and insists it transmitted as much information available to the World Health Organization as soon as it could.Trump insisted on his accusations during the interview with Fox. "Everything came from China and they should have stopped it," he said."It's very sad what happened in the world and in our country with all those deaths," he added.Accusations of hackingThe U.S.-China pandemic fight raises questions about the partial trade agreement reached in January, which established a truce in its tariff war.Earlier in the week, Trump ruled out renegotiating the deal after press reports that indicated that China wanted to reopen the deals.On Friday, China's chief negotiator, Liu He, spoke on the phone with his US peers and then said that both sides agreed to implement the first phase of the agreement.But the war of words is simmered. U.S. officials stoke the fire by saying Chinese hackers are trying to seed data on coronavirus treatments and vaccines. They also warned that this attempt involves groups and individuals related to the Chinese government.The FBI and federal cybersecurity agency said China's efforts pose a "significant threat" to the U.S. response to Covid-19 when dozens of companies, institutes and governments around the world are running in search of developing a vaccine.Beijing rejects the signs and believes that they are looking to soil the game at a time when he denied the US accusation that the coronavirus arose in a Wuhan lab.Asked by Fox Business about the reasons for that accusation, Trump was less categorical than other times and even seemed to mitigate it."We have a lot of information and it's not good. But, you know, whatworst of all, whether it came out of a lab or a bat, it's that it came from China and they have to stop it," he said.Load-Date: May 15, 2020End of Document

What does Trump's executive order propose for social media?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 29, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1335 wordsBody       President Trump issued an executive order to end censorship on social media.President Donald Trump signed an executive order to prevent social media from violaging the first amendment to the Constitution, given the censorship enhanced during the coronavirus pandemic and even accused Twitter's partisan bias in favoring the Chinese communist regime throughout the health crisis."Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube wield immense, if unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; censoring, deleting or disappearing information; and to control what people see or don't see," the representative says.He accuses this practice as "fundamentally anti-American and undemocratic" and that "we cannot allow a limited number of online platforms to choose by hand the speech that Americans can access and transmit on the Internet."Because they "exercise dangerous power," Trump says they stop functioning as passive bulletin boards and should be viewed and treated as content creators.The measure has sparked controversy as an executive order is signed by decree, without the endorsement of Parliament, circumventing the division of powers. In addition, the president is getting into private enterprise policies. However, executive orders are supported for major issues that require immediate resolution. In the middle of election year, Trump considers this to be the case given that the thoroughness of social media censorship operates in a discriminatory manner and alleges that the Internet now occupies the place of the public square, so censorship involves silencing people.Trump's executive order would sue social mediaThe federal law that Trump wants to amend section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, also known as "the 26 words that created the Internet".As reported by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Section 230 protects free expression of the Internet and states that: "No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or spokesperson for any information provided by any other content provider". I mean, they weren't subject to lawsuits. This would change with Trump's executive order.Through the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the executive order requests to examine whether editions made by companies cause them to lose protection under section 230.In the event that civilians want to denounce censorship, the executive order calls for the creation of a tool by the White House's digital strategy division. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) would be in charge of the review and the White House division would be in charge of monitoring the allegations and creating observation lists.Twitter now reflects 'political bias'It is possible to read the full executive order on the prevention of online censorship on the official website of the White House, This document states:Section 1. Policy. Freedom of expression is the foundation of American democracy. Our Founding Fathers protected this sacred right with the First Amendment to the Constitution. The freedom to express and discuss ideas is the basisof all our rights as free people.The Chair affirmed his commitment to free and open debate on the Internet. Such a debate is as important online as it is in universities, town halls and homes. It is essential to sustain our democracy, it says in the text.It is insisted that online platforms are participating in selective censorship that is harming our national discourse. "Tens of thousands of Americans have reported, among other problematic behaviors, that online platforms 'mark' content as inappropriate, even though it does not violate any of the established terms of service; make unenforceable and unexplained changes to company policies that have the effect of disadvantage certain views; and delete entire content and accounts without warning, without justification and without recourse," he adds."Twitter now selectively decides to place a warning tag on certain tweets in a way that clearly reflects political bias," he exclaims.In fact, after issuing the executive order, Twitter censored a Trump post, claiming it glorifies violence. As a result, no one can comment or like its publication indicating "where there will be looting" with respect to the protests in Minneapolis. The news was issued by a reporter from The Wall Street Journal who calls it "unprecedented" to hide what the representative said.Twitter has taken the unprecedented step of hiding a tweet from a head of state, for violating its policy against glorifying violence.This means the tweet from @realDonaldTrump cannot be liked, retweeted or replied tohttps://t.co/WEncT3lLre— X'A-Xii Mims (@mims) May 29, 2020Previously Trump had been censored but otherwise. When he commented unfavorably about the vote by mail Twitter added a warning below the post. Which triggered the issuance of the executive order.Apparently, Twitter has never put that label on another politician's tweet, Trump claims in the recent executive order. He quotes that just last week Democratic MP Adam Schiff was still misleading his supporters by talking about the alleged collusion with Russia, and Twitter did not score those tweets.Trump directly incredulous the Twitter director, claiming he has bragged about his political bias in his own tweets.Trump accuses Twitter being functional to China's communist regimeMoreover, Trump accuses the platform of promoting aggression and misinformation spread by foreign governments such as China. A U.S. company, for example, created a search engine for the Chinese Communist Party that would have blacklisted "human rights" searches, hid unfavorable data against the regime, and tracked down users who were determined appropriate for surveillance.It also established research associations in China that provide direct benefits to china's Army. He reports that other companies have accepted advertisements paid by the Chinese government that spread false information about the massive imprisonment of religious minorities by the communist regime, therefore allowing human rights abuses.It claims that they have also expanded China's propaganda abroad, including by allowing communist government officials to use their platforms to spread misinformation about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and undermining pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.This is not the first time the Trump administration has had a cross between social media directors. In July 2019 Republican Senator JoshHawley suggested an end to the automatic immunity of tech companies. Representatives from Google, Facebook and Twitter testified during a hearing. While acknowledging that their respective companies had made mistakes about published content, they said they do not censor content for political beliefs.On May 27 this year, Facebook ceo Mark Zuckerberg said he disagreed with Twitter and his decision to tag the president's tweets. "I firmly believe that private companies shouldn't be the arbiter of the truth of everything people say online," he said in an interview with Fox News.Twitter executive chairman Jack Dorsey responded to Trump's criticism that same day through a series of tweets, claiming that he is solely responsible for the company's decisions.As tension grows on U.S. streets, the country with the most reported COVID-19 cases in the world, how social media information is approached is defined by the dispute, what truly violates freedom of expression, government regulation of social media, or censorship of platform owners?When we started the PanAm Post to try to bring the truth about Latin America to the rest of the world, we knew it would be a big challenge.

Chinese investment in US drops to lowest level since 2009Associated Press Financial WireMay 11, 2020 Monday 4:27 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 328 wordsByline: By PAUL WISEMAN, AP Economics WriterDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - China's direct investment in the United States fell last year to its lowest level since the Great Recession, even before the coronavirus pandemic shut down much of global commerce.The decline in Beijing's investment in the United States reflected tensions between the world's two biggest economies and Chinese government restrictions on overseas investment.A report out Monday from the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations and the Rhodium Group consultancy found that China's direct investment in the U.S. dropped from $5.4 billion in 2018 to $5 billion last year, the lowest level since the recession year of 2009. Direct investment includes mergers, acquisitions and investments in things like offices and factories but not financial investments like purchases of stocks and bonds.The report found that Chinese direct investment in the United States virtually vanished - to $200 million - from January-March this year as the coronavirus pandemic hammered the world economyU.S. investment in China ticked up last year - to $14 billion from $13 billion in 2018. But that increase largely reflected previously announced projects, including Tesla's factory in Shanghai.Two-way investment between the United States and China fell to a seven-year low, the report found.U.S. regulators, worried that China will gain access to sensitive American technology, have been taking a harder look at Chinese investment in the United States, a shift mandated by a 2018 law.The two countries have also sparred over U.S. charges that China uses abusive tactics, including forcing foreign companies to hand over trade secrets and outright cyber-theft, in its effort to surpass American technological dominance. President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on about $360 billion worth of Chinese goods.The Trump administration and Beijing reached an interim trade agreement in January intended to ease the tension. But the pact was quickly overtaken by the pandemic.Load-Date: May 12, 2020End of Document

Asian Americans experience increased xenophobia, racism in light of coronavirusThe Maneater: University of Missouri - ColumbiaApril 30, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: CAMPUS; Pg. 1Length: 533 wordsByline: Hannah NortonBodyOver the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, Asian Americans have experienced a continuous uptick in xenophobia and violence.Xenophobia is the "fear and hatred of strangers or foreigners or of anything that is strange or foreign," according to Merriam-Webster. It is not a new problem, but reported cases of xenophobia have increased dramatically as the coronavirus spreads.Zach Deng is a senior studying strategic communication.Deng works at Rollins Dining. When he returned to campus after winter break, Deng said he saw an immediate change in his coworkers' attitudes after they learned he had been in China and Thailand.Deng assured his coworkers he was safe and healthy, as was his family. But he still felt out of place at work."You can see their faces [that they] are very just trying to stay away from [me] or they're very suspicious about me and about everything," Deng said. "So that's the first time I felt very uncomfortable, because I really thought I fit in so well."Deng felt that even around close friends, he might be judged for his race. He was invited to a friend's party the next day, but said he felt desperate and wanted to avoid socializing."[The host's] friends are not that diverse and are all American - I first said I would be there, but then I didn't go at all," Deng said. "I was so scared that people would ask where I came from or where I'm from, and I'm just too embarrassed to answer these questions."Miya Russell is a junior studying linguistics. Vice president of the MU Asian American Association, Russell said she doesn't know anyone who has experienced violent attacks, but there is always underlying passive aggression.On March 16, President Donald Trump referenced "the Chinese virus" in a tweet.Responses were split: some stated that the term was accurate, as the coronavirus originated in China. Others felt that Trump was promoting racist attitudes.Russell said that the term "Chinese virus" pins the pandemic on Asian Americans."While it may have been intended to be specifically China and the Chinese government, what it does is it affects the Asian American people here who, a lot of them have never been to China and many of them are not Chinese at all," Russell said. "And so, while the intended effect may have been more as a foreign relations thing, it definitely has a strong effect here at home."On March 11, AAA released a statement on social media regarding COVID-19 and xenophobia."We are disheartened by the increase in anti-asian sentiment and harassment as a response to COVID-19," the statement reads. "AAA stands in solidarity with all APIDA [Asian Pacific Islander Desi American] individuals and will advocate for your health and safety."Deng said that many Asian Americans do not feel comfortable reporting their experiences and feel that they may be overlooked."[They] don't actually want to speak out because they really don't want to be considered as being too woke or too sensitive," Deng said. "So, I want to tell people that these jokes are not okay and it really is something that is not appropriate to say."For more information about the coronavirus, students can visit MU Alert or the CDC.Edited by Lucy Caile | lcaile@themaneater.comLoad-Date: May 1, 2020End of Document

China's 'runrún' is heard again amid COVID-19 pandemicCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 25, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 820 wordsBodyAfter the companies stopped, the sale of cars in the Asian country is expected to gradually recover; factories are already restarting their activities.Much of the world's production is paralyzed as a result of the new coronavirus,but China is slowly waking up by restarting production at factories and resuming some flights.The recovery in the world's second-largest economy is some relief for global manufacturers in the coming months as the virus continues to wreak havoc in Europe, the United States, India and Latin America. .Employees return to work, production lines are starting to work and even the epicenter where the virus initially emerged in Wuhan will soon finish its blockade. Car sales in China were likely to hit rock bottom last month and are expected to gradually recover as the spread of the virus declines and consumers buy again, an automotive industry group said this month."Real-time indicators show that China is rebooting its industrial complex," Sanford analysts C. Bernstein said in a comment Tuesday. "Obviously, the restart is at an early stage,but things are gradually improving."In the country's airline industry, whose collapse last month decimated its huge aviation market to a smaller size than Portugal's, airlines are slowly re-establishing flights. Expected capacity increased by 2.4 percent last week from seven days prior to 9.2 million seats, while the world's other top 10 markets continued to contract, according to flight data analysis firm OAG Aviation Worldwide.Among other signs, Chinese subway traffic increased 21 percent last week and online sales of large appliances recovered in both volumes and a weekly average of prices, according to Bernstein.Much of China has been closed for weeks since late January, as the spread of COVID-19 forced the spread of the Lunar New Year holiday. This is the current situation of some manufacturers:BmwProduction at BMW's Shenyang plants resumed on February 17,and the German carmaker said it is confident that the Chinese government will manage the crisis and defeat the epidemic. "We continue to rely on the medium- and long-term business perspective of our no.1 global market," the company said in an email response to questions.Fiat ChryslerThe company stated that its manufacturing activities in China have restarted production after receiving authorization from the relevant regional and national governments. More than 90 percent of its distributors and 95 percent of the joint venture staff with Guangzhou Automobile Group are operational again, and "business and manufacturing activities in general are gradually resuming business," said Fiat Chrysler.FordThe U.S. automaker said its Chinese plants resumed production on February 10 and continue to increase it. Their local societies have recovered by nearly 100 percent, although some Hubei or Wuhan employees are still under travel restrictions.FoxconnFoxconn, a major name manufacturing partner known as Apple or HP, is gradually recovering. Foxconn's Hon Hai Precision Industry unit said this weekthatit has recovered full seasonal staff ahead of schedule, indicating that the Taiwanese company is confident of solving the labor shortage and logistical problems that threatened to quell the flow of iPhones and devices to the United States and the rest of the world.HondaThe Japanese automaker noted that capacity is gradually recovering in its two Chinese companies and so far has had no problems because of the shortage of parts there.NissanAll Nissan Motor factories in China have resumed work and production will be in line with government mandates, the company said.SaicAll SAIC Motor plants in China have resumed production,and the company has adjusted production levels according to demand. The automaker has contingency plans to secure parts in case of outages, he said.TeslaTesla's factory in China has recovered from a better shutdown of the virus than many others in the industry, with the help of local authorities. After resuming operations on February 10, Tesla's only one outside the US has exceeded its pre-closing capacity,reaching a weekly production of 3,000 cars, a company representative said Friday.ToyotaThe Japanese auto giant's plants in Guangzhou and Changchun have returned to their regular two-shift schedule,while in Tianjin, all production lines return to two shifts, except one that follows in one shift. More than 98 percent of Toyota dealerships have reopened,and the company has no plans so far to revise its 2020 sales target in China, he said.VolkswagenAlmost all production facilities are back in operation, Volkswagen said. There are problems,such as a slow national supply chain as well as limited transportation options for employees, but all volkswagen component production sites and their partners are producing again,"he said.The 'runrún' entry of plants in China is heard again amid the COVID-19 pandemic first appears in I-Xport.Load-Date: March 26, 2020End of Document

ByteDance, which also operates the social media app TikTok, developed Feishu as an internal app, then marketed it for business use in 2019. An international version of the app, called Lark, launched in April 2019 and is still operating in markets like Japan and Singapore.Feishu has become popular in China during the coronavirus pandemic as people continue working from home. Bloomberg describes the app as a combination of Slack, Skype, and Google Docs. In China, Feishu competes with Alibaba s DingTalkand Tencent s WeChat. Last month, the much larger WeChat started blocking links from Feishu.Feishu parent company ByteDance faced heavy scrutiny last year for its relationship with China; it denied allegations in a that TikTok was censoring pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) raised security concerns about TikTok. In December, the US army barred soldiers from using TikTok, calling the app a cyber threat.See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/25/21236075/china-tiktok-bytedance-feishuContact Information:Kim LyonsTags:, Artificial Intelligence Newswire, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: April 27, 2020End of Document

2019-20 NBA season hangs in the balanceThe Rebel Yell: University of Nevada - Las VegasApril 6, 2020 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: SPORTS; Pg. 1Length: 488 wordsByline: Salim DweckBodyIt is beginning to look as if this NBA season does resume, it will not be for a long time. As of now, the league has kept all options open, but the early predictions of a May return look more and more unrealistic as the days go on.ESPN's Brian Windhorst has reported that the league is considering resuming in one or two singular cities in a "quarantine bubble," with Las Vegas being one of the cities mentioned. All NBA players and team staff would have to be under mandatory quarantine for a period of 14 days before they would be able to enter the bubble.During this time, neither they nor those who live with them would be allowed to leave the house, even for a grocery store run. The Chinese Basketball Association was planning to do this in May, but due to a second-wave of coronavirus cases in China, the Chinese government has halted the resumption of professional sports for now.Windhorst also reports that the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association are talking about the financial implications of canceling the season altogether.Most teams have already played 65 games, just one shy of the number of games played in the lockout-shortened 2011-2012 NBA season. With roughly 80% of the season already completed, would players receive their full salaries if it were canceled? How would it affect free agency?The Milwaukee Bucks have to be sweating a bit knowing that they could lose a year to convince Giannis Antetokounmpo to re-sign with them, something that they could have done this year if they were to win the title.The league has been flirting with the idea of a 66-game season for a while now and if this season is pushed back instead of canceled, the smart move might be to start the 2020-21 season on Christmas day.This year's regular-season would be finished and the current top eight seeds in both conferences would play shortened playoffs taking place between October and early November.Given the fact that teams are not permitted to practice together, it would be wise to delay the start of the playoffs until late fall to give players more time to get into playing shape and knock off the rust.The draft will probably go on in late June as currently scheduled, but it will either be held behind closed doors or via webcam.Teams hosting prospects for workouts would have to take extra precautions and would be able to conduct any contact drills. In theory, teams could send their private planes to pick up prospects for pre-draft meetings, but international players might have a more difficult time with this depending on their country's lockdown protocols.Unfortunately, there is no great option here. The sports world (and the world in general) will not go back to any semblance of normalcy until there is a vaccine or rapid, expansive testing and contact-tracing. All there is to do now is to stay safe and take as many precautions as possible while waiting for life, and basketball, to resume.Load-Date: April 6, 2020End of Document

The city of Wuhan will end the world's harshest coronavirus lockdown after 11 weeks. The world is petrified that the virus will come back.Business Insider USMarch 24, 2020 Tuesday 07:56 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1206 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Bill Bostock)Highlight: Experts fear a "boomerang effect," where the coronavirus could reappear due to symptom-less infections and visitors bringing new cases.BodySTR/AFP via Getty Images• Wuhan - the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak - will end its uncompromising lockdown on April 8, allowing traffic to reenter and pass through the city.• Eleven million people confined to their homes since January 23 aren't allowed to leave their homes, and are being delivered food as armed police patrol the streets.• Wuhan's lockdown has been more severe than anywhere else, meaning the world is watching closely to see how effective it's been in slowing the spread of the coronavirus.• In recent weeks, Italy, Spain, Britain, and several US states have enforced lockdowns and curfews of their own as Europe and the Americas enter their worst periods fighting the virus yet.• Some experts fear that when lockdowns end, a "boomerang effect" will occur, bringing a resurgence of viruses due to unidentified and symptomless infections, as well as new imported cases.• Meanwhile, some experts and local Wuhan residents doubt that the city is as clear of the virus as the government says.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.The city of Wuhan, China, will end its all-encompassing lockdown on April 8, with the world anxiously watching to see what comes next.In a Tuesday post on social media site Weibo, Hubei province - where Wuhan is located - said restrictions in, out, and within the city will end, meaning people will be able to pass through Wuhan and the wider province.It will mark the end of a 76-day, intense lockdown, which started on January 23 as the coronavirus raged out of control through the city and the province.Wuhan, where the coronavirus broke out last December, has been hard hit by the virus. The scale of its lockdown has been unprecedented both in terms of measures and timescale, and far surpasses the rules currently being set in countries like Italy, France, Britain, and            parts of the US.Photo by STR/AFP via Getty ImagesHere's a rundown of what's been happening in Wuhan:• Eleven million residents all confined to their homes, with the exception of            delivery and hospital workers.• One person from each household only allowed to leave the building every 72 hours to buy food and medical supplies.• Food and medicine delivered to their doorsto avoid transmission of the virus.• Entrances to housing estates guarded so only residents enter and leave.• Armed police patrolling the streets to make sure people don't breach the restrictions without proper cause.• Police enforcing traffic blocks by controlling who enters the city and who doesn't.But as the official death and infection toll in Wuhan, Hubei province, and the rest of China continues to decrease, so too have the number of restrictions in Wuhan.On Monday, ahead of the April 8 reopening, a number of public-transport services and supermarkets reopened to the public, according to state news outlet CGTN, and over the weekend a train carrying 1,000 workers pulled into the city's main station. Some experts now fear that the lifting of restrictions will bring back the virus in a phenomenon known as the "boomerang effect." Fears of a 'boomerang effect'Dr. Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong who researches influenza transmission and control measures, told Business Insider there are two ways the virus can make a resurgence as residents emerge from their homes, return to work, take their children to school, and go shopping.• First, a small number of residents who were under lockdown could still have the virus when restrictions lift, but not know they're sick. Those people could then spread it, starting a new wave of infections.• Second, international travelers could bring the virus back into the country."What happened in Wuhan could happen repeatedly to a city," Cowling told Business Insider."They can shut down for a month, but then when they reopen, they're still going to have an epidemic starting again, and I don't see the long-term plan for those locations.""Are they going to just cycle? Just down one month in every three months?" Cowling said.Hector Retamal/AFP via Getty ImagesCurrent reports from authorities in Wuhan, however, suggests that the lockdown has worked as intended: to slow the spread of the virus.In early February, Wuhan had been reporting dozens of new coronavirus cases every day. On March 19, it reported no new cases in a 24-hour period - the first time since the outbreak began in early December, according to the World Health Organization.Another sign that Wuhan's worst days were behind it came on March 10, when Chinese premier Xi Jinping visited, after a near three month absence from the front lines of the fight against the virus.As Wuhan lifts restrictions, some officials and locals doubt it's really clear of the virusSome local officials have doubted the official figures, however.The Caixin news outlet on Monday cited an unidentified official at Wuhan's infectious-diseases prevention and control team as saying that the city is still recording "several or more than a dozen asymptomatic infected individuals," which are people who do not feel ill but have tested positive for the coronavirus.China reported 78 new cases of the coronavirus on Tuesday, but said they were imported from Europe, according to Reuters. Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and South Korea are also experiencing the same trend.Stringer/Getty ImagesResidents of Wuhan are still fearful, despite the ease in constraints."Everyone is being very careful," resident Iris Yao, 40, told The Guardian."I am really worried that there are still many asymptomatic infected people inside Wuhan. As soon as everyone goes back to work, everyone will be infected," a person identified by The Guardian as Wang, 26, also told the paper.Some experts also believe that the authorities could be lying about the new number of deaths."With the cover-up in December and January we really cannot trust the numbers from the Chinese government without more credible and solid evidence to verify," Ho-fung Hung, a professor in political economy at Johns Hopkins University, told The Guardian.Associated PressThroughout the coronavirus crisis, the government has silenced a large number of critics, including            journalists and the whistleblowing doctor            Li Wenliang.Viral hashtags and posts criticizing the government's response            have been censored on social media. A new law            introduced in early March effectively criminalized the posting of content critical of the regime on the internet. Even before the outbreak, China's government and tech companies have long been known to distort data and            enforce strict censorship on what its citizens can see."I don't believe [the numbers]. This epidemic will not disappear so easily," one resident of Wuhan told The Guardian.NOW WATCH: 3 dietitians debunk 18 weight loss myths, from cutting carbs to fad dietsSee Also:• Western countries only seem capable of social distancing when their governments force them• An intensive-care expert broke down just how contagious the coronavirus is, showing how one person could end up infecting 59,000 in a snowball effect• Critical coronavirus patients in Italy are being treated with bubble-shaped containers over their heads.

China Competes to Become Global Technology LeaderThe Santa Clara: Santa Clara UniversityMay 14, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 849 wordsBodyChina Competes to Become Global Technology LeaderAre China's questionable intellectual property tactics challenging US dominance?In ancient times, China was a global leader in technology. Today, the country is on track to become one again. The Chinese government is investing heavily in intellectual property and innovation since developments in technology are seen as a critical factor in establishing the country as a global superpower.In the past several years, China has become infamously known for intellectual property theft, although this transfer of IP has long been a requirement for companies doing business in China. Since the 1980s, China has required all foreign companies to enter joint ventures with local companies as a condition of entering China and doing business there. This process required foreign companies and investors to knowingly transfer their IP to the Chinese companies they partnered with. In other words, multinational firms were willingly trading technology transfers for access to China's market.The problem here is that China has taken this transferred information and used it in Chinese state-owned companies to its own benefit and without permission. This has come at the expense of the US economy through counterfeit goods, pirated software and the unapproved use of trade secrets in seperate Chinese companies. To many people, particularly from Western cultures, this has demonized China. But was the use of willingly shared IP in other domains entirely malicious, or was it in part a cultural difference?It's interesting to consider Shenzhen, China's technology capital, which has a different approach towards invention. The culture in Shenzhen strongly encourages its young demographic of engineers to invent and innovate in collaboration. Electronic parts are sold in bulk at cheap prices in stall-style shops that resemble traditional Asian markets. In other words, you can find almost any part you need under one roof. Because of this, Shenzhen serves as a hub that gives rising inventors easy access to quick production. Perhaps this lapse in cultural understanding is in part responsible for the current IP theft issues.From China's point of view, they deny having coerced any foreign companies to transfer this IP because these firms had, and still have, the option to leave China's market and safeguard their IP in doing so. It is, in fact, their choice to stay there. It is also important to note that requiring joint ventures is actually a common practice among many emerging economies and is not unique to China.From a Western perspective, China has stolen IP unfairly, unjustly, and betrayed our trust in doing so; However, we should not have assumed that a foreign culture would view IP in the same way we do. It is in part our responsibility to recognize that different countries and cultures do things differently, and we will be better off if we acknowledge this and act accordingly. This is true not only regarding technology, but across all other sectors as well. Taking different cultures and their norms into perspective, and being open to adjusting our own standpoints, is increasingly vital to being successful in the globalized world we live in.Although IP theft helped China catch up to the global playing field of high-tech, China is now moving beyond this stolen technology and coming up with technological advancements of its own. For example, China has invented the world's fastest supercomputer, the first fully electric cargo ship, the first package-delivering automated drone and is the first country to ever land on the far side of the moon.The future of emerging technologies is one of the biggest areas of competition between the U.S. and China and may determine which country holds the most geopolitical and economic power moving forward. China clearly sees this and is pouring funding into research and development of cutting-edge technologies, making it an important player in this increasingly competitive and critical sector. In a 2010 speech, then-president Hu Jintao said that "a nation's technological competitiveness determines its place and future in international competition."Under pressure from the US, China has agreed to tackle the issue of IP theft, but IP is a tricky thing to track and monitor. One way to stop China's IP theft would be for countries to relocate their businesses, but China's economy has become so prominent that many multinational and other foreign companies are still willing to risk IP theft to keep a foothold in China.As technology continues to become one of the most important things in our lives and a huge economic driver, the US and China will continue their virtual battle for IP and technology dominance.Although by questionable means, it is undeniable that China has come a long way in a short amount of time, but is China really a current technological rival to the US? Some experts believe they are, while others won't entertain the idea. Regardless of which country currently leads the world in technological innovation, China is quickly, and undeniably, gaining momentum.Load-Date: May 14, 2020End of Document

Committee to Protect Journalists: Chinese Police Detain 2 Volunteers Who Collect and Share Censored News, 1 More MissingTargeted News ServiceApril 28, 2020 Tuesday 8:23 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 447 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: TAIPEI, Taiwan BodyThe Committee to Protect Journalists issued the following news on April 27:Chinese authorities should immediately release and drop all charges against the two media workers arrested for sharing censored news articles, and disclose if a third is in government custody, the Committee to Protect Journalists said.On April 19, Beijing police arrested Cai Wei and his girlfriend, a woman surnamed Tang, whose full name was not released, according to news reports. Cai and Tang work as volunteers for Terminus2049, a webpage that collects and republishes news articles and social media posts that have been censored by the Chinese government, according to those reports.The Beijing Public Security Bureau's Chaoyang branch sent letters to Cai and Tang's families on April 23 and 24, respectively, stating that the two had been charged with "picking quarrels and provoking trouble" and were being kept under "residential surveillance at a designated location," a form of extrajudicial detention, according to those reports and a report by the Southern Idiot Observation Group, a Chinese human rights group active on Facebook.A third volunteer for the website, Chen Mei, went missing on April 19, according to those news reports. Chen's brother posted on Twitter today that the family has not received any arrest notice or word of his whereabouts. CPJ called the Chaoyang branch of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, but an officer who answered said he had no information on Chen or the other two volunteers.Terminus2049, which is hosted on the software website Github, began operating in 2018 and recently republished news articles critical of the government's handling of the COVID-19 outbreak, according to CPJ's review of its content."China can't change the facts of its bungled initial response to the COVID-19 outbreak and it must stop trying to cover it up," said CPJ Asia Program Coordinator Steven Butler in Washington, D.C. "Authorities should free Cai Wei and Tang immediately and allow them to return to the important work of keeping the public informed. Authorities must also disclose if they are holding Chen Mei and, if so, must let him resume his work."The volunteers' family and friends called the police after the three went missing, but were repeatedly told that they were not detained or the police had no information on their whereabouts, until Cai and Tang's families received the Public Security Bureau's letters, according to the Southern Idiot Observation Group.China was the worst jailer of journalists in 2019, with at least 48 behind bars as of December 1, 2019, according to CPJ research.[Category: Media]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7097981 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: April 28, 2020End of Document

It's time to shut down GW's Confucius Institute Restaurants sell extra ingredients as groceries to make extra funds during pandemic Voting for Biden is a tough pill to swallow, but it's the right move Virtual Weekend Outlook - Jam out at an open mic nightThe Hatchet: George Washington UniversityMay 28, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINIONS; Pg. 1Length: 760 wordsByline: Filip VachudaBodyMost students would be forgiven for not knowing about GW's Confucius Institute, a chapter of a worldwide organization promoting the study of Chinese culture and language in universities. It may seem an innocuous cultural organization, but Confucius Institutes at GW and across the country are nothing less than soft power tools of the Chinese Communist Party.These Institutes are operated by Hanban, a government entity funded by the Chinese Ministry of Education, and hire employees largely based on their loyalty to the CCP. Topics of discussion forbidden by the Chinese government are forbidden as well at their events. The Institutes regularly sabotage events related to critical topics about China, pressuring universities to disinvite the Dalai Lama or removing conference materials listing Taiwan as a country. Confucius Institutes have also allegedly carried out espionage, assisted in the theft of intellectual property and threatened Chinese students for what they may say in the classroom.Universities are aware of these issues, and some schools across the United States and abroad have subsequently shuttered their Institutes in the past two years. Of GW's 12 peer schools, only Tufts University and the University of Pittsburgh still allow branches. More tellingly, Congress and the FBI reviewed the activities of Confucius Institutes last year, identifying them as threats to campus free speech and information security and urging U.S. universities to sever ties. Several faculty associations, human rights groups and student organizations have likewise called for their closure. The University must consider these warnings and shutter the GW Confucius Institute as soon as possible.Confucius Institutes are not like cultural Institutes like France's Alliance Francaise or Germany's Goethe-Institute because they, unlike others, operate as fixtures on the campuses of their host universities. They have a voice in what events or discussions take place on campus, which is particularly concerning given the Chinese government's track record of speech policing. A Chinese official even admitted in 2011 that the Institutes were an "important part of China's overseas propaganda set-up." It is reasonable to assume GW's Institute is part of this broader mission and effort to censor discussion and surveil at universities nationwide.Allowing the Chinese government space on campus to communicate its policies is controversial enough. Permitting it to stifle the communications of others is intolerable. When one then takes into account the national security concerns, the course of action required by the University becomes all too obvious.We should also consider the funds GW allocates toward the Institute. Congress passed a law in 2018 withholding all Department of Defense language funding from universities that host an Institute. We are possibly forfeiting critical language resources - at a time when our language departments have needed to cut classes - all so we can give an authoritarian government a platform on campus. The COVID-19 pandemic has already caused financial harm to the University, and while closing the Institute won't balance the budget by any means, it could be a beneficial way to start.The need to learn Chinese or gain familiarity with Chinese culture is undoubtedly present, especially at a university renowned for its international affairs program. But there are plenty of ways to do so without allowing the Chinese government to manipulate discourse on campus. Just ask American or Georgetown universities or any of the Ivy League schools, which have avoided hosting Confucius Institutes and still maintain top-notch programs in Chinese language and politics. All our Confucius Institute really does for students is organize language classes and art events. We already have a Chinese language department, and it's not worth keeping the Institute for the sake of a few calligraphy lessons or ballet performances.To operate legitimately, any foreign organization should ensure a commitment to freedom of speech, transparency and integrity of academic practices. The University as much as any other school must make it clear that our values of freedom and democracy are not for sale. GW's insistence on keeping the Institute open not only defies rationality but violates our character as an institution.Filip Vachuda, a rising junior majoring in international affairs and economics, is a writer.Want to respond to this piece?

He also asked that "Department of Defense capabilities" be used to respond to state-sponsored hackers, noting that attacks on health care groups "put the lives of Americans who are seeking care at risk.""The United States must communicate a strong message to China's government that this behavior is unacceptable," Peters wrote. "The Administration should use public pressure and the threat of sanctions and additional indictments to deter future Chinese government attacks against research institutions."GARY NAMED ONE OF MOST BIPARTISAN SENATORSIt was announced this week by the non-partisan Lugar Center, that Gary ranks as the 3rd most bipartisan Democrat and 12th most bipartisan Senator in the first year of the 116th Congress. The Bipartisan Index, produced by The Lugar Center and Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy, measures how often a member of Congress introduces bills that succeed in attracting co-sponsors from members of the other party, and how often they in turn co-sponsor a bill introduced from across the aisle.GARY CONTINUES TO FIGHT FOR FRONTLINE WORKERSGary continues to fight for Michigan's front line workers through the 'Heroes Fund' which would give workers an extra $13 an hour and up to $25,000 for the rest of this year.WZZM: Sen.

It would be federal money, not paid by the employers."It's also the janitors who are cleaning hospital rooms to make sure that it's sterile and be used to help treat patients. It means people working in grocery stores and our food supply chain, our postal workers, our first responders, he said. "These are folks who genuinely need hazard pay because they are doing essential jobs and put themselves and their families at risk."GARY IS GETTING MICHIGAN HOSPITALS NEEDED RELIEFGary recently announced that $14.4 million in federal funds will be awarded to 39 health centers across Michigan to support testing activities and the purchase of personal protective equipment.The Detroit News: Michigan hospitals getting $900M in fed COVID-19 aidMichigan Democratic Sen.

In 2010 he won the most prestigious literary prize in his country.From Wuhan, where he lives, he began writing a diary on January 23 that ended in March. after 60 posts posted on the internet, where it tells the fear, anger and hope of the city's 11 million inhabitants, the epicentre of the pandemic.The newspaper speaks of saturated hospitals that reject the sick, their confined lives, the death of relatives, the solidarity between inhabitants or the simple pleasure of seeing the sun from their room."A doctor friend told me, "We doctors have long known that there is a human transmission of the disease, we inform our superiors, but still no one warned people," he wrote on the 38th day of confinement.His personal, non-journalistic, chronicle of confinement was followed by millions of Chinese interested in a different view of today, versus official, state-controlled media.But Fang Fang is controversial because his diary will be published in the coming months in the form of a book abroad, in English, German and French.The main rebuke of the writer is that the translation of her diary will lead foreigners to criticize the Chinese government, especially the United States, which accuses Beijing of having been slow to react to the pandemic."An American media says he wants to use the book to hold China to account. Congratulations Fang Fang, you give Western countries weapons to shoot against China," writes a user of the Weibo social network."That's how you show your nature as a traitor," she adds."How much have you sold your diary?" asks another person, who accuses the writer of enriching herself at the expense of the nearly 3,900 killed by coronavirus in Wuhan.- "Authoritarian country" -Another source of controversy is the politicized presentation of the book by the American publisher HarperCollins, speaking of a text that "mixes the strange and the dystopian" by a writer who fights "systemic political problems" of an "authoritarian country."According to Hu Xijin, the influential editor-in-chief of the nationalist newspaper Global Times, "it is not very good to publish now a translation of the newspaper, in the midst of diplomatic conflict with Washington."In the end it will be the Chinese, including those who initially supported Fang Fang, who will have to pay the price of their prestige in the West," he wrote on Weibo, in a message that received 190,000 likes.The Global Times speaks of a "partial" text that "exposes only the shadowy part of Wuhan."Criticized and insulted, Fang Fang claims to be a victim of the "cyberviolence" of nationalists.The consequence, she said, is that several Chinese editors interested in publishing the text are now hesitation in doing so because of the controversy generated."Why should we give up publishing this book? Just because some people can use us? (...) If people really read my diary, they'll discover all the effective measures China took against the epidemic," she explains the writer in a response published on The Caixin magazine website.It also promises to give all the copyright to the book "to the families of deceased health workers" in the pandemic.Faced with criticism, many netizens have come out in support of Fang Fang on the weibo social network, considering the attacks to be "disproportionate.""Fang Fang should notnobody," says one user. "If you want to write a diary that goes against what she says, translate it and publish it abroad!"ehl/bar/jhd/pc/blLoad-Date: April 23, 2020End of Document

Huawei is one of the world's leading brands in cell phone production.The Chinese ministry anticipated that the Trump administration's initiatives "destroyed global manufacturing, supply and value chains."On Friday, Donald Trump's administration announced a series of measures that seek to leave Huawei out of the global semiconductor market, seen by Washington as a threat to national security.The U.S. Department of Commerce said these measures block"Huawei's efforts to circumvent U.S. export controls."According to U.S. officials, China's telecommunications giant managed to bypass previous Washington sanctions by turning to chip and component suppliers in other parts of the world, but manufactured with U.S. technology.The Chinese company was under extreme pressure from Washington, which with its lobby got allies around the world to avoid equipment developed by Huawei in the name of security,in a context of trade war between China and the United States.Load-Date: May 17, 2020End of Document

Zoom s CEO, Eric Yuan, has this week publicly admitted that he  messed up  on privacy and security.https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/zoom-at-your-own-risk/But we are missing a larger question as we grapple with these security flaws. Zoom today is a publicly-traded American company listed on NASDAQ, but the company s mainline app is developed by China-based subsidiaries. Its servers in China also appear to have transmitted the company s AES-128 encryption keys earlier this year, including, as a Citizen Labs report documents, some keys used for meetings among North American participants (the company posted a response to that report here, noting that a geofencing error due to the heavy traffic from the outbreak of COVID-19 might have led some meetings  under extremely limited circumstances  to be routed through China, and it has corrected the error).

So have Google, Apple, NASA, and New York City schools. Earlier this week, the FBI warned about Zoom teleconferences and live classrooms being hacked by trolls; security experts warn that holes in the technology make user data vulnerable to exploitation.  Zoom s CEO, Eric Yuan, has this week publicly admitted that he  messed up  on privacy and security.But we are missing a larger question as we grapple with these security flaws. Zoom today is a publicly-traded American company listed on NASDAQ, but the company s mainline app is developed by China-based subsidiaries. Its servers in China also appear to have transmitted the company s AES-128 encryption keys earlier this year, including, as a Citizen Labs report documents, some keys used for meetings among North American participants (the company posted a response to that report here, noting that a geofencing error due to the heavy traffic from the outbreak of COVID-19 might have led some meetings  under extremely limited circumstances  to be routed through China, and it has corrected the error). Beijing s intelligence laws obligate Zoom and other companies with nexus in China to share data held on the mainland with Chinese government authorities upon request.(Editor s note: Zoom has published a 90-day plan to improve its privacy and security initiatives, and recently hired ex-Facebook CISO Alex Stamos as an outside consultant.

U.S. asks China to reconsider expulsion of journalistsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 17, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 373 wordsBodyWashington, Mar 17 (EFE News). , The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal."This is unfortunate, we just saw it, I hope you will reconsider," Pompeo said during a press conference at the State Department.The official considered that there is less press freedom in China than in the Us, where a reporter can ask any question to a political leader and wait for an answer, he illustrated."We know," he added, "that such freedoms do not exist within China. In fact, people in China want more information, they want to know more about their country, but they (the government) continue to make decisions like the one you saw today, in which they deny the world the possibility of knowing what is going on within their country."On the other hand, Pompeo announced at the press conference the appointment as a terrorist of the new leader of the jihadist group Islamic State (IS), Abu Ibrahim al Hashemi al Qurashi.On Tuesday, the Chinese Foreign Office announced restrictions on journalists from The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The Washington Post, whose press credentials expired in 2020.The Chinese government's decision comes after Washington launched a new front in tensions with Beijing in mid-February.Then, surprisingly, U.S. diplomacy announced restrictions for five Chinese state media outlets operating within the U.S.: the Xinhua agency, CGTN television, China Radio International and China Daily newspaper, as well as the company that distributes that journal, hai Tian Development USA.Washington justified its decision by ensuring that these five media outlets make "propaganda" of the Communist Party of China and has therefore gone on to consider them "foreign missions," so that they have to follow the same rules as embassies and consulates.In response to that coup, China revoked three journalists from The Wall Street Journal to work in the country.Subsequently, the US authorities announced limits on the number of Chinese-majority employees that four means (Xinhua, CGTN, China Radio International and China Daily) can have in the US.Washington and Beijing have been fighting since the start of the trade war in 2018; but until now they went through a sweet moment after reaching a principle of agreement.Load-Date: March 19, 2020End of Document

Sens. Hawley, Scott Introduce Legislation to Ban TikTok From Government DevicesTargeted News ServiceMarch 13, 2020 Friday 8:32 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 345 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, issued the following news release:U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) introduced legislation to ban all federal employees from using TikTok on government devices. The State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, and TSA have already banned TikTok on federal government devices due to cybersecurity concerns and possible spying by the Chinese government."TikTok is owned by a Chinese company that includes Chinese Communist Party members on its board, and it is required by law to share user data with Beijing. The company even admitted it collects user data while their app is running in the background - including the messages people send, pictures they share, their keystrokes and location data, you name it. As many of our federal agencies have already recognized, TikTok is a major security risk to the United States, and it has no place on government devices."Senator HawleySenator Scott said, "The use of apps like TikTok by federal employees on government devices is a risk to our network and a threat to our national security, and I'm proud to join Senator Hawley to put an end to it. We should all be very concerned about the threat of Communist China, and I hope my colleagues will join me to implement this ban immediately and protect our national security."Senator Hawley announced he would be introducing the bill in last week's Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee entitled, "Dangerous Partners: Big Tech & Beijing." TikTok declined his invitation to testify in the hearing - just as they did for the Subcommittee's hearing in November. After the November hearing, Senator Hawley introduced the National Security and Personal Data Protection Act to combat the flow of Americans' sensitive personal data to China and countries that similarly threaten national security.Full text of the bill is available here (https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/No-TikTik-On-Government-Devices-Act-Bill-Text.pdf).Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7052372 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 13, 2020End of Document

China calls on US to end 'crackdown' on HuaweiCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 17, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 261 wordsBodyChina urged the US to end the "irrational crackdown on Huawei and Chinese companies," after Washington announced new export controls to limit The Chinese giant's access to semiconductor technology."The Chinese government will strongly defend the legitimate and legal rights and interests of Chinese companies," the Foreign Ministry said yesterday in a statement."We urge the US to immediately cease its irrational crackdown on Huawei and Chinese companies," he said. The ministry said Donald Trump's administration's initiatives "destroyed global manufacturing, supply and value chains."On Friday, the Trump administration announced a series of measures that seek to leave Huawei out of the global semiconductor market, seen by Washington as a threat to national security.The U.S. Department of Commerce said these measures block "Huawei's efforts to circumvent U.S. export controls."According to U.S. officials, China's telecommunications giant has managed to circumvent previous Washington sanctions by turning to chip and component suppliers in other parts of the world, but manufactured with U.S. technology.The Chinese company has been under extreme pressure from Washington, which with its lobbying has got allies around the world to avoid equipment developed by Huawei in the name of security, in a context of trade war between China and the United States.U.S. officials have repeatedly accused China's tech giant of stealing U.S. trade secrets and supporting China's espionage efforts.This situation can further stoke tensions between Washington and Beijing.Load-Date: May 18, 2020End of Document

The methodology of the Chinese Communist Party is also contagiousCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 7, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1024 wordsBody       Meeting of the Chinese Communist Party. (Photo: Flickr)It may be a good idea to review the peculiar reactions that some heads of government have expressed to the current complex health situation.Trump recently demanded, on Twitter, two giant car companies engage in the manufacture of respirators. The Chinese government, of course, closed borders to prevent new infected people from entering. López Obrador, president of Mexico, maintained until recently an amazing attitude of supposed idiosyncratic immunity, provided that his stamps and amulets accompany him. A position similar to that of Bolsonaro, which ensures that Brazilians "divere sewers" and, therefore, cannot get sick from Covid-19.All these reactions seem to be part of a comedy of lousy taste. Whether the aforementioned heads of government are being spontaneous or being guided by their advisers, this is a chain of behaviors worthy of psychiatric study.Terrible procedures to generate peace of mindThe stages of political leaders in the face of the confrontation of the disease and its consequences seem to be: first, an arrogant contempt or denial, followed by a brief moment of caution. Then, an excess movement with heroic intentions that aspires to solve everything but late and, like this one cannot be successful, a noisy paranoia emerges - simulated or not - that points to someone else of their own mistakes. Well-seen, they are no different reactions to those of ordinary citizens.The strangest thing is that some of the most absurd of these behaviors claim to have the intention of avoiding altering people's nerves.Taking care that there is no widespread panic is understandable, provided that the methodologies are not negligent with the severity of the situation or produce a more harmful effect than it, as is happening in many cases.The myopia of political pragmatismThe terrain of partisan rivalry is multiplying the dangers of the virus, as the intention to seek solutions predominates, as long as they favor an ideology. Those measures that allow a sector to accumulate positive looks and references are implemented. I have no doubt that there is also a genuine interest in solving the problem, but what good would it do if it is not possible to scratch popular crumbs along the way?It is a good idea to remember that the first reaction of the professional politician to any situation that arises, that is why he is praised and why he is "good" in his work, is to conceive a way from which to use what happens for the benefit of his career.One of the atypical elements of the current situation is that it allows us to appreciate how the cynical element, so useful in political professional life, not only puts at risk its represented with astonishing coldness, but can also be a tool at the service of its own harm. The fact that several dignitaries have become ill or have been very close to being so tells us that negligence has been more dangerous than calculated.The popular English expression "keep your eyes on the ball" invites us to keep our focus on what's important, at complex or baffling moments like today." It is a pity that, as long as for most of humanity "the ball" is the cure of the coronavirus, too many leaders continue to have their own popularity as the priority.The danger of chaining communicationEven if it's an uncomfortable topic to deal with for less leftistsinclined to debate, the Chinese case is psychologically paradigmatic. Not because the virus was generated in China, an eventuality to which we are grisly exposed all human beings, the paradigmatic was the mechanism used to manage information, which was full of crippling anxiety on the part of the leadership of the only recognized political institution in that country, as the Communist Party remains.Even if it is speculative, we can review the thought process that takes place in an event like the one that occurred:"We face an unknown and complex virus. We have the possibility to report on this to facilitate the participation of society in the search for solutions.However, as there is a possibility that disclosure will become bad publicity, serving as a weapon for our enemies to signal us as inefficient in health work, we better devote our ever-few and valuable resources to blocking the dissemination of information.We then implemented a sufficiently oiled device to persecute medical personnel, journalists and the general population precisely those who could be our best allies in building a solution to the problem."There must be few who do not consider the previous soliloquius a regrettable delirium, full of the highest dose of human awkwardness that can be found. Not only because it delayed the activation of well-managed international alerts that could have saved the lives of thousands of people; but because he failed miserably in his original mission of not ridiculing the Chinese Communist party itself, on which one of the most important and extensive justified animaversions of recent times weighs today.It should be noted that it may not be coincidental for us to talk about health, hygiene and food; lands easily associated with shame, feelings of inferiority and, also sometimes, some revulsion; all of them are obvious emotionally sensitive cores for party officials.His childish movement to avoid shame has received the homeopathic medicine of general humiliation. As the origin of the most important pandemic of the last hundred years, and - much more central than that - because they were possessed by the political complexes to such an extent that they let the epidemic develop in silence, almost as if it were a deliberate biological weapon, even if, obviously, that was not the intention.When we started the PanAm Post to try to bring the truth about Latin America to the rest of the world, we knew it would be a big challenge. But we were rewarded for the incredible amount of support and feedback from readers that made us grow and improve.Be part of the mission to spread the truth!Help us combat attempts to silence dissenting voices and contribute today.Contribute todayContribute to the PanAm Post today with your donationLoad-Date: April 8, 2020End of Document

Rep. Omar Leads Letter to CEOs, Including Apple, Amazon, and Google, Condemning the Use of Forced Uyghur Labor in ChinaTargeted News ServiceApril 7, 2020 Tuesday 7:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1001 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota, issued the following news release:Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) led Members of Congress on a series of letters to the CEOs of American companies, calling on them to stop the use of forced labor of the Uyghur Muslim population in China. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute has painstakingly tracked both forced transfers of workers from Xinjiang to other parts of China, and the use of Uyghur labor in factories within Xinjiang.The letters were signed by Rep. James P. McGovern, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, Rep. Andy Levin, Rep. Jan Schakowsky, and Rep. Jamie Raskin."The treatment of Uyghur and other Muslim people by the Chinese government - which the Simon-Skjodt Center for the Prevention of Genocide at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum has determined may amount to crimes against humanity - has drawn fierce and sustained bipartisan condemnation," the Members wrote. "American companies using forced Uyghur labor, intentionally or unintentionally, is profoundly disturbing. Among the acts that comprise crimes against humanity, Uyghurs have been allegedly subjected to enslavement, arbitrary detention, torture, enforced disappearance, and persecution against a collective group of people. Put simply, it is our strong belief that nobody should be profiting from these conditions. As you are well aware, American companies represent this country in your business abroad. It is essential that your values are in line with the basic principles of human rights.""Importing goods that were made in whole or in part by forced labor is a violation of American law, and numerous international human rights and labor rights standards," Rep. Omar said. "No American company should be profiting from the use of gulag labor, or from Uyghur prisoners who are transferred for work after their time in Xinjiang's concentration camps. This harkens back to some of the darkest moments in our history, and Americans want to know that the clothing and electronics they are buying are not tainted by the use of forced labor. Particularly during this global health crisis, the connections between us and the need to protect the most vulnerable could not be starker or more urgent."Tim CookCEOAppleOne Apple ParkwayCupertino, CA 95014Dear Mr. Cook,We are writing to express our deep concern regarding recent reporting from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute that links your company to the use of forced Uyghur labor in China./1Last year, the Senate passed the Uighur Intervention and Global Humanitarian Unified Response Act unanimously, and the House of Representatives passed it by a vote of 407-1./2The treatment of Uyghur and other Muslim people by the Chinese government - which the Simon-Skjodt Center for the Prevention of Genocide at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum has determined may amount to crimes against humanity/3 - has drawn fierce and sustained bipartisan condemnation. That American companies would be using forced Uyghur labor, intentionally or unintentionally, is profoundly disturbing.The specific claims against Apple in ASPI's report include your alleged use of:* Changji Esquel Textile Co. Ltd, which participated in a "job fair" to organize labor transfers in Xinjiang, and used an admitted 34 forced Uyghur workers;* Foxconn Technology, one of the factories in Henan province where 560 workers were transferred from Xinjiang in late 2019, and the facility that reportedly makes half of the world's iPhones;* Hubei Yihong Precision Manufacturing Co. Ltd, where 105 Uyghur workers were transferred on May 17th, 2018;* Highbroad Advanced Material Co. Ltd, where more than 500 Uyghur workers were transferred in November 2017, and which sells predominantly to BOE Technology Group, reportedly set to become Apple's second-largest OLED screen supplier by 2021;5)* O-Film Technology Co. Ltd, which received a transfer of 700 people from Xinjiang in May 2017 and where a Uyghur worker claimed to have worked with more than 1,000 Uyghurs, and which you personally visited in 2017.As you are no doubt aware, the import of products made wholly or in part with forced or prison labor is in violation of Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 USC 1307.) It is also in violation of numerous international human rights and labor rights standards.Among the acts that comprise crimes against humanity, Uyghurs have been allegedly subjected to enslavement, arbitrary detention, torture, enforced disappearance, and persecution against a collective group of people. Put simply, it is our strong belief that nobody should be profiting from these conditions.As you are well aware, American companies represent this country in your business abroad. It is essential that your values are in line with the basic principles of human rights.In light of the gravity of the situation, as we consider legislative options, we ask the following:* Were you aware of these allegations before the release of ASPI's report?* Has your company in fact sourced from the factories identified in the ASPI report? If so, for how long?* What precautions have you taken regarding your company's supply chain in China, especially in regards to goods or materials produced in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), excludes any use of forced labor and is in compliance with Section 307?* What audits or investigations has your company undertaken to ensure that your factories or the factories you source from do not use forced labor? How do you ensure that such audits or investigations are independent? Will you make available copies of any audits or investigations carried out over the last three years?Sincerely,Ilhan OmarMember of CongressAdditional signers:Rep. James P. McGovernRep.

A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a figure below 50 suggests contraction. "For investors this is enough for now because all they wanted to see was a glimmer of hope," Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade, said in a morning note.On Monday, the World Health Organization pointed to signs of stabilization in Europe and expressed hope that outbreaks in Italy and Spain are approaching their peak, Bloomberg reported. Italy reported 4,050 new cases on Monday, its lowest daily tally in nearly two weeks.Read more: UBS outlines 3 major investing themes the coronavirus crisis is shaping today - and breaks down how they'll play out in the years to comeAnalysts were suspicious of the sudden resurgence of Chinese manufacturing.The statistics "stretch the bounds of belief," Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said in a morning note.Read more: Macro hedge funds are soaring while quants and stock-pickers tank.

COULD CHINA'S NEW DF-100 MISSILES REALLY SINK AMERICA'S CARRIERS?States News ServiceMarch 5, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1386 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for the National Interest (former the Nixon Center):Key point: Beijing is keeping the details of the DF-100 close to its chest. But from what is publically known, it seems that this new anti-ship missile could post a real problem.On October 1, 2019, the People's Liberation Army rolled out an impressive procession of advanced new weapons systems to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the People's Republic of China.This article first appeared earlier in 2019 and is being reposted due to reader interest.Still, many of the weapons officially debuted that day, like the DF-17, the first hypersonic missile to officially enter regular service, had been public knowledge for some time.But that was not the case for the regiment of sixteen ten-wheel TEL trucks that came rolling past Tiananmen Square, each lugging two octagonal launch canisters with the designation 'DF-100' prominently stenciled on their sides. You can see the video footage here.The DF, or Dongfeng ("East Wind") designation, is mostly reserved for China's many types of ballistic missiles, which arc high into the atmosphere before plunging down at tremendous speeds. But the existence of the DF-100 had never been reported before.Curiously, the announcer seemed to ignore the DF designation."Here comes the CJ-100 cruise missile formation...the latest in the CJ series. The hypersonic weapon features high precision, and long-range strike capability, as well as fast response."The CJ-designator, for Chang Ji n ("Long Sword"), is used for a land-attack cruise missile, which skim close to the earth's surface over hundreds of miles. So what on Earth is the CJ-100 or DF-100?The "CJ-100"The DF-100's launch canisters afforded no glimpse of the missiles supposedly inside. But a week earlier on September 25 the PLA Rocket Force posted a video montage including a two-second clip of the launch from a desert test site of a "CJ-100" missile which had never been seen beforethen removed that segment shortly afterward.On the face of it, the PLARF accidentally leaked footage of heretofore secret missile. More likely, this may have been a viral marketing ploy to create buzz in advance of the DF-100's official reveal during the parade. Note that the missile in the clip was launched by the same ten-wheel truck-based launcher subsequently seen in the parade.Anonymous sources told Chinese media the CJ-100 was a long-range supersonic cruise missile with a "near space" flight altitude, capable of speeds between three and four times the speed of sound. Analysts speculated that the unusual strakes at the bottom of the missile were possibly intakes for a ramjet a propulsion system, which is optimized for sustained supersonic travel.A larger-diameter rocket booster at its base (described as identical in size to that of a DF-11A short-range ballistic missile) is designed to loft the missile upwards at high speeds, at which point the booster is discarded and the ramjet takes over.But at the anniversary parade, state media organs described the DF/CJ-100 as hypersonic missilesmeaning they travel at least five times the speed of sound.The confused DF and CJ designations may be because hypersonic missiles travel at extremely high speeds and exit the atmosphere like a ballistic missilebut then adopt a flatter trajectory during which they remain maneuverable, allowing them to descend upon their target faster, and making them harder to intercept with anti-ballistic missile defenses.China's unique-looking DF-17 land-attack hypersonic missile (technically, the DF-17 is the carrier for a triangular hypersonic glide-vehicle called the DF-Z) was given a DF designator, so perhaps the CJ-100 was re-designated for reason of consistency.But why is China bothering to develop a second land-based hypersonic missile?'Carrier-Killer' ReduxA parade review by the South China Morning Post sheds some light:"A military insider says the weapon is now in active service. It has a range of about 2000-3000km [1242-1864 miles] and is mainly designed for big targets at sea.""Big targets at sea" almost certainly means "aircraft carriers."A China Times article on the September 25 launch described it as being for "attack large enemy surface ships and high-value targets such as communications and command hubs."China has already developed two truck-born "carrier-killing" anti-ship ballistic missiles, the DF-21D and DF-26B, with ranges of around 1,000 and 2,000 miles respectively. In 2019, the PLARF test-fired several on maritime targets, possibly for the first time. In response, the U.S. Navy has developed the SM-3 and SM-6 anti-ballistic missile interceptors to defend its surface ships against the new threat.The DF-100, therefore, maybe intended to complement China's ASBMs with a weapon which flies on a different trajectory and may prove even more challenging for air-defense missiles to intercept.One of the chief difficulties facing any very long-range anti-ship weaponsboth ballistic and hypersonicis that there's no way the launch unit will be able to directly track a carrier over a thousand miles away. Instead the battery must receive the initial targeting data from a separate pair of eyes, such as a drone or patrol plane in radar range of the target ship. The missile then soars towards the target's general vicinity using inertial and GPS guidance, preferably while receiving mid-course updates (as ships are, of course, moving targets), before a seeker on the missile takes over for precise guidance in the terminal phase.The China Times writes the CJ-100 likely benefits from new composite guidance technology designed to integrate multiple systems, including inertial navigation, terrain image-matching, and satellite navigation using China's Beidou constellation.The description of the CJ/DF-100 being 'fast responding' therefore makes sense given it would have only fleeting windows of opportunity to exploit relayed targeting data on a moving ship, and likely implies use of a solid-fuel rocket booster as liquid fuel is impractical for a prompt-response system.A Chinese defense blogger points out that the missile's mid-body fins and peculiar low-body strakes resemble those on the SY-400 short-range export ballistic missile and U.S. Navy's SM-6 missile. As a 'penetration aid,' the authors claims the missile possesses both an integral jammer to disrupt hostile sensors, and be hardened for resistance to enemy countermeasures (ECM)which it claims "is a first for a domestically-built missile." The author points out that it's increasingly common for modern missiles to do double duty as single-use reconnaissance, jamming or decoy systems.To be clear, the claims from non-official Chinese media must be treated cautiously as being anonymously sourced, or as merely informed conjecture and speculation.Many important characteristics regarding the DF-100 remain unclear: is it capable of carrying a nuclear as well as conventional warhead? Is it also intended to deliver surface strikes against command and control centers as a backup to the DF-17? Will the DF-100 be adapted for launch from an H-6N strategic bomber or missile destroyer? Does it actually glide at hypersonic speeds during the midcourse phase, or does it only 'dash' to those velocities during its terminal phase?What is clear, however, is that the Chinese government is telling the world that the DF-100 is a hypersonic, regional-level anti-ship missile that will impose a new, challenging threat-vector for long-range attacks against large warships over a thousand miles of China's coastline.It's also noteworthy that the new missile has apparently been developed and ostensibly entered operational service without making it to the public eye until a week agoand without receiving specific mention in the U.S. Department of Defense's annual Chinese military assessment.Sebastien Roblin holds a master's degree in conflict resolution from Georgetown University and served as a university instructor for the Peace Corps in China.

FBI: China trying to hack U.S. firms for coronavirus dataUPIMay 13, 2020 Wednesday 1:23 PM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 304 wordsByline: CLYDE HUGHESDateline: May 13 BodyThe FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency warned Wednesday the Chinese government and affiliates are looking to hack U.S. organizations doing coronavirus research.The FBI and CISA said all U.S. firms conducting COVID-19 work should maintain cybersecurity to prevent theft."These actors have been observed attempting to identify and illicitly obtain valuable intellectual property and public health data related to vaccines, treatments and testing from networks and personnel affiliated with COVID-19-related research," the FBI and CISA statement said."The potential theft of this information jeopardizes the delivery of secure, effective and efficient treatment options," the statement said.They urged agencies working on COVID-19 research to patch all systems for critical cyber vulnerabilities, actively scan web applications for unauthorized access, modification, or anomalous activities, require multi-factor authentication and suspend access of users exhibiting unusual activity.In a statement Wednesday, Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., the ranking member in the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, called on the Trump administration to take stronger action against the Chinese government for coronavirus hacks."By targeting hospitals and healthcare providers, these state-sponsored hackers put the lives of Americans who are seeking care at risk," Peters said. "The administration should use public pressure and the threat of sanctions and additional indictments to deter future Chinese government attacks against research institutions."Peters also called for increased cybersecurity funding for hospitals, medical and research institutions and directing Human and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to prioritize information technology in his department to improve cybersecurity.Load-Date: May 13, 2020End of Document

California man gets prison for working as agent for ChinaAssociated Press InternationalMarch 17, 2020 Tuesday 11:09 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 468 wordsDateline: OAKLAND, Calif. BodyOAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - A former San Francisco Bay Area tour operator was sentenced to four years in prison for serving as an unregistered agent for China's Ministry of State Security in a scheme to use "dead drops" to pick up digital memory cards from a source and take them to China.Xuehua Edward Peng, 56, also was sentenced Monday in Oakland, California, federal court to pay a $30,000 fine, the U.S. Justice Department said.Peng pleaded guilty on Nov. 25, 2019, to acting at the direction and under the control of ministry of state security officials in China. If convicted at trial, he could have faced up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.The Hayward, California, resident admitted that while he was on a business trip to China in March 2015, an official of the People's Republic of China introduced himself and asked Peng to use his U.S. citizenship to assist him.Peng came to understand the official worked for China's Ministry of State Security but agreed to take actions in the U.S. on behalf of China and learned how to use dead drops: rent hotel rooms, leave money and leave for several hours."The official instructed Peng to return later and retrieve small electronic storage devices that the source would leave for him," a Justice Department statement said. "Thereafter, Peng was to fly to the PRC and deliver the retrieved devices to the PRC official. Peng never met nor interacted with the individual who left the devices for him and was instructed not to access the information stored on the SD cards."Peng made practice run in June 2015 and then participated two dead drops in the San Francisco Bay Area between October 2015 and April 2016. He then made three dead drops from Columbus, Georgia, before telling the Chinese official that he wanted to return to dead drops in the San Francisco Bay Area.The U.S. was never at risk because the information left for Peng was provided by an FBI double agent who had also been approached for spy work by the Chinese government but decided to inform the U.S. government instead, prosecutors have said.Peng was arrested in September 2019 before completing the next dead drop."This case exposed one of the ways that Chinese intelligence officers work to collect classified information from the United States without having to step foot in this country," Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers said in a statement.Investigators described Peng as a sightseeing operator in the San Francisco area for Chinese visitors and students. Public records listed Peng as president of U.S. Tour and Travel in San Francisco, but no website for the company was found.Peng entered the country in 2001 on a temporary business visa. He became a lawful permanent resident in 2006 following his marriage and was naturalized in September 2012.Load-Date: March 18, 2020End of Document

Wall Street ignores tensions between US and China and attempts ups in last session of the weekCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 22, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 531 wordsBodyWall Street is trying the uprisings this Friday. Its main indices begin the session with moderate movements and mixed sign. Sales do not prevail, unlike on the Asian and European stock exchanges (before the opening of the US market), despite renewed tensions between the UNITED States and China and sharp oil declines.The New York Stock Exchange closed Thursday with moderate relegations. Ecotrader Advisor Joan Cabrero indicates that the selective Dow Jones and S&P; 500 are "short-term pressing on important resistors". In the case of the latter, it points out, they are in the 3,000 points, a "very important" level."In this environment sales can put the index back on pressure and that's why you have to keep an eye on what's going on in the index," the expert warns. He adds that if the S&P; 500 exceeds 3,000 integers at the end of a day, it will open the door "to a continuity of the rebound towards probably the 3,140-point environment."At the Dow Jones the resistance is in the 24,765 units, Cabrero says. "A closure on this resistance would a priori a sign of strength," he says. Although it warns: "what happened in Europe could also happen weeks ago, that the indices split similar resistances before the last sharp fall."IBM announces layoffsAt the corporate level, IBM technology is now focused on the impact of the coronavirus crisis on its business, but has not wanted to quantify them. His actions barely move this Friday.Also, processor manufacturer Nvidia sees its titles rise moderately in the parquet after publishing its first quarter results. Among other figures, it has reported revenues of more than $3 billion.A new focus of tension?However, the indexes do not stray from their 'levels to attack'. The rises are attempting this Friday, leaving aside renewed tensions between the United States and China, the world's two largest powers.In the city of Hong Kong, the Chinese government's rejection of its plans to impose a national security law "cutting citizen freedoms" is growing, the Department of Income Analysis 4 explains. His bag has fallen by almost 6% this morning.The controversial regulations will be discussed at the National People's Assembly (ANP) that began yesterday, and is also a new "new focus of tension between China and the US," these experts say.According to Bloomerg, Beijing has been willing to move forward with the first part of the trade agreement signed in January, as agreed by both nations earlier this month. But the 'frictions' between the two powers, the world's largest, have increased in recent days in the face of US President Donald Trump's accusations of the Asian giant of not controlling "the plague" of the coronavirus.Oil goes downA tension that occurs in the midst of the global recession precisely because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, the Chinese government, for the first time in 26 years, has not set an economic growth target for this year.A lack of forecasts that affect not only stock markets, but also oil, whose prices fall strongly this Friday. The barrel of Brent, a reference in Europe, drops by 3% to $35 a barrel and US West Texas (WTI) loses 3%, to $33. The descents were more pronounced in the morning.Load-Date: May 23, 2020End of Document

Ellomay Capital Reports Publication of Financial Statements of Dorad Energy Ltd. for the Year Ended December 31, 2019PR NewswireMarch 30, 2020 Monday 1:00 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1638 wordsDateline: TEL-AVIV, Israel, March 30, 2020 BodyPR NewswireEllomay Capital Ltd.(NYSE American: ELLO) (TASE: ELLO) ("Ellomay" or the "Company"), a renewable energy and power generator and developer of renewable energy and power projects in Europe and Israel, today reported the publication in Israel of financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 of Dorad Energy Ltd. ("Dorad"), in which Ellomay currently indirectly holds approximately 9.4%.On March 26, 2020, Amos Luzon Entrepreneurship and Energy Group Ltd. (f/k/a U. Dori Group Ltd.) (the "Luzon Group"), an Israeli public company that currently holds 50% of U. Dori Energy Infrastructures Ltd. ("Dori Energy"), which, in turn, holds 18.75% of Dorad, published its annual report in Israel based on the requirements of the Israeli Securities Law, 1968. Based on applicable regulatory requirements, the annual report of the Luzon Group includes the financial statements of Dorad for the same period.The financial statements of Dorad for the year ended December 31, 2019 were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. Ellomay will include its indirect share of these results (through its holdings in Dori Energy) in its financial results for this period, which are currently expected to be published on or about March 31, 2020 and will include the financial statements of Dorad in its annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2019.  In an effort to provide Ellomay's shareholders with access to Dorad's financial results (which were published in Hebrew), Ellomay hereby provides a convenience translation of Dorad's financial results.Dorad Financial HighlightsDorad's revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 - approximately NIS 2,700,766,000. Dorad's operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2019 - approximately NIS 397,841,000.Dorad informed the Company that in connection with the recent outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and the actions taken by governments and authorities to prevent the spread of the virus, Dorad is acting in accordance with the instructions of the Israeli Electricity and Health authorities and that due to the COVID-19 crisis there is a certain decrease in the electricity consumption of Dorad's customers and of the Israeli Electric Company. Dorad is examining the methods for managing in the event of a decrease in its revenues as a result. Dorad's financial statements note in connection with a natural gas supply agreement executed between Dorad and Energian Ltd. during 2017 that on February 5, 2020, Dorad was informed by Energian Ltd. that due to the COVID-19 spread in China, the Chinese government issued restrictions on travel and transportation including to an area where portions of its gas production facilities are manufactured and therefore there a delay is expected in the supply of gas to Dorad. Dorad notes that in the event of delays, it may purchase natural gas from its current supplier at a higher price than the price set in the agreement with Energian.Based on the information provided by Dorad, the demand for electricity by Dorad's customers is seasonal and is affected by, inter alia, the climate prevailing in that season. The months of the year are split into three seasons as follows: the summer season – the months of July and August; the winter season - the months of December, January and February; and intermediate seasons – (spring and autumn), the months from March to June and from September to November. There is a higher hourly demand for electricity during the winter and summer seasons, and the average electricity consumption per hour is higher in these seasons than in the intermediate seasons and is even characterized by peak demands due to extreme climate conditions of heat or cold. In addition, Dorad's revenues are affected by the change in load and time tariffs - TAOZ (an electricity tariff that varies across seasons and across the day in accordance with demand hour clusters), as, on average, TAOZ tariffs are higher in the summer season than in the intermediate and winter seasons.Due to various reasons, including the effects of the spread of COVID-19 and the economic impact of such spread and of actions taken by governments and authorities, the results included herein may not be indicative of full year results in the future.A translation of the financial results for Dorad as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 and as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 is included at the end of this press release.Ellomay does not undertake to separately report Dorad's financial results in a press release in the future.

Laura Bozzo supports Carmen Salinas and calls Chinese "genocidase"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 25, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 330 wordsBodyMEXICO CITY, March 25.- Laura Bozzo, with a social media post, came out in defense of Carmen Salinas, saying that people of Chinese nationality are genocidal and that they hid information regarding the Covid-19 coronavirus that caused a global pandemic.   "The Chinese Embassy calls Carmen Salinas ignorant; demands a public apology. My total support for Carmen Salinas, the most serious thing is that the Chinese government hid what was going on and caused this pandemic so for me they are GENOCIDAS," reads in the driver's post.  The comments the netizens made in Bozzo's post divide opinions, some support her by saying that the actress should not apologize and give Bozzo the reason saying that China lied to the world, others say that "God makes them and they get together" , as a form of mockery. Others criticize the consumption of animals in Asian society. "I don't see why they claim you if it's a reality that they are the ones who make up the illegal wildlife and exotic animal industry in the world and generate diseases," a user of the twitter social network posted.  But what happened to Carmen Salinas? She was pointed to by the Chinese embassy as an ignorant person by the Chinese embassy and demanded a public apology for comments she made to people of Asian origin and her relationship with Covid-19. "That's what's happening to little bugs for eating puppies and kittens, hey, don't play. That's why he gave them that disease. They were not punished by God our lord, life punished them," the actress of "Beautiful Night" said. In the face of these statements, the Chinese Embassy in Mexico mentioned that it took note of the interview given by the actress asking for an apology because, according to the statement, she used a racist and discriminatory word (chinito).

US threatens to expel China Telecom from its marketCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 10, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 398 wordsBodyThe United States threatened to prevent Beijing-controlled China Telecom from operating in the U.S. market due to legal and security risks,the Department of Justice announced.Major government departments, including Defense, State, and Homeland Security, recommended in a text common to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) "revoke and cancel" authorizations from China Telecom's local subsidiary to provide international telecommunications services to and from the United States."Executive branch agencies identified considerable and unacceptable national security and law enforcement risks associated with China Telecom's operations, making FCC authorizations inconsistent with the public interest," the Justice Department said Thursday in a statement.The move could mean that the hundreds of millions of telephony and Internet customers of China Telecom, China's second-largest mobile operator, lose connectivity to the United States or across the United States.The text considers China Telecom to be vulnerable to beijing's "exploitation, influence and control," and that its operation enables the Chinese government to "engage in malicious cyber activities that allow economic espionage and the interruption and diversion of U.S. communications."The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Friday expressed its "strong opposition" to the recommendation."We urge the United States to comply with market principles, stop its mis practices of using national security as an argument, and politicize trade issues, and stop unfair repression of Chinese companies," said spokesman Zhao Lijian.The recommendation came just five days after President Donald Trump's administration formed an intergovernmental commission to formally discuss the national security implications of the activities of foreign telecommunications companies operating in the United States.In September 2019, two senators, Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Tom Cotton, called on the FCC to consider banning China Telecom and another company from that country, China Unicom, from participating in the U.S. market for national security issues.Thursday's statement does not specifically explain what China Telecom did to provoke the recommendation that it be expelled.It merely states that the company provided misinformation to U.S. authorities about where it stores its records in the country and how it manages cybersecurity.Load-Date: April 11, 2020End of Document

China loses its control in Europe without glamour: Andreas KluthCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 7, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 923 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- If 2019 was the year Europeans began to have serious doubts about Beijing's geopolitical intentions, 2020 could go into history as the defiant time they turned against China. And it's not because they blame the Chinese for originating the coronavirus, as U.S. President Donald Trump and his secretary of state seem to obsessively insist. It is because China, in trying to capitalize on the pandemic with a surprisingly unsophisticated propaganda campaign, inadvertently showed Europeans its cynicism.The motivation behind Chinese propaganda is pretty obvious: with the turmoil currently living in the U.S. under Trump, Beijing sees an opportunity to finally live up to a second superpower. The biggest geopolitical prize in this contest is the European Union, previously securely anchored in the transatlantic field, but in recent years increasingly nervous about Trump and open to China in terms of trade, investment and influence.As the epicentre of the pandemic moved from Wuhan to European countries such as Italy and Spain, China initially had the right idea. From mid-March, it sent to Europe large quantities of cover caps and other medical equipment, adorned with Chinese flags. Some of these shipments proved poor quality, but people perceived it as a good gesture. China could have stopped there, in the "bulging diplomacy" and come out furious.But he didn't. Instead, Beijing's henchmen began to spread misinformation, apparently intending to describe EU democracies as ineffective and authoritarian China as comparatively strong. In France, the Chinese embassy published on its website an accusation claiming that French nursing homes were leaving the elderly to their fate. In Italy, Chinese puppets spread stories that coronavirus had originated in Europe, or manipulated video clips showing Romans playing the Chinese anthem in gratitude. In Germany, Chinese diplomats urged (unsuccessfully) government officials to issue public praise for China.In response, the EU diplomatic service produced a report on the disinformation campaigns being carried out by China and the other accustomed: Russia. China quickly worsened a bad situation, relying on the authors of the publication to mitigate it. In response, members of the European Parliament were further outraged and demanded assurances that the EU will not self-censorship under Chinese pressure.In some European countries, these tensions are not new. Even before the coronavirus, the Swedes were shocked by the Chinese ambassador's unbeated threats against his press, and some politicians want to expel him from the country. But other EU members have voluntarily accepted China's harsh treatment.They include several countries in the south and east of the EU, such as Croatia and Hungary, which have signed China's two major geopolitical efforts. One is a Forum led by Chinese called 17+1, in which Beijing (1) attempts to organize economic cooperation with 17 European countries. The other is the silk road Economic Strip initiative, a global infrastructure project that skeptics see as a Chinese attempt to turn Asian, African and European countries into economic vassals.Even before the pandemic, Europeans were disappointed by the unilaterality of these "associations," both economically and politically. Take, for example, the rather symbolic fight between Prague and Beijing, which they agreed to be sister cities: Prague accepted the policy of One China (which denies Taiwan being a country) and Beijing delivered, among other things, cute pandas to the zoo ofPrague. But the pandas never came. As other conflicts intensified between the two partners, Beijing recanted. Prague's mayor, fed up, found a different sister city in Taipei, Taiwan.China's largest trading partner in Europe, Germany, has also stood up after several Chinese companies acquired stakes in German technology, from a robot manufacturer to a power company. Last year, Berlin tightened the rules on such sensitive acquisitions. The EU did the same, with a common investment selection approach coming into effect this year. In order to preserve Europe's technological and industrial autonomy, it has the implicit objective of keeping China at bay.The general direction of EU policy towards China will be the deployment of this year's fifth-generation, or 5G, telecommunications networks. Although the Trump administration harasses Europeans into boycotting China's largest equipment manufacturer, Huawei Technologies Co., EU members have been divided or undecided about whether to allow the company to bid on contracts. In Germany, the trend seems to tilt against Huawei. Even the UK, now outside the EU, could reconsider its decision to allow Huawei to participate in its 5G plans.Beijing is the only one to blame for all this. Somehow, Chinese officials have managed to offend Europeans across the continent, who generally disagree on anything. At the beginning of the year, the 2020 agenda was full of Sino-European summits to celebrate ever-deeper ties. On the other hand, the pandemic is likely to be an opportunity for Europeans to start emancipating themselves from a bad relationship.Even under the assumption that the real goal of China's child propaganda campaign is its internal audience or the Chinese diaspora, this "diplomacy" doesn't really seem like a brilliant strategy. If it reflects Beijing's quality of government, fears about China's rise may have been disproportionate.Original Note:How China Is Losing Its Grip in Europe: Andreas Kluth©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: May 8, 2020End of Document

AUSTRALIA-CHINA TENSIONS OVER CALL FOR GLOBAL COVID-19 PROBEStates News ServiceApril 30, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 418 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: SYDNEY BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):By Phil MercerAn extraordinary diplomatic dispute is intensifying between Australia and China over the new coronavirus. Canberra wants an international investigation into the source of COVID-19 and its spread, a move that has infuriated Beijing.China has rejected criticism from other governments about how it handled the outbreak of COVID-19. The highly contagious and deadly new coronavirus is thought to have originated at an animal market in Wuhan, a large city in China's Hubei province.Australia is pushing for an international investigation into the origins of the disease, and how and why it became a global pandemic.While the idea is likely to have support from U.S. President Donald Trump, France and Britain have said now is the time to fight the virus, not to look for who to blame.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, though, says the world deserves answers on the deadly COVID-19 outbreak."Australia will continue to, of course, pursue what is a very reasonable and sensible course of action," he said. "It has shut down the global economy. It would seem entirely reasonable and sensible that the world would want to have an independent assessment of how this all occurred so we can learn the lessons and prevent it from happening again."China sees the inquiry as a political witch hunt, orchestrated by the U.S. and designed to humiliate Beijing. Its ambassador to Canberra has hinted at retaliation and a boycott of Australian products and universities, described by a senior Australian government minister as "threats of economic coercion."However, Long Zhou, China's consul general in the state of Victoria, said Beijing has acted in good faith over the COVID-19 pandemic."China has attached great importance to international health cooperation," he said. "The Chinese government has released information related to the COVID-19 in (an) open, transparent and responsible manner."Some experts believe Australia's relationship with China, already strained with allegations of political meddling and cyber espionage, is now at its lowest point since diplomatic ties were established in 1972.Australia has much to lose. China is its biggest trading partner, and its demand for natural resources has helped to underpin its recent prosperity. Before Australia closed its borders because of the COVID-19 outbreak, Chinese travelers and students were also important to the success of its tourism and higher education sectors.Load-Date: May 1, 2020End of Document

Zai Lab Announces First Chinese Patient Dosed in the Global Phase 3 ATTACK Trial of Sulbactam-Durlobactam for Patients with Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter InfectionsGlobeNewswireMay 18, 2020 Monday 4:30 AM PTCopyright 2020 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: HEALTHLength: 1298 wordsBodySHANGHAI and SAN FRANCISCO, May  18, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zai Lab Limited (NASDAQ: ZLAB), an innovative commercial stage biopharmaceutical company, today announced dosing of the first Chinese patient in the global ATTACK (Acinetobacter Treatment Trial Against Colistin) Phase 3 registrational trial evaluating the combination of sulbactam and durlobactam (SUL-DUR) for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections."With over 200,000 occurrences estimated each year, China ranks among the countries with the highest incidence of A. baumannii infections in the world. Most cases are caused by strains resistant to carbapenem antibiotics which are very difficult organisms to treat. For these patients where mortality rates are approaching 50%, new antibiotics replacing colistin are clearly needed," said Harald Reinhart, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Autoimmune and Infectious Diseases. "Given the excellent in-vitro activity of sulbactam/durlobactam against MDR Acinetobacter and the demonstrated safety of the combination in clinical trials, we look forward to collaborating with our partner, Entasis Therapeutics, in the ATTACK trial."ATTACK is a global, two-part Phase 3 registrational trial enrolling approximately 300 patients with pneumonia and bloodstream infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. The data readout is expected in early 2021. Zai Lab and its partner, Entasis Therapeutics, will cooperate in conducting the trial in China with Zai Lab taking the operational lead by conducting the screening, enrollment and treatment of patients and coordinating development, registration and commercialization of SUL-DUR in specified countries in the Asia-Pacific region including Japan.About Acinetobacter baumannii InfectionsA. baumannii is a Gram-negative bacterium causing severe infections associated with high mortality and has emerged as a cause of numerous global outbreaks, displaying ever-increasing rates of antibiotic resistance, which greatly limits treatment options. Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has placed carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii at the top of its list of "Critical" priority pathogens for new antibiotics. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) also recognizes A. baumannii as a serious public health threat and estimates that 63% of A. baumannii are multidrug-resistant.In China, A. baumannii accounts for approximately 11% of total Gram-negative infections. Based on a national surveillance of over 1,300 hospitals in China, there are over 200,000 A. baumannii infections per year, although the actual incidence is estimated to be much larger. The resistance of A. baumannii to the carbapenem class of antibiotics has increased significantly, estimated at 60% in 2016, with some provinces as high as 70-80%. In other Asia-Pacific countries, such as Japan and Korea, this pathogen has also become an increasingly significant challenge for physicians. Due to the high rates of multidrug-resistant infections, the Chinese government has announced the goal of developing one to two innovative anti-infective drugs by 2020.About Sulbactam-Durlobactam (SUL-DUR) Durlobactam (DUR; previously designated ETX2514) is a novel broad-spectrum intravenous inhibitor of class A, C and D beta-lactamases. Sulbactam (SUL) is a generic Î²-lactam antimicrobial with activity against Acinetobacter baumannii; however, Î²-lactamase-mediated resistance to sulbactam is now widespread rendering it generally ineffective. In preclinical studies, durlobactam inhibits the Î²-lactamases commonly found in A. baumannii thus restoring sulbactam's antimicrobial activity. Entasis Therapeutics is developing SUL-DUR (previously designated ETX2514SUL), a fixed-dose combination of durlobactam and sulbactam, as a novel intravenous antibiotic for the treatment of a variety of serious multidrug-resistant infections caused by A. baumannii. A Phase 2 trial and several Phase 1 trials of SUL-DUR have recently been completed with positive results for pharmacokinetics and safety/tolerability. SUL-DUR has been designated a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and awarded Fast Track status.About Zai LabZai Lab (NASDAQ:ZLAB) is an innovative commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on bringing transformative medicines for cancer, infectious and autoimmune diseases to patients in China and around the world. To quickly target the large, fast-growing segments of China's pharmaceutical market and address unmet medical needs, Zai Lab's experienced team has secured partnerships with leading global biopharma companies, generating a broad pipeline of innovative drug candidates.

US says Chinese hackers might be targeting virus researchersAssociated Press InternationalMay 13, 2020 Wednesday 5:06 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICAL NEWSLength: 359 wordsByline: By BEN FOX, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - Organizations conducting research into COVID-19 may be targeted by computer hackers linked to the Chinese government, according to the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security.Neither agency cited any specific examples Wednesday, but they warned that institutions and companies involved in work on vaccines, treatments and testing for the novel coronavirus should take additional security measures to protect data and be aware of the potential threat."China's efforts to target these sectors pose a significant threat to our nation's response to COVID-19," said a statement from the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. "This announcement is intended to raise awareness for research institutions and the American public and provide resources and guidance for those who may be targeted."It comes amid heightened tensions between the two countries over the source of the outbreak and Trump administration complaints that China did not adequately alert the world to the danger posed by the new coronavirus.The warning also echoes long-standing U.S. complaints that China has engaged in the wholesale theft of technology and trade secrets to build its economy.Institutions that have received media attention for their efforts related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, should assume that they would be targeted and should take precautions, the Department of Justice said."The potential theft of this information jeopardizes the delivery of secure, effective, and efficient treatment options," it said.The FBI and the cybersecurity agency said they were issuing the alert to raise public awareness of the potential threat and said additional technical details would be released in the coming days.China has defended its response to the virus, and Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian denied the government was involved in any attempt to steal virus-related data on Monday, after some media reported on the warning in advance."We are leading the world in COVID-19 treatment and vaccine research," Zhao told reporters. "It is immoral to target China with rumors and slanders in the absence of any evidence."Load-Date: May 14, 2020End of Document

The history of the U.S. military man who was unth proof of introducing the coronavirus into China: now his life is "a nightmare"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 27, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1001 wordsBodySince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, conspiracy theories and misinformation have overflowed the network, spreading more quickly than the virus.These conjectures, disseminated without any evidence, blame each other for having synthetically created the disease to pursue particular interests. And in recent weeks, one of the most strongly hit by the web is the one that directly attacks Maatje Benassi.The US Army reservist and mother of two has become the target of conspiracy lovers, who place it at the source of the pandemic, and accuse her without evidence of having brought the virus to China; a hypothesis that has triggered hundreds of thousands of videos on Youtube, millions of social media posts, and delusional blog posts, turning the lives of Benassi and his family into hell."It's like waking up from a bad dream and getting into a nightmare day after day," Maatje Benassi said in an exclusive interview with CNN, where he broke his silence for the first time.(Photo: Twitter/CNN)When the slander and slander began on her, her social media and those of her husband, Matt Benassi, were filled with threatening messages from strangers and users who disbelieved them from fake accounts. Although they closed their profiles, the couple's mailing address was leaked, and every day, they receive intimidating letters in their mailbox that make them fear for their lives."I want everyone to stop harassing me, because this is a cyberbullying for me and it's gone out of hand," the military said, trying to hold back the tears.Despite efforts by tech giants to eliminate fake news during the pandemic, they were unable to erase the thousands of publications that framed the American reservist. And even today, there are posts on some social networks.As they told the U.S. television, despite working for the government, they feel just as powerless and unprotected as anyone else who has been the victim of this type of harassment. After consulting a law firm, the lawyers told them there was little that could be done. At the police station, they got the same answer.Maatje and Mat Benassi (Photo: Twitter/CNN)"Law enforcement will tell you that there is nothing that can be done because there is freedom of opinion in the country. Then they say, 'Consult a civil lawyer,' so we did. We guided the lawyer. You quickly realize that for people like us, it's too expensive to bring something like this to trial," Matt explained.Both he and Maatje continue to come to work. She is a civilian employee at the U.S. Army base Fort Belvoir in Virginia, where she serves as a security officer. After joining the ranks of the Air Force, he retired and now also works as a civilian employee at the Pentagon, home of the country's Department of Defense, also located in Virginia.Neither has tested positive for COVID-19, nor have they had any symptoms. Despite this, day after day, they are victims of unsubstanced accusations and feel the helplessness of not being able to stop a colluding that spreads in an uncontenmentible manner, to the point of being accepted and published by the Party's mediaChinese Communist.Why Maatje Benassi?Maatje Benassi participated last October at the Wuhan World Military Games (Photo: Twitter/CNN)When the coronavirus emerged in late December in the Chinese city of Wuhan, some slanderers and conspirators unceded that the disease was a biological weapon introduced into the Asian country by the US. Zhao Lijian, spokesman for the Chinese government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs publicly encouraged this theory, and said via social media that the U.S. military had brought the virus to Wuhan.Then Mark Esper, US Secretary of Defense, came out to disprofer the grave indictment of Zhao Lijian, which he called "ridiculous and irresponsible."It wasn't until March that all the floodlights focused on Maatje Benassi.The conspiracy theory is based mainly on the fact that the Virginia reservist participated in October at the World Military Games held in Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus outbreak began.It is, in essence, a kind of Olympics that contest the different armies of the world. Maatje Benassi participated in the cycling category. On the last lap, he suffered an accident that left him with a fracture and a concussion.(Photo: Twitter/CNN)Although hundreds of U.S. servicemen participated in the games, the only one who became a direct target for the conspirators was Benassi. According to CNN, one of the people who helped promote the plot was George Webb, which the television called "prolific street vendor of misinformation."Through Youtube, George Webb claimed that Maatje Benassi was the zero patient of COVID-19 in the world, and introduced the virus to Wuhan when he attended the Games. She also said that she, her husband Matt, and the Italian DJ Benny Benassi, who wrote the famous song "Satisfaction" in 2002, were part of a plot linked to the virus.However, the Italian musician denies any family or friendship with the American military. He said he did not know them, noting that the surname "Benassi" is very common in Italy.(Photo: Twitter/CNN)Although CNN contacted George Webb for evidence of his speculative theory against the Benassi, the television showed no firm evidence that could be highlighted in his article.The youtuber, who considers himself to be "research reporter", and non-conspiracy theoretically has almost 100,000 followers and more than 27 million views on the social network. In addition, conspiracy theory spread on Chinese networks such as WeChat, Xigua Video and Weibo, where thousands of debates and comments were triggered."The damage is done, " concluded Maatje. "I know it will never be the way it was again. Every time you Google my name, it will appear as patient zero."MORE ON THIS TOPIC:US and China accuse each other of origin of new coronavirusUS insists China failed to report coronavirus "in a timely manner" to WHOChinese agentsspread messages among the U.S. population to sow panic, intelligence officials warnedLoad-Date: April 28, 2020End of Document

The warning will be issued in the coming days.Questioned by the AFP, U.S. diplomacy declined to confirm or disprofer the information.In Beijing, foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian rejected the allegations, claiming that his country strongly opposes cyberattacks."We are leading global research for treatment and a vaccine for Covid-19," said the minister said it is "immoral" to attack China with rumors and slander in the absence of "evidence."The United States has a longrant with China, whom it accuses of industrial espionage and the defense of intellectual property was at the center of the trade war between the two powers.But this new accusation could further cloud much-damaged relations since the emergence of the new coronavirus in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.Donald Trump's administration accuses Chinese authorities of delay in alerting the world to the epidemic and of having disguised its spread, so it considers them to be "responsible" for the planetary spread, which has led to an unprecedented economic crisis.Load-Date: May 13, 2020End of Document

Continue reading How Huawei is dividing Western nationsThe U.S., U.K. and Australia take different approaches to the Chinese telecom giant, with vast consequences for the future of national securityhe relationship between the United Kingdom and Australia is not usually a flashpoint in international relations. After all, the two allies share a common language, ancestry, and monarch. So what caused a dustup recently that saw a senior Australian parliamentarian rebuke the British foreign secretary, and for a group of Australian MPs to then cancel a trip to London in protest?The answer is fears over Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant at the center of the 5G next-generation wireless debate. Australian officials were miffed when the British government recommended that the company be allowed to play a limited role in the U.K. s 5G deployment despite calling it a  high risk  supplier due to its close ties to the Chinese government (the company s founder, Ren Zhengfei, served for many years as an engineer in the People s Liberation Army). The Australian government, a fellow member of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance (which includes the two countries plus the United States, Canada, and New Zealand), disagreed back in 2017 when it barred Huawei on national security grounds.Now, two close allies are at cross purposes about the very future of the internet. What s at stake is not just who equips the future of telecom infrastructure, but the very values that the internet itself holds.Two countries, ocean(s) apartIt s not just Australia and Britain that find themselves separated by an ocean (or two). In America, Huawei has become the Trump Administration s favorite company to hate. In a speech at this year s Munich Security Conference, Defense Secretary Mark Esper called the company  today s poster child  for  nefarious activity  while another White House official compared the company to  the Mafia.   It should come as no surprise that the company is the target of trade restrictions, a criminal action against its CFO, and a concerted diplomatic campaign.America s concerns are twofold. First, that critical infrastructure provided by a Chinese company with such close ties to the country s central leadership is an unacceptable security risk. Second, that arresting Huawei s increasing dominance risks surrendering any chance for American leadership in 5G technology.National security considerations have predominantly driven policymakers in Australia. More alert by geography to the strategic risks posed by China, Canberra moved early and decisively to bar Huawei from participating in its 5G networks at all.  The fundamental issue is one of trust between nations in cyberspace,  writes Simeon Gilding, until recently the head of the Australian Signals Directorate s signals intelligence and offensive cyber missions.That lack of trust between China and Australia is compounded by the difficult geopolitics of the Asia-Pacific.  It s not hard to imagine a time when the U.S. and China end up in some sort of conflict,  says Tom Uren of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI).  If there was a shooting war, it is almost inevitable that the U.S. would ask Australia for assistance and then we d be in this uncomfortable situation if we had Huawei in our networks that our critical telecommunications networks would literally be run by an adversary we were at war with. Gilding warned,  It s simply not reasonable to expect that Huawei would refuse a direction from the Chinese Communist Party.  And no matter what reassurances Huawei executives have given, they just simply haven t been able to allay those concerns. Beijing didn t help Huawei s case when it passed its 2017 Intelligence Law, which obliges all Chinese companies and individuals to assist with intelligence efforts if asked.  People were always afraid [that might happen],  adds Uren,  and having it in writing really solidified those concerns. As a result, Canberra s policy to ban Huawei has been largely uncontroversial. With the exception of some of the country s telecom companies,  the decision [to ban Huawei] has bipartisan backing,  says Simon Jackman, CEO of the US Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.Calling out LondonAmerican officials wish their British counterparts shared Australia s outlook   and haven t been shy about saying so. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged the UK to  relook  at the decision and lobbied Prime Minister Boris Johnson on the issue on a recent trip to London. Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Esper has made clear that electing to use Huawei could threaten allies  access to American intelligence.  If countries choose to go the Huawei route,  Mr. Esper told reporters on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference,  it could well jeopardize all the information sharing and intelligence sharing we have been talking about, and that could undermine the alliance, or at least our relationship with that country. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo leaves 10 Downing Street after a meeting with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on 30 January 2020 in London, England. (Photo by WIktor Szymanowicz/NurPhoto via Getty Images)British officials not only believe this to be a bluff   the Five Eyes intelligence alliance is much too strong in their view   but have a different assessment of the risk Huawei poses.  Everyone s perception of the Huawei risk is particular to them,  says Nigel Inkster, a former deputy chief of MI6 now at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).The U.K. goes even further though. Experts in the British government, which started using Huawei in its 3G and 4G networks back in 2003, believe that not only can the risks be mitigated, but they are being overstated in the first place.  The Australian approach is driven by the kind of worst-case analysis of the risk 5G could pose in effect on the brink of war,  says Inkster.  I don t think the U.K. envisages going to war with China any time soon. Inkster and other top officials remain confident in the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (HCSEC), which was established by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) back when Huawei was first introduced into Britain s telecom networks.  We ve never  trusted  Huawei,  wrote NCSC Technical Director Dr. Ian Levy in a January 2020 blogpost. As a result, the U.K. has  always treated them as a  high risk vendor  and worked to limit their use in the UK and put extra mitigations around their equipment and services. Levy and the government s other cybersecurity experts believe that their system will continue to work.  The basic cyber security measures that have been used for 3/4G also apply to 5G,  argues Marcus Willett, who also served as the first Director of Cyber at GCHQ, Britain s signals-intelligence agency.  If Huawei had been playing games, we would have discovered it by now,  says Pauline Neville-Jones, a Conservative member of the House of Lords, and previously security minister and cybersecurity advisor in former British Prime Minister David Cameron s government.British regulations already restrict Huawei and other high-risk vendors in several ways, including capping their market share at 35% and ensuring their equipment is continuously evaluated by HCSEC. In addition, by preventing Huawei s 5G kit from being used near sensitive sites and limiting it to the periphery of the network (as opposed to the core), British officials are confident that they can contain any additional risk.That s not to say Huawei doesn t face stiff opposition from some corners. Even if you mitigated the risk, it s  quite a leap to allow the Chinese to be intimately involved in something as sensitive as this,  one U.K. retired diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the topic, told me. And the company is no one s first choice.  If the U.K. didn t have Huawei in its system, it wouldn t choose to have Huawei now,  Lady Neville-Jones told me.  But we are in a different place [than Australia] and we have set up a system which we believe enables us to manage the risk. And by God, we will be on alert. We re not stupid. [But] you say to yourself, at the end of the day, do you trust your technical people or not? And there s never been a complaint on backdoors or traps.  Indeed, government experts have often caught coding errors she adds.  I suspect the result of [British inspections] is that technically Huawei is a better company than it might otherwise have been. The British position is also rooted in game theory.  Even if you could [bring down the network], when would you do it?  asks Willett, formerly of GCHQ.  It is effectively a  one shot  capability   if used by China, it would undermine the position of all Chinese companies in the world tech market. China would therefore presumably save the  one shot  for war or near-war, in which case it would need to be sure it would work. That is not easy. Australian experts are skeptical, though.  I think [the British] are overconfident in their ability to mitigate [the risk],  Uren, the ASPI expert, told me. His view   widely shared in Australia   is that defenders always think they can defend a system until they can t, and giving a Chinese company access to the network is already a concession too far.  Cybersecurity is all about raising the costs for the attacker,  writes Gildling, the former Australian official.  Network access through vendors   which need to be all over 5G networks to maintain their equipment   effectively reduces the access cost to zero. The economic equation in EuropeIt s hard to understate the difference geography makes, though. In America and Australia   Pacific powers   China is physically present. For Europeans   including Britain   the risks of a rising China don t carry the same emotional weight. The idea of China being a direct security threat is still somewhat abstract,  says Dr. Janka Oertel of the European Council on Foreign Relations. With the exception of countries like Poland and Estonia which are reliant on U.S. military support and thus more willing to toe Washington s line,  European governments have just begun to assess the risk China can pose in the cyber realm.  Partly to allay those rising concerns, Huawei about a year ago established a a Cyber Security Transparency Centre in Brussels, the de facto capital of the European Union. Unlike Britain s HCSEC, however, it is not an independent evaluation center and it is not designed to carry out the same functions.Economics dominate the conversation on the continent more than national security concerns. The fragmented telecom market in Europe (105 mobile operators versus just four in America), has also proven beneficial to Huawei. In a competitive environment where cost has become everything, the state-subsidized Huawei is often able to underprice its competitors. Even in Britain, security concerns were weighed against the fact that  stripping out [the Huawei components already in the system] and starting again would carry enormous costs,  Inkster told me.Still, Oertel thinks the debate in Europe is being debated on the wrong grounds.  It s really hard to say Huawei is cheaper than Ericsson or Nokia. No one has the numbers because these are all contracts between private companies. We re talking a lot of hypotheticals.  Her concern is that while Huawei might seem cheaper now, that might change if it s able to squeeze out competitors and raise prices.The battle isn t over yet, though. Ericsson and Nokia maintain that they are competitive on technology and cost. Indeed, Ericsson is already running 27 5G networks in 15 countries and was just selected by the Danish government to build the country s 5G network, displacing existing Huawei equipment. Meanwhile in Germany, the government s move toward using Huawei has run into sharp opposition in the Bundestag, the German federal parliament. Norbert Röttgen, a prominent member of Chancellor Angela Merkel s own party, helped draft a bill that would bar any  untrustworthy  company from  both the core and peripheral networks. Norbert Roettgen, CDU at the Bundespressekonferenz the occasion of the candidacy for the CDU chairmanship, on February 18, 2020 in Berlin, Germany. (Photo by Felix Zahn/Photothek via Getty Images)The Trump Administration is still concerned enough about Huawei s potential ability to dominate 5G worldwide that it is actively campaigning for a Western alternative.  We are encouraging allied and U.S. tech companies to develop alternative 5G solutions,  Defense Secretary Esper said in Munich, where he also exhorted fellow security officials to  develop our own secure 5G network ... so we don t regret our decisions later. Other American officials have suggested even more extraordinary measures. Declaring in a February speech that nothing less than  our economic future is at stake,  Attorney General William Barr (who also served formerly as a long-time lawyer for U.S. telecom and TechCrunch parent company Verizon) bluntly called on the U.S. and its allies to  actively consider  a proposal for the government and U.S. companies to take a controlling stake in Nokia and Ericsson.  Putting our large market and financial muscle behind one or both of these firms would make it a far more formidable competitor. Ericsson dismisses these comments.  Personally, I find it odd that Barr is even thinking like this really,  Gabriel Solomon, a senior Ericsson executive in Europe, told me.  We were first to commercial deployment in four continents. We are in a very competitive market. Indeed, that echoes a common view in Europe: that the goal of American policy on Huawei is less about security and more about market share   and making sure America, not China, owns the future of 5G. And that has its own risks.  Cutting out Huawei altogether potentially moves us toward a kind of bipolar, bifurcated internet, which if taken to logical extreme would have some very serious adverse implications for everyone in terms of cost, a slowdown in innovation, and general reduction in intellectual and technical interchange,  says Inkster, the former MI6 official.Things would be easier, Europeans say, if America presented an obvious alternative. Without one, America s allies feel they have little choice but to use Huawei if they don t want to fall behind technologically.  The West has got itself in a mess,  says the retired British diplomat.  It is a striking failure of political cooperation and coordination that we should find ourselves in this position. There is still optimism on both sides of the Atlantic that a Western solution can be found. As Röttgen of Germany wrote in a tweet in February:Norbert Röttgen@n_roettgenThe #USA & EU could team up to counter #China s #5G dominance. We share the same security concerns & should cooperate to expandalternatives. But to do so we must know that tariffs against Brussels are off the table. Partners don t threaten one another. https://reut.rs/2tEIEBDU.S., Europe could team up on 5G, but not if trade war under way: German lawmakerThe United States and the European Union could team up to counter the dominance of China s Huawei Technologies in next-generation 5G telecoms technology, but not if Washington continues to threaten reuters.com1093:20 PM   Feb 8, 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy 71 people are talking about thisRather than pick a champion, another solution would be to level the playing field.  Telecoms security doesn t pay,  concedes Dr. Levy of HCSEC. And  externalising the security costs of particular choices (including vendor) will help operators make better security risk management decisions.  Another option: better national screening investment mechanisms that would limit the ability of state-owned enterprises to operate unfairly.But to get there requires coordination and cooperation   and that isn t necessarily as forthcoming as you might expect. Germans still remember that the NSA hacked Chancellor Merkel s phone   and the Trump Administration s trade war has targeted Europe almost as much as it has China. Röttgen cautioned that cooperation on 5G was connected:  [W]e must know that tariffs against Brussels are off the table,  he said in the same tweet.  Partners don t threaten one another.  Meanwhile, Huawei is earning goodwill by sending medical equipment to Europe to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Technology was supposed to unite us,  laments Jackman, the Australian professor;  instead it s driving us apart not just from our rivals, but our allies, too. See Campaign:https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/the-future-of-telecoms-in-the-ukContact Information:Scott BadeTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: March 30, 2020End of Document

Rick Scott, R-Florida, issued the following news release:Senators Rick Scott and Josh Hawley introduced legislation to ban all federal employees from using TikTok on government devices. The State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, and TSA have already banned TikTok on federal government devices due to cybersecurity concerns and possible spying by the Communist Chinese government.Senator Rick Scott said, "The use of apps like TikTok by federal employees on government devices is a risk to our networks and a threat to our national security, and I'm proud to join Senator Hawley to put an end to it. We should all be very concerned about the threat of Communist China, and I hope my colleagues will join me to implement this ban immediately and protect our national security."Senator Josh Hawley said, "TikTok is owned by a Chinese company that includes Chinese Communist Party members on its board, and it is required by law to share user data with Beijing. The company even admitted it collects user data while their app is running in the background - including the messages people send, pictures they share, their keystrokes and location data, you name it. As many of our federal agencies have already recognized, TikTok is a major security risk to the United States, and it has no place on government devices."Full text of the bill is available here (https://outreach.senate.gov/iqextranet/iqClickTrk.aspx?&cid=SenHawley&crop=14193.5518255.5287480.7161270&report_id=&redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.hawley.senate.gov%2fsites%2fdefault%2ffiles%2f2020-03%2fNo-TikTik-On-Government-Devices-Act-Bill-Text.pdf&redir_log=388743953642713).Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7052276 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 13, 2020End of Document

Lucas Leads Science Committee Members Requesting FBI & CISA Briefing on Chinese Hacking of U.S. COVID-19 ResearchTargeted News ServiceMay 23, 2020 Saturday 8:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1047 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: CHEYENNE, Oklahoma BodyRep. Frank Lucas, R-Oklahoma, issued the following news release:Republican Members of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee sent a letter to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) today. The letter was prompted by a joint CISA and FBI report issued May 13, 2020: People's Republic of China (PRC) Targeting of COVID-19 Research Organizations.The report publicized recent attempts by China to steal public health data and intellectual property by hacking U.S. organizations conducting research on COVID-19. The CISA and FBI announcement warned that, "the potential theft of this information jeopardizes the delivery of secure, effective, and efficient treatment options."The Committee Members requested a briefing to better understand the challenges America's research institutions and companies are facing from these threats, and how the FBI and CISA are working to detect and prevent such attacks."Taking into consideration the vital research these U.S. institutions are conducting in order to develop vaccines and treatments for the novel coronavirus that is devastating the entire world, such malicious targeting is reprehensible," the Members wrote."We applaud your work in notifying the public to raise awareness of these threats and appreciate the resources and guidance you are providing to institutions that may be targeted. Given the critical nature of the COVID-19 research being conducted at U.S. institutions, it is imperative they take the proper steps to secure their networks and take advantage of the resources your agencies have without delay."The letter was led by Ranking Member Frank Lucas (R-OK) and Rep.

On May 13, 2020, the FBI and CISA published People's Republic of China (PRC) Targeting of COVID19 Research Organizations. This notice informed all U.S. research institutions and the American public of the attempts to hack U.S. organizations conducting COVID-19-related research by cyber actors and non-traditional collectors supported by the Chinese government in order to obtain valuable intellectual property and public health data. While this announcement is extremely concerning, it is not surprising. As Members of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, experts have warned us about foreign countries' efforts to steal American technological information and scientific discoveries. The National Counterintelligence and Security Center Director Bill Evanina has said China's theft of U.S. intellectual property totals as much as $400 billion annually.Taking into consideration the vital research these U.S. institutions are conducting in order to develop vaccines and treatments for the novel coronavirus that is devastating the entire world, such malicious targeting is reprehensible. According to the notice, "These actors have been observed attempting to identify and illicitly obtain valuable intellectual property (IP) and public health data related to vaccines, treatments, and testing from networks and personnel affiliated with COVID-19-related research. The potential theft of this information jeopardizes the delivery of secure, effective, and efficient treatment options." We applaud your work in notifying the public to raise awareness of these threats and appreciate the resources and guidance you are providing to institutions that may be targeted. Given the critical nature of the COVID-19 research being conducted at U.S. institutions, it is imperative they take the proper steps to secure their networks and take advantage of the resources your agencies have without delay. We want to thank the FBI and CISA, along with all of the other agencies you coordinate with, for their work to prevent such attacks. We are grateful to the agents and staff who are fighting the good fight and hope that we can do all we can in Congress to support those efforts.Pursuant to House Rule X, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology has jurisdiction over the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which develops cybersecurity standards and guidelines for the federal government and recommendations for the private sector. In order to further understand the challenges America's research institutions and companies are facing from these threats, and the activities the FBI and CISA are undertaking to detect and prevent such attacks, we request a briefing with Members and staff of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology no later than June 22, 2020, at the classified level if appropriate.Thank you for your prompt attention in this matter.

RUBIO, MENENDEZ, RISCH, GARDNER, MARKEY, REPRESENTATIVES MCGOVERN AND SMITH APPLAUD HOUSE PASSAGE OF UYGHUR HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY ACTStates News ServiceMay 27, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 853 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), James Risch (R-ID), Ranking Member and Chairman, respectively, of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Cory Gardner (R-CO), Ed Markey (D-MA), Chairman and Ranking Member, respectively, of the Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy, and Representatives Chris Smith (R-NJ) and Jim McGovern (D-MA) applaud the House passage of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020 (S.3744). This bipartisan bill is an important step in countering the totalitarian Chinese government's widespread and horrific human rights abuses in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), including the mass internment of over one million Uyghurs and other predominantly ethnic Turkic Muslims, as well as Beijing's intimidation and threats against U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents on American soil. S. 3744 now goes to President Trump's desk for signature.Rubio is Cochair of the bipartisan and bicameral Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations' Subcommittee that oversees human rights, and is a member of the Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy."I commend the House for swiftly passing this bipartisan bill, which now heads to the President's desk to become law," Rubio said . "Congress is sending a strong message of support to Uyghur Muslims worldwide that the United States stands with you and will not sit idly by as the Chinese government and Communist Party commit egregious human rights abuses and crimes against humanity. For far too long, the Chinese Communist Party has tried to systematically wipe out the ethnic and cultural identities of Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims. It's long overdue to hold the perpetrators accountable and I urge the President to sign it into law without delay.""Today's passage by the House of Representatives makes clear the United States Congress is united and determined to take action as millions of Uyghur Muslims continue to be unjustly imprisoned, subjected to a mass surveillance state, and forced into labor camps by Beijing's autocratic regime," Ranking Member Menendez said . "Enactment of this legislation to provide justice for the Uyghur people and others subject to China's gross violations of human rights and possible crimes against humanity is long overdue. I look forward to getting the president's signature on this bill to enact it into law as soon as possible.""I am glad the House took swift action to pass the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act today," Chairman Risch said . "The internment of at least a million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities is reprehensible and inexcusable, and the Chinese Communist Party and government must be held to account. I look forward to the president signing this important legislation into law soon.""The Chinese Communist Party's actions in Xinjiang are an affront to humanity and the CCP must pay a heavy price for these heinous crimes," Gardner said . "The mass internment and forced labor of Uighurs is one of the greatest ongoing tragedies of our time. With passage of this bill, the U.S. Congress stated loud and clear that we will hold the CCP and its enablers responsible, pursuant to my Asia Reassurance Initiative Act and other relevant U.S. laws.""The House has now joined the Senate in sending a united message that Beijing's attempt to erase a culture through mass detention and surveillance will not succeed," Markey said . "I am proud to co-sponsor this legislation and will continue to press our own government to promote accountability for the Chinese government's oppression of historic scale. I commend those who have revealed the enormity of these human rights violations, including the brave journalists of Radio Free Asia's Uyghur Service, whose family members have endured retaliatory abuse simply for uncovering the terrible truth of Beijing's campaign against its ethnic and Muslim minorities.""I applaud the passage of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act. This important bipartisan action makes clear that Congress will not be silent while Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities face reprehensible human rights abuses," McGovern said . "I call on the President to sign the legislation quickly and take swift action to sanction Chinese officials and businesses engaged in mass internment, surveillance, and forced labor.""We cannot remain silent in the face of the unconscionable, horrific atrocities in the Xinjiang region of China," Rep. Chris Smith said , who wrote the House version of the bill supported by 136 bipartisan cosponsors. "Our strong bipartisan legislation condemns mass surveillance, the internment of Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities, and the systematic use of forced labor to profit the Chinese government and state-owned companies. We are committed to stopping these horrendous abuses of human rights and labor rights and this legislation is a starting point, not our last word or action on behalf of the victims."Load-Date: May 28, 2020End of Document

Apple's iPhone Sales Down More Than 50% in China: ReportTheStreet.comMarch 9, 2020 Monday 4:31 PM EDTCopyright 2020 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 453 wordsByline: Annie GausHighlight: The coronavirus outbreak triggered a steep iPhone demand plunge in China, according to data from a Chinese government agency.BodyApple  warned investors weeks ago that the COVID-19 outbreak could mean an ugly quarter, and now we know more about what that will look like. China's Academy of Information and Communications Technology, a government agency, reported that widespread travel restrictions and quarantines through the Lunar New Year cut mobile phone sales by more than half in February. Shipments of Apple phones fell to 494,000 last month, down from 1.27 million in the year-ago quarter. Shares of Apple were down nearly 6% on Monday amid a  l-off triggered by a plunge in oil prices and ongoing coronavirus fears.The drop in iPhone sales is worse than some analysts had predicted, and point to a steep demand plunge in China in addition to  faced by Apple and other firms that manufacture goods near Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak originated. "These are doomsday type of iPhone units and overall smartphone sales which are not surprising given the essential lockdown that most of China saw during the month of February," wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note on Monday. Apple CEO Tim Cook told  that China was "getting the coronavirus under control," and that Apple's production was ramping back up, but couldn't give assurance that the damage to Apple would be contained to the March quarter. Apple pulled its revenue guidance for the quarter in February, but did not issue a specific downward revision due to the evolving nature of the coronavirus threat. Ives added that the steep drop in Chinese iPhone sales in the March quarter is tantamount to a "shock event," and that demand will likely normalize in the second half of 2020. Nonetheless, the Apple sales numbers paint a picture of a dramatic drop in consumer demand in China in the midst of the outbreak.Other U.S. firms with a significant consumer presence in China, such   and  , have warned of a plunge in first quarter revenue owing to the spread of coronavirus. In late February, Goldman Sachs forecast that fallout from the coronavirus outbreak could yield zero earnings growth for the S&P 500 in 2020. The forecast reflects a "severe decline in Chinese economic activity in 1Q, lower end-demand for U.S. exporters, disruption to the supply chain for many U.S. firms, a slowdown in U.S. economic activity, and elevated business uncertainty," according to Goldman Sachs analyst David Kostin.The Dow Jones closed more than 2000 points lower on Monday, equivalent to a roughly 8% drop, in one of the worst trading days since the 2008 financial crisis.Apple, Starbucks and Disney are all components in the Action Alerts Plus portfolio.

The WHO Must Drop Its Pro-Beijing 'Goodwill Ambassador'Newsweek.comMay 19, 2020 Tuesday 7:30 AM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 985 wordsByline: Hillel C. NeuerHighlight: The WHO has a 'goodwill ambassador' who is in Beijing's pocket. That must end.BodyAs the World Health Organization (WHO) meets virtually this week for its annual assembly, its chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus should explain why the agency's elite group of "goodwill ambassadors" includes a Chinese government news presenter who has broadcast forced confessions and is now exploiting his WHO title to whitewash China's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.Born and raised in the U.K., James Chau has worked since 2004 in Beijing as a news presenter and host for the English-language channel of the Chinese Communist Party's state-controlled CCTV.Chau was appointed to the WHO in February 2016 by its previous head Dr. Margaret Chan, a Chinese national with            close ties to Beijing. Appointments only last            two years, which means Tedros has twice renewed Chau's term.In interviews, Chau never explains why a Cambridge graduate would sell out to a totalitarian regime, allowing it to influence global audiences through his British-accented English and deep voice.            Asked by the Financial Times, Chau is evasive.What we do know is that his work is pure propaganda. According to CCTV's website, Chau's accomplishments include anchoring "major stories," such as the annual sessions of the National People's Congress, which are carefully choreographed pageants of pretend democracy.Chau now hosts "The China Current," an online program initiated by the China-United States Exchange Foundation, a registered foreign agent that seeks to            sway coverage of China. According to            Foreign Policy magazine, Chau's sponsor is "bankrolled by a high-ranking Chinese government official with close ties to a sprawling Chinese Communist Party apparatus that handles influence operations abroad, known as the 'united front.'"That Chau is a paid mouthpiece for one of the world's most repressive regimes—which has locked up one million Muslim Uighurs in "re-education" camps—is enough to disqualify him from representing a U.N. agency whose constitution speaks of the "fundamental rights of every human being."But it's worse.Chau doesn't just read government-sanctioned news on innocuous stories. As reported by TheNew York Times, Chau broadcast the            forced confession of Peter Humphrey, a British private investigator who was arrested in 2013 on charges of illegally obtaining and selling Chinese citizens' data. Humphrey was drugged, chained to a chair, locked in a cage and forced to read a confession.So it shouldn't be surprising that Chau, armed with his U.N. badge of legitimacy, has been mobilized from the start of the pandemic to spin for Beijing on Twitter,            Weibo,            YouTube and            the broader web, abusing his WHO title to whitewash China's record and legitimize the regime and its officials.Glorified by the U.N. (which just            posted another of Chau's messages), the so-called journalist's voluminous statements on Beijing's response to the pandemic omit any mention of how the Chinese Communist Party purged the public sphere of dissent, censored news reports, harassed citizen journalists, shut down news sites and            summoned Dr. Li Wenliang to a middle-of-the-night interrogation for sounding the alarm in Wuhan.On Twitter, Chau excuses China's repressive measures, saying "you do what you have to do,"            adding, "not everything is 'draconian.'"In a February 6 op-ed in The Hindu, entitled "A time for solidarity, not stigma," Chau rushed to defend Beijing. Yes, the WHO had just declared COVID-19 a global health emergency but, "that said," this was "not a vote of no confidence in China's capacity to control the spread."Media comparisons with SARS, cautioned Chau, were exaggerating "the scale and severity of the Wuhan outbreak." He warned that videos being shared about chaotic scenes at Wuhan hospitals were "unverified," and thus "we can't assume that these videos are related to the Wuhan outbreak." Chau said nothing on how China began to censor keywords related to the coronavirus outbreak on December 31, 2019, a day after Dr. Li Wenliang and other doctors tried to warn the public.In his online YouTube program and            podcast, Chau            emphasizes how Tedros has an "investment of trust in China" and "confidence in its leadership."Using propagandistic videos with uplifting music, Chau recites the latest WHO directives, along with platitudes about "openness and togetherness." Yet his            Wuhan timeline ignores any reference to those arrested and made to disappear for sounding the alarm.When he interviews China's former Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei, Chau pivots attention away from China, asking "Where have we gone wrong as a world?" In turn, the former Chinese diplomat calls on the world to "spend more time on global health governance." Chau allows those statements to stand, not mentioning that China had reportedly            pressured the WHO to hold off on declaring a health emergency.Chau is also a regular on CGTN, a global affiliate of CCTV. In a show attacking critical articles from TheNew York Times, the Chinese network brought on Chau—introduced as a U.N. goodwill ambassador—to speak of the need to "trust" leaders. In another show, Chau was            invited to provide "the World Health Organization perspective"; he decried America's "institutional, systemic, structural racism."The WHO and its chief Tedros are rightly under pressure after they repeatedly lavished praise on Chinese President Xi Jinping's regime for its "seriousness," "transparency" and "leadership" in handling the pandemic.To begin to restore its credibility, the WHO must now remove James Chau as its goodwill ambassador.Hillel C.

What Trump's signed decree says that limits social media protectionsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 29, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 705 wordsBodyDonald Trump signed a decree thursday to assess whether his government can punish Twitter, Facebook, YouTube or Google if they try to moderate content posted on their platforms, amid a growing debate about the extent to which freedom of expression on the Internet should go.Later, the White House issued the full decree calling on the U.S. government to review and possibly eliminate the legal protections enjoyed by large Internet platforms under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996.This section indicates that large Internet companies are exempt from almost any legal consequence resulting from the content published on their platform and even their own decisions to remove content, because they are supposed to be mere intermediaries or channels.Trump considered that Twitter and other platforms have proven to have an "uncontrolled power to censor, restrict, or edit" the content they post, so he gave Commerce for 60 days to propose to the independent Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that the rules be reformed.What the decree says"In a country that has always appreciated freedom of expression, we cannot allow a limited number of online platforms to choose at their discretion the discourse that Americans can access and share on the Internet. This practice is fundamentally un-American and undemocratic. When large and powerful social media companies censor opinions with which they disagree, they wield dangerous power. They stop working as passive ad boards and should be viewed and treated as content creators.""Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube wield immense, if unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; censoring, deleting or disappearing information; and to control what people see or don't see."Illustrative file image of the Twitter app loading on a smartphone. (Mike Blake/)"Online platforms are participating in selective censorship that is harming our national discourse. Tens of thousands of Americans have reported, among other problematic behaviors, that online platforms 'mark' content as inappropriate, even though it does not violate any of the established terms of service; make unenforceable and unexplained changes to company policies that have the effect of disadvantage certain views; and delete entire content and accounts without warning, without justification and without recourse.""Twitter now selectively decides to place a warning tag on certain tweets in a way that clearly reflects political bias. As has been reported, Twitter seems to have never placed that tag in another politician's tweet.""While online platforms invoke inconsistent, irrational, and unfounded justifications for censoring or restricting Americans' discourse, several online platforms benefit and promote aggression and misinformation spread by foreign governments like China's. A U.S. company, for example, created a search engine for the Chinese Communist Party that helped block human rights-related searches, hid unfavorable data for the party, and tracked users to be monitored. Other companies have accepted ads paid for by theChinese government to spread false information about the mass incarceration of religious minorities, thus enabling these human rights abuses. They have also expanded China's propaganda abroad, including by allowing Chinese government officials to use their platforms to spread misinformation about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and undermining pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.""The policy of the United States is that large online platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, such as the critical means of promoting the free flow of speech and ideas today, should not restrict protected speech. The Supreme Court has pointed out that social networking sites, such as the modern public square, 'can provide perhaps the most powerful mechanisms available for a private citizen to make his voice heard."MORE ON THIS TOPIC:Donald Trump signed a decree limiting social media protections and said he would "close Twitter if he could"Twitter first labeled two Donald Trump posts as "baseless allegations"Mark Zuckerberg differed from Twitter: "Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of the truth of everything people say on the internet"Load-Date: May 30, 2020End of Document

BEATING CHINA BY WAY OF TEXASStates News ServiceApril 3, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 544 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Texas Rep. Kay Granger:Friends,China may be continents away, but we feel its threats right here at home. After starting in China last year, the coronavirus has found its way to Texas, where Governor Abbott is keeping our state at the frontlines of federal efforts to fight the virus. Meanwhile, I'm working with my colleagues in Congress and President Trump's Administration to ensure that all American workers, families, and businesses get the comprehensive, coordinated response they deserve.When the coronavirus was first diagnosed, the Chinese government's response was to censor information and lie, covering up the early spread of the deadly virus. By quarantining the truth, China only made the crisis much worse.The coronavirus is just one of many threats from China that impact us all, including here in our district. It has already highlighted how dependent we as Americans are on China's pharmaceutical products. Last year, 80 percent of all U.S. antibiotics and 95 percent of all U.S. ibuprofen were made in China. While we've banned Chinese wireless technology from our infrastructure, we overlook that China is exploiting supply chains of something much more familiarlike the ibuprofen millions of us take every day. Meanwhile, China continues to steal our intellectual property and trade secrets, costing our economy over $600 billion a year. China is actively working to infiltrate our universities to both steal information, as well as influence our nation's academic leaders. Earlier this year, right here in Texas, we learned that over 100 faculty members were involved in one such Chinese recruitment programbut thankfully its response to China's assault on our academic freedom was so strong that even the Trump Administration took notice.Some threats from China are more obvious. China is continuing to develop a space program on track to rival our own, and now boasts more successful annual space launches than the U.S. I am proud Texashome of NASA's Johnson Space Center plays a frontline role in our country's next great space race.I am even prouder that Texas' contribution to our national defense comes right out of our local community, where our world-class workforce builds the F-35 jets keeping our country and our allies' skies safe and secure from enemies like China. Earlier this year I brought my friend, Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist, to Fort Worth for a tour of Lockheed Martin's F-35 plant, where he saw firsthand our talented engineers and workers building the world's most lethal fighter jets that are capable of beating China. I am especially proud that North Texas' talented, patriotic workforce continues to work and fight for our common defense during these trying times.I am working on your behalf here in Washington to make sure our country has the resources needed to counter China's threat to our security and the American way of life. In this difficult time for our Nation, China's threat to our lives and livelihoods could not be more obvious.In Texas, we're known for doing everything bigger and better, and we should be proud of our state's Texas-sized role in defending our nation, especially against threats like China.Sincerely,kay.jpgKay GrangerLoad-Date: April 3, 2020End of Document

MTS Awarded Seismic Simulation Project Valued At Over $70 Million For China's National Facility For Earthquake Engineering Simulation At Tianjin UniversityPR NewswireMarch 25, 2020 Wednesday 9:05 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 894 wordsDateline: EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn., March 25, 2020 BodyPR Newswire MTS Systems Corporation (NASDAQ: MTSC), a leading global supplier of high-performance test systems, motion simulators and sensors, today announced it has been awarded the largest single order in its 54-year history, valued at over $70 million, to design, manufacture and install two of the world's largest, and most advanced seismic simulation systems at Tianjin University, one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in China.The project will be part of the new National Facility for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NFEES) on the Tianjin University campus in Tianjin, China. Upon completion, the earthquake simulation facility will be the largest and most powerful of its type, expanding the world's engineering science and technology research capabilities. It will play an important role in ensuring the safety of hydraulic engineering, buildings and bridges, wind energy generation, and offshore infrastructure. The lab will include two separate test systems, both of which will be the largest of their type in the world. One system will be a six-degree-of-freedom seismic table with a working area of 16 x 20 meters and a 1350-ton specimen mass capacity, allowing for full-scale or near full-scale testing. The other system will consist of two 6 x 6-meter six-degree-of-freedom seismic tables, each capable of handling 150-ton specimens. These 6 x 6-meter tables will be designed to be submersible in up to three meters of water and configured for independent or synchronous testing. One of the underwater tables will be in a fixed location and the other may be positioned at different points along a 57-meter long trench allowing for testing of large specimens that vary in length, such as bridges, tunnels and pier structures. The basin will also employ wave and current generators to create different sea states to help determine the effects of water and waves on structures during an earthquake or tsunami event.MTS was selected for this project due to a combination of extensive experience and expertise in creating the most advanced seismic simulation systems in the world, and a demonstrated capability to support sophisticated customers and applications in China. The entire project will be performed over the course of four years with scheduled completion in 2023."MTS' strong presence in China and proven systems integration expertise will contribute tremendously to the success of this project. As a leader in this market, MTS is one of the few companies in the world that has the demonstrated expertise in large-scale seismic simulation technology, and a proven capability to handle all the elements of a project of this scale, from the high-force motion control to the complex systems integration required for the simulation of earthquakes and tsunami events," states Dr. Jeffrey Graves, MTS President and CEO. "MTS is honored to be working with Tianjin University on this groundbreaking endeavor to better simulate seismic activity, providing information that will help design safer and more sustainable buildings, bridges and renewable energy infrastructure for China's future.""We look forward to working closely with MTS to build the world's largest, most advanced seismic simulation systems, as essential elements of our National Facility for Earthquake Engineering Simulation. This project is similar in scale to other one-of-a-kind national research projects undertaken by the Chinese government in recent years," says Prof. Zhang Fengbao, Vice President of Tianjin University and Executive Chief Director of NFEES. "When complete, this state-of-the art facility, and its data and results will be shared with researchers from all countries, with a goal of improving the safety and sustainability of critical infrastructure in highly populated areas around the world. Tianjin welcomes all scientists and engineering experts to visit and help to further earthquake engineering simulation research."About Tianjin UniversityTianjin University is the oldest institution of higher education in the modern history of China.

FSI scholars analyze Asian healthcare systems' responses to COVID-19The Stanford Daily: Stanford UniversityApril 26, 2020 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1028 wordsByline: Annie ChangBodyFaculty members at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies praised South Korea, Vietnam and Singapore's responses to coronavirus, while criticizing China, Indonesia and India at a virtual seminar on the successes and failures of different healthcare systems across Asia.The seminar convened Stanford's leading experts in Asian healthcare systems in a discussion about the important lessons for the future from the policy responses across Asia.Xuegang Zhou, a professor in economic development and sociology, criticized the Chinese government's response to the coronavirus."At the beginning, the Chinese government responded to the crisis in a predictable way: They tried to sweep the problem under the rug," Zhou said.According to Zhou, the government's decision to enforce lockdown in Wuhan sparked turmoil, and medical staff were overwhelmed by high numbers of cases. Resentment against the government spread over the internet and social media."I have never seen this kind of organized and concerted effort in defiance of government censorship," Zhou said, suggesting that this moment marked a new era in China's virtual space.However, as the epicenter of the outbreak shifted to Europe and the United States, the Chinese government's handling of the crisis began to look much better in comparison, he added."Those voices critical of Chinese governments' mishandling of the situation have mostly been silenced," Zhou said.Speakers criticized the responses of other Asian countries such as Indonesia and India. Don Emmerson, senior fellow emeritus at FSI and director of the Southeast Asia Program, says that both countries responded late. According to Emmerson, the president of Indonesia refused to recognize the problem."It was up to the provinces to see the effects of the crisis and pressure the government to do more," he said. "[The president's] policies have been inconsistent and chaotic."Karen Eggleston, a senior fellow at FSI and deputy director of the Asia-Pacific Research Center, praised the Indian state Kerala's strong health system and speediness in deploying contacting tracing as key to addressing the crisis. But, the national government's first serious response occurred three weeks after India's first case in March and took the form of a sudden lockdown with only hours notice.Scholars cited countries such as South Korea, Vietnam and Singapore as examples of effective responses to the pandemic.Yong Suk Lee, South Korea Center Fellow at FSI and deputy director of the Korea Program, praised the Korean government's successful response to the pandemic."South Korea has, at this point, seemed to have flattened the curve," Lee said, though he noted the possibility of a second wave of infections.According to Lee, one element of South Korea's successful response was its speed."Even before the first case was identified, the Moon administration gathered various test kit developers and encouraged them to develop and mass produce kits," he said.This massive increase in production of testing kits, along with a national health insurance program that made it cost-effective for Korean citizens to obtain testing, led to high testing rates among Koreans for coronavirus.Contact tracing was also an important part of Korea's response, allowing the government to track the movements of infected individuals. If there is a confirmed case of the virus, Lee said, all of the information about the person's location will be shared with others via mobile apps.South Korea also saw greater compliance with important preventive measures such as social distancing, mask wearing, and contact tracing due to stronger trust in the government. The country never implemented a lockdown and maintained an open border policy with China, instead establishing testing sites at its borders. As a result, Lee said, the economic impact of the outbreak appears to be less severe there."Rather than pursuing a lockdown policy, contact tracing may have allowed Koreans to experience a less negative [economic] impact," he said.Emmerson cited Singapore and Vietnam as two countries in Southeast Asia that effectively responded to the crisis. Though Singapore has reported more cases, he said its "ability to determine who has [coronavirus] and who doesn't represents a capacity to flatten the curve."While he criticized the Singaporean government for ignoring positive cases among migrant workers, he praised the government's high-tech approach in fighting the pandemic."Of all the countries in Southeast Asia, none has approached the virus with a high technological array of instruments," he said, explaining how the government tracks its citizens' movements electronically through mobile apps.Vietnam's success in fighting coronavirus, according to Emmerson, came through the power and network of the communist party."It's not a question of a phone app," he said. "Someone employed by the government will find out if you have symptoms, and you may end up in some kind of containment."Using this aggressive approach, the Vietnamese government imposed order and prevented infection, he said.He added that, although Laos and Cambodia both claim to have had zero deaths from the virus, their data is questionable.While Japan is leading the world in the demographic transition, Eggleston said, the share of the population 80 and over makes the nation particularly vulnerable to coronavirus."It's not clear whether the pandemic will derail long-term trends towards healthy aging and undermine intergenerational social contracts," she said.Emmerson emphasized "government competence" as most important in dealing with the pandemic. While all of the countries discussed at the seminar had strengths and weaknesses in their responses,"It may not be the regime that matters, but it is certainly the case that government competence is really what matters if we are to come out of this crisis as soon as possible," he said.Contact Annie Chang at annie215 'at' stanford.edu..css-10w0hkr{margin:0 auto;width:100%;}@media (min-width:1100px){.css-10w0hkr{width:650px;}}Annie Chang.css-qmqbsq{margin:0 auto;width:100%;}@media (min-width:1100px){.css-qmqbsq{width:600px;}}Load-Date: April 27, 2020End of Document

Chinese Parents Donate Personal Protection Equipment to UC San Diego HealthThe Pan American: University of Texas - Pan AmericanApril 19, 2020 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 380 wordsByline: Vivian YangBodyThis article is a part of our news series on the COVID-19 pandemic. For information on how to prevent the spread of the virus, click here.UC San Diego Health received the first shipment of medical protection masks from a group of over 300 Chinese parents of UCSD students on April 1, 2020. This shipment is one of several shipments sent by this group of UCSD parents from China. The entire shipment includes medical supplies such as masks, protective overalls, and face shields.In March, the group of parents voiced their intentions to donate money and medical support to UCSD as the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 was rising and reports of medical equipment shortages were confirmed.The donation started spontaneously among the parents and officially began on March 27. It received more than $40,000 USD, or ¥300,000 Chinese Yuan, in two 24-hour donation windows.Due to the transportation and trade control in place by the Chinese government, the donations were divided into multiple shipments. Three shipments have been received at the time of this article's publication, and a fourth shipment will arrive within the next few days.A box of medical equipment with a logo that says "Love" (in red) in the middle.On April 12, the official UCSD Twitter account posted a thread as they received 20,000 masks, expressing their appreciation.A parent who volunteered in helping with the donation procedures said she wanted to help the university because to help the university is to help her own child.But one of the key leading organizers of the donation event expressed more motivations behind this donation on her personal blogging platform.She declined to disclose her name because she insisted that the donation is from the entire group of parents from China, and she does not want to, in any case, enlarge her personal contribution."If what is falling down in front of us is the entire world, who could avoid her responsibility and only mind herself?" she said. "What we want to do is what can bring a thread of peace to our hearts during the darkest time."A group of UC San Diego parents from China sent more than 20,000 masks, thousands of protective face shields, and full body suits to @UCSDHealth. We thank them for their generosity during these difficult times. #UCSDCaresLoad-Date: April 19, 2020End of Document

Europe rethinks its position on China because of its lack of transparency in the virus and its attitude to the crisisCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 17, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 778 wordsBodyEuropean governments, in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, are hardening their positions toward China as suspicions about the lack of transparency in the coronavirus's home country grow and the possibility that their attempt to hide the crisis would be the cause of its global uncontrollability.French President Emmanuel Macron accused Beijing of not being honest with its handling of the epidemic, while in the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plans to hire Chinese tech giant Huawei to develop its 5G network could be victims of the growing rejection of the Asian country.The European Union's position on China has been relatively measured, but the continent's leaders are beginning to call for a more in-depth analysis of its actions, amid accusations that Beijing has covered up the true scale of the epidemic. Leaks in recent weeks from U.S. intelligence agencies indicate that China concealed the extent of its outbreak and underestimated the number of cases and deaths."Let's not be naive enough to say that China has been much better at handling this," Macron told the Financial Times in an interview published Thursday. "We don't know, things have clearly happened that we don't know."   Revised countChina on Friday reviewed its official coronavirus death count, adding some 1,290 deaths in Wuhan City. The government rejected the accusations of cover-up, and foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the revisions were a common practice and that China "has done nothing to be criticized.""China would like to work with all countries, including France and the United Kingdom, to stick to multilateralism, strengthen solidarity and cooperation to jointly safeguard the lives and health of all people," Zhao told journalists in Beijing.But tensions escalated soon after, when the French government summoned the Chinese ambassador after a publication appeared on the Asian embassy's website suggesting that France abandon residents of senior residences. France's Minister for European Affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, also accused China and Russia last month of using the delivery of medical equipment to spread propaganda in Europe.A French official said, in statements to Bloomberg under confidentiality, that France's priority was to secure the masks and other health supplies they import from China, adding that the incident was "over."  5G networksTension has also lifted blisters on one of the key points of Chinese-European relations: Huawei's presence on European 5G networks and the suspicion that Beijing could exploit them to organise possible sabotage or espionage of European systems.In London, Johnson's government had been trying for months to win over half a hundred rebel 'tories' MPs with a positive information campaign on Huawei. Its objective is to hold when possible a vote in Parliament to approve the company's participation in the country's 5G infrastructure. But two government sources now believe that a tightening of positions among rebel conservative parliamentarians will make it difficult, if not impossible, for legislation to be passed. Prominent 'tories' voices have called for a rethink of relations with China in light of its behavior.Meanwhile, in Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has spent her tenure cultivating relations with her key trading partner, has been more cautious about any accusations against China. But German officials have warned about Beijing,claiming that it is exploiting the crisis in the West to gain a hole in the vacuum of international power left by the US.Buying vulnerable companiesEU countries are already on alert to the possibility that Chinese companies are trying to exploit the sharp stock falls of recent weeks to buy from key European companies. Numerous banks have recently seen an increase in applications from Chinese firms and funds to buy target shares in Europe. Spain has, for the time being, approved a decree prohibiting such acquisitions in times of weakness."The G-7 and European nations must be in guard guarding the government of President Xi Jinping, who will try to use his influence during the crisis and recovery," said a German government official in late March.Without explicitly naming China, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas warned that US President Donald Trump's order to freeze the funds he gives to the World Health Organization could invite anti-democratic countries, such as China, to increase his presence. "Every inch that the United States withdraws from the rest of the world, especially at this level, is a space that will be occupied by others, especially those who do not share our values of liberal democracy," Maas said Thursday in Berlin.Load-Date: April 18, 2020End of Document

Press Sec Hits Twitter for Singling Out Trump, Not Chinese PropagandaNewsweek.comMay 28, 2020 Thursday 2:32 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 572 wordsByline: Jenni FinkHighlight: White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany pushed back against Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's request that people "leave employees" out of the fact-checking debate, saying the White House would continue to question the people on the team.BodyWhite House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany criticized Twitter for fact-checking President Donald Trump, but not Chinese propaganda and called the deployment of the feature "completely incoherent."Trump is expected to sign an executive order against social media companies on Thursday, two days after Twitter applied a fact-check to two of the president's tweets about mail-in ballots. After being called out for a double standard, Twitter applied a fact-check to a Chinese government spokesman's tweet claiming SARS-CoV-2 originated in the United States.During an interview on Fox News on Thursday, McEnany questioned the political motivations behind the decision to fact-check Trump at a time when Twitter wasn't fact-checking Chinese propaganda. She said the White House has seen some "egregious actions" from Twitter and criticized the social media company for "singling out" the president's tweet.Earlier this week, and again on Thursday, administration officials targeted Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity, over tweets he published in 2016 and 2017. The tweets called Trump a "racist tangerine," likened senior counselor Kellyanne Conway to Joseph Goebbels, the head of Nazi propaganda, and said there were "actual Nazis in the White House."In response to the spotlight on Roth, Jack Dorsey, Twitter's CEO, said the person ultimately accountable for the company's actions is him and asked that people "please leave our employees out of this." McEnany pushed back on Dorsey's request, calling it an "untenable" and "unfair" proposition and one that the White House would not entertain."Twitter wants this to be the standard ... and yet we don't get to ask who the fact-checkers are ... we will ask who the fact-checkers are," McEnany told Fox News.Newsweek reached out to Twitter for comment but did not receive a response in time for publication.Compared to Dorsey's model that's "completely incoherent in the way it's deployed," McEnany praised Facebook's approach to fact-checking. On Thursday, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, told CNBC that making internet platforms arbiters of truth was a "dangerous line to get down to" with regard to deciding what is and isn't true.When it comes to political speech, Zuckerberg said people should be able to see what politicians say, but acknowledged that people aren't able to "say whatever they want." Facebook's goal is to give people as much voice as possible while cutting down on certain comments, such as rhetoric that could incite violence or pushes false information about cures for a disease.Dorsey denied in a Twitter thread that fact-checking accounted to them being an "arbiter of truth." The intention of the feature is to "connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves."Trump's tweet in question said that there was "no way" mail-in ballots would be anything less than "substantially fraudulent." He added that people would rob mailboxes, forge ballots and illegally print out and fraudulent sign them. The president posted in a Thursday tweet that it was "so ridiculous" for Twitter to make the case that "mail-in ballots are not subject to fraud."McEnany wouldn't go into details about what the social media executive order would entail, as it would mean getting ahead of the president, but Trump posted on Twitter Thursday would be a "big day for social media and fairness!"Link to ImageGraphic kayleigh mcenany twitter fact check trump chinaMandel Ngan/AFP/GettyWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany speaks to the press on May 15 in the Brady Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, D.C.

People who traveled to hot spots were designated with a red bar code and directed to quarantine themselves. Citizens without such a travel history were given a green bar code, allowing them to move freely.The Chinese government reportedly announced an initiative in 2017 to rate citizens in a social credit system, penalizing people for criminal behavior as well as what they buy, do and say. The country began implementing President Xi Jinping's policy of “once untrustworthy, always restricted” in May of that year.Hangzhou's health commission said Friday that it was considering a permanent version of the tool, TheWSJ noted, citing information on the commission's website.“At the same time, we can use big data to rate group health in apartment buildings, residential communities and businesses,” Hangzhou health commission chief Sun Yongrong said, according to TheWSJ.

Josh Hawley of Missouri expressed the belief that such techniques could be abused and ultimately violate citizens' rights of privacy.Apple and Google have been unresponsive to the Daily Caller News Foundation's requests for comment about the tools.Governors and city officials are also deploying drones from a Chinese firm to police their citizens.Elizabeth, New Jersey, Mayor J. Christian Bollwage, for instance, is using drones from China-based            company DJI to warn citizens who are walking outdoors not to get too close in physical proximity to other people. The drones blare sirens and issue this warning: “Stop gathering, disperse and go home.”Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are engaged in an inquiry to determine the breadth of a DJI drone program donating drones to city officials as they seek to protect people from the virus, the DCNF reported on May 13.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Coronavirus in US: markets crash after Donald Trump threat to ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 1, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 754 wordsBodyU.S. President Donald Trump's new threat to impose tariffs on China for the coronavirus shook global markets on Friday.In New York, the Wall Street Stock Exchange fell sharply at the opening and the dow Jones main index closed with a 2.55% decline after Trump reiterated Thursday that covid-19 could originate from a lab in the Chinese Asian country and raise the possibility of setting more trade tariffs on chinese product entry.Markets are well aware of the global economic impact of the pandemic, and tech giants Apple and Amazon became the latest companies to announce troubling results, in a context of worldwide layoffs and forecasts of cuts in companies' profits.The dark landscape deepened further with the launch of a survey that points to a historic decline in U.S. manufacturing activity in April. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) index is currently at its lowest level since 2009, during the global financial crisis.In Asia, major exchanges did not operate on Friday to mark Labor Day, except for Tokyo whose Nikkei index closed at a drop of 2.84%, according to data from the Bloomberg agency.The same was the case with the vast majority of European markets, with the exception of London whose FTSE indicator lost 1.99%.Trump's accusations, flatly debunked by China, seemed to contradict the statements of his chief of intelligence Mike Pompeo who said, "We don't know exactly where it started."Whether true or not, Trump's statements cause tensions at a time when the World Health Organization (WHO) called for a Chinese investigation into the "animal origins" of the pandemic.Scientists believe the virus jumped from animals to humans, emerging in China late last year, possibly from a market in Wuhan City that sells exotic animals for human consumption.But speculative theories have revolved around a top-secret lab in central China.Asked whether he had seen anything to make him think the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the source of the outbreak, Trump replied, "Yes, I've seen it."But he refused to give details, and Pompeo said he had not seen conclusive evidence."We don't know if it came from Wuhan Virology Institute. We don't know if it came from the market or somewhere else. We don't know those answers," he added.In Geneva, a WHO spokesperson said a number of investigations were underway on the origin of the virus, adding that the global agency is "not currently involved in studies in China.""WHO would be willing to work with international partners and, at the invitation of the Chinese government, participate in research on the origin of animals," Tarik Jasarevic told the AFP agency.Beijing has repeatedly denied that the laboratory was the source of the virus.The pandemic has disrupted the world's economies and kept billions of people confined to their homes. But now that contagions in several regions are stabilizing, European countries and some U.S. cities have begun to ease the social and economic constraints decreed to curb the pandemic, joining Asian countries that feel they have already left behind the worst of the crisis.While mortality rates are slowing in most of Europe, thepandemic has left nearly 235,000 people dead worldwide and more than 3.2 million contagions,according to a balance sheet set by AFP this Friday from official sources.The country with the highest death toll is the United States with some 63,000 deaths (and more than 1 million cases). It is followed by Italy, with more than 28,000 dead and some 205,400 cases; United Kingdom, with more than 27,500 killed (about 171,200 cases); Spain, with some 24,800 deaths (about 215,200 cases), and France, which exceeds 24,500 deaths (about 167,100 cases).PAHO warningIn Latin America, where the pandemic already caused more than 11,000 deaths and 215,000 contagions, according to official figures, several countries also contemplate lifting some restrictions.But "an immediate easing of the measures could be disastrous," said Marcos Espinal, director of the department of contagious diseases at the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).In Bolivia, which will make quarantine more flexible from May 11, a pan-headed protest broke the silence Thursday night in the cities of El Alto and La Paz, after Congress passed a law to call general elections within 90 days in the middle of a pandemic.In Brazil, confinement was prolonged in Rio de Janeiro until 11 May, a decision taken against the opinion of President Jair Bolsonaro, who advocates the resumption of economic activity at all costs.Source: AFPLoad-Date: May 2, 2020End of Document

Large brands linked to forced labour of Uighurs in China, NGO denouncesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 2, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 405 wordsBodyChina moved tens of thousands of members of the Uighur Muslim minority, detained in internment camps, to factories supplying at least 80 major global brands, according to a report from the Australian think tank released on Monday.Between 2017 and 2019, more than 80,000 Uighurs, detained in the Xinjiang region (northwest), were transferred to factories "belonging to the supply chain of 83 globally known brands in technology, textiles and the automotive industry," he said Australian Institute of Political Strategy (ASPI)."The factories resort to forced labour by Uighurs under a (Chinese)-controlled transfer mechanism, which stains production chains on a global scale," the institute said in a 56-page report.Among the brands noted are big names of electronics (such as Apple, Sony, Samsung, Microsoft, Nokia), textiles (Adidas, Lacoste, Gap, Nike, Puma, Uniqlo, H&M; and others) and even the automobile (BMW, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, Land Rover, Jaguar), according to the Document.Large Chinese groups were also identified, including car manufacturers, but also high-tech such as Haier (home appliances), Huawei or Oppo (smart phones).The Chinese government launched a maximum security policy in Xinjiang in response to the inter-ethnic violence that has bloodied this vast region in recent years, attributed by the authorities to separatist Uighurs.Several human rights organizations accuse China of having admitted at least one million Muslims to "re-education camps" in Xinjiang. Beijing denies that figure and talks about "vocational training centres" to support employment and combat religious extremism.However, according to the report of the Australian Think tank, Uighur workers transferred to factories in the rest of China remain deprived of their liberty and forced to work under close surveillance."Companies that benefit from forced labour by Uighurs in their production chain violate laws prohibiting the importation of goods produced" under these conditions, he said.The report urges the groups noted "to conduct immediate and thorough investigations into respect for human rights in factories supplying them in China".The AFP contacted some of these companies. The Xinjiang authorities and the Foreign Ministry were not immediately available to react.The government recognizes the transfer of "surplus labor" from Xinjiang to other regions in the name of the fight against poverty.arb/dm/lth/jug/sbr/jhd/misLoad-Date: March 3, 2020End of Document

Monday Sunrise Briefing: No deal yet on U.S. economic rescue; Catch me up on the weekend news: Congress struggles to agree on a huge rescue deal, China sends supplies worldwide, and Kenny Rogers dies.The Christian Science MonitorMarch 23, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: WorldLength: 948 wordsByline: David Clark Scott Audience Engagement EditorBodyA huge economic rescue bill in Congress careened off track Sunday.  On Saturday, Republicans and Democrats said they were nearing agreement after marathon talks on the approximately $2 trillion package to help Americans. But by Sunday night, the cooperation had slipped. The disagreement is reportedly over the balance between helping families, workers, and healthcare providers vs. helping corporations. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the plan would give workers and businesses assistance to cover payrolls for the next 10 weeks; unemployment insurance; and a one-time "bridge payment" of about $3,000 for a family of four. Democrats pushed for food aid and small business loans, and said three months of unemployment insurance is not enough. They said the draft plan has a $500 billion "corporate slush fund" that lacks specifics, and doesn't effectively ban corporate stock buy-backs.Investors are hoping Washington can soften the blow of the healthcare crisis and what many economists say is a looming recession.[Editor's note: As a public service, all our coronavirus coverage is free. No paywall.]2. A helping hand? China is moving quickly to help nations struggling with COVID-19. But some analysts are skeptical of Beijing's motives. It's using the global crisis to build political goodwill and defuse criticism that it allowed the disease to spread, critics say. "The Chinese government's failures ... will be less harshly viewed in light of the failures of other governments to respond effectively as well,"Julian Ku at Hofstra University told the Associated Press. Serbia's president welcomed a shipment of medical supplies from his "brother and friend," Chinese leader Xi Jinping. China is sending 100,000 test kits to the Philippines. More than 10 flights carrying millions of masks and other supplies are bound for the Czech Republic this week. Nearly 80 countries sent supplies to China during its outbreak. "It is China's traditional virtue to repay goodwill with greater kindness," a Chinese foreign ministry official said, citing an ancient Confucian saying: "You throw a peach to me, and I give you a white jade for friendship."3. Master of the 4-minute story. Kenny Rogers, the husky-voiced Grammy-winning balladeer, whose career spanned six decades and multiple music genres, passed on Friday night.  "You either do what everyone else is doing and you do it better, or you do what no one else is doing and you don't invite comparison," Rogers told The Associated Press in 2015. "So I found something that I could do that didn't invite comparison...."His biggest hits included "Lucille," "Lady" "Islands in the Stream" and "The Gambler." "Kenny was one of those artists who transcended beyond one format and geographic borders," says Sarah Trahern, chief executive officer of the Country Music Association. Look AheadTuesday, March 24Going home: Passengers from the Grand Princess cruise ship who have been quarantined on three US military bases in California are expected to be released on Tuesday and Wednesday Cinematic fast-forward: "Just Mercy," a legal drama starring Jamie Foxx and Michael B.

The event aims to draw attention to climate change, sustainability, and offer  "a spotlight moment that puts nature at the center of international conversations," according to WWF, the main sponsor. Inspiration WatchFirst, it was the Italians. Then, the Germans took to their balconies and rooftops to sing in solidarity with Italy. In the Bavarian town of Bamberg, they brought instruments out and sang "Bella Ciao," an Italian resistance song, The Guardian reports.And on Friday, residents of a Dallas, Texas building gathered a flash choir at the windows. Tenor Danzel Barber led the quarantine singalong, captured on video by KERA-TV member (and building resident) and organized by Bonnie Currie, another building resident. She chose the Bill Withers song, "Lean on me" and her neighbors responded. "It's an amazing moment of community," Ms. Currie told NPR. "People coming together even though we have to stay apart."Indeed, kindness, community, and inspiration are spreading worldwide.Hidden gemStart your week with a recent story that inspired Monitor readers:Quidditch in Uganda: On this pitch, women and men are equalSneak previewIn tonight's Daily Edition, watch for the changing nature of capitalism, the next story in our Navigating Uncertainty series.Finally, check out the Monitor's selected stories from Friday's subscription-only Daily Edition:How do you do social distancing in a refugee camp?'I love this city to my bones': How Mayor Jenny Durkan leads SeattleGrocery clerks get a new title: Emergency respondersThe next Tesla?

Editorial Roundup: USDaily Collegian: Pennsylvania State UniversityMarch 25, 2020 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 4200 wordsBodyExcerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad:---March 24The Chicago Tribune on adopting a pet while social distancing amid the new coronavirus:During the current period of enforced isolation and social distancing, you may be craving warmth, companionship and plain old physical closeness. You may yearn to snuggle on the couch, feel valued and talk honestly about your practical problems and deep anxieties.Did you know dogs are attentive listeners?Animal shelters are among the many industries adapting to coronavirus regulations and stay-at-home orders. If you're considering adopting or fostering a pet, you can do most of the groundwork online. Has the prospect occurred to you? Why not get a pet?If you think YouTube cat videos are a treat, imagine a live performance all day, every day. Granted, a lot of the spectacle will involve sleeping. But as TV personality Jane Pauley once noted, "You can't look at a sleeping cat and be tense." An important note: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, "We do not have evidence that companion animals, including pets, can spread COVID-19."If you aren't ready for a permanent arrangement, you can take a pet on a temporary basis, known as fostering. That frees shelter space and allows the animal to get used to life in a real home. If you're new to pet ownership, or not quite sure, you can think of this arrangement as a trial run to learn whether it's right for you. At worst, you'll serve as a bridge between the dog or cat and its permanent placement. At best, you'll fall hopelessly in love.PAWS Chicago founder Paula Fasseas says that organization has established a virtual adoption process, which allows interested adopters to browse animals online and talk to an adoption counselor without leaving their homes. If you take a pet home and change your mind, you can get a refund on fees, which range from $25 to $400. With all due respect to Garfield, cats are cheaper to adopt.Other rescue facilities have shifted from regular visiting hours to meet-and-greet appointments.Not only might this be a perfect time for people to adopt or foster, it may be a time when saviors are especially needed. Brian Krajewski, chairman of the Animal Services Committee for DuPage County, says that in periods of economic trouble, it's not unusual to see an increase in the number of animals being handed over by owners or simply dumped by the side of the road."It happens when people lose their jobs, or they can't afford to keep their pet, or they have to move and can't take their pet with them," he says. Owners who are quarantined or hospitalized by COVID-19 may be unable to care for their pets or to find someone else to do it. His agency and its rescue shelter partners can use help in accommodating these animals.If you decide to take on this humane task, you'll have the satisfaction of knowing you made a worthwhile contribution during a time of national crisis. And, from the animal you take in, you'll get an endless supply of gratitude.Online: https://www.chicagotribune.com/---March 24The Baltimore Sun on the postponement of the Summer 2020 Olympic Games:Historically, it takes a war to postpone or cancel the modern Olympic Games. Since 1896, there have been three cancellations - the 1916 Berlin games (World War I); and the 1940 and 1944 games (World War II) in Japan, then Helsinki, Finland, and, for the latter games, London and Italy. That's a pretty high standard. There have been Olympics in some pretty bad times from the rise of Adolf Hitler's Germany in 1936 to the post-Afghanistan invasion by the Soviet Union Olympics of 1980 which the United States and some of its western allies boycotted.Tuesday's announcement by Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that he and the International Olympic Committee came to an agreement to postpone the summer games to the summer of 2021 at the latest came as no big surprise under the circumstances. But it should serve as a reminder that the coronavirus outbreak will not be over in a matter of days or even weeks: The Olympics were not set to open in Tokyo until July 24."The leaders agreed that the Olympic Games in Tokyo could stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times and that the Olympic flame could become the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present," the parties announced in a joint statement. That is a lovely thought. And it certainly is not the first time that world leaders looked to the world's largest sporting event to salve global wounds.Athletes like Reisterstown-native Olivia Gruver, a champion pole-vaulter, are likely disappointed. World-class skills can be a perishable commodity. But they, perhaps better than most, understand the limits of the human body and the risks conducting the games would have presented to everyone involved including their families. Meanwhile, Japan is looking at a major economic blow. The Olympics had been expected to bring more than 600,000 visitors to the island nation, and preparations already cost it more than $12 billion.President Donald Trump is already given to comparing the battle against COVID-19 as a military conflict positioning himself as a wartime president. In a sense, the delay of the Olympics supports that narrative.But the Olympics will rise again. Just as the U.S. and other nations will emerge from these days and weeks of quarantine. People will get back to work. Schools will eventually reopen. The economy will bounce back. But there's a lesson in sports about health and injury. Athletes who have serious injury and try to get back in the game prematurely often cause a far worse outcome, turning a sprained knee, for example, into a candidate for surgery. Patience is as much a part of competition as motivation. Coaches often call this "playing smart." Sometimes, you accept short-term setbacks in order to achieve long-term gain. Preventing hospitals and other medical providers from being overwhelmed by COVID-19 victims, that's the goal here, that's the finish line. The sacrifice has been significant but not yet to the point where it outweighs that higher purpose of saving lives.Here's the best part of the Olympic postponement: It wasn't about politics. Organizers simply recognized that this was not the time. The risks were not worth the reward. Reason won the day. We cheer for elected leaders who approach the outbreak in the manner of an athlete looking to win the gold: Pay no attention to the complainers, don't get distracted by the unimportant, listen to expert coaching, focus on the goal at hand, recognize our limits and, of course, saying a little prayer never hurt.Online: https://www.baltimoresun.com/---March 24The Wall Street Journal on letting private companies handle their own businesses when it comes to producing product that would combat the new coronavirus:President Trump can't do right by some critics no matter what he does. For three years he's been denounced as a reckless authoritarian, and now he's attacked for not being authoritarian enough by refusing to commandeer American industry. The truth is that private industry is responding to the coronavirus without command and control by the federal government.Last week Mr. Trump invoked the 1950 Defense Production Act that lets a President during a national emergency order business to manufacture products for national defense, set wage and price controls and allocate materials. On Tuesday the Federal Emergency Management Agency used the Korean War-era law for the first time in this crisis to procure and distribute testing kits and face masks.But Democrats want the Administration to take over much more of the private economy. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday tweeted that the federal government should "nationalize the medical supply chain" and "order companies to make gowns, masks and gloves." He has been echoed by Democratic governors and leaders in Congress.Yet businesses across America are already chipping in where they can. Aerospace manufacturer Honeywell plans to hire 500 workers at its plant in Rhode Island, which currently produces safety goggles, to make millions of N95 face masks for medical professionals. 3M has doubled its global output of N95 masks and this week is sending 500,000 respirators to hot spots in the U.S.Corporations including Apple, Facebook, Tesla and Goldman Sachs are donating millions of medical masks stockpiled for wildfires or a biochemical attack. Apparel manufacturers are repurposing textile mills to produce personal protective equipment. Hanes plans to manufacture masks using U.S. cotton at factories in El Salvador, Honduras and the Dominican Republic. Diverse supply chains can help businesses operate more flexibly during a crisis since they don't depend on any single country for materials or workers. That's why an America first or America only government supply order would be a mistake.Maine-based Puritan Medical Products, one of America's top sources for nose swabs, says it has been rushing to keep up with orders even as some workers have become sick. Directing the company to produce more coronavirus swabs won't do any good if it can't get more workers and could create a shortage of flu tests if it has to divert resources from other lines.Businesses know their workforce capacities and supply chains better than the government-and how to retool them to maximize efficiency. Dozens of breweries and distillers including Anheuser-Busch and Pernod Ricard USA are churning out hand sanitizer. General Electric plans to hire more workers to produce ventilators even while it lays off thousands in aviation. Fuel cell manufacturer Bloom Energy is retrofitting hundreds of old ventilators for the state of California.Ford said on Tuesday that it would start assembling plastic face shields and work with 3M and GE to make respirators and ventilators. General Motors is also exploring how to use its global automotive supply chain to make ventilators. Ford's CEO said its ventilators could be available by June, and it isn't obvious that a government takeover of manufacturing would speed this up.It might make sense for the federal government to purchase supplies from manufacturers and then allocate them to hospitals and states with the highest need. But it doesn't make sense to order manufacturers like Apple or GM to make nose swabs or chemical reagents for testing kits if they don't have the expertise or suppliers to do so.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers can also help convert vacant hotels and college dorms into make-shift hospitals, as it is doing in New York. When this pandemic is over, one of the lessons is likely to be that the government should have done more earlier to purchase and surge medical equipment to hospitals.But dictating to businesses now will lead to bureaucratic snafus and inefficiencies. President Trump said Sunday "we're a country not based on nationalizing our business." That's the right impulse. America needs to emerge from this with a private economy intact and ready to grow again, not nationalized industries subject to bureaucratic and political control.Online: https://www.wsj.com/---March 24The London Evening Standard on crowds traveling the London Underground amid the new coronavirus:This morning, as happened yesterday, there were scenes of packed peak-hour Tubes, trains and buses. This makes a mockery of advice to keep at least two metres apart to limit the risk of infection.Passengers are right to be angry that they are being put at risk. Transport staff fear for their safety too. This can't go on. The Government, the Mayor and transport bosses need a better plan.While millions of people are working from home - or, for a time, not able to work at all - huge numbers of us still need to travel. That doesn't just mean NHS staff or teachers keeping schools open for key workers, but everyone who keeps our city fed, safe and functioning - from engineers who make sure our broadband works to delivery drivers who bring food and fill the supermarket shelves.They need to travel, and they have a right to do so in safety.Last week transport bosses prepared a plan which saw some Tube stations close altogether and which cut back the frequency of services. For most of the day, this plan works. Overall demand on the Tube has fallen by 85 per cent this week.But it's not enough to cope with the pressure of peak travel so far in the morning. National rail services, running less often, are also crowded in places.The obvious thing to do would be to roll back some of the cuts. But there's a problem. Already around 750 Tube drivers are self-isolating, and as the coronavirus crisis grows, staff shortages will grow too.London's transport bosses say they can't run more trains and they want to make sure they have staff to keep lines open.We understand the challenge but in the next few days more frequent services are necessary.What matters most is that only essential workers travel. But what counts as essential?Many building sites remain open, and it is impossible for people on them to work remotely. Around half of London's construction workers are self-employed and, without any other reliable income, will keep coming to work.The pressure of numbers is causing overcrowding. One answer would be to shut construction sites.It might come to that, but there should be no reason why, when run properly, work cannot continue at a reduced level. Construction firms should stagger their start times so not all their workers have to come in at once.They could also limit the amount of work being done on sites.We need a plan for this, fast. The order from the Prime Minister is clear and it is right - travel only for essential reasons and keep apart when you do.If your journey isn't essential, stay off the Underground.Online: https://www.standard.co.uk/---March 23The New York Times on the language used to refer to the coronavirus:We've been down this road before, too many times. In the 14th century the Black Death provoked mass violence against Jews, Catalans, clerics and beggars; when syphilis spread in the 15th century, it was called variously the Neapolitan, French, Polish and German disease, depending on who was pointing the blame; when the plague struck Honolulu in 1899, officials burned down Chinatown. And so on, down to our times, when epidemics like Ebola, SARS and Zika fueled animus toward specific regions or peoples.Here we are in 2020, with Asians being assailed across the United States and around the world as purported sources of the "Chinese flu," the "Wuhan coronavirus" or simply the "foreign virus." Once again, a mysterious, fast-spreading and sometimes lethal disease is exacerbating racism and hatred - only now with the help of the potent megaphone of social media.As the coronavirus has spread from its beachhead in Wuhan, China, old anti-Asian prejudices have spread with it, from the "Yellow Peril" canard that led to the lynching of Chinese in the 1870s to stereotypes of Chinese as dirty and decrepit.As The Times reported on Monday, Chinese-Americans and other Asians lumped together with them by racists are being beaten, spat on, yelled at and insulted from coast to coast, driving some members of the maligned minority to purchase firearms in the fear of worse to come as the pandemic deepens.The United States is not alone in this blight of xenophobia. Japan's Kyodo News agency described similar incidents of anti-Asian bigotry wherever the coronavirus has struck: Asian students pelted with eggs in Leicestershire, England, or people in Egypt yelling out "corona" when passing Asians in the street. Vile posts on social media have made graphic threats in rants against Asians over the coronavirus.However much mystery still surrounds the coronavirus, these are not the Dark Ages, and there really should be no reason to remind people that this terrible new virus makes no distinction among races or nations. Though it makes good medical sense to keep a distance from people who have been to an area with a high rate of infection - which today is effectively anywhere - it is foolish and malicious to hold the Chinese (or any other) people responsible for the spread of the virus, or to assume that they are somehow more likely to be its carriers.A time of great fear and danger requires solidarity, humanity, sacrifice and hope, and not hysteria or hatred. That should be the message of the world's political, social, religious and corporate leaders as they race to find ways to cope with the lethal virus. Many leaders have done just that.It is more than unfortunate, then, that President Trump, some members of his cabinet and some conservative politicians have opted to fan the bigotry by deliberately using the term "Wuhan virus" or "Chinese virus." Mr. Trump, who spent previous months calling it the coronavirus, started defending the use of "Chinese virus" last week. Photographs of a text of the speech he was reading seemed to show "Corona" lined out and "Chinese" written in the president's hand. Mr. Trump tweeted support of the Asian-American community on Monday, but his many supporters online had already embraced his formulation.In tying the virus to China, the president has also adopted the argument of Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, that referring to Wuhan or China is payback for Chinese disinformation and for Beijing's delay in letting the world know of the outbreak. Of course, it is possible to hold the Chinese government accountable for its handling of the crisis and its spread of misinformation without maligning a nation of more than 1.3 billion people or the people of Chinese descent who make their homes in nations around the world.The xenophobia and prejudices that result from naming new infectious diseases after places, people or animals are the reasons the World Health Organization has urged against doing so, and instead using generic descriptive terms like "coronavirus." Names like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Spanish flu, swine flu or monkey pox, the W.H.O. said, can have serious consequences, whether provoking a backlash against members of a particular community or prompting needless slaughter of food animals.In the end, though, the anti-Asian hatreds spread by the coronavirus are not solely the product of politics, but of the deep fears that have always accompanied the outbreak of lethal pathogens. It is for all Americans to try, in whatever ways they can, to remain united and compassionate as the disease invades all facets of our lives.Online: https://www.nytimes.com/---March 22The SunSentinel on whether the U.S. was unprepared for the new coronavirus:It may never be known how many people caught the new coronavirus while standing for hours in densely packed international airports, waiting for the government to screen them. That happened even as some governors and mayors began taking drastic steps to eliminate crowds, and long after sporting leagues had voluntarily shut down to limit the contagion.Like almost everything else the federal government has done in this crisis, it came desperately late, was conceived on the fly, and confirmed that there had been an appalling absence of planning for just the sort of a pandemic that experts had warned was inevitable.That unreadiness was a monstrous failure to apply what the government already knew about its vulnerabilities.During 2019, the administration had simulated just such a scenario. As disclosed by the New York Times this week, the Department of Health and Human Services conducted an exercise code-named "Crimson Contagion" to gauge how public and private agencies across the nation would respond to an imaginary pandemic eerily like the new coronavirus. It theorized that 110 million Americans would be infected, 7.7 million would be hospitalized and 586,000 would die.The exercise caught the government woefully unprepared.The 46-page staff report, stamped "for official use only" and not to be disclosed to anyone who didn't "need to know," identified rampant confusion and bureaucratic turf wars. State agencies and hospitals did not know what equipment was at hand or could be found. Too little emergency money was in reserve. States were at odds over whether to close schools.Among the findings:- "The current medical countermeasure supply chain and production capacity cannot meet the demands imposed by nations during a global influenza pandemic."- "States experienced multiple challenges requesting resources from the federal government due to a lack of standardized, well-understood and properly executed resource request procedures."- "States questioned federal resource allocation decisions in response to an influenza pandemic."- "A significant topic of concern centered around the inadequacies of existing executive branch and statutory authorities to provide HHS with the requisite mechanisms to serve successfully as the lead federal agency in response to an influenza pandemic."What was done with this alarming information other than keeping it secret from the American people and, as far as we know, from Congress?A copy went to the White House, which now claims it took steps to improve the quality and quantity of flu vaccines. The response fell far short.Of all the subsequent failures, the most consequential are probably the dire shortages of testing kits, protective gear for health care workers and first responders, and respirators for the most critically ill victims.In South Korea, by contrast, there had been only four known cases when health officials took emergency steps to develop and mass-produce tests. For weeks, that nation has been testing more than 10,000 people a day and new cases are declining while ours are nearly doubling daily.The blame for America's unreadiness is widely shared, with HHS Secretary Alex Azar and President Donald Trump at the top of the list.It is doubtful that Trump even saw the report or would have cared to read it. But as Harry Truman said, the buck stops at the president's desk. He is responsible also for having spent two months downplaying the danger after it had become obvious to almost everyone else."We pretty much shut it down coming from China," he said. He promised that "by April ... it miraculously goes away," and that it will "disappear." He even called it a "hoax," fostered by Democrats to hurt him politically. Now, despite the video clips, he claims that he knew all along it was serious.It took the collapse of the stock markets to get his attention. The president who berated Barack Obama for how he healed the economic damage of 2008 is now repudiating almost everything he and other Republicans have long said against the government's responsibility to rescue a staggering economy.But yes, dramatic action is necessary. The major questions are in the details.Without doubt, there needs to be massive help to individuals and small businesses crippled by the necessary social distancing. Some industries, like the airlines, are too important to be allowed to fail.But sympathy comes especially hard for the airlines, for which Trump proposes $50 billion. They squandered their tax cut windfalls, and then some, on buying back their stocks in order to boost value, which meant executives would be paid more. They spared almost nothing for investment or reserves. Over the past decade, 96% of the free cash flow at the biggest airlines went to buy back their own shares.Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other Democrats properly demand strong terms for the airlines, which should be applied to all industries that accept emergency funding. The essential ones include a ban on stock buybacks and a three-year freeze on dividends and executive bonuses.Moreover, any bailouts should come with a lien on subsequent profits, if not an outright stake in equity.After coping with the current emergency, Congress must demand to know why America was so unprepared; why the warnings of the "Crimson Contagion" exercise were ignored, and what should be done about the institutional weaknesses that bitter experience is confirming.This could best be done by a bipartisan commission, along the lines of the 9/11 Commission. Even a new and better president will need a new and better system than today's fragmented array of turf warriors.One key question: Should there be a permanent, career, nonpolitical health directorate with independence akin to that of the Federal Reserve?The fundamental duty of any government is to protect its citizens. That applies as fully to public health as to defense against foreign and domestic enemies.The military has contingency plans for almost any imaginable attack, or so we are told. After Ebola, MERS, SARS, Swine Flue, Zika and HIV-Aids, why were the civilian agencies so unprepared for yet another pandemic?This won't be the last one. But it had better be the last for which our nation was unready.Online: https://www.sun-sentinel.com/Submit a Letter to the EditorIf you're interested in submitting a Letter to the Editor, click here.Submit• Send Letter to the EditorCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Editorial Roundup: USAssociated Press InternationalMarch 25, 2020 Wednesday 9:02 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: DOMESTIC NEWS; Editorial RoundupLength: 4153 wordsByline: By The Associated PressBodyExcerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad:___March 24The Chicago Tribune on adopting a pet while social distancing amid the new coronavirus:During the current period of enforced isolation and social distancing, you may be craving warmth, companionship and plain old physical closeness. You may yearn to snuggle on the couch, feel valued and talk honestly about your practical problems and deep anxieties.Did you know dogs are attentive listeners?Animal shelters are among the many industries adapting to coronavirus regulations and stay-at-home orders. If you're considering adopting or fostering a pet, you can do most of the groundwork online. Has the prospect occurred to you? Why not get a pet?If you think YouTube cat videos are a treat, imagine a live performance all day, every day. Granted, a lot of the spectacle will involve sleeping. But as TV personality Jane Pauley once noted, "You can't look at a sleeping cat and be tense." An important note: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, "We do not have evidence that companion animals, including pets, can spread COVID-19."If you aren't ready for a permanent arrangement, you can take a pet on a temporary basis, known as fostering. That frees shelter space and allows the animal to get used to life in a real home. If you're new to pet ownership, or not quite sure, you can think of this arrangement as a trial run to learn whether it's right for you. At worst, you'll serve as a bridge between the dog or cat and its permanent placement. At best, you'll fall hopelessly in love.PAWS Chicago founder Paula Fasseas says that organization has established a virtual adoption process, which allows interested adopters to browse animals online and talk to an adoption counselor without leaving their homes. If you take a pet home and change your mind, you can get a refund on fees, which range from $25 to $400. With all due respect to Garfield, cats are cheaper to adopt.Other rescue facilities have shifted from regular visiting hours to meet-and-greet appointments.Not only might this be a perfect time for people to adopt or foster, it may be a time when saviors are especially needed. Brian Krajewski, chairman of the Animal Services Committee for DuPage County, says that in periods of economic trouble, it's not unusual to see an increase in the number of animals being handed over by owners or simply dumped by the side of the road."It happens when people lose their jobs, or they can't afford to keep their pet, or they have to move and can't take their pet with them," he says. Owners who are quarantined or hospitalized by COVID-19 may be unable to care for their pets or to find someone else to do it. His agency and its rescue shelter partners can use help in accommodating these animals.If you decide to take on this humane task, you'll have the satisfaction of knowing you made a worthwhile contribution during a time of national crisis. And, from the animal you take in, you'll get an endless supply of gratitude.Online: https://www.chicagotribune.com/___March 24The Baltimore Sun on the postponement of the Summer 2020 Olympic Games:Historically, it takes a war to postpone or cancel the modern Olympic Games. Since 1896, there have been three cancellations - the 1916 Berlin games (World War I); and the 1940 and 1944 games (World War II) in Japan, then Helsinki, Finland, and, for the latter games, London and Italy. That's a pretty high standard. There have been Olympics in some pretty bad times from the rise of Adolf Hitler's Germany in 1936 to the post-Afghanistan invasion by the Soviet Union Olympics of 1980 which the United States and some of its western allies boycotted.Tuesday's announcement by Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that he and the International Olympic Committee came to an agreement to postpone the summer games to the summer of 2021 at the latest came as no big surprise under the circumstances. But it should serve as a reminder that the coronavirus outbreak will not be over in a matter of days or even weeks: The Olympics were not set to open in Tokyo until July 24."The leaders agreed that the Olympic Games in Tokyo could stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times and that the Olympic flame could become the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present," the parties announced in a joint statement. That is a lovely thought. And it certainly is not the first time that world leaders looked to the world's largest sporting event to salve global wounds.Athletes like Reisterstown-native Olivia Gruver, a champion pole-vaulter, are likely disappointed. World-class skills can be a perishable commodity. But they, perhaps better than most, understand the limits of the human body and the risks conducting the games would have presented to everyone involved including their families. Meanwhile, Japan is looking at a major economic blow. The Olympics had been expected to bring more than 600,000 visitors to the island nation, and preparations already cost it more than $12 billion.President Donald Trump is already given to comparing the battle against COVID-19 as a military conflict positioning himself as a wartime president. In a sense, the delay of the Olympics supports that narrative.But the Olympics will rise again. Just as the U.S. and other nations will emerge from these days and weeks of quarantine. People will get back to work. Schools will eventually reopen. The economy will bounce back. But there's a lesson in sports about health and injury. Athletes who have serious injury and try to get back in the game prematurely often cause a far worse outcome, turning a sprained knee, for example, into a candidate for surgery. Patience is as much a part of competition as motivation. Coaches often call this "playing smart." Sometimes, you accept short-term setbacks in order to achieve long-term gain. Preventing hospitals and other medical providers from being overwhelmed by COVID-19 victims, that's the goal here, that's the finish line. The sacrifice has been significant but not yet to the point where it outweighs that higher purpose of saving lives.Here's the best part of the Olympic postponement: It wasn't about politics. Organizers simply recognized that this was not the time. The risks were not worth the reward. Reason won the day. We cheer for elected leaders who approach the outbreak in the manner of an athlete looking to win the gold: Pay no attention to the complainers, don't get distracted by the unimportant, listen to expert coaching, focus on the goal at hand, recognize our limits and, of course, saying a little prayer never hurt.Online: https://www.baltimoresun.com/___March 24The Wall Street Journal on letting private companies handle their own businesses when it comes to producing product that would combat the new coronavirus:President Trump can't do right by some critics no matter what he does. For three years he's been denounced as a reckless authoritarian, and now he's attacked for not being authoritarian enough by refusing to commandeer American industry. The truth is that private industry is responding to the coronavirus without command and control by the federal government.Last week Mr. Trump invoked the 1950 Defense Production Act that lets a President during a national emergency order business to manufacture products for national defense, set wage and price controls and allocate materials. On Tuesday the Federal Emergency Management Agency used the Korean War-era law for the first time in this crisis to procure and distribute testing kits and face masks.But Democrats want the Administration to take over much more of the private economy. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday tweeted that the federal government should "nationalize the medical supply chain" and "order companies to make gowns, masks and gloves." He has been echoed by Democratic governors and leaders in Congress.Yet businesses across America are already chipping in where they can. Aerospace manufacturer Honeywell plans to hire 500 workers at its plant in Rhode Island, which currently produces safety goggles, to make millions of N95 face masks for medical professionals. 3M has doubled its global output of N95 masks and this week is sending 500,000 respirators to hot spots in the U.S.Corporations including Apple, Facebook, Tesla and Goldman Sachs are donating millions of medical masks stockpiled for wildfires or a biochemical attack. Apparel manufacturers are repurposing textile mills to produce personal protective equipment. Hanes plans to manufacture masks using U.S. cotton at factories in El Salvador, Honduras and the Dominican Republic. Diverse supply chains can help businesses operate more flexibly during a crisis since they don't depend on any single country for materials or workers. That's why an America first or America only government supply order would be a mistake.Maine-based Puritan Medical Products, one of America's top sources for nose swabs, says it has been rushing to keep up with orders even as some workers have become sick. Directing the company to produce more coronavirus swabs won't do any good if it can't get more workers and could create a shortage of flu tests if it has to divert resources from other lines.Businesses know their workforce capacities and supply chains better than the government-and how to retool them to maximize efficiency. Dozens of breweries and distillers including Anheuser-Busch and Pernod Ricard USA are churning out hand sanitizer. General Electric plans to hire more workers to produce ventilators even while it lays off thousands in aviation. Fuel cell manufacturer Bloom Energy is retrofitting hundreds of old ventilators for the state of California.Ford said on Tuesday that it would start assembling plastic face shields and work with 3M and GE to make respirators and ventilators. General Motors is also exploring how to use its global automotive supply chain to make ventilators. Ford's CEO said its ventilators could be available by June, and it isn't obvious that a government takeover of manufacturing would speed this up.It might make sense for the federal government to purchase supplies from manufacturers and then allocate them to hospitals and states with the highest need. But it doesn't make sense to order manufacturers like Apple or GM to make nose swabs or chemical reagents for testing kits if they don't have the expertise or suppliers to do so.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers can also help convert vacant hotels and college dorms into make-shift hospitals, as it is doing in New York. When this pandemic is over, one of the lessons is likely to be that the government should have done more earlier to purchase and surge medical equipment to hospitals.But dictating to businesses now will lead to bureaucratic snafus and inefficiencies. President Trump said Sunday "we're a country not based on nationalizing our business." That's the right impulse. America needs to emerge from this with a private economy intact and ready to grow again, not nationalized industries subject to bureaucratic and political control.Online: https://www.wsj.com/___March 24The London Evening Standard on crowds traveling the London Underground amid the new coronavirus:This morning, as happened yesterday, there were scenes of packed peak-hour Tubes, trains and buses. This makes a mockery of advice to keep at least two metres apart to limit the risk of infection.Passengers are right to be angry that they are being put at risk. Transport staff fear for their safety too. This can't go on. The Government, the Mayor and transport bosses need a better plan.While millions of people are working from home - or, for a time, not able to work at all - huge numbers of us still need to travel. That doesn't just mean NHS staff or teachers keeping schools open for key workers, but everyone who keeps our city fed, safe and functioning - from engineers who make sure our broadband works to delivery drivers who bring food and fill the supermarket shelves.They need to travel, and they have a right to do so in safety.Last week transport bosses prepared a plan which saw some Tube stations close altogether and which cut back the frequency of services. For most of the day, this plan works. Overall demand on the Tube has fallen by 85 per cent this week.But it's not enough to cope with the pressure of peak travel so far in the morning. National rail services, running less often, are also crowded in places.The obvious thing to do would be to roll back some of the cuts. But there's a problem. Already around 750 Tube drivers are self-isolating, and as the coronavirus crisis grows, staff shortages will grow too.London's transport bosses say they can't run more trains and they want to make sure they have staff to keep lines open.We understand the challenge but in the next few days more frequent services are necessary.What matters most is that only essential workers travel. But what counts as essential?Many building sites remain open, and it is impossible for people on them to work remotely. Around half of London's construction workers are self-employed and, without any other reliable income, will keep coming to work.The pressure of numbers is causing overcrowding. One answer would be to shut construction sites.It might come to that, but there should be no reason why, when run properly, work cannot continue at a reduced level. Construction firms should stagger their start times so not all their workers have to come in at once.They could also limit the amount of work being done on sites.We need a plan for this, fast. The order from the Prime Minister is clear and it is right - travel only for essential reasons and keep apart when you do.If your journey isn't essential, stay off the Underground.Online: https://www.standard.co.uk/___March 23The New York Times on the language used to refer to the coronavirus:We've been down this road before, too many times. In the 14th century the Black Death provoked mass violence against Jews, Catalans, clerics and beggars; when syphilis spread in the 15th century, it was called variously the Neapolitan, French, Polish and German disease, depending on who was pointing the blame; when the plague struck Honolulu in 1899, officials burned down Chinatown. And so on, down to our times, when epidemics like Ebola, SARS and Zika fueled animus toward specific regions or peoples.Here we are in 2020, with Asians being assailed across the United States and around the world as purported sources of the "Chinese flu," the "Wuhan coronavirus" or simply the "foreign virus." Once again, a mysterious, fast-spreading and sometimes lethal disease is exacerbating racism and hatred - only now with the help of the potent megaphone of social media.As the coronavirus has spread from its beachhead in Wuhan, China, old anti-Asian prejudices have spread with it, from the "Yellow Peril" canard that led to the lynching of Chinese in the 1870s to stereotypes of Chinese as dirty and decrepit.As The Times reported on Monday, Chinese-Americans and other Asians lumped together with them by racists are being beaten, spat on, yelled at and insulted from coast to coast, driving some members of the maligned minority to purchase firearms in the fear of worse to come as the pandemic deepens.The United States is not alone in this blight of xenophobia. Japan's Kyodo News agency described similar incidents of anti-Asian bigotry wherever the coronavirus has struck: Asian students pelted with eggs in Leicestershire, England, or people in Egypt yelling out "corona" when passing Asians in the street. Vile posts on social media have made graphic threats in rants against Asians over the coronavirus.However much mystery still surrounds the coronavirus, these are not the Dark Ages, and there really should be no reason to remind people that this terrible new virus makes no distinction among races or nations. Though it makes good medical sense to keep a distance from people who have been to an area with a high rate of infection - which today is effectively anywhere - it is foolish and malicious to hold the Chinese (or any other) people responsible for the spread of the virus, or to assume that they are somehow more likely to be its carriers.A time of great fear and danger requires solidarity, humanity, sacrifice and hope, and not hysteria or hatred. That should be the message of the world's political, social, religious and corporate leaders as they race to find ways to cope with the lethal virus. Many leaders have done just that.It is more than unfortunate, then, that President Trump, some members of his cabinet and some conservative politicians have opted to fan the bigotry by deliberately using the term "Wuhan virus" or "Chinese virus." Mr. Trump, who spent previous months calling it the coronavirus, started defending the use of "Chinese virus" last week. Photographs of a text of the speech he was reading seemed to show "Corona" lined out and "Chinese" written in the president's hand. Mr. Trump tweeted support of the Asian-American community on Monday, but his many supporters online had already embraced his formulation.In tying the virus to China, the president has also adopted the argument of Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, that referring to Wuhan or China is payback for Chinese disinformation and for Beijing's delay in letting the world know of the outbreak. Of course, it is possible to hold the Chinese government accountable for its handling of the crisis and its spread of misinformation without maligning a nation of more than 1.3 billion people or the people of Chinese descent who make their homes in nations around the world.The xenophobia and prejudices that result from naming new infectious diseases after places, people or animals are the reasons the World Health Organization has urged against doing so, and instead using generic descriptive terms like "coronavirus." Names like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Spanish flu, swine flu or monkey pox, the W.H.O. said, can have serious consequences, whether provoking a backlash against members of a particular community or prompting needless slaughter of food animals.In the end, though, the anti-Asian hatreds spread by the coronavirus are not solely the product of politics, but of the deep fears that have always accompanied the outbreak of lethal pathogens. It is for all Americans to try, in whatever ways they can, to remain united and compassionate as the disease invades all facets of our lives.Online: https://www.nytimes.com/___March 22The SunSentinel on whether the U.S. was unprepared for the new coronavirus:It may never be known how many people caught the new coronavirus while standing for hours in densely packed international airports, waiting for the government to screen them. That happened even as some governors and mayors began taking drastic steps to eliminate crowds, and long after sporting leagues had voluntarily shut down to limit the contagion.Like almost everything else the federal government has done in this crisis, it came desperately late, was conceived on the fly, and confirmed that there had been an appalling absence of planning for just the sort of a pandemic that experts had warned was inevitable.That unreadiness was a monstrous failure to apply what the government already knew about its vulnerabilities.During 2019, the administration had simulated just such a scenario.

Pompeo: United States condemns China's attempts to 'steal' COVID-19 dataUPIMay 14, 2020 Thursday 10:45 PM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 505 wordsByline: DARRYL COOTEDateline: May 14 BodyThe United States condemns China's attempts to "steal" U.S. intellectual property and data related to COVID-19 research, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday after federal authorities warned the Chinese government was looking to hack U.S. organizations.The statement of condemnation follows the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issuing a public service announcement on Wednesday to warn U.S. organizations researching the coronavirus to be on the lookout for suspicious activity, stating "China's efforts to target these sectors pose a significant threat to our nation's response to COVID-19."The United States' top diplomat called on the People's Republic of China to "cease this malicious activity.""The PRC's behavior in cyberspace is an extension of its counterproductive actions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic," Pompeo said in a statement Thursday. "While the United States and our allies and partners are coordinating a collective, transparent response to save lives, the PRC continues to silence scientists journalists and citizens, and to spread disinformation, which has exacerbated the dangers of this health crisis."According to the Wednesday warning from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security's CISA, actors on China's behalf have been "observed" attempting to find and "illicitly obtain" U.S. intellectual property and public health data related to vaccines, treatments and testing through networks and personnel connected to COVID-19 research.Pompeo reiterated that theft of this information may jeopardize treatment options in the United States.Following the release of the FBI report, China chastized it as "slanderous," stating the Chinese Communist Party has no need to steal such information as it is "leading the world in COVID-19 treatment and vaccine research."Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian said during a regular press briefing Thursday China is a victim of cyberattacks and opposes it in all forms, accusing the United States of spreading rumors to "scapegoat" from its own response."It should not seek to distract attention and deflect responsibility by unrelentingly pinning the blame on others," he said.Tensions between the two countries have risen amid the coronavirus pandemic as the United States has repeatedly accused China of attempting to coverup its initial outbreak -- accusations that China, ground zero of the virus, has denied.The United States has also frequently accused the Asian nation of withholding key information about COVID-19, including the identity of the so-called patient zero, and Pompeo early this month blamed China's opacity and efforts to conceal the outbreak for the hundreds of thousands of deaths attributed to the virus.The disease, which emerged in early December in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has since infected the world over, claiming more than 300,000 lives and sickening more than 4.4 million people, according to a live tracker of the virus by Johns Hopkins University.Load-Date: May 14, 2020End of Document

Next Round of US-China Trade Talks to be Toughest YetPR NewswireMarch 19, 2020 Thursday 7:00 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 658 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON, March 19, 2020 BodyPR Newswire China's fast-paced economic rise and flouting of globally accepted market rules -- along with the growing economic fallout from COVID-19 -- has put the US-China Phase II negotiations near the top of the critical issues facing the US postelection.As detailed in a new report by the Committee for Economic Development of The Conference Board (CED), while the first phase of the US-China trade deal has eased tension, it also set the stage for discussions on the most contentious economic issues. Points of dispute include forced technology transfers, cyber theft of intellectual property (IP), industrial policies, state subsidies, and new technology, according to The China Trade Challenge: Phase II."The Phase II negotiations will encompass critical challenges to both US national security and economic policies," said Lori Esposito Murray, President of CED.  "Policymakers and trade officials will need to leverage all levers of US power to maintain the benefits of free and fair market competition, uphold the values that have stood the free-world community in good stead since World War II, and convince the Chinese that they have a stake in this system that propelled their advancement and growth."The new CED brief issued these recommendations for policymakers as they prepare for the second round of negotiations:Establish a high-level Task Force to undertake a comprehensive "decoupling assessment" of US-China trade relations and dependencies. Prior to launching the Phase II negotiations, reach a common understanding with allied advanced economies on a technology-security treaty. Re-examine anti-monopoly rules that prevent industries from standing as one against Chinese government pressure. Survey where and how US businesses and interests are restricted in China, and gradually ensure similar restrictions on China's interest until it opens its economy in those spaces. Ensure that China is held to global standards set forth in the WTO rules, which include opening its borders to foreign direct investment and to imported goods and services. Unite the world trading community to repair, update, and upgrade the WTO treaty and all its related systems, especially enforcement procedures. Treat IP theft and forced technology transfers as crossing "red lines" that will result in severe and immediate economic penalties. Involve European, Japanese, Korean, and Australian representatives in pressing China to reform its cross-border trade and investment approach. Immediately begin negotiating the US's reentrance into the TPP-11 (now called the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP).

Resources Connection, Inc. Reports Third Quarter Results for Fiscal 2020; Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Highlights:; Business WireApril 2, 2020 Thursday 8:05 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 4941 wordsDateline: IRVINE, Calif. BodyResources Connection, Inc. (Nasdaq: RGP), a multinational business consulting firm, operating as Resources Global Professionals (the "Company" or "RGP"), today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended February 22, 2020.Restructuring InitiativeThis quarter we embarked on the latest phase of our transformation journey, performing a deep and strategic review of our global business, focused initially on North America and Asia Pacific. Based on our findings, we formulated an action plan to streamline our organizational structure, improve operating efficiency and more effectively align resources to business priorities. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, our management team and board of directors committed to a restructuring plan to reduce approximately 7.5% of our management and administrative workforce and consolidate our geographic presence to certain key markets, while shifting to a virtual operating model in most other markets.We carried out a reduction in force in early March, whereby we eliminated 73 positions in North America and Asia Pacific. This process allowed us to remove leadership layers and nonessential positions to simplify our organizational structure and streamline operations. We believe these efforts will make our teams more efficient and improve the employee experience. Our review of the European business is still underway. We will report further on the European review and actions when the work is complete in fiscal 2021. We expect to take a restructuring charge of $4 million to $5 million, of which approximately $3 million will be taken in the fourth quarter of 2020. Upon completion of the reduction in force, the Company expects annual pre-tax savings of $13 million to $15 million with respect to personnel costs. In fiscal 2021, after the impact of COVID-19 is clearer, we may reinvest a limited amount of those personnel savings in the business to drive forward certain growth initiatives in core markets and digital capabilities.As a second element of our restructuring plan, we determined that our current physical footprint is not well aligned with our evolving go-to-market strategy or with strong business and industry trends favoring virtual operating models. Our new real estate strategy focuses our real estate investment in a set of core high growth markets where we also host client events and trainings and provides for a shift to virtual operations in most other markets. The transition to virtual is supported by a robust array of enhanced technical tools which enable and accelerate virtual work. While the exact timing of these changes depends on a number of variables, we currently expect to terminate or sublet 26% of our existing real estate leases by the end of the 2020 calendar year. We expect to incur approximately $1 million of lease termination costs and other costs associated with exiting the facilities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Additional restructuring charges are expected through fiscal 2021 as management continues to execute the plan to exit the real estate leases. Upon completion of the exit plan, the Company expects annual pre-tax savings of $3 million to $4 million with respect to occupancy costs.We believe the actions we are taking to strengthen the business will enable us to operate with greater agility as we seek to ensure our organizational health and resilience in this volatile macro-economic climate.Management Commentary"We are operating now in a new normal. Our utmost concern is for our people - our employees and our clients. We have pivoted rapidly to a virtual operating model and are doing everything we can to stay productive, while continuing to serve all of our people with empathy, speed and creativity," said Kate Duchene, chief executive officer. "COVID-19 impacted RGP in Q3 in our Asia Pac region. That, plus the tough holiday dynamics created a challenging backdrop these past three months. I am proud we were able to deliver revenue results close to the high-end of our expectations in the third quarter despite these conditions - and we saw continued strengthening in both closed revenue and pipeline in January and February. In the past few weeks, COVID-19 has become a truly global pandemic and we are relieved to have taken significant action in early March to improve our operating model and cost structure. While we cannot predict with certainty how the pandemic will impact our business in the coming months, I believe our timely initiative to reduce cost and streamline operations will serve us well."RESOURCES CONNECTION, INC.

On a constant currency basis, revenue decreased 6.2% from the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and decreased 9.1% from the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 included $5.4 million of revenue attributable to Veracity. Excluding the impact of the Veracity acquisition and the exit activities in Europe in fiscal 2020, revenue decreased $14.5 million, or 8.2% compared to the prior year quarter (8.1% on a constant currency basis). On a comparable basis, the decrease in revenue compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019 reflected the impact of additional holidays in the U.S. (third quarter of fiscal 2020 included the Thanksgiving holidays and was impacted by the mid-week timing of Christmas and New Year's Day) and the adverse impact from an extended Lunar New year's holiday and COVID 19 in Asia Pacific.Revenue decreased sequentially primarily reflecting the impact of three additional holidays in the U.S. (third quarter of fiscal 2020 included the Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day holidays while the second quarter of fiscal 2020 included only Labor Day) as well as the mid-week timing of Christmas and New Year's Day and Europe (Christmas and New Year's Day in third quarter of fiscal 2020), as well as the extended Lunar New Year's holiday and the adverse impact of COVID 19 in Asia Pacific.In January 2020, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) surfaced in Wuhan, China. In an effort to contain the spread, the Chinese government mandated immediate business closures and restricted certain travel within the country. As a result of these restrictions, many businesses in China extended their Chinese New Year holiday shut down by one to two weeks. Our practices based in China and other parts of Asia adopted virtual methods of working in order to ensure business continuity for both our clients and the Company. Nevertheless, the events relating to COVID-19 had an adverse impact on our revenue in Asia Pacific during the quarter ended February 22, 2020. As events relating to COVID-19 continue to develop globally, including in the U.S., there is significant uncertainty as to the likely effects of this pandemic which may, among other things, reduce demand for or delay client decisions to procure our services. While not yet quantifiable, management expects the COVID-19 pandemic to have an adverse impact on our operating results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and continues to assess the financial impact for the upcoming fiscal year.Gross margin for the third quarter was 36.5%, decreasing 130 basis points from the third quarter of fiscal 2019, and 380 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential decreases are related primarily to an increase in holiday pay for consultants in the U.S. (third quarter of fiscal 2020 included the Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day holidays while the third quarter of fiscal 2019 included only the Christmas and New Year's Day holidays and second quarter of fiscal 2020 included only Labor Day) and a lower bill to pay ratio. The sequential decrease in gross margin reflects a similar trend and is further impacted by higher payroll taxes at the beginning of the calendar year.SG&A was $55.3 million, or 32.9% of revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and $55.6 million, or 31.0% of revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The year-over-year dollar decrease in SG&A is primarily attributable to: (1) a $0.8 million decrease in incentive compensation as a result of the lower revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, (2) a $0.5 million decrease in stock compensation, (3) a $0.5 decrease in expenses relating to contingent consideration, and (4) a $0.8 million decrease related to occupancy and office related expenses, partially offset by $2.2 million in additional payroll and benefit costs due to additional headcount related to project delivery and digital transformation efforts, including VeracitySequentially, SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased by 380 basis points from 29.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The primary reasons for the increase were: (1) a $1.1 million increase in payroll taxes as we transition into a new calendar year in the third quarter, (2) a $0.4 million increase in bad debt expense, (3) a $0.3 million increase in self medical insurance, and (4) a $0.4 million increase in software expense, partially offset by $0.7 million increase in a benefit relating to contingent consideration in connection with Veracity.Our income tax provision primarily includes tax expense (benefit) on operating results of our U.S. and foreign entities, all taxed at different statutory rates applicable in the various tax jurisdictions, changes in valuation allowances related to tax benefits of certain foreign locations and tax expense (benefit) related to stock-based compensation for nonqualified stock options and for disqualifying dispositions under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. We record income tax expense (benefit) based upon actual results versus a forecasted tax rate because of the volatility in its international operations that span numerous tax jurisdictions.The third quarter of fiscal 2020 had an income tax benefit of $4.0 million (an effective tax benefit rate of (135%)) as compared to an income tax expense of $3.8 million (an effective tax rate of 40%) for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The income tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of a deduction related to a worthless stock loss in the Company's investment in its wholly owned subsidiaries, partially offset by taxes on operating income. The Company, after analyzing the facts and circumstances, determined to no longer invest in the Belgium, Luxembourg and the Nordics markets which includes Sweden and Norway. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company filed a U.S. tax election to liquidate, thus disregarding the aforementioned entities, enabling the Company to claim $6.6 million of benefit in our U.S. tax return for the tax basis of the investments.First Nine Months of Fiscal 2020Revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2020 decreased 4.0% compared to the prior year period. On a constant currency basis, revenue decreased 3.7%. Revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 included $12.6 million of revenue in North America attributable to Veracity as well as lost revenue of $7.3 million as a result of our exiting of the Nordics and Belgium markets. Excluding the impact of the Veracity acquisition and the impact of exiting the Nordics and Belgium markets, revenue decreased $27.4 million, or 5.1% (4.8% constant currency), compared to the prior year period. The decrease in revenue on a comparable basis reflected the impact of the wind-down of lease accounting implementation projects, the completion of other large projects as well as the impact of COVID-19 in China and political protests in Hong Kong.Gross margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2020 was 38.7%, increasing 40 basis points from the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The year-over-year improvement is related primarily to an improved bill/pay ratio.SG&A was $166.0 million, or 31.6% of revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2020 and $166.9 million, or 30.5% of revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The year-over-year dollar decrease in SG&A is primarily attributable to: (1) a decrease of $4.1 million in incentive compensation expense as a result of the decrease in revenue during the first nine months of fiscal 2020, (2) a decrease of $1.6 million in transformation and system implementation costs, (3) a decrease of $1.4 million in business expenses as management continues to closely manage discretionary spend, and (4) a decrease of $1.1 million in rent expense, partially offset by an increase of $6.5 million in payroll and benefits due to additional headcount related to project delivery and digital transformation efforts, including Veracity and $0.6 million of acquisition costs in the first half of fiscal 2020.Income tax expense was $4.0 million (an effective tax rate of 14%) and $12.5 million (an effective tax rate of 36%), for the nine months ended February 22, 2020 and February 23, 2019, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense in the nine months ended February 22, 2020 compared to the prior year comparable period was primarily caused by the worthless stock deduction taken during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 (see third quarter discussion above) as well as lower operating income.For all periods presented, the Company is unable to benefit from, or has limitations on the benefit of, tax losses in certain foreign jurisdictions. To a lesser extent, the accounting treatment under GAAP for the cost associated with unexercised expiring stock options and shares purchased through the Employee Stock Purchase Plan has caused volatility in the Company's effective tax rate.Conference Call InformationRGP will hold a conference call for analysts and investors at 5:00 p.m., ET today, April 2, 2020.

Such forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as "anticipates," "believes," "can," "continue," "could," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "may," "plans," "potential," "predicts," "remain," "should" or "will" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. In this press release, such statements include statements regarding our expectations for growth, the expected impact of our recent restructuring actions, the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operating results and the expected impact of our previously-announced operational initiatives and our new business pipeline. Such statements and all phases of the Company's operations are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements and those of our industry to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include uncertainties regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the economy generally; our ability to successfully execute on our strategic initiatives, our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive professional services market and to secure new projects from clients, our ability to successfully integrate any acquired companies, seasonality, overall economic conditions and other factors and uncertainties as are identified in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 25, 2019 and our other public filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission (File No. 000-32113). Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business or operating results. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company does not intend, and undertakes no obligation, to update the forward-looking statements in this press release to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, unless required by law to do so.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Company utilizes certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not defined by, or calculated in accordance with, GAAP to assess our financial and operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of operations; or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure so calculated and presented. The following are the Company's non-GAAP measures:• Constant currency revenue amounts represent the outcome that would have resulted had exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period.• Organic revenue is calculated as GAAP revenue less revenues from acquired businesses and revenues related to businesses that the Company disposed of either through sale or abandonment.• Constant currency organic revenue amounts represent the outcome that would have resulted had exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect and applied to the same organic revenue in the comparable prior year period.• Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net income before amortization of intangible assets, depreciation expense, interest and income taxes plus stock-based compensation expense and plus or minus contingent consideration adjustments.• Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by revenue.• Cash tax rate excludes the non-cash tax impact of stock-based compensation expense, non-cash tax benefits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the U.S., and non-cash impact of valuation allowances on international deferred tax assets.• Adjusted income tax (benefit) expense, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per common share were calculated based on the Company's cash tax rates, which exclude the non-cash tax impact of stock-based compensation expense, non-cash tax benefits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and non-cash tax impact of valuation allowances on international deferred tax assets.We believe that constant currency revenue, organic revenue, constant currency organic revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted income tax (benefit) expense, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted diluted earnings per common share, which are used by management to assess the core performance of our Company, provide useful information to our investors because they are alternative financial measures that investors can also use to assess the core performance of our Company from period to period and compare it to the Company's peers. Constant currency revenue, organic revenue, constant currency organic revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted net income and Adjusted diluted earnings per common share are not measurements of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or construed as substitutes for net income or other cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP for purposes of analyzing our profitability or liquidity. These measures, as well as the Adjusted income tax (benefit) expense and cash tax rate should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net income, earnings per share, cash flows or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.RESOURCES CONNECTION, INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(Amounts in thousands, except per share

IMPOSING IMMIGRATION-RELATED VISA AND ENTRY SANCTIONS TO OPEN THE DOORS TO CHINA'S LABSStates News ServiceApril 28, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1608 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for Immigration Studies:By Dan CadmanReaders may recall that in January, long before others, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) warned of the possibility of a pandemic emanating from China and called for a travel ban. For his prescience, he was treated to scorn from the chattering classes and the mainstream media the same ones who now fault President Trump for his slow response to the virus's onset. Even major health organizations piled on and suggested that Cotton's remarks were unhelpful and unnecessary. But who was proved wrong by events? Not Cotton.The senator has since penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal (partially behind a paywall), suggesting that circumstantial-but-cogent evidence points to the virus emanating from a biolab in Wuhan. This same point has been made by Jim Geraghty, writing in National Review.Considered objectively, there is much about the theory that makes sense. It would also explain why the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which rules the People's Republic of China (PRC) with an iron hand, authorized reopening of the "wet markets" in Wuhan, to the horror of many worldwide. It suggests that party officials know that, however despicable the markets are, they were not the source of the coronavirus whose global death toll is now quickly approaching 200,000.In his op-ed, Cotton has made the point that until the CCP allows an open and unfettered inquiry rather than denying entry to health officials and expelling journalists who refuse to be silenced we may never know for sure. This is, of course, unacceptable from any conceivable moral, intellectual, scientific, or even international legal standpoint. But what can be done? Verbal rebukes mean nothing to the CCP.A part of the answer lies in imposing visa sanctions against all citizens and nationals of the PRC: No granting of visas, and denial of entry to those already possessing visas of any kind, including tourists, students, scholars, and temporary guestworkers headed for jobs in Silicon Valley or elsewhere. None. The only exceptions would be for returning PRC nationals who already possess lawful permanent resident status, or for refugee entrants and the latter only when they are at significant risk. As my colleague Nayla Rush has observed:Resettlement must be a ticket out only for refugees who are genuinely at risk in the countries hosting them. But contrary to common claims, for most resettlement is not a matter of life and death. Only 17 percent of UNHCR global resettlement submissions in 2018 were urgent or emergency ones.What would be the legal bases for an action suspending virtually all visas and entries of PRC nationals?First, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) already contains language providing for the exclusion or deportation of aliens whose presence is contrary to the foreign policy interests of the United States see INA sections 212(a)(3)(C) and 237(a)(4)(C).Although these provisions are generally understood to be applicable to individual aliens (and should be invoked each and every time a PRC national seeks a visa or applies for admission at a port of entry), the rationale behind them is even more important when applied to a class of aliens if the result will be opening doors to scientific inquiry needed to save thousands of lives now and in the future. Is that not a critical foreign policy interest of the United States? Surely that argument is incontestable.Second, those particular "foreign policy" removal provisions are not the only legal justifications that may be relied upon for invoking the sanctions they, and the important logic behind them, merely undergird and reinforce Sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA. Section 212(f) is the same robust presidential authority already used for other executive orders (the so-called terrorist "travel ban" and the most recent suspension of green card processing to prevent the spread of the virus), and Section 215(a) was invoked by President Jimmy Carter to order registration and, when necessary, expulsion, of Iranian students in the United States subsequent to the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979. Carter's presidential order also ordered the suspension of both immigrant and nonimmigrant visa processing for Iranian nationals using Section 215(a).Department of Homeland Security nonimmigrant statistics relating to PRC nationals reflect that in fiscal year 2018:Among nonimmigrants, (see Supplementary Table 27d) there were 2,625,021 tourist and business admissions; 657,996 student and scholar admissions; 108,751 temporary worker admissions; 11,803 "all other classes" (a catchall for everyone from fiances to journalists); and 5,659 "unknown", for a total of 3,409,230 PRC admissions in that year alone. Note than an admission doesn't always equal one alien, as some individuals may depart and reenter in the same year, but even so, that is a huge number. Note also that admissions of diplomats and other accredited international representatives from the PRC have been excluded from this total.Among immigrant categories (see Table 10) there were 24,022 immediate relative visas; 11,728 "family sponsored" (extended family) visas; 18,843 employment-based visas; 19 diversity lottery visas; 10,420 adjustments to permanent residence by refugees and asylees; and 182 unspecified "other" immigrant visas, for a total of 65,214 permanent admissions of PRC nationals to the United States. Note that, unlike nonimmigrant admissions, there is a one-to-one ratio between immigrant admissions and aliens.Cumulatively, those PRC immigrant and nonimmigrant admissions for 2018 total 3,474,444 an astoundingly high figure, even given the qualification previously noted about nonimmigrant figures.Two points merit emphasis:First, were the president to suspend visas and entry of PRC nationals, it should not be, or be viewed as, a punitive measure. It's worth remembering that citizens and nationals of the PRC, whether they are majority-group Han Chinese, or ethnic minorities such as Uighurs or Tibetans or others, are the foremost, and most frequent, victims of the CCP's totalitarian domination of the country and its consistent violation of their fundamental rights. Were we to know the real toll of virus-related deaths in China, instead of the bogus statistics put forward by the PRC, one suspects that we would be shocked. But of course the CCP never wants us to glimpse the truth for fear that the man behind the red curtain will be revealed in all his impotence. Rather, imposing these sanctions is to exert maximum pressure on the CCP to open up the suspect laboratories (there are two in Wuhan that merit scrutiny), as well as all data sources so that the origin of the virus may be located and examined in granular detail for scientific purposes. The president can make clear that the suspensions will only remain in place until the PRC does open its doors literally and figuratively for the scientific explorations needed.Second, the president should encourage other like-minded leaders to pile on the pressure and do the same. The United States has a history of taking the lead in calling other nations to action on important global matters. Discovering the origins of this virus is of paramount importance, and collective action is not only in American interests, but will in the end probably be necessary to succeed. Italy and the United Kingdom come immediately to mind, but the more nations the better, since the world will be a better (and safer) place once everything that can be known about coronavirus and its spread is known.If imposed by a community of nations, such visa and entry sanctions would constitute the kind of powerful pressure point to which the CCP is likely to respond since it will not want to be cast into the role of pariah nation (where it rightly belongs after its scurrilous behavior in covering up the existence and spread of the virus). It is also a collective manner of pushback against aggressive Chinese pressure being applied to individual countries like Australia that have demanded accountability, only to be told they will be subjected to economic boycotts and other harsh reactions if they don't back off.Such sanctions would also probably bring with them domestic pressure of the type the CCP likes to keep a lid on. This is because literally millions of PRC business people, intending students and scholars, and temporary workers will be furious at being cut off from their economic contacts, prestigious schools of learning, and research institutions throughout the world.What's more, spouses and family members of the communist party elite enjoy the perquisites of frequent travel to the United States, the UK, France, Australia, and other such countries; being denied this ability will undoubtedly have unhappy repercussions at home for many senior officials.Multiply the nearly 3.5 million nonimmigrant and immigrant PRC admissions to the United States for just 2018 many times over for even just a few of the world's developed countries, and one can see the magnitude of the problem that the CCP would face were the cork to be put into the bottle on visas and entries by a community of nations working to pressure the Chinese government to open up its records and laboratories for inspection as it ought to be doing of its own accord.Immigration-related visa and entry sanctions may not be adequate by themselves, and certainly other economic and/or politico-diplomatic measures could and should be considered. But they are a start, and accountability from the People's Republic of China is something the world should not only expect but demand.Load-Date: April 28, 2020End of Document

Brazilian minister offends China with tweet over coronavirusCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 6, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 365 wordsBodyChina on Monday demanded explanations from Brazil after Education Minister Abraham Weintraub linked the coronavirus pandemic to an Alleged Plan of the Asian country "to dominate the world," he wrote on Twitter, mocking the Chinese accent."Geopolitically, who could be strengthened, in relative terms, from this global crisis?" asked Weintraub in his Saturday tweet, replacing in his text the letter "r" with a capital "L", for example, to say "BLasil" instead of Brazil."Who are the allies in BLasil of the infallible plan to dominate the world?" the minister continued.China's embassy in Brasilia condemned the message as "absurd and despicable," with a "highly racist wedge.""The Chinese government is waiting for an official explanation of Brazil," Ambassador Yang Wanming wrote on Twitter.This new diplomatic shock occurs at a time when Brazil, like many other countries, is trying to buy China medical equipment to deal with the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.In an interview, Weintraub defended his tweet and asked China to do more to help fight the pandemic.If they sell the 1,000 respirators correctly [to Brazil], I get down on my knees in front of the embassy, I apologize and say I was an, the minister said.Last week, Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta said Brazil is struggling to buy respiratory fans and other medical supplies produced in China, as several purchases made with China were cancelled without explanation.The controversy with China, Brazil's main trading partner, became a trend on Twitter under the hashtag "Commercial BlockingChinoYa".Brazil is the Latin American country most affected by the new coronavirus, with nearly 500 deaths and more than 11,000 confirmed cases.Since the eruption of the pandemic, ties between the two nations have been strained after Deputy Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of U.S. President Jair Bolsonaro, criticized china for its handling of the crisis and calling the new coronavirus "Chinese virus," as did US President Donald Trump.That episode prompted the Consul general of China in Rio de Janeiro, Li Yang, to question the MP in an opinion column in the OGlobo newspaper: "Are you so naive and ignorant?"jhb/val/js/lpLoad-Date: April 7, 2020End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 28 of 304The new normal in Chinese jobs: head coverings, constant cleaning and absolute vigilance  Page 30 of 304Moulton's backing of resolution against China faces backlash  Page 32 of 304Shenzhen, China's great metropolis of technology  Page 35 of 304Suspected espionage and stolen plans: how the Chinese brand that threatens Tesla with cheaper cars emerged  Page 37 of 304The controversial theory of a Chinese diplomat: says the U.S. Army brought the coronavirus to Wuhan  Page 39 of 304FBI arrests researcher for NASA who allegedly failed to report ties to China  Page 43 of 304What Trump's Twitter Feed Tells Him About the Coronavirus  Page 45 of 304Here's How The Media Is Pushing Chinese Propaganda And Talking Points  Page 50 of 304Intelligent Transportation System Market Size to Reach USD 8474.2 Million by 2026; Rising Number of Automated & Connected Cars to Propel Growth: Fortune Busines....  Page  of Arkansas professor accused of not disclosing ties to China  Page 53 of 304Trump Goes Soft When Asked About Intel Report Allegedly Confirming China Underreported Coronavirus Data  Page 64 of 304WHILE DEMOCRATS SPIN FICTION, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS LEADING THE NATION TO ADDRESS THE CORONAVIRUS  Page 66 of 304Chinese social network WeChat closes account that defamed US  Page 68 of 304INDONESIA PROBES DEATH OF SIXTH MAN LINKED WITH CHINESE FISHING BOATS  Page 71 of 304Sens.
