TikTok Could Become A Powerful Propaganda Tool If It Stays With China, Experts WarnThe Daily CallerAugust 4, 2020 Tuesday 01:25 AM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; techLength: 2334 wordsByline: Chris White, Tech Reporter, chris@dailycallernewsfoundation.orgChris is a Missourian trying to find news angles in the blank spaces of life. Also go Chiefs!Author ImageBodyLink to Image• China could use TikTok as a powerful propaganda tool if ByteDance, its China-based parent company, retains ownership, according to national security analysts and China experts.• The authoritarian regime could suppress or promote content to benefit the Chinese Communist Party, the experts said. Data collected through the app could be used to create propaganda, they went on to say.• TikTok has denied that it's beholden to China, and Microsoft is in talks to purchase the app.TikTok could become a powerful propaganda tool capable of shifting American public opinion if it remains in the hands of its Chinese parent company, national security analysts and China experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation.The authoritarian regime could use data collected through TikTok to produce more targeted, and consequently, effective propaganda, the experts, who favored banning the app, said. The app could also be used to influence U.S. politics, spy on the nation, or suppress or promote content to benefit the Chinese Communist Party.“You could influence political behavior or engage in information environment-shaping, or propaganda. All these things can be done, and have been done,” Stephen Yates, CEO of the public policy consultancy firm DC International Advisory, said of a foreign country's ability to use social media platforms as weapons.TikTok has faced increased scrutiny across both the U.S. government as well as private industry, and President Donald Trump floated banning the app. Microsoft is in preliminary talks to purchase TikTok from its parent company, ByteDance, the software company confirmed Sunday.Suppressing and promoting contentChina could control what content users see on the app, suppressing videos that are critical of the authoritarian regime or amplifying ones it finds beneficial, according to Yates.While TikTok is primarily known for its use among Generation Z to create and view dance and comedy videos, the app has already reportedly influenced U.S. politics on at least one occasion.TikTok users coordinated an effort to get people who didn't intend on attending a Trump campaign rally in Tulsa sign up for it, CNN reported in June. One TikTok post urging fans of Korean pop to sign up for June rally received over 100,000 likes. Mary Jo Laupp, a 51-year-old women in Iowa, reportedly kickstarted the troll campaign.Laupp's video encouraging people to register for free tickets to the rally garnered more than 2 million views. The Trump campaign disputed the claims, saying it weeds out phony registrations.Yet demonstrations in Hong Kong that received worldwide attention were barely mentioned on TikTok, according to a Washington Post report.A hashtag used to identify posts showing resistance to an extradition bill supposedly designed to weaken Hong Kong autonomy, #antielab, had only 11 posts on TikTok, but collected more than 34,000 posts on Instagram at the time of reporting. Meanwhile, Hashtags for #HongKongProtests on TikTok returned either a single video or an error message telling users that TikTok could not “find this hashtag: Check out trending videos.”Link to ImageProtesters supporting Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement wearing protective masks hold signs. REUTERS/Jeenah MoonTikTok also directed moderators to censor content that mentions Tiananmen Square and Tibetan independence and banned religious groups, The Guardian reported in 2019, citing leaked documents highlighting the app's moderation guidelines.The app could similarly suppress content regarding China's treatment of Uighurs, Yates told the DCNF. Numerous reports have shown Uighurs being held in concentration camps and being subjected to forced sterilization.Comparing TikTok To FacebookYates, a foreign policy expert who worked as a deputy national security adviser to former Vice President Dick Cheney, compared TikTok's potential political influence to how Russia used Facebook posts and advertisements to disrupt the U.S. political system ahead of the 2016 election.The Russian government spread disinformation to users on a variety of social media platforms during the last presidential election cycle. Facebook gave Congress roughly 3,000 ads in 2017 with links to Russia. The company said it sold $100,000 worth of ads to Russian-linked sources that investigators believe were trying to influence the the 2016 election.But when it comes to data collection, TikTok and Facebook can't be equated, according to Yates.Washington Post tech columnist Geoffrey Fowler argued on a July 13 that much of the concerns related to TikTok's alleged privacy violations are driven by “xenophobia” and compared its data collection to Facebook, which owns Instagram.“This would be a commercial and political communication platform that gives a hostile power access to people's cell phones and computers in which their entire lives have become dependent,” Yates said of TikTok. The app is totally “within China's sphere of influence,” he added.And Matt Stoller, the Research Director at the American Economic Liberties Project, told the DCNF that the difference between a company like Facebook and TikTok is that one is “controlled by a greedy American” corporation, while the “other is controlled by a genocidal regime hostile to liberal democracy.”TikTok's executives have also managed to avoid U.S. oversight.TikTok executives “couldn't attend hearings and testify because executives were located in #China,” Sen. Josh Hawley tweeted in May. He linked to a report that a former Disney executive, Kevin Mayer, would become the app's new CEO.“But this new executive lives in the USA,” the Missouri Republican continued. “I look forward to hearing from him. Under oath.”Meanwhile, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, along with the CEOs of Google, Apple and Amazon, testified before the House Judiciary's Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law on July 29 over lawmaker concerns that they are building their empires through anti-competitive methods.Potential collaboration with ChinaTikTok has the potential to be used as a spying tool for China, according to Dan Blumenthal, the director of Asian Studies at the American Enterprise Institute. (RELATED:  TikTok Hires Former GOP And Democratic Congressional Staffers To Lobby On US Policy Ahead Of The Election)“The Chinese are building a mass of information about the U.S. including a 'human network map' that makes connections it deems important among U.S. financial, corporate, policy media and political elites,” Blumenthal, who supports banning the app, told the DCNF. “This is both for espionage purposes as well as for purposes of influencing U.S. politics.”Blumenthal did not elaborate on how such data could be used to spy on Americans.But China's National Intelligence Law gives the government authority to compel Chinese companies to collect and provide any information it requests, including data on foreign users, Quartz reported in 2017. The law makes spying a duty for Chinese companies, Yi-Zheng Lian, a former chief editor of the Hong Kong Economic Journal, wrote in a 2019 New York Times editorial.The Australian Strategic Policy Institute reported in 2019 that ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, worked alongside the Chinese Communist Party to enforce the country's strict censorship laws.ByteDance “engaged in deeply unethical behavior in Xinjiang, where their work directly supports and enables mass human rights abuses,” the report, titled “Mapping China's Tech Giants,” said. Xinjiang contains concentration camps where Uighers are held and forced into labor.“ByteDance collaborates with public security bureaus across China, including in Xinjiang where it plays an active role in disseminating the party-state's propaganda on Xinjiang,” the report stated. ByteDance also established a joint venture in December 2019 with a Chinese state media group, Shanghai Dongfang Newspaper Company, Reuters reported in 2019.Additionally, Check Point Research found vulnerabilities in the app that could allow cyber attackers to gain control of TikTok accounts, change the privacy settings on videos, upload videos without permission and obtain email addresses of select users.The app collects troves of data on users, according to the company's privacy policy. If a user downloads and opens an app without ever creating an account, for instance, then TikTok can collect a user's IP address, browsing history on the app, mobile carrier, location data when using a mobile device and information on the device used to gain access to TikTok.Link to ImagePresident Donald Trump speaks. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)Once a user creates an account, TikTok can gather details about every video a user uploads, the length of time he or she watches a video, what type of content he or she like the most, which videos are shared, and any messages a user exchanges on the app. The app's portal also asks users for permission to access other social media accounts, their phone number contact list, and geolocation data.'We are not the enemy'Yates, Blumenthal and Stoller made their comments before TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer addressed concerns about data, before Trump threatened to ban TikTok and before the notion of Microsoft purchasing the app became public.“TikTok has become the latest target, but we are not the enemy,” Mayer wrote Wednesday. He said TikTok will address concerns about “the company's Chinese origins” “through greater transparency and accountability.”Mayer did not address what the company would do if China demanded user data. But TikTok dismisses claims that the company is beholden to the authoritarian regime.“Our security team is led out of the U.S. by our Chief Information Security Officer who has 30-years of Department of Defense and financial services industry experience,” a company spokesperson said in a statement to the DCNF. “TikTok collects much less U.S. user information than many of the companies in our space and stores it in the U.S. and Singapore.”The app launched what company executives called a transparency center in Los Angeles to allow government officials to monitor TikTok's content review process, the company noted in a March blog post.U.S. officials have reported evidence that TikTok is providing personal user data to the CCP. The company is under national security review, Reuters reported Wednesday.Link to ImageThis photo shows the logo of the social media video sharing app Tiktok displayed on a tablet screen in Paris. (LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP via Getty Images)Increasing scrutinyRegardless, companies often use personal data to dramatically influence how people behave and think, according to researchers at Cracked Lab, an independent research institute based in Austria that measures how information networks impact human thinking.“[D]ata-driven persuasion undermines the concept of rational choice and thus the basic foundation of market economy,” the group's researchers wrote in a 2017 report, referring to methods and techniques tech companies use to manipulate users into engaging with content. “When used in political campaigns or in other efforts to shape public policy, it may undermine democracy at large.”A bipartisan slate of lawmakers and U.S. officials have determined TikTok is a major threat. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for example, suggested during in a July 7 Fox News interview that Americans should download the app “only if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.”Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, asked the U.S. intelligence community in 2019 to assess TikTok's national security risks, saying that such apps could be used to spy on U.S. citizens or become targets of foreign influence. Hawley also wants officials to more closely scrutinize the Chinese app.Companies, governmental bodies, and U.S. political campaigns are asking employees to delete the app.Wells Fargo told employees to delete the app amid what executives said were concerns about security, CNN reported on July 13. Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign also directed staffers to stop using TikTok over security concerns, Bloomberg reported.The Department of Defense also advised military personnel in January to remove the app for similar reasons, The New York Times reported.But a federal ban of the app is too extreme, according to Peter Micek, a digital human rights expert at Access Now, a digital rights nonprofit.“[B]anning apps is an extreme measure that does not meet international human rights standards,” Micek told Vice on July 15. “Under international human rights law, blocking an entire service or application is not regarded as necessary and proportionate and has been declared unlawful in several instances.”Much of the concerns related to TikTok's ties to China can be solved through comprehensive data protection regulations, Micek argued. The General Data Protection Regulation, a European Union law passed in 2016, gives social media users control over their own personal data, ZDNet reported in 2019.The law requires companies that gather a person's personal information to disclose the data they collect, declare the reason for processing such data, and explicitly state how long the information will be retained, ZDNet noted. Companies must also explain if any data is being redirected to third-party groups.Conversely, Stoller supports banning the Chinese app.“It's hard to convey just what a yawning gap there is between elite opinion and the obvious right thing to do. The [People's Republic of China] is a dangerous expansionist threat. Literally the least we could do is not allow them to manipulate tens of millions of Americans,” he wrote in a July 20 tweet, referring to critics of banning the application.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

LOL World Cup could follow NBA formula against covidCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 1, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1382 wordsBodySports competitions face their final stages in full uptick in the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, major esports tournaments continue their garter schedule, many of them adapting to an online format and with the vast majority of face-to-face events suspended.On the horizon of esports is getting closer one of the most important competitive video game events of the year: the League of Legends World Championship. And there is still no official confirmation of its celebration, although several sources confirm the possibility of conducting the competition by mimicking the ''system' bubble of the NBA.The League of Legends regional leagues resumed their activity a few weeks ago. Some, like the LEC, have done so online, without audiences and with teams playing remotely. Up to four European clubs could travel to the World Cup if the decision to hold the international competition goes ahead. And it seems so.On the tenth anniversary of the competition, the Worlds are scheduled to return to China this year to crown the world champion of riot Games' most prominent game. At least that's the intention. Although the company made the decision to cancel the Mid-Season Invitational celebration in the face of the inability to travel for most teams, plans for the 2020 World Cup are still going on, although there is still no official confirmation.Cancellation of sporting events in ChinaIn early July, the Chinese government announced its decision not to host anyinternationalsportschampionshipsfor the remaining 2020s. The Chinese decision left such major tournaments as the Golf World Cup,as well as the Shanghai Formula One Grand Prix,so the League of Legends World Cup was also called into question.But it seems that planning is moving forward to bring the best teams in the world to China. From the mayor of Shanghai it was reported that the city would do everything possible to hold the event and the American media espN published that Riot Games was considering replicating the bubble system used by competitions such as the NBA. That is, limit the entire competition to the same city - rather than a touring several cities, as usual - and in an armored sports venue without spectators or possibly press.That's what the so-called 'bubble'The NBA made the decision just over a month ago to resume competition with this system at the Disney World facility in Orlando, USA. The protocol of more than 100 pages developed and sent by the league contemplates all the security measures necessary to guarantee the integrity of the competition and the protection of its participants.In addition to limiting the number of displaced persons per franchise - 35 maximum members for each of the 22 participating teams - a flexible period was established for teams to attend the venue in a staggered manner. To enter the Disney World bubble it was necessary to have tested negative at source, in addition to saving quarantine before passing two new tests upon arrival in Orlando.All teams have been housed in the same three hotels and, in the face of the play-offs, are expected to be relocated into a single building. Each team member is identified with wristbands and an optional proximity alarm for players andmandatory for other team members who alert when they share more than five seconds less than 1.8 meters away.The mask is mandatory except on the court, meals and in the rooms; they will also have to wear the safety garment in the leisure areas - such as in the rest rooms equipped with consoles with the NBA 2K20 - or in the stands if they want to watch other games, always with safety distance and hygiene measures.International transfers would complicate the bubbleMeasurements within the bubble system would be easily adaptable to a League of Legends world championship, with the exception of transfers to move to it. For the NBA it has been relatively easy to manage the arrival of teams in Orlando, always with movements between states within the country itself. But it may not be that easy to get to China for some teams and players in the Riot Games regional leagues.There are still several months left for a competition that usually starts in October. Everything can change in a few weeks depending on the evolution of covid-19, not only in China, but also in the countries of origin of the different classified teams. Each country is applying different rules and protocols in mass passenger transit, and while it could be relatively simple in leagues such as the European LEC - all players reside in Germany - it must be borne in mind that there are a dozen regions that will send their players to China. Regions such as Latin America, Brazil or Vietnam that are currently experiencing an exceptionally complicated situation.Disinfection measures slow competitionAnother drawback that NBA protocol might have if it fits the League of Legends World Cup is time. At Disney World, at least four hours must elapse between games. This is necessary for disinfection teams to clean the facilities after each meeting and before reopening the stadium doors.A measure that, if adapted to the World Cup, would particularly affect the previous stages of the Qualifying Play-In and even the group stage. One possible solution would be to reduce these phases, or even perform the previous phases online and celebrate only the play-off in person,reducing the number of teams and the complexity of the event, although this could produce an inequality between regions that would affect competitive integrity.What would happen if a positive was detected?The NBA protocol leaves very well defined what to do in the event that a coronavirus positive is detected within the bubble. First, the affected person is referred to and moved out of the Disney World enclosure to confirm, through another medical test, that it is indeed a positive case. If confirmed, all direct contacts of the affected person will be put under observation to ensure that the virus has not been transmitted. A player or employee of a team who has tested positive will need to get two negative results before returning to the venue and joining the squad.In the case of the League of Legends World Cup, nothing is yet known about the protocols being studied. There is comprehensive control in regional leagues with tests and quarantines applied to league players and workers. As an example, what happened in week 4 of LEC, when commentator Trevor 'Quickshot' Henry and his wife former and current Misfits worker Becca Henrywere notified of having been in contact with a positive outside the competition. The league decided to relocate its team of commentators and return to the remote broadcast from their homes.The bubble can be puncturedThe NBA has shown that competitive events of the highest level can be held in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, despite being conducted without public and among extreme security measures. The league has followed the protocol, leaving players like Kristaps Prozingis (Dallas Mavericks) out of the call and quarantined him for forgetting to take his coronavirus test.Still, the bubble has proved imperfect. Especially sounded has been the recent controversy starring Los Angeles escort Clippers Lou Williams,who is being investigated for allegedly escaping the bubble to go to a streptease club, after the NBA granted him a permit for a family matter. Protocol determines that a bubble exit involves a four- to ten-day quarantine,so Lou Williams could go without stepping on the court this weekend.China would return to the forefront in 2021If the World Cup is finally held this year in China, it will not be by far the great world cup that the world awaits on the occasion of the 10th anniversary. China would again be the official venue of the international tournament in 2021, while the United States will have to wait until 2020, although, again, there is no official confirmation.It should not be forgotten that the world is an event that is usually prepared months in advance and that implies a technical and logistical complexity that, if celebrated with the bubble system, will be even greater. We will have to wait to see the evolution of the pandemic in the coming weeks to see if we will have global in 2020, and whether it will finally be held in China in whole or in part.Load-Date: August 2, 2020End of Document

Farewell to TikTok in the United StatesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 641 wordsBodyMEXICO CITY, August 7.- Amid tensions and accusations that the TikTok short video platform poses a risk to national security, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order that will block all transactions from ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, so the app could be banned in the coming weeks. Arguing that the decision is part of an effort to "address the national emergency with respect to the information and communications technology supply chain" the decree is not immediate, a 45-day period is available to take effect. The U.S. government asserts that it is an application whose access to user data, including their location, browsing and search histories, could be shared with the Chinese Communist Party, potentially allowing China to track the locations of federal employees and contractors and create personal information records to blackmail and conduct corporate espionage , so it poses a threat to your country's national security, foreign policy and economy. "The United States must take aggressive action against the owners of TikTok to protect our national security." And in this case you not only look at the use of TikTok, a parallel order is also banning transactions with WeChat, a Chinese texting application that has a small user base in the United States. In both orders, the president appoints the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, as well as the National Emergency Act, which, they point to U.S. media, is a very unusual move and will likely be subject to a legal challenge. While there is a possibility that the executive branch will impose sanctions against individuals and corporations, placing them on a "blacklist," as already happened with Huawei and ZTE, the decrees are usually established by the Commerce Department instead of the White House and involves a specific procedure that was not followed in this case.  The order comes despite the possibility of Microsoft acquiring the TikTok operation in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In that regard, the company said the purchase should be completed by September 15. It should be said that the possible ban would come on 20 September, that is, just after the deadline set for negotiations of the agreement with Microsoft. So far there has been no talk that the app stores will stop hosting the TikTok. However, ByteDance is expected to request a suspension of the order in court, otherwise it will be forced to abruptly discontinue the platform's services when the deadline is met.  "It does not adhere to the law," TikTok said of the U.S. decree, adding that the executive order was issued "without any due process." TikTok suggests that it intends to challenge the order in U.S. courts. "We will seek all available resources to us to ensure that the rule of law is not discarded and that our company and our users are treated fairly, but by the Administration, then by the courts of the United States." He also cautioned that the order "runs the risk of undermining the confidence of global companies in America's commitment to the rule of law. And it sets a dangerous precedent for the concept of free speech and open markets."  He insisted that it had sought to engage constructively with the United States government regarding the issues raised and had offered solutions such as opening its algorithm and providing more transparency about its moderation policies. "We have made it clearthat TikTok has never shared user data with the Chinese government, nor has it censored content at its request," TikTok says. Finally the social network sent a message to its users, creators and partners: "We give priority to the security, protection and trust of our community always. In TikTok you have the right to express your opinions to your elected representatives, including the White House. You have the right to be heard."Load-Date: August 8, 2020End of Document

It's unclear how far negotiations with Twitter and Oracle went, but Microsoft did make a public announcement about his interest in buying TikTok and said he had spoken to President Trump about a possible deal.These apps collect significant amounts of user private data, and the information can be consulted and used by China. TikTok has a documented history of free speech censorship to conform to the propaganda of the Communist Party of China, and we take the data of Americans very seriously," said Kayleigh McEnany, the White House Press Secretary on August 13.The White House has expressed concern that data obtained by the Chinese government through the app could be used to produce detailed dossiers on certain individuals.The possibility that one of the world's largest giants in terms of technology and data management can acquire western operations from an app that has so much potential growth that even the U.S. government considers it a threat, is not fully ruled out. With information from CNET Load-Date: August 24, 2020End of Document

Microsoft is in advanced negotiations to purchase the app.Load-Date: August 18, 2020End of Document

TikTok to challenge Trump administration's efforts to ban appCNN.comAugust 22, 2020 Saturday 8:33 PM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHLength: 239 wordsByline: By Brian Fung, CNNBodyTikTok said Saturday it plans to go to court to challenge a Trump administration executive order that seeks to ban the short-form video app from operating in the United States unless its Chinese parent company finds an American buyer."To ensure that the rule of law prevails and that our company and users are treated fairly, we have no choice but to challenge the Executive Order through the judicial system, TikTok said in a statement to CNN, adding that the legal challenge could come as soon as this coming week.TikTok added that while it had tried to work with the US government on a solution to its national security concerns, what it encountered instead was "a lack of due process as the Administration paid no attention to facts and tried to insert itself into negotiations between private businesses."The White House did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. The Department of Justice declined comment.The Trump administration has argued that TikTok's ties to China could result in US users' data being transferred to the Chinese government. TikTok has rejected those claims, saying it would refuse to give American data to China even if it were asked.Cybersecurity experts say there is a theoretical risk of Americans' data falling into the wrong hands, but that there is no evidence to suggest it has occurred and that many US tech companies, which collect similar data, are just as much a target for spying.Load-Date: August 22, 2020End of Document

Walmart's Move in Joining Microsoft to Pursue TikTok's US Operations 'Likely Seals The Deal,' Wedbush SaysMT Newswires Live Briefs PROAugust 27, 2020 Thursday 2:04 PM ESTCopyright 2020 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 490 wordsBody Walmart's (WMT) move to team up with Microsoft (MSFT) "likely seals the deal" for the companies to buy the US operations of the popular China-based social media app TikTok, analysts at Wedbush Securities said Thursday. News of Walmart's involvement in the pursuit of TikTok -- which allows users to upload and share short mobile videos -- came Thursday from a CNBC report, with Walmart later confirming the report to the news outlet. Shares of Walmart jumped by 5.5% to trade near $138 each intraday. The stock has gained about 16% during the year."Walmart would be clearly interested in owning TikTok for its potential e-commerce and advertising capabilities to further boost its consumer presence as it further battles Amazon (which cannot touch TikTok given antitrust issues) in the field," Wedbush analysts led by Daniel Ives wrote in a Thursday afternoon note."In our opinion, this is the final piece of the puzzle that ultimately cements Microsoft successfully acquiring TikTok's US operations for likely $35 billion to $40 billion," said Wedbush. Microsoft (MSFT) shares picked up 3% to trade around $228. Its shares this year have bounced up by roughly 44%.Earlier this month, the Trump administration said the app posed a "national security threat" by capturing users' information which could potentially allow Chinese officials to collect information about federal employees and contractors and engage in blackmail and corporate espionage. TikTok has denied it is controlled by the Chinese government.But the app's broad reach in part prompted Microsoft to pursue TikTok's US business. Earlier Thursday, The Wrap news site reported that Oracle (ORCL) had taken the lead in the race to acquire TikTok in a $20 billion cash-and-stock offer.Wedbush said a number of data privacy and technology issues make talks to acquire TikTok complex while security concerns between China and the US would need to be satisfied before any entity reaches an agreement. But Microsoft "is the only US technology stalwart with the treasure chest, infrastructure, and distribution to get a deal like this done in our opinion," Wedbush said."We believe Microsoft buying TikTok would be like Christmas morning coming early for investors, especially at a valuation in the (approximate) $35 billion to $40 billion range," or lower, "which in a few years if navigated the right way could reach a valuation in the $200 billion area code," the analysts added.TikTok's parent company ByteDance is moving closer to reaching a deal to sell its operations based in the US, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, sources told CNBC. A deal announcement could be made in the coming days, the report said."We are confident that a Walmart and Microsoft partnership would meet both the expectations of US TikTok users while satisfying the concerns of US government regulators," said Walmart in a statement, according to CNBC.Price: 138.07, Change: +7.37, Percent Change: +5.64Load-Date: August 27, 2020End of Document

111, Inc. Announces Second Quarter 2020 Unaudited Financial ResultsPR NewswireAugust 20, 2020 Thursday 4:35 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3336 wordsDateline: SHANGHAI, Aug. 20, 2020 BodyPR Newswire 111, Inc. ("111" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: YI), a company dedicated to digitally connecting patients with drugs and healthcare services in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2020.Second Quarter 2020 HighlightsNet revenues were RMB1.62 billion (US$229.6 million), representing an increase of 93.5% year-over-year.   Operating expenses[1] were RMB177.5 million (US$25.1 million), representing an increase of 24.2% year-over-year. Operating expenses accounted for 10.9% of net revenue this quarter as compared to 17.0% in the same quarter of last year.  Number of pharmacies served increased to more than 280,000 as of June 30, 2020, compared to more than 190,000 pharmacies as of June 30, 2019.   Quarterly pharmacy order numbers reached 557,000, representing an increase of 188.6% year-over-year."Sustaining on the strong momentum from the previous quarter, the Company once again delivered strong financial results in the second quarter of 2020, and made tremendous progress on our path to sustainable profitability. Net revenue was RMB1.62 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 93.5%. Gross profit increased by 101.3%, and the non-GAAP net loss continued to narrow from 10.1% last year to 4.9% as a percentage of net revenue, another step closer to profitability," said Mr. Junling Liu, Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of 111."We delivered strong performances across all of our business segments, a testament to the success of our multifaceted growth strategy. In our B2B segment, revenue grew by 113.7% to RMB1.39 billion, while orders saw an increase of 188.6% over the same period last year. Our extensive virtual pharmacy network is the largest in the country, covering more than 50% of total drugstores in China. In the quarter, the network expanded to more than 280,000 retail pharmacies, an increase of 47% year-over-year," Mr. Liu said."In our B2C segment where the lifetime value of a customer is largely driven by recurring services such as online consultations and e-prescriptions, during this period, service revenue grew by 46% year-over-year to RMB6.2 million, while product revenue showed steady growth over the last two quarters. Our omni-channel drug commercialization services for global pharmaceutical companies have also seen encouraging early results. We are pleasantly surprised by the performance of Eli Lilly's diabetes drug Trulicity and Novartis' Cosentyx on our platform. Both drugs are blockbusters in their respective categories in the United States, and we are confident that we can help them achieve their potential in the Chinese market."He continued, "Driven by the strong demand from pharmaceutical product online retailers, revenue for our E-Channel segment grew by 112.8% year over year to RMB63.7 million, while the number of orders increased by 216% over the same period last year.""As we seek to accelerate growth, we're continually exploring new strategic opportunities that can leverage our existing infrastructure while deepening our core competency in digital healthcare. Towards that end, we're building the capability to extend our omni-channel healthcare ecosystem beyond today's focus on treatment of minor ailments to a support system for patients in their ongoing management of medical conditions. This allows us to have a more comprehensive view of each patient, which we believe will help them achieve better health outcomes, while opening up a vast new market for the Company.""As proof of our belief in and commitment to this opportunity, we recently launched in Shanghai the Lung Cancer Patient Care Program for holistic management of the disease. The program, spearheaded by the China Primary Health Care Foundation, offers diagnostic and treatment services and resources for lung cancer patients. Delivered via a full life-cycle doctor-patient interactive platform to be established and operated by 111, patients can access disease education materials, medication guides, online consultation, follow-up consultation and clinic visitation," he explained."As we further strengthen our digital healthcare infrastructure, we bring ever-greater value to our customers. Our cloud-based, AI-driven system enables our customers to better target and meet the needs of their end consumers, and doing so with greater efficiency and effectiveness. But the benefits of our digital capabilities accrue not only to our customers, but also to our own operations. Empowered by these industry-leading tools, our business development team is able to provide better service to prospects and customers alike, achieving higher conversion rates and customer loyalty.""To support our ongoing investments in these strategic growth opportunities, we have taken steps to strengthen our financial flexibility. On August 17, 2020, we completed the capital injection from new investors with an aggregate of RMB419.2 million (US$60.49 million) in our principal subsidiary Yao Fang Information Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. at a pre-money valuation of RMB8.33 billion (US$1.2 billion). In addition, we announced today our strategic plan to pursue a listing of this principal subsidiary on the Shanghai Stock Exchange's 'STAR Market' to access to China's capital markets.""While we are grateful that life is slowly returning to some form of normalcy, given the Chinese Government's effective control of the pandemic, risks remains given the fluidity of the situation and uncertainties around the global economy. Particularly in face of these unprecedented challenges, our results in the first half of 2020 once again demonstrated the power of our technology-enabled and integrated model, and the effectiveness of our disciplined execution. Looking forward to the rest of the year and beyond, we will continue to stay focused on executing against our four growth pillars to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. With our strengthened financial position from the capital injection, we have greater flexibility to seek out and capitalize on strategic market opportunities, further strengthening our digital capabilities, accelerating our business growth and expediting our next phase of expansion," Mr. Liu concluded.Share Repurchase ProgramOn August 14, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to US$10 million, as a vote of confidence in the Company's prospects.

ET on:A live and archived webcast of the conference call will be available on the Investor Relations section of 111's website athttp://ir.111.com.cn/.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn evaluating the business, the Company considers and uses non-GAAP loss from operations, non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders, and non-GAAP loss per ADS, non-GAAP measures, as supplemental measures to review and assess its operating performance. The Company defines non-GAAP loss from operations as loss from operations excluding share-based compensation expenses. The Company defines non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders as net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses and impairment loss of long-term investment. The Company defines non-GAAP loss per ADS as loss per ADS excluding share-based compensation expenses and impairment loss of long-term investment per ADS. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.The Company believes that non-GAAP loss from operations, non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders, and non-GAAP loss per ADS help identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain expenses that it includes in loss from operations and net loss. Share-based compensation expenses is a non-cash expense that varies from period to period. Impairment loss of long-term investment is a non-cash, non-recurring expense that occurred in the historical period. As a result, management excludes these two items from its internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that the adjustments for share-based compensation expenses and impairment loss of long-term investment provide investors with a reasonable basis to measure the company's core operating performance, in a more meaningful comparison with the performance of other companies. The Company believes that non-GAAP loss from operations, non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders, and non-GAAP loss per ADS provide useful information about its operating results, enhances the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the management in their financial and operational decision-making.The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP loss from operations, non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders, or non-GAAP loss per ADS is that it does not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company's operations. Further, the non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. The Company encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.Reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included at the end of this press release.Exchange Rate Information StatementThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader.

Economy.- Trump will ban TikTok on September 15 if it doesn't sell its U.S. operations soonerCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 3, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 262 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, 3 (EUROPA PRESS)U.S. President Donald Trump has assured that his government will ban the popular application of TikTok microvideos starting September 15 if it does not reach a sale agreement on its U.S. operations before that date.Speaking at the White House, collected by the U.S. media, the president has also positively valued Microsoft technology's interest in taking over the U.S. business of the Chinese app.In addition, Trump has assured that he expects the U.S. Treasury to receive a share for the purchase of TikTok, although he has not gone into detail about what this would be done."[TikTok] will close on September 15 unless Microsoft or another company is able to buy it and get a proper deal so that the U.S. Treasury makes a lot of money," Trump said, as recorded by 'The Boston Globe'.The company led by Satya Nadella on Sunday confirmed its interest in acquiring part of TikTok, which currently belongs to the firm China ByteDance. "Microsoft is ready to continue discussions to explore the purchase of TikTok in the United States," the company reported through a statement disseminated through its 'blog'.The president already announced Friday that he would ban TikTok using emergency economic powers or an executive order, although he did not provide further details on it.Critics of the app were wary of whether the data TikTok could collect from US users could end up in the hands of the Chinese government, even though the company has assured it stores its data outside China and would resist any attempt by Beijing to seize the information.Load-Date: August 4, 2020End of Document

Instagram launches 'Reels', a clone of TikTokCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 5, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 520 wordsBodyFacebook'sphoto-sharing app Instagram is launching its TikTok clone in more than 50 countries, a week after CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended the company's imitation strategies against U.S. lawmakers in an antitrust audience.The product, called Reels,allows people to edit 15-second video clips along with music, just like in TikTok. It will be integrated on Instagram in the United States and elsewhere, company reported on Wednesday in a blog post.  Reels is the second main feature of Instagram that follows an almost identical feature popularized by a competitor: Instagram Stories, the tool to post videos and photos that disappear after a certain time, was inspired by Snap.Reels is not Facebook's first attempt to challenge TikTok. Facebook's Lasso, a separate app with similar features that was tested in limited markets, was closed last month after it couldn't win over an audience. Reels might have better luck: it's launching just as TikTok's existence in the United States is being challenged by President Donald Trump.TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, faces a US ban, or a possible split and sale to a U.S. owner, possibly Microsoft. Trump and other officials say TikTok is a threat to national security because the Chinese government can access data from Americans. TikTok has repeatedly denied the allegations."The timing coincides in some respects," Said Vishal Shah, Instagram's product manager, in an interview with journalists. Facebook has already launched Reels in other countries, including India, after the TikTok government ban there. "We had the feeling that the product had a lot of potential and we learned very quickly that it was resonating with people," Shah added.Trump's pressure has led some TikTok creators to redirect their audiences to Instagram, hoping for a more stable future in case TikTok is banned. Facebook benefits from uncertainty even when regulators investigate the company for possible violations of antitrust law,particularly its practice of buying and copying competitors.According to documents published by the US Congress, Zuckerberg in 2012 became more interested in practice after noting that Chinese competitors moved rapidly to introduce new products with already proven uses.Reels videos will appear in Instagram's 'Explore' tab, where people can see the content of accounts they're not following yet.The benefit of having Reels on Instagram, Shah noted, is the existing network of more than one billion users. It's harder to get people to download a new app than to use one they already own, he added. Reels will also give instagramers a new opportunity to become famous, beyond what they already have."Historically, we haven't been very good at helping new creators find an audience," Shah said.ByteDance has stated that the copy of Facebook, as well as its claims that Chinese-owned apps may not be committed to data security or freedom of expression, are equivalent to "plagiarism and defamation".But ByteDance also didn't invent the edited short video format. Vine, a Twitter property launched in 2013, popularized it and was closed before the rise of TikTok.Load-Date: August 6, 2020End of Document

US to tighten restrictions on Huawei on access to technology, chipsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 17, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 412 wordsBodyBy David ShepardsonWASHINGTON, 17 Aug (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's administration announced Monday that it will tighten restrictions on Huawei Technologies Co with the goal of ending their access to market-available processors.Commerce's measures, initially reported by Reuters, will expand the restrictions announced in May to prevent the Chinese telecommunications giant from obtaining semiconductors without a special license - including processors developed by foreign companies that have been developed or produced with U.S. software or technology.The government will also add 38 Huawei subsidiaries in 21 countries to the U.S. economic blacklist, sources said, bringing total subsidiaries to 152 since Huawei was included in May 2019.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business that restrictions imposed on Huawei in May "led them to take some evasive measures. They turned to third parties," Ross said. "The new rule clarifies that any use of U.S. software or U.S. manufacturing equipment is prohibited and requires a license."Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the rule change "will prevent Huawei from circumventing U.S. law through the production of alternative chips and the supply of existing processors." He added in a statement that "Huawei has continually tried to evade" the restrictions imposed by the United States in May.Huawei did not comment immediately.Relations between Washington and Beijing are at its worst in decades, and the United States is pressuring other governments around the world to exclude Huawei from its networks, arguing that the company will hand over data to the Chinese government for espionage. Huawei denies that it is spying for China.The new measures, which come into force immediately, should avoid Huawei's attempts to circumvent U.S. export controls, Commerce said."It clarifies that we are covering existing designs that Huawei might be looking to buy from other designers," a Commerce Department official told Reuters.A new rule requires economic blacklisted companies to obtain a license when a firm such as Huawei acts "as a buyer, interim consignee, end consignee, or end user."The department also confirmed that it will not issue a temporary general license that expired on Friday for users of Huawei devices and telecommunications providers.

What is Triller, the rival TikTok app worn by Donald TrumpCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 18, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 617 wordsBodyDonald Trump opened an official account of his campaign in Triller, one of the alternative apps to TikTok. In a 15-second video in which Trump appears claiming to be a "technology professional," Triller has managed to get 1.2 million views and surpass 6,000 followers in a few hours. Triller is not a new app, as it was created in 2015 and has a long history, but the landing of the President of the United States in it has made many discover it only now. This application, available for Android and iOS mobiles, is a social network of music videos with a very similar performance to that of TikTok, but has its base in Los Angeles, United States. Donald trump at triller (Infobae)The application allows you to create "professional-looking videos", as Triller in the App Store ensures, and uses artificial intelligence to edit the contents recorded by users automatically.Also, as with TikTok, Triller allows its users to also add filters to modify the appearance of the videos and it is possible to insert songs to convert the short videos into musical ones.Its basic features are complemented by the possibility to customize the clips with text, drawings and emojis, as well as collaborate with friends on group videos and share videos on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, SMS, email or save them to the camera roll.In recent weeks, Triller has reported an increase in users. The US company, as mentioned in a statement, was number one on the App Store, Apple's official mobile software platform, in 50 countries around the world, including the United States, Australia, France, the United Kingdom and Italy.In addition, according to the app, the platform already has celebrities and show world personalities such as Selena Gomez, Rita Ora, Justin Bieber and Kevin Hart.Triller's growthAs mentioned, Triller had a growth in popularity in the latter time that just at a time when Tik Tok is in the crosshairs of the U.S. government that has accused the social network of implying a risk to citizens' safety.In fact, President Donald Trump last Friday signed a decree requiring Chinese group ByteDance to sell the activities in the United States from TikTok, its international social network, within 90 days, thus materializing repeated threats.Trille showed a growth in users in the latter in which Tik Tok was accused by the US Government of being a security risk of that country (REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration) (DADO RUVIC/)The US official has for months accused the popular video-sharing platform of diverting data from US users to deliver to the Chinese government."There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that ByteDance (...) it could take measures that threaten to damage America's national security," the presidential decree explains.Against a backdrop of strong trade and political tensions with China, the US president already took radical action a week ago against TikTok and WeChat. He banned transactions with U.S. partners from 45 days of the announcement.The decree signed on Friday specifies that the buyer must be A.D. and "demonstrate his will and ability to comply with this decree."TheUS computer giant Microsoft is in negotiations with ByteDance to buy TikTok, at least in the United States. And it doesn't seem to be the only company interested in acquiring this social network: it's rumored that Twitter and Oracle also want to compete in this bid to see who gets the popular platform.MORE ON THIS TOPIC: The United States sanctioned 38 Huawei subsidiaries in Latin America and the rest of the world"My Prof Fidelito": the teacher who went viral for his tricks to learn MathematicsSo you can download Fortnite on your Android phone even if it's no longer in the Play StoreLoad-Date: August 19, 2020End of Document

Trump says he plans to ban TikTok in the U.S.Politico.comAugust 1, 2020 Saturday 2:49 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 442 wordsHighlight: The move comes amid heightening worries that China could get access to U.S. user data.BodyPresident Donald Trump said Friday that he plans to bar the Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok from operating in the United States, a move that comes as officials across Washington accuse the company of posing a national security risk."As far as TikTok is concerned we're banning them from the United States," Trump told reporters traveling with him from Tampa aboard Air Force One. He said he could take action against the company as soon as Saturday.TikTok, owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, has come under fire from lawmakers and government officials on both sides of the aisle over fears that it could turn over American users' information to the Chinese government. TikTok says it has not provided consumers' personal information to Beijing and would not do so. The president said he could use emergency economic powers or an executive order to ban TikTok in the United States."Well, I have that authority. I can do it with an executive order or that," Trump said, referring to emergency economic powers. Trump made clear he was not in favor of a deal to let a U.S. company buy TikTok's American operations, following reports that Microsoft is in talks to do just that.An administration official said earlier Friday that the administration would force ByteDance to divest ownership of TikTok through a ruling by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed earlier this week that TikTok has been under review by the inter-agency body, which evaluates whether foreign investments pose security risks. ByteDance acquired TikTok's precursor, Musical.ly, in 2017. Mnuchin said Wednesday that he expected CFIUS to make a recommendation for action on TikTok this week.After reports of a planned administration action against the company surfaced earlier Friday, TikTok spokesperson Jamie Favazza said in a statement, "While we do not comment on rumors or speculation, we are confident in the long-term success of TikTok. Hundreds of millions of people come to TikTok for entertainment and connection, including our community of creators and artists who are building livelihoods from the platform."Fox Business and other news outlets reported that tech giant Microsoft is in talks to acquire TikTok, a move that would give the trillion dollar company a fresh footprint in the social media market. Microsoft declined comment on the reports. The Trump administration plan to order ByteDance to sell off TikTok was previously reported by Bloomberg.Cristiano Lima contributed to this report.Load-Date: August 2, 2020End of Document

SoftBank lands on U.S. secure 5G telco list  FierceWirelessAugust 20, 2020Copyright 2020 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights ReservedSection: ARTICLELength: 535 wordsByline: Bevin FletcherHighlight: Japan's SoftBank Corp. has joined a list of global telecoms that the U.S. considers secure under the State Department's “Clean Network” initiative, with the operator having excluded China's Huawei as a 5G supplier last year. BodyJapan's SoftBank Corp. has joined a list of global telecoms that the U.S. considers secure under the State Department's “Clean Network” initiative, with the operator having excluded China's Huawei as a 5G supplier last year.SoftBank in a statement said it was “pleased to be recognized as a 5G Clean Telecommunications company” by the U.S.In June, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement naming service providers deemed as “Clean Telcos” because they don't use 5G network gear from Huawei. The U.S. flagged Huawei, a leading network equipment and handset supplier, as posing national security risks. The U.S. says Huawei is a tool of the Chinese government that could be used for state-backed activities like surveillance. Huawei has repeatedly denied claims. In Thursday's statement, SoftBank said it “believes telecommunication networks are an important part of social infrastructure, and that they will play a crucial role in transforming people's lives and industry in the 5G era. Accordingly, SoftBank Corp. is committed to providing services that are both convenient and secure to all of its customers.”RELATED: U.S. clamps down on Huawei's efforts to ‘circumvent' export rulesSoftBank stated that it “fully supports the Clean Network initiative” in the U.S. and will work to build out 5G networks “that use secure equipment from trusted network vendors.”In August, the U.S. expanded its network initiative targeting Chinese firms to also include mobile app stores and apps, cloud-based systems, carriers, and cable. In a press statement Secretary Pompeo said the approach is aimed at protecting privacy and companies' sensitive information “from aggressive intrusions by malign actors, such as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP),” with efforts to “protect America's critical telecommunications and technology infrastructure.”SoftBank's addition to the telco list comes after the company already in May 2019 shunned Huawei for its 5G build, opting instead for Ericsson and Nokia. Huawei had been a 4G vendor for SoftBank and participated in 5G trials.Other Japanese operators not using Huawei include NTT, KDDI, and Rakuten. For more than a year the U.S. has campaigned globally for countries and network operators to ban vendors it says pose security risks, namely Huawei. It's also imposed trade restrictions, which were tightened this week to further clamp down on Huawei's access to U.S. technology.RELATED: U.K. bans Huawei for 5G; will Germany be next?Japan is one of more than 30countries and territories that the U.S. said committed to only use trusted vendors for 5G. The U.K. is also on that list, having changed course over the summer with a decision to ban Huawei after initially authorizing a limited role in operators' 5G radio access network (RAN). Recent reports pegged India as the next country expected to take action to keep Huawei and ZTE gear out of the country's 5G networks. India's Jio is already named by the State Department as a telecom that's rejected Huawei. Canada's three major operators have picked Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung for 5G. Huawei also has been passed over by Orange in France, Telstra in Australia, and SK Telecom and KT in South Korea, among others. Load-Date: August 21, 2020End of Document

AMP.- US.- Trump announces that he will ban the use of TikTok in the US and claims he "has authority" to do soCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 1, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 346 wordsBodyMADRID, 1 (EUROPA PRESS)U.S. President Donald Trump announced Friday that he will ban the use of the TikTok app in the US, while en ampassured that he "has authority" to do so."As far as TikTok is concerned, we're going to ban it in the United States," Trump told the press aboard Air Force One. Thus, he has specified that to prohibit it he would use emergency economic powers or an executive order, although he has not provided further details in this regard, according to the CNN television network.Hours earlier, it referred to the matter and confirmed that its Administration was considering banning the use of the mobile phone application, following the opening of an investigation to the 'app' for national security reasons."We're analyzing TikTok. We could ban TikTok, we could do other things. There are a couple of options, but a lot of things are happening," said the representative.The investigation against TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, has been conducted by the U.S. Foreign Investment Committee. U.S. authorities were concerned about whether the 'app' poses a risk to national security.Specifically, critics of the application were wary of whether the data TikTok could collect from US users could end up in the hands of the Chinese government, even though the company has assured it stores its data outside China and would resist any attempt by Beijing to appropriate the information.For their part, cybersecurity experts have pointed out that the potential national security risk posed by the application is, above all, theoretical and that there is no evidence to suggest that TikTok user data may be compromised by China Intelligence.Beijing on Thursday accused Washington of "threatening Chinese companies without evidence" and thereby violating "the principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO)"."Without evidence, the United States threatens a Chinese company in the wake of a presumption of guilt, revealing its hypocrisy in the so-called 'respect for justice and freedoms'," criticized Wang Wenbin, foreign Ministry spokesman for the Asian giant.Load-Date: August 2, 2020End of Document

'Lax' Internet Freedom Group Balks at New Pack OversightThe Breeze: James Madison UniversityAugust 27, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 2419 wordsByline: Susan Crabtree | RealClearWireBodyIn early August, two government officials showed up at the taxpayer-funded Washington, D.C., offices of a nonprofit billing itself as devoted to enabling dissidents in China, Iran and other repressive countries to gain Internet access and escape censorship and surveillance.What the officials of the U.S. Agency for Global Media -- the umbrella organization for Voice of America and several other foreign-language news outlets -- found set off serious alarm bells about what they describe as the organization's carelessly lax security. It was as if the nonprofit, the Open Technology Fund, or OTF, was still moving into the offices and had yet to put any security protocols in place. Laptops and hard drives were left unsecured in boxes throughout the room. An internal door connecting the OTF office space to offices rented by other firms and entities was not only unlocked but left wide open.The USAGM officials recognized that COVID-19 telework-at-home policies were obviously in place for OTF employees at the time of the office visit and likely prevented the nonprofit from getting settled in and up and running. But they still believed there was no justification for what appeared to be a reckless disregard for basic security measures.Iran, China, Russia, and other U.S. adversaries are constantly looking for ways to hack into U.S. agencies, and often target firms receiving government contracts as a means to do so. At the time of the OTF office visit, there were also more basic domestic security concerns to consider. Most downtown D.C. buildings and businesses were still on edge over the violent racial justice protests and looting that rocked the city during the early summer, their front doors and windows boarded up.Hearing about the haphazard state of the workspace, a senior government official was dumbfounded. "So OTF is saying they are so concerned about the security of dissidents abroad, but they leave their workspace door literally wide open to Iran, China and Russia?" the official lamented to RealClearPolitics.What was even more curious to the officials: The OTF appeared to be trying to obscure its location from the USAGM to avoid any oversight. The D.C. address wasn't listed on the OTF website until USAGM started asking questions about its location, an agency official said. An L Street NW address suddenly popped up on the site once the inspection took place.The two officials who visited the nonprofit's office were part of the management team of Michael Pack, the Trump-appointed new CEO of the agency. The USAGM for years has been criticized from the right and the left as adrift in its mission "to inform, engage and connect people around the world in support of freedom and democracy." Instead, the news that the agency broadcasted and posted to its website appeared no different from that produced by mainstream U.S. news outlets.For at least the last decade, the USAGM has had another mission as part of its purview: trying to break through the Internet blockades against U.S. and other Western news erected by some of our greatest adversaries, including China, Iran and other repressive regimes around the world. It has received more than $100 million to fund tools to circumvent those governments' online Iron Curtains. But critics say it has little to show for it - especially in denting China's great Internet firewall. In fact, USAGM's internal figures, viewed by RealClearPolitics, show that only 1.7% of people inside China have access to the agency's programming.In trying to overhaul the agency he now leads, Pack has gone to war with its entrenched bureaucracy -and the OTF is at the center of the turmoil, as well part of a fierce legal battle.Pack, a documentary filmmaker and former senior official at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, hired now-indicted Steve Bannon several years ago as a consultant on two of his films. From the time President Trump nominated Pack to the USAGM post, his detractors have latched onto the narrative that Pack is going to turn the broadcasting agency into a megaphone for the administration, an assertion he vehemently denies. Instead, he says he simply wants to return the agency to its original mission.Pack has repeatedly underscored his commitment to fighting Chinese and Iranian disinformation, especially amid the coronavirus saga, and alarming reports over the last several years that China had jailed millions of members of its minority Uyghur population. The predominantly Turkic-speaking Sunni Muslims were recently subjected to higher COVID contagion as the Beijing regime required them to work in labor camps, according to those reports. Last week, Pack announced funding awards to two Internet firewall circumvention projects, at least one of which targets Iran and has seen its funding cut nearly in half under the previous USAGM leadership.Considering the years of bipartisan concern about the way the USAGM was carrying out its mission, including from Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state, Pack wanted to bring his own people into leadership positions at the agency and at OTF. For the last two months, the nonprofit organization has launched a barrage of lawsuits to fight him.An act of Congress gave Pack the power to fire the existing agency leadership and all board of directors members and install his own team. When Pack tried to do so at OTF as well, the nonprofit said he didn't have the authority, filed suit and sought a temporary injunction. An Obama-appointed judge initially denied the injunction request, but a federal appeals court two weeks ago temporarily blocked those firings. A final ruling has yet to be made. Neither the OTF nor its lawyers returned RCP's emailed requests for comment.The OTF is reportedly set to file another suit this week, demanding the USAGM pay the remaining $9.1 million of its $20 million annual budget in quarterly installments, instead of monthly. The OTF has complained that failing to provide funding to OTF on a quarterly basis has caused it to halt 49 of its 60 Internet freedom projects, although it has not specified which ones.OTF says legal agreements between it and USAGM require that the money be given to them quarterly, instead of monthly. The agency contends that monthly disbursement are reasonable and that's what it's committing to providing and has done so far.Pack and other senior USAGM officials say the threatened suit contains outright lies about the demands the agency's lawyer, Mora Namdar, made for personnel, salary and contracting information from the OTF, and the way Namdar carried out those demands. Agency officials argue they have the right to the information because of legal requirements in the grant agreement the USAGM has that governs its funding of OTF.In a statement issued Friday, Pack denounced the OTF's attacks on his staff."The campaign being waged by individuals who seem more concerned about covering up corruption and past failures than working on behalf of the American people should outrage every American," he said."In particular, the personal and false attacks launched against [Namdar] and other members of my staff working to advance freedom and human rights are totally without merit," he addedBefore Pack started doling out multi-millions to OTF on a quarterly basis, he wanted some basic details about its operations. He wanted an accounting of how the money Congress was providing to the nonprofit was being spent. He wanted to know other basic data, such as how many employees work at OTF on a full-time, part-time, contractor and fellowship basis and how much they are paid. He wanted details about employees' and fellows' backgrounds, the projects they are working on and what access they have to certain USAGM systems.As soon as they arrived at the agency, Pack's team was inundated with complaints about how OTF was spending its $20 million annual taxpayer budget. They heard that the group, along with other international organizations, hosts annual overseas summits in resort locales such as Valencia, Spain, and pays for dozens of participants around the world to fly in and attend, including key "technologists, journalists, digital rights defenders, community activists, lawyers and policy advocates," according to a description of its 2017 summit on its website.The OTF's top leaders also earn tens of thousands more than their counterparts at USAGM. A handful of managers receive taxpayer-funded salaries of at least $190,000, while most of the other employees are in the lower six-figure range, a senior government official tells RCP.Concerns by Pack's team that the OTF office was left unsecured were compounded by another deeply troubling problem Pack found at the agency when he got there. An internal government report issued by the Office of Personnel Management had uncovered a decade of gross lapses in common personnel vetting practices that raise serious security concerns at USAGM. The State Department and related agencies, including USAGM, are constant targets for foreign spying, one of the reasons OPM is so concerned about a failure to properly vet staff.But even more distressing to Pack and his team are charges from USAGM and State Department employees that OTF spends roughly 25% of its budget on actual technology tools while devoting the other 75% to the lavish conferences, salaries, benefits, and pet civil society projects duplicative of ones that State and the U.S. Agency for International Development are already carrying out.There are also corruption questions about the OTF's leadership, including former CEO Libby Liu, who was cited in 2015 by the State Department inspector general for failing to follow federal contracting rules designed to prevent nepotism and conflicts.Since 2012, OTF existed within the USAGM's Radio Free Asia, or RFA, a sister agency to the Voice of America designed to broadcast news for Asian viewers abroad in multiple languages, including Mandarin, Cantonese, Uyghur and several others.Liu, who was the RFA's president for more than a decade, created the OTF within the RFA, sources at the agency say, by pushing previous USAGM leaders to defund another effective entity, called the Office of Internet Freedom , in order to give her control of the work and contracting decisions.Liu resigned in protest in mid-June, just days before Pack was set to be installed as USAGM's new CEO. When she was still at the agency last fall, Liu turned OTF into an independent nonprofit with plans to expand its work into the private sector -- even though it's fully funded by taxpayer dollars.The move confounded some in the agency who viewed it as a way to wall off money from government oversight and accountability or even prevent it from being redirected if and when Pack was installed as the new USAGM chief. Even before Pack arrived, some USAGM employees who questioned the legality of OTF's spinoff filed complaints with the State Department inspector general's office, which is now looking into the matter.Over the last several weeks, Pack has tried to refund the Office for Internet Freedom by asking other USAGM offices to return unused and unobligated funds that have been sitting around for years - funds his team says Congress slated for digital freedom projects. The move angered Laura Cunningham, the acting OTF director, because OTF would then be competing with the official USAGM Office for Internet Freedom for funding. Since Pack's arrival in mid-June, OTF has launched a social media campaign to save itself. In recent weeks, the group has argued that dissidents in 60 countries who rely on tools developed by the fund, such as Signal and Tor, are already being hurt because it's not receiving quarterly payments from USAGM and had to fight for the payments they have received since Pack arrived.An agency official said the narrative is turned around."All we're doing is going back to the way things were funded before," the official said. "They are now accusing us of doing exactly what they did to OIF."Pack and his staff say that, after arriving in early June, they have been flooded with letters from current and former USAGM employees, some of whom work for the Uyghur broadcasting arm, thanking him for trying to ensure the funds are being used for the most effective internet freedom tools."Thank you so much for reviving the Office of Internet Freedom," said an Aug. 18 letter to Pack from a USAGM employee, one of several letters RealClearPolitics has reviewed. "I am really grateful to you and happy to work ... to get it restarted.""For years that I have worked for OIF, Open Technology Fund took the funds from us and used it on their activists and never contributed much to the USAGM."Effective deputies who would question contracting and other decisions by Liu were sidelined and the OIF "went downhill," the employee said."Language services such as Mandarin, Persian and many others depend on these tools to reach their audience," the staffer concluded. Even members of OTF's team of supporters complained about the group's less-than-vigilant approach to securing its communications. A member of the save-the-OTF social media campaign team reached out to RCP in late June to complain that the group was hosting its conference calls on Zoom despite widespread international criticism over the video conferencing company's willingness to follow China's orders  and concern that the Beijing government could use the platform to spy on its own citizens or on overseas conferences the company hosted."I strongly believe in OTF's values and its approach to open source technology, but I was shocked to find that in this instance the community is not practicing what it preaches," the source told RCP. "Despite being alerted to the risks of the choice of conference call [platform], this call still went ahead using Zoom - closed-source technology that has recently been revealed to be bending to orders from the Chinese Communist government."This article originally ran on realclearpolitics.com.• Facebook• Twitter• WhatsApp• SMS• Email• Print• SaveTags• Libby Liu• Open Technology Fund• Michael Pack• Usagm• Otf• Politics• Work• Law• Economics• Institutes• Ministries• Usagm Office• Government• Firm• State Department• Employee• AgencyTownNews.com Content ExchangeSuccess!

TikTok Has Taken Down More Than 380,000 Videos For Hate Speech Policy Violations In The US This YearThe Daily CallerAugust 24, 2020 Monday 05:14 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; techLength: 362 wordsByline: Kaylee Greenlee, Reporter, kaylee@dailycallernewsfoundation.orgBodyLink to ImageChinese owned video-sharing social media app TikTok took down more than 380,000 videos this year for allegedly violating the company's hate speech policies, according to a statement the company released on Thursday.The app reportedly banned around 1,300 accounts for allegedly posting content against the community guidelines TikTok Head of Safety Eric Han said in a statement. The removed content reportedly included race-based harassment.TikTok defines hate speech as “content that intends to or does attack, threaten, incite violence against, or dehumanize an individual or group of individuals on the basis of protected attributes like race, religion, gender, gender identity, national origin, and more,” according to the company's community guidelines. TikTok says they removed 38K videos & 1.3K accounts for hate speech violations. While notable, our experts highlighted tricks extremists use to evade detection. Without more transparency from TikTok, it's impossible to gauge the impact of these efforts. https://t.co/UDIDKT0BCs - Jonathan Greenblatt (@JGreenblattADL) August 20, 2020The company's statement reiterated its content policy and emphasized its “zero-tolerance” policy for organized hate groups or content that denies “violent tragedies” after videos directed at slavery and the Holocaust went viral, the statement said.TikTok started a content advisory council in March after criticism over content moderation, the New York Post reported. (RELATED: TikTok To Sue Trump Administration For Banning App)Officials worry that sensitive user information could be accessed by the Chinese government through the social media application, the Post reported. ByteDance was given 90 days to dismantle TikTok's U.S. operations by President Donald Trump.The social media company is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, though it reportedly said it has not given user data to China, the Post reported.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Trump criticized after claiming for Treasury portion of a TikTok purchaseCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 5, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 576 wordsBodyPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday defended his claim for the Treasury to ambush part of a purchase by Microsoft or another U.S. company from the popular Chinese social network TikTok.This stance was however harshly criticized for unconstitutional and for resembling extortion."We have all the letters, because without us, you can't get into America," Trump said at a press conference at the White House."If you are an owner, and you have a tenant, the tenant's business needs a rent, you need a lease," he exemplified.Trump argued that much of any TikTok purchase price should go to the Treasury and that Microsoft "agreed with me."Firm executive Satya Nadella spoke to Trump Sunday to convince him to approve negotiations with ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, to buy the already well-advanced U.S. subsidiary.The computer giant issued a statement explaining that the acquisition would be subject to "a comprehensive security assessment and should bring economic benefits to the United States, including the U.S. Treasury."- "Mafia Tactics" -The representative had said Monday to be willing to approve Microsoft or another U.S. company purchasing TikTok's assets in the United States, after threatening to prohibit application for national security reasons, in exchange for a "substantial portion" of any transaction being poured into the Treasury.Trump lacks powers to make that demand, his critics said, who added that this idea is harmful to business and international relations."It's a kind of Mafia tactic that you could see in Russia," said James Lewis, one of the directors of the Center for Strategic and International Studies."It's not good practice and I don't think it's constitutional." Added.Bobby Chesney, a law professor at the University of Texas, said Trump's idea "is grossly inappropriate and unseemly, not to mention that he has no legal basis."Former federal prosecutor Michael Bromwich, for his part, noted on Twitter that Trump's approach sounded like an association for criminality, alluding to the Anti-Mafia and Organized Crime Act (RICO)."Every day that passes, this increasingly becomes a RICO initiative," Bromwich wrote in response to Trump's comments.- "Manipulation" and "intimidation" -China reacted by accusing the United States of "political manipulation.""It's absolute intimidation," Wang Wenbin, spokesman for Beijing's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, criticized at a press conference.Journalists from The Wall Street Journal Spencer Jakab and Dan Gallagher said in an opinion piece that Microsoft should reject any such idea."If the proposal is serious and considered legal, it would set a dangerous precedent for taking foreign business through arbitrary regulations and opens the door for U.S. companies to be treated the same," they wrote."If the price includes some unusual payment to the U.S. Treasury, U.S. companies have more to lose than to win if they participate," they said.With billions of users worldwide, the TikTok social network has become the latest fight between China and the United States, the world's largest powers.Used by 1 billion people worldwide, mainly teenagers, the short video social network TikTok is the last front trump opened up in his political and trade war against Beijing.For Washington, TikTok collects personal data from users, which Beijing uses for espionage andother ends.TikTok denies that it gives the Chinese government access to its users' data.rl/bfm/gm/ll/yow/rsrLoad-Date: August 6, 2020End of Document

The Chinese government on Friday changed the rules for such a sale to receive superior approval, with restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence-based technologies, Bloomberg and the FT reported.The Chinese Ministry of Commerce has changed the list of subject technologies and export controls. An update to the list that hasn't happened since 2008, the FT says, adding restrictions to "custom recommendation services based on data analysis." Inclusion in this list means that companies must receive government authorization to export certain technologies.Tik Tok, ByteDance's video service, is built on algorithms that analyze users' behaviors to recommend videos. Citing sources close to Tik Tok's sale operation, the FT said beijing's decision could derail the preliminary deal for the sale of Tik Tok, which was touted this week. Any deal will now take longer and is subject to a major question mark, as it will depend on Beijing's decision.Donald Trump has ordered the sale of Tik Tok's U.S. operations to ByteDance for national security reasons. Microsoft is vying with Oracle for the purchase, and it was reported that Centricus and Triller on Friday made an offer to operate the video platform in several countries for $20 billion.Load-Date: August 31, 2020End of Document

He banned transactions with U.S. partners from 45 days of the announcement.The decree signed on Friday specifies that the buyer must be A.D. and "demonstrate his will and ability to comply with this decree."US computer giant Microsoft is in negotiations with ByteDance to buy TikTok, at least in the United States, or even more broadly.ByteDance must also confirm that it has destroyed all data "from US users, obtained or derived from TikTok and Musical.ly", a US application that had been purchased by the Chinese company and merged with TikTok.juj/leo/gfe/llLoad-Date: August 16, 2020End of Document

Trump's Proposed TikTok Ban Would Be a 'Danger to Free Expression' and 'Technologically Impractical,' ACLU SaysNewsweek.comAugust 1, 2020 Saturday 5:17 AM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 473 wordsByline: Brendan ColeHighlight: President Donald Trump said he will take action to ban the Chinese-owned video app over what he says are security and censorship concerns.BodyPresident Donald Trump's threat to ban the video app TikTok from the U.S. has been criticized as a move which would curb freedom of speech."As far as TikTok is concerned, we're banning them from the United States," Trump said on Fridayon board Air Force One, adding that he had the authority to do so, "with an executive order."TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese firm ByteDance, and has up to 100 million users in the U.S. and hundreds of millions worldwide, has faced scrutiny over security concerns. It has denied that it is controlled by or shares data with the Chinese government.Trump's threat comes after the platform was used to inflate expectations for turnout expected at Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which was embarrassing for the president's campaign, USA Today reported.The American Civil Liberties Union was among those who raised concerns about a ban of TikTok on freedom of speech.In a statement, the ACLU tweeted: "Banning an app like TikTok, which millions of Americans use to communicate with each other, is a danger to free expression and technologically impractical."Trump's threat has also seen as a move, which could alienate a significant proportion of the electorate ahead of the election.The author Kurt Eichenwald tweeted to his nearly half a million followers: "50% of @tiktok_us users are 18-34. That's 35 million voting age folk Trump just p***d off."#PresidentSnowflake banning TT cause he's mad about Tik Tok teens & Tulsa. If it was "national security" he wouldn't stop Microsoft from buying it," he added, referring to the move by the company to buy the app from ByteDance.However, if ByteDance did sell to Microsoft, it might have to shed TikTok's U.S. operations, the BBC reported. Trump is not favor of such a deal, saying according to Reuters "we are not an M&A [mergers and acquisitions] country."Meanwhile, in a statement in which it highlighted that it had hired 1,000 people and that it "supported U.S. creators who are building livelihoods from our platform," TikTok said that its U.S. user data is stored in the U.S, "with strict controls on employee access.""TikTok's biggest investors come from the U.S. We are committed to protecting our users' privacy and safety," it added.Earlier this week, TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer had said in a blog post his company would be transparent and that "we are not political.""Our only objective is to remain a vibrant, dynamic platform for everyone to enjoy," he said, adding, "TikTok has become the latest target, but we are not the enemy."The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is looking at the company's operations in the U.S. and the spat with the app comes amid tensions between the Trump administration and Beijing over trade and China's handling of the coronavirus. Newsweek has contacted the White House for comment.Link to ImageGraphic Tik Tok userNARINDER NANU/Getty Imagesa  mobile users browses through the Chinese owned video-sharing 'Tik Tok' app on June 30, 2020.

Portaltic.-TikTok values us veto as "a dangerous precedent for freedom of expression"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 418 wordsBodyMADRID, 7 (Portaltic/EP)The music video social network TikTok has responded to the executive order signed by US President Donald Trump, which prohibits "any" transaction with the company, and has called it "a dangerous precedent for freedom of expression and open markets."TikTok has criticized the united States' action, which would prevent it from continuing to function in this country in 45 days, based on "unquoted reports" and "unjustified fears" to disinformation campaigns, as the platform owned by China's Bytedance is collected in a statement.The social network argues that despite attempting to propose "a constructive solution" to U.S. concerns, the Trump Administration has "failed to pay attention to the facts" and has acted "without following the usual legal processes."Trump has already warned earlier this week that his government will ban TikTok from September 15 if it doesn't reach a sale deal on its U.S. operations before that date.Microsoft on Sunday confirmed its interest in acquiring part of TikTok, something the president appreciated positively. The president already announced Friday that he would ban TikTok using emergency economic powers or an executive order, although he did not provide further details on it.For its part, TikTok, with 100 million users in the United States, has announced that it will "pursue all available remedies" so that there is a "fair deal" for the company and its users, and does not rule out resorting to U.S. courts.UNQUOTED REPORTSThe executive order signed by Trump argues his decision to veto TikTok in reports that the collection of data carried out by the application would allow actions such as "tracking the locations of federal employees and contractors, building personal information records for blackmail, and conducting corporate espionage."The social network has denounced the focus on what the Chinese company considers to be "unquoted reports" and "fears or justified" to disinformation campaigns.TikTok has also valued the data collection that its application carries out as "typical in the industry" of mobile apps worldwide."We want to make it clear that TikTok has never shared user data with the Chinese government, nor has it censored content at their request," they have secured music video on the social network.In this regard, last March TikTok announced the creation of a 'Transparency Center' at its headquarters in the US city of Los Angeles, to allow "external experts" to examine and verify the work of his team members.Load-Date: August 8, 2020End of Document

Microsoft Is Now Interested in All of TikTok's Global Operations: ReportTheStreet.comAugust 6, 2020 Thursday 12:35 PM EDTCopyright 2020 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 363 wordsByline: Tony OwusuHighlight: Microsoft was originally only interested in certain portions of TikTok's operations, but a new report suggests that it has widened the breadth of its interest in the company.BodyMicrosoft's  bid for ByteDance-owned social media platform TikTok has expanded, with the Financial Times saying it wants to take over the company's entire global business outside of China, including its India and European operations.Microsoft had previously only indicated it was interested in TikTok's U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand operations, but the Financial Times reports that Microsoft is now interested in more of the Chinese company's assets, potentially due to the logistical challenge of owning and running only a portion of a global platform.President Trump said on Monday that "it was probably easier to buy the whole thing than to buy 30% of it." He also said that the eventual purchaser of TikTok would have to pay a "substantial" fee to the U.S. Treasury, although it was unclear how that would work. TikTok does not operate in China and instead has a sister app called Douyin that would not be part of any deal, the FT reported.The two sides  after Microsoft announced that it was pursuing the company following a conversation between Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and President Donald Trump.Trump threatened to ban the popular video app in the U.S. amid growing tensions between the U.S. and China and privacy concerns surrounding the app. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates gave an interview to Bloomberg this week saying that Microsoft is "very careful about its data promises. We won't do things that are hostile, or viewed as hostile."In a statement Sunday, the company said that "among other measures, Microsoft would ensure that all private data of TikTok's American users is transferred to and remains in the United States. To the extent that any such data is currently stored or backed-up outside the United States, Microsoft would ensure that this data is deleted from servers outside the country after it is transferred." Microsoft executives have reportedly sought to pacify the Chinese government amid growing tensions between the Trump administration and Beijing. Microsoft shares were basically flat at $213 per share in afternoon trading Thursday. Microsoft is a holding in Jim Cramer's .

WeChat: The jewel of the Chinese crown, threatenedCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 22, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1269 wordsBodyIt's a common trope in sci-fi movies. The protagonist travels back in time and, after minimal intervention in the past, the place to which he returns is unrecognizable. Something similar happened on the Chinese network when his government altered the evolutionary line, isolating leading US companies – Google, Facebook, Twitter. The result is an ecosystem with its own unique characteristics. Perhaps the most representative is the existence of Wechat, a platform platform ubiquitous in the country; the main digital bridge between China and the rest of the world. Now, U.S. sanctions are threatening to blow it up and deepen the regional fragmentation of the Internet initiated by the Asian giant.Two weeks ago, Donald Trump signed executive orders out of "commercial transactions" with Wechat and TikTok, the popular short video app submitted for months to the Administration's scrutiny. They argued in the White House that, as Chinese companies, both are subject to the party's ultimate authority; which poses a threat to the privacy of its users in the U.S. and thus national security. The announcement comes when the bilateral relationship between the two superpowers is at its worst since its inception in 1972, aimed at an increasingly belligerent enmity.The date of entry into force for presidential provisions is meridian: a period of 45 days. Its ambiguous formulation, however, leaves many doubts as to what will be forbidden for whom. Paul Triolo, head of Geotechnology at Eurasia Group, bets because "WeChat will not be able to operate in the U.S." He says, "The most important thing is to figure out how far the order will go out of the country."Two are interpretations in this regard. The first, more restricted, would block access to WeChat for any individual on American soil. The second, broader, infers that no company could supply North American technology products not only to WeChat and TikTok, but also to their respective matrices, Tencent and ByteDance. This ban, similar to that against Huawei, would be a major blow to the global operability of both firms and would require, for example, Apple and Android to remove apps from their download portals worldwide, including China.This broad scope stems from the document's original verbalization, which advocates the need to "take aggressive action against the WeChat owner to protect our national security." This was endorsed days later by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who during an intervention in Prague warned that the measures could be "extensive." It is possible, however, that everything is part of a Trump tactical maneuver to accelerate, for example, the sale of TikTok; or to redouble the pressure against the Asian giant. Last year the president linked the fortunes of Huawei, the first global Chinese company he shot at, at the end of the trade war now parked with a minimums deal. In any case, doubts will not dissipate until in mid-September Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross determines how far the veto goes.Tencent's offices, meanwhile, remain calm. The seventh company in the world by market capitalization last week presented its results for the second quarter of the year, which showed higher-than-expected growth. Its profits increased by 37% compared to 2019, the best pace in two years, to 33.1 billion yuan (4 billion euros). WeChat active users rebounded 6.5% to more than 1.2 billion – equivalent to 15% of the populationWorld World Cup.During the act, its leaders ventured that the sanction would have a superficial impact on their business figures to be applied exclusively outside China. "The executive order is focused on WeChat in the United States and not other businesses outside the country," said John Lo, chief financial officer of the tech giant, in a recent call with investors; before adding that "we are in the process of getting more clarification from both parties in Washington." He established that Tencent generates less than 2% of its global profits in the U.S.Results accountThe most basic of the bans might not have much significance for Tencent's results count, but it would be for the Chinese community in the diaspora, for whom WeChat is the only way to be in touch with relatives across the Pacific. This is the case, for example, of Alicia Lu, born in Wuhan and resident in New York. "I'm very worried about the veto because I would get away from some of the people that matter to me. My mother, aunt and some of my best friends live in China and we use WeChat to communicate daily. Not being able to use the app would not only be an inconvenience, but it would create a huge void in my life," he explains.This would also affect companies, from large multinationals to SMEs, operating between the two countries. One sector injured would be that of casino operators in Macau, such as MGM Resorts International, Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands – owned by Sheldon Adelson, a generous donor to the Republican Party – who channel most of their communications through this platform. "The problem is that the purpose of this executive order remains unclear. It is possible that those who wrote it were not aware of the amount of collateral damage that it could trigger," Triolo says.The day after Commerce advisor Peter Navarro first threatened to take action against the app, in July this year, a popular petition on the White House website titled "WeChat Shouldn't Be Banned" registered more than 60,000 signatures. "The primary goal of WeChat is to facilitate communication. While Chinese-born Americans may give up a leisure phone app among the many that exist, they cannot give up the only one that links them to their families in China. During this pandemic WeChat plays an even more important role in helping families stay connected and up-to-date. (...) If WeChat were banned, nearly 5 million people would be severely affected," the text read.Second derivativeA second derivative is at stake. Sanctions against Tencent, such as ByteDance or Huawei before, show the gradual trend that leads to the end of the Internet as a global project; in favour of fragmentation into regional blocs. For years, China has defended in the international sphere the notion of digital sovereignty, according to which a state has the right to regulate the Network within its territory without any foreign interference. Paradoxically, the consolidation of this process now occurs at the expense of the global operability of its companies. WeChat, without going any further, was already blocked in Iran between 2013 and 2018 for serving as a means for the distribution of pornography; and since last June it is in India, along with 58 other Chinese apps."There has already been a significant disintegration of the Internet over the past decade," says Triolo. "China's efforts to keep out social media, search engines and other American platforms are now being seenReplicated. However, the U.S. does not intend to censor content but to prevent the use of apps that censor content, through laws according to its country of origin. The Trump Administration also wants to restrict the use of technology products in its network and that of its allies based on their origin. This process, of expanding, can lead to a profound rupture, as countries will eventually be forced to choose between two supply chains for all their products." These two ecosystems that until now lived together will become more and more different and exclusionary. Only the imposition of one of them, or a time trip, could fix it.You can follow THE RETINA TECHNOLOGY COUNTRY on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or subscribe here to our Newsletter.Load-Date: August 23, 2020End of Document

Facebook may be behind the pressure to remove TikTokCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 24, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 528 wordsBodyIn recent weeks the TikTok platform has faced problems in the United States. President Donald Trump accuses the application of being a national security risk and signed an order that could be banned from September 20. And, it seems, that decision could have been influenced by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.No one is surprised that Zuckerberg sees TikTok as a threat to his platforms. In a short time the Chinese-born social network became the favorite for millions of users worldwide. And with over 100 million users in the United States, the app could take people away from Facebook's dominant suite of apps. However, it has not been saved from criticism that claims works under censorship policies and that the data they collect from their users may be compromised.According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, one of the reasons TikTok is now struggling to survive in the United States is that Zuckerberg spoke about TikTok and the threats other Chinese internet companies pose to American companies at a private dinner with President Donald Trump last October.The WSJ report also notes that Facebook's CEO discussed the scope of the app, owned by the ByteDance company, with Republican Sen. Tom Cotton, who wrote a letter to open a national security investigation into TikTok last October.It is further claimed that in November, Zuckerberg also met with Senator Josh Hawley, who called for the app to be banned on all federal devices.  Hawley spokesman Kelli Ford told WSJ: "Facebook has recently sounded the alarm about China-based technology as a pr tactic to boost its own reputation."Regarding this situation, last month TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer attacked Facebook saying that the company should engage in open competition rather than attack the app under the guise of patriotism. "Let us focus our energies on fair and open competition at the service of our consumers, rather than the defamatory attacks of our competitor, that is, Facebook, disguised as patriotism and designed to end our presence in the United States."He also emphasized that Facebook released another product that mimics the short video platform: Reels, linked to Instagram, after Lasso failed. So, if TikTok is banned, the social media giant will have a lot to gain.They'll fight to stayTikTok has repeatedly pointed out that the fear of the US authorities that it will hand over information from its users to the Chinese government is unfounded, that they have never done so and would not do so if asked, even though laws in the Asian country force companies to hand over data if requested.It is precisely because of the above that earlier this month President Donald Trump signed an executive order that TikTok's operations in the United States will be banned from September 20.Also, arguing national security concerns, Trump also gave ByteDance deadline until mid-November to sell U.S. network operations.TikTok said he will bring the measures against him to justice. "To ensure that the right is respected and that our company and our users are treated fairly we have no choice but to question the decree through the judicial system," the group wrote in a message transmitted to the AFP.Load-Date: August 25, 2020End of Document

New US sanctions on Huawei will further enrify the supply chainCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 18, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 669 wordsBodyBy Josh Horwitz and Hyunjoo JinSHANGHI/SEUL, 18 Aug (Reuters) - Increasing US restrictions on Huawei is likely to cut off the Chinese smartphone manufacturer's access to even the chips already available on the market and once again disrupt the global supply chain of technology, executives and experts warned.The Trump Administration on Monday extended its restrictions to Huawei and banned suppliers from selling chips made from U.S. technology to the Chinese company without a special license, thus closing potential loopholes in its May sanctions that could have allowed Huawei access to the technology through third parties.The restrictions underscore the breakdown of relations between Beijing and Washington, which have reached their worst in decades, with the White House pressuring states around the world not to hire Huawei, claiming that the company would hand over data to the Chinese government.Huawei denies espionage for China."It will have a big impact," said Gu Wenjun, chief analyst at Shanghai-based consultanc law FIRM ICWise, referring to america's stricter restrictions. "It will disrupt Huawei's plans to obtain chips by buying them from third parties, rather than obtaining them from HiSilicon."Huawei has said that from September it will stop making its Kirin chips, its flagship, because U.S. pressure on its suppliers has made it impossible for its HiSilicon division to continue manufacturing the chips that are key components of its mobile phones.For chip suppliers in other regions the ban could also be a setback, as most use the US design software from Cadence Design Systems and Synopsys and chip engraving tools from firms such as Applied Materials, experts said.In Asia, memory card manufacturers, including South Koreans Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, Japan's image sensor manufacturer Sony and Taiwanese chip manufacturer MediaTek could be affected, said an industry source.The source, an employee of a large Asian technology provider who refused to be identified due to media statement rules, said the company's management was concerned about restrictions, which they were studying to determine whether it would be affected.It is not yet clear how many of the major vendors are licensed or will need new ones to comply with these standards, or whether such licenses will be granted.Samsung and Hynix declined to comment.A Sony spokeswoman also declined to comment, but noted the company's statements earlier this month announcing that it would cut its three-year sensor investment plan to accommodate the changing environment of the smartphone market.MediaTek said it was studying the new rule changes to follow compliance with its provisions, but that it did not expect a substantial impact on its short-term operations, in light of the information available.MediaTek shares were down 10% on Tuesday, en route to its worst day since 2017, while Huawei's small suppliers also fell on a pair of bearish Asian exchanges. Samsung shares were up 2%, while Sony and Hynix were down about 1%.The ban is also likely to affect U.S. companies such as Qualcomm and Intel, and other small chipmakers in Asia and Europe.Several unknowns remain on how the new restrictions will be implemented and the extent to which the U.S. Department of Commerce will push to require knowledge of any transactions that could be madeon behalf of Huawei or a blacklisted subsidiary in Washington, political risk consultant Eurasia Group said in a note.A semiconductor seller "would potentially be required to know where all of their products end up so that they do not engage in any transactions in which a Huawei partner may be a buyer, an intermediate consignee, an end consignee or an end user," Eurasia analysts said.(Information from Josh Horwitz from Shanghai and Hyunjoo Jin from Seoul; additional information about Brenda Goh from Shanghai, Makiko Yamazaki from Tokyo, Yimou Lee from Taipei; written by Sayantani Ghosh; edited by Himani Sarkar; translated by Darius Fernandez in the Gdansk news)Load-Date: August 19, 2020End of Document

As Trump threatens ban, TikTok says it wants to fight foreign interference in the November electionCNN WireAugust 5, 2020 Wednesday 1:00 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 531 wordsDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  TikTok, the embattled short-form video app owned by a Chinese tech firm, wants to stop the spread of online misinformation and fight foreign interference in November's US presidential election. The company said in a blog post Wednesday that it is updating its policies on "misleading content," and plans to bolster its fact-checking partnerships to "help verify election-related misinformation." The company is also adding an in-app option to report falsehoods. TikTok added that it is working with experts --- including the US Department of Homeland Security --- "to protect against foreign influence on our platform."The announcement comes days after President Donald Trump threatened to ban the app from operating in the United States. US policymakers have for weeks criticized the app as a national security risk, and fear that the data it collects on its US users could end up in the hands of the Chinese government. TikTok has said it stores its data outside of China and that it would resist any attempts by Beijing to seize the information.Trump later said he would be open to allowing a US company to buy TikTok, but said any deal would have to include a "substantial amount of money" coming to the US Treasury. Trump also set a September 15 deadline for TikTok to find a US buyer. While TikTok has become a flashpoint in geopolitical tensions between China and the US, the app has faced less scrutiny from US lawmakers and the media about its role in spreading misinformation compared to American competitors, including Facebook. It's known more as a platform for dancing videos than as one for political organizing. But there have been some signs of political involvement. In June, TikTok users encouraged people to register online for a free Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and then not show up. Trump bragged about 1 million RSVPs for the event, though his rally arena did not fill to the more than 19,000 capacity.Misinformation has also popped up on the platform. TikTok this week removed a fake video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that had been manipulated to make it appear as if the congresswoman was drunk or drugged. A version of the video posted in May had clocked a modest --- but not insignificant --- 40,000 views. A version reposted on Facebook late last week, which has not been removed but which includes a warning label, was seen millions of times in a few days. Like other social media platforms, TikTok has previously made pledges to tackle online misinformation, including about Covid-19. "While TikTok isn't the go-to app to follow news or politics, we're focused on supporting our users with education and authoritative information on important public issues," wrote Vanessa Pappas, the general manager of TikTok US, in Wednesday's blog post. She said the Homeland Security task force TikTok is partnering with will be able to share insight about "possible disinformation campaigns." The task force also connects local election officials with online platforms and law enforcement "so that we can help protect the integrity of the vote," she added. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

China's Future in Low Carbon and Clean Energy Industry Expansion 2020 - Renewable Energy and the New Energy Vehicle (NEV) Industry Will Lead the WayPR NewswireAugust 24, 2020 Monday 12:45 PM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1047 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, Aug. 24, 2020 BodyPR NewswireThe"China's Future in Low Carbon and Clean Energy Industry Expansion"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.In the coming years, low-carbon industry developments will set the economic and business agenda in China and other major economies as climate change becomes more severe in its effects.The renewable energy and NEV industries will see an accelerated shift in investment activities. Renewable energy and electric mobility are among the most effective tools in the fight against climate change, and more countries are in a joint effort to mature these industries.Therefore, there will be more room for renewable energy companies to expand their business overseas - especially for Chinese companies as they manufacture renewable energy products way cheaper and in a mass scale due to the economies of scale, government support and experience. Chinese NEV manufacturers also have the same advantage as renewable energy companies in terms of attracting overseas consumers with lower prices.As a result, this report will look at China's current policy ground and emerging private sector investments for a greener development, with 15 + 1 key studies from various companies in renewable energy and the NEV sector. Furthermore, it will lay out the China-specific opportunities & challenges in these sectors as well as providing key insights for investors and market watchers.Executive Summary:China stands to benefit significantly by transforming its pattern of economic activity towards low-carbon development pathways. Such a transformation is not only important in preventing climate change and increasing energy efficiency, but it is also important to capitalize on new growth opportunities as a supplier that can help satisfy the increasing global demand for low carbon technologies -solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles (EV). Health crises, the limits of old economic models and energy security are the drivers of China's low-carbon industry expansion, especially the renewable energy sector and the new energy vehicle sector. The key studies represented in this report shows that government incentives and subsidies played a key role in developing these sectors. Thanks to these policies and subsidies, the country is in a leading position when it comes to renewable energy output and has also established itself as a market leader in other related technologies, like electric storage systems. However, as renewable energy prices have fallen, renewable subsidies are being phased out. Previously subsidies were provided as to make renewable energy cheaper and competitive against traditional means of energy production. Another reason is the impact of the US-China trade war on China's economy. Now, the government is stricter on its spending and subsidy policies. As a result, wind and solar facilities must now compete directly at auction with other forms of power generation. Considering this situation, there are various challenges and opportunities for these sectors. Challenges include a highly competitive domestic market, possible subsidy cuts, slowing global demand, the USChina trade war and technological developments that the Chinese industry seems to be following from behind. NEV manufacturers are also facing the same challenges. Moving into the 2020s, the energy industry will see an accelerated shift to renewable energy projects large and small. Renewable energy is one of the most effective tools in the fight against climate change, and more countries are in an effort to switch their energy systems towards renewables. Therefore, in the future there will be more room for renewable energy companies to expand their business overseas - especially for Chinese companies as they manufacture renewable energy products way cheaper due to economies of scale. In addition, Chinese NEV manufacturers also have the same advantage as renewable energy companies in terms of attracting overseas consumers with lower prices. Chinese NEVs are almost 75 percent cheaper than those of their overseas counterparts. Lastly, these industries are welcoming foreign investors and putting efforts into improving their technologies. Foreign investment can contribute to the industrial and technological development of the host country through global integration and technology transfer. These investments increase the competition in the NEV and renewable energy industry at multiple stages of production, thereby improving efficiency.Key Topics Covered:1. Introduction2.

Trump gives TikTok an ultimatum to leave the U.S. or agree to be soldCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 4, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 360 wordsBodyUS President Donald Trump today until September 15 to social video app TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, to move into the hands of U.S. capital or face its ban on domestic security.The representative said that TikTok will have to close on September 15 if it does not agree to be purchased by Microsoft, which is engaged in negotiations for its acquisition, or another U.S. equity firm."I don't care if it's Microsoft or another big company, a secure company, a very American company has to buy it," Trump said on Monday.It also stated that the Treasury Department should "receive a lot of money" from the sale operation, without specifying on what concept or how it would be carried out.TikTok, which in the U.S. has more than 80 million users, is one of the most growing social networks in recent years, where it has become the main entertainment for many teens and a marketing channel for major celebrities.The Trump Administration, as well as leading Democratic congressmen, have insisted that the widespread use of TikTok puts American data privacy and national security at risk as it is exposed through ByteDance to chinese government instructions and intervention.Microsoft announced on Sunday that discussions are continuing to explore the possible purchase of TikTok in the U.S. and promised to complete the operation by September.The decision was made known by the Company based in Redmond, Washington state, after its CEO, Satya Nadella, spoke with President Trump, who on Friday announced his intention to ban the Chinese social network in the country.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also said on Sunday that Trump has the ability to force the sale to national capital of TikTok's U.S. operations and that this strategy is also supported by Democratic leaders in Congress.The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) allows the president to block transactions and freeze assets if he considers an "unusual and extraordinary threat" to the country's national security or economy.The Chinese Foreign Ministry opposes the forced sale of TikTok, an operation that it believes violates the principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO).Load-Date: August 5, 2020End of Document

Alibaba sales soar but US crackdown may be loomingCNN WireAugust 20, 2020 Thursday 1:11 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 553 wordsDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  China's economy has bounced back from the Covid-19 outbreak in China's Wuhan province. That's great news for Alibaba, the e-commerce and cloud giant. But the company also acknowledged the threat of being caught up in the burgeoning trade war between the United States and China.Alibaba posted strong sales and earnings growth Thursday morning that topped Wall Street's forecasts. Overall revenue was up nearly 35% from a year ago and the company also posted solid increases in total and mobile users.The stock fell slightly during early trading Thursday but it is up about 25% so far in 2020. "Although the global community continues to struggle with uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, we have seen encouraging signs of recovery in China due to effective management of the outbreak in vast majority of the country," said Alibaba chairman and CEO Daniel Zhang during a call with analysts.But Alibaba is concerned it could become a target in the Trump administration's war on Chinese tech firms such as ByteDance-owned TikTok and Tencent's WeChat.Zhang acknowledged during the conference call with analysts that Alibaba faces "uncertainties from not only the global pandemic, but also increasing tensions between US and China." "We are closely monitoring the latest shift in US government policies towards Chinese companies, which is a very fluid situation," Zhang added. "We are assessing the situation and any potential impact carefully and thoroughly and will take necessary actions to comply with any new regulations.Alibaba does not have a major retail presence in the United States. But a growing number of small businesses in America use Alibaba's cloud hosting services to set up their own digital commerce operations. Alibaba competes with the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Google owner Alphabet in the lucrative cloud market. Alibaba said its cloud revenue rose nearly 60% from a year ago.Zhang touted its cloud prowess -- and how that helps American companies -- during the conference call. "As the world's largest e-commerce platform, Alibaba's primary commercial focus in the US is to support American brands, retailers, small businesses and farmers to sell to consumers and trade partners in China as well as the other key markets around the world," Zhang said."We believe global trade will continue, and Alibaba's active pursuit of our mission to make it easy to do business anywhere are fully aligned with the interest of both China and the United States," he added. Still, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said earlier this month that American businesses must be wary of "untrusted" Chinese technology. He said it was dangerous to have too much information about intellectual property stored on cloud networks run by Alibaba and other Chinese firms.Zhang pointed out though that Alibaba has a big opportunity in the Chinese cloud market, which is still in its early stages and has the potential to grow more rapidly than cloud computing in the United States.Alibaba rival JD.com reported a better-than-expected jump in quarterly sales of 35% from a year ago earlier this week. Another Chinese e-commerce site, group deals platform Pinduoduo, will report its latest results Friday morning.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Microsoft has escaped Trump's wrath so far. That could be about to change.Politico.comAugust 8, 2020 Saturday 11:00 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1837 wordsHighlight: If the company's plans to buy TikTok pan out, it will likely face future scrutiny in Washington over political speech, antitrust and its dealings with China.BodyMicrosoft has successfully avoided angering President Donald Trump for years. Now the software giant's bid to buy TikTok is plunging it deep into some of the tech industry's most volatile Washington fights.The company has kept a less contentious profile than peers like Amazon and Google - a position that likely helped open the door to its potential acquisition of the video-sharing app. That deal would give Microsoft a social media platform poised to challenge the likes of Facebook and Snapchat. But nabbing TikTok would also throw Microsoft into the middle of three major battles raging between the tech industry and the administration: the policing of social media, the power of Big Tech and ever-more combative U.S.-China relations."They're putting a big bet on the table politically," said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington think tank that Microsoft helps fund. Microsoft has done its best to tilt the odds in its favor. CEO Satya Nadella has built a rapport with Trump since the president took office, for example sitting alongside the president at a roundtable on tech early in Trump's term. The company has also cultivated relationships with those close to the president, including hosting First Lady Melania Trump last year at its Redmond, Wash., headquarters. But the key to the company's less polarizing reputation may be that it has simply been less of a target for Trump and lawmakers, whose anger at the tech industry has focused on issues with little relevance to how Microsoft makes money, such as protections for consumer internet data, politically charged messages on social media and dominance in online markets. Microsoft, as a result, has had fewer fires to put out in discussions with government officials."They have engaged and they haven't pissed off," said a tech industry official with knowledge of the company's Washington operations, who asked for anonymity to speak candidly. "I don't think that Microsoft necessarily has a special relationship, but I think that they have a relationship where they are better than the alternative."The usefulness of that position became clear over the weekend when Nadella called Trump to convince him of the TikTok deal's merits. Trump had said late Friday he intended to ban TikTok from the U.S., but then declared he would be open to a sale after conversations with administration officials, lawmakers and Nadella. In a blog post on Sunday, Microsoft acknowledged its acquisition talks and said it "appreciates the U.S. Government's and President Trump's personal involvement as it continues to develop strong security protections for the country." The company declined to comment for this story. The soft power outreach has been clear. Nadella has accompanied other tech leaders when asked to advise the White House on policy matters, and more recently joined dozens of business leaders tapped to help the president navigate economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. And Microsoft President Brad Smith promoted computer science education alongside Trump's daughter and senior advisor Ivanka Trump at a Virginia school in 2017.Microsoft hasn't completely shied away from opposing Trump administration policies it finds objectionable. Nadella is among the CEOs who urged the White House not to abandon the Paris Climate agreement, and has spoken out against several of Trump's immigration decisions. Indeed, Microsoft brought one of the Supreme Court lawsuits that ultimately reversed Trump's move to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.But Nadella has, so far, avoided the clashes that other CEOs have had with Trump. Twitter, Facebook and Google-owned YouTube have run afoul of Trump for taking action against his misleading social media posts. Amazon has drawn ire because founder Jeff Bezos also owns The Washington Post, whose news coverage Trump has at times lambasted. Meanwhile, Microsoft has largely stayed out of the crosshairs on divisive policy issues like privacy, antitrust and content moderation - three issues that have dogged its fellow tech giants and, just last week, forced the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google to testify before Congress.Microsoft's more favorable position is "certainly serving them well," said Matt Perault, a former Facebook lobbyist who now leads Duke's Center on Science & Technology Policy. But "I'm not sure that's the best basis for making a decision on who can acquire a company.""It's not clear to me that Microsoft is best suited to grow and improve the app, but it's essentially impossible for Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook to bid given the political dynamics right now," Perault added.The TikTok acquisition could change that more favorable position.An acquisition would insert Microsoft into one the most partisan and deeply unresolved debates surrounding internet companies: how they should moderate controversial online content and whether Congress needs to amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a decades-old law that largely absolves platforms of legal liability for what their users post."With regard to TikTok, I think the biggest risk to Microsoft in this is just weighing into the whole content moderation quagmire, where you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't," Atkinson said. "They're going to have to really work at making sure they don't get either the Republicans mad at them or the Democrats mad at them."Atkinson said the deal could ultimately pay off for Microsoft. Trump could suffer blowback from TikTok's 100 million American users if he banishes the app altogether, so having the app snapped up by a U.S. company may be the safest political option, he said. With its viral videos and ballooning audience, TikTok puts Microsoft at the center of the social media debates in a way it hasn't yet faced with LinkedIn, which it also owns. TikTok hasn't had the same issues as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter with terrorism, hate speech and political interference - but it was thrust into the political spotlight after teens used the platform to reportedly sabotage a Trump campaign rally. Trump supporters on TikTok, meanwhile, use hashtags including #trump2020, #trumptrain and #votetrump to amplify their support."You've seen a bigger target on the most dominant players. It doesn't mean that the same concerns around content moderation can't apply to a smaller player, like a Twitter or a TikTok or even a Reddit," said Chris Lewis, president and CEO of progressive advocacy group Public Knowledge.The purchase of TikTok itself is unlikely to raise antitrust alarms for Microsoft, but it comes at a time when Washington regulators are hypercritical of the tech industry's acquisitions and overall market power. Already, Microsoft is part of a broad Federal Trade Commission review of mergers from the past decade that also targets Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook. And Congress appears eager to engage antitrust efforts to pursue companies for a range of woes. Lawmakers used last week's hearing of tech CEOs - called because of antitrust concerns - as an opportunity to go after the companies on topics ranging from alleged conservative censorship to China's pursuit of U.S. tech intellectual property.Microsoft, with a market cap of $1.6 trillion, has separate antitrust headaches to deal with. Last week, Slack filed a complaint with the EU's antitrust authority against Microsoft for allegedly tying its Microsoft Teams to the rest of its Office products, raising the prospect of a new competition challenge for the company.Antitrust fights are familiar territory for Microsoft, which battled claims from both the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department throughout the 1990s over allegedly unfair business tactics used to prop up its PC business. At the time, then-CEO Bill Gates delivered his own fiery remarks at a much-watched Capitol Hill hearing - contentious moments the company has worked not to revisit.Lewis, whose group opposes monopolization in the tech industry, said it was too early to tell whether the potential Microsoft acquisition would impact market competition in the social media space. He said he'll watch how Microsoft handles data privacy and content moderation, and whether TikTok remains a viable alternative to other social media platforms. Purchasing TikTok also puts Microsoft at the crosscurrent of the U.S. and China in their fight of technology dominance. Already the prospect of selling TikTok has angered the Beijing government and Chinese citizens, who have taken it as the U.S. playing the national security card to capture one of China's most globally successful internet companies. (The Chinese version of TikTok operates independently but they're both subsidiaries of the same company.)Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters Tuesday that the U.S. has "stretched the concept of national security" in the TikTok case."If everyone were to follow the US's practice then anyone can invoke national security to take similar measures against a US company," Wang said. "The US should not open this Pandora's box otherwise it will swallow the bitter fruit."Microsoft's Smith said in January that China accounts for less than 2 percent of the company's global revenue, which totaled $143 billion last fiscal year. That figure would be higher, he said, if not for the piracy of the company's software. Nevertheless, Microsoft has longstanding business ties in China having first entered the market in 1992.But Microsoft is also among the U.S. companies that have run into problems in China under the company's Anti-Monopoly Law. In 2014, the country took seven months to agree to allow Microsoft to buy Nokia's device business and required the companies to agree to limits on how it would use its patents. Not long after, Chinese antitrust regulators opened an antitrust probe into Microsoft's distribution of its media player and browser.Pressure could be coming from the U.S. as well. Trump's top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, told CNN that the proposed deal between Microsoft and China is problematic because of Microsoft's business in that country. Navarro said Microsoft should divest its business in China, if the purchase of TikTok goes through, to avoid potential conflicts. "This is not a white-hat company," Navarro told CNN, saying that it enables China's censorship in order to do business there. Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser and China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said timing of the deal is particularly bad for Microsoft's China efforts."This is as high profile a case as there could be because it looks like the top political leadership has gotten itself into the middle of the negotiations right as the relationship is deteriorating along every single dimension," Kennedy said. Microsoft, he added, is "stepping into an amazingly loaded minefield right now."Leah Nylen and Alexandra S.

As far as TikTok is concerned, we re banning them from the United States,  Trump told reporters aboard      Air Force One on Friday night. Bloombergreports that Trump indicated he s ready to sign a document to order the ban as early as today, either via an executive order or emergency economic      powers. I will sign the document tomorrow,  said Trump on Friday night, indicating that a ban could take effect  essentially immediately. The threat of a TikTok ban has been lingering since Secretary of State Mike Pompeo mentioned the possibility on July 7th, saying it was  something we re looking at.  TikTok is a subsidiary of      Beijing-based ByteDance, and critics have called out its privacy practices and potential ties to the Chinese government. Pompeo also compared TikTok to Huawei and ZTE, two Chinese companies      that have been designated as threats to US national security.TikTok US General Manager Vanessa Pappas thanked the company s US supporters in a video on Saturday.  We ve heard your outpouring of support,  she said, adding  we re not planning on going      anywhere.  The company will bring 10,000 jobs into the US over the next three years, Pappas said.  We re here for the long run. @tiktokA message to the TikTok community.? original sound   tiktokReports on Friday suggested the Trump administration would potentially force TikTok s Chinese owner to divest it. Such a move triggered rumors about Microsoft potentially acquiring TikTok s US      operations, a move that Trump appeared to downplay on Friday.  [It s] not the deal that you have been hearing about, that they are going to buy and sell, and this and that. And Microsoft and      another one. We re not an M&A company,  said Trump.It s still not clear exactly how the Trump administration will force a TikTok ban in the US. There are variety of different methods, but a network block like China s Great Firewall would simply      be unprecedented in the US.

TikTok sues Trump for banning its U.S. operationsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 24, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 471 wordsBodyThe social video app TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, on Monday sued the government of US President Donald Trump for enacting a law prohibiting any transaction or business with that company in the United States.In his lawsuit, TikTok alleged that President Trump's executive order, signed in early August, "is not based on genuine national security concerns," according to excerpts from the company's own court paper on a blog Monday.  Double Way  "The executive order issued by the Administration on August 6, 2020 has the potential to strip our community of rights without any evidence to justify such extreme and due process," TikTok said in that complaint.The Trump Administration argues that TikTok poses a "threat" to US national security, so it prevented its transactions from September 15, and is seeking to force its sale to an American company like Microsoft, which has shown interest in the popular social network.In his executive order, Trump claimed that TikTok creates "real risks" for the US, so he banned any business with his parent company, a move that can force ByteDance to sell its social network.The lawsuit, filed monday in the Federal District Court for the Central District of California, in Los Angeles, represents another step in the dispute between TikTok and the White House.It all started with Trump's first executive order against TikTok, which derives from his legal authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows the president to regulate economic transactions in a national emergency.Previous administrations have used it to sanction foreign governments, as well as drug kingpins and hackers, but have never used it against a global technology company.TikTok, which in the US has more than 80 million users, is one of the most growing social networks in recent years, where it has become the main entertainment for many teenagers and a marketing channel for major celebrities.The Trump Administration, as well as leading Democratic congressmen, have insisted that the widespread use of TikTok puts American data privacy and national security at risk as it is exposed through ByteDance to chinese government instructions and intervention.China's Foreign Ministry also opposes the forced sale of TikTok, an operation it believes violates the principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO).In fact, the GovernmentChina sees the intention to sell TikTok as another chapter of the trade war between Beijing and Washington, which seeks to contain the growing technological power of the Asian giant, which has already seen telecoms firm Huawei have faced restrictions.Attempts to put pressure on TikTok are also seen with concern by tech giants with global ambitions such as Alibaba and Tencent.Listen to the podcast ??SpotifyApple PodcastsGoogle PodcastsAcastDeezerLoad-Date: August 25, 2020End of Document

Iran, China bet on a multibillion-dollar strategic deal against THE U.S.CE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 14, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 582 wordsBodyIran and China are committed to sealing a strategic agreement that would involve investments of 340 billion euros in the Islamic Republic in exchange for oil and gas at a competitive price. With this big deal, Tehran would have an economic oxygen ball to dodge Donald Trump's government sanctions following the withdrawal of the nuclear pact. Beijing, for its part, would be able to secure its New Silk Road and deliver a coup d'éte of authority to the United States in the Middle East.The two countries have been negotiating a pact since 2016 under which Tehran is committed to supplying Beijing with hydrocarbons at a competitive price in exchange for China investing up to $400 billion (about 340 billion euros) in the country's battered infrastructure. On June 21, Tehran gave for good the draft, which must now be passed into Chinese hands.The Iranian government has not yet presented the document in Parliament, which has amplified fears that there are many transfers to Beijing. Even some Iranian parliamentarians accused the Government of intending to hand over the island of Kish, located in the strategic Persian Gulf, to the Asian giant; and to authorize the presence of 5,000 Chinese soldiers on Iranian territory. Mohamad Javad Zarif, Iran's foreign minister, had to appear in the House to deny it. The Chinese side, for the time being, remains silent and it is unknown whether or as it has signed the agreement.Iran's geostrategic situation, between the Caspian and the Persian Gulf, and its oil and gas reserves make it ideal for being one of the essential links for China and its great New Silk Road project. This plan is a series of infrastructure investments in more than 60 countries and its central stretch passes through Iran. The Government of Iran has published on the Internet the broad outlines of the agreement, which includes a long list of collaborations in hydrocarbons, petrochemicals, transport, energy and security. According to Petroleum Economist magazine, Iran would effectively be willing to make huge concessions to China, including discounts of up to 32% on hydrocarbons and the possibility of delaying payments by two years. The draft lists nearly 100 investment projects, including the construction of high-speed airports, trains and underground lines and the infrastructure for Chinese 5G, which pits Beijing against Washington.The idea of a 25-year strategic agreement was conceived after Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Iran in January 2016. With Washington's 2018 exit from the nuclear deal, which Beijing also signed, and the re-signing of U.S. sanctions, Chinese companies left the Iranian market and it seemed that the plan would not curd. But China continued to import Iranian oil, although in 2019 trade between the two fell to $23 billion, one-third less than the previous year.Now Beijing reaches out to Tehran, who is urgently needed to find a powerful partner to get out of economic isolation and counter American pressure. Iran needs investment and renew its oil industry and cannot count on the support of Russia, a geopolitical partner in the region (versus the US and Saudi Arabia), but with which it competes as a hydrocarbon exporter.Ali Aghamohammadi, the government's economic adviser, said in July that "Iran must increase its crude oil production to 10 million barrels per day and needs a strategic client not to be removed from the oil market." In light of the draft, it appears that this "strategic client" will be China.Load-Date: August 15, 2020End of Document

TikTok Picks Winning Offer Despite Surprise Obstacle From Beijing: ReportInvestor's Business DailyAugust 31, 2020Copyright 2020 Investor's Business Daily, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGYLength: 505 wordsByline: APARNA NARAYANANBodyhttps://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Stock-TikTok-02-adobe.jpgA TikTok deal may reportedly be announced as soon as tomorrow as the video-sharing app has selected a winning bidder for its U.S., New Zealand and Australian operations, sources told CNBC.Last week, Walmart teamed up with Microsoft on a TikTok deal as the Trump administration pressures the app to sell its U.S. operations, while Oracle was readying a competing offer.An announcement of the winning bid would come days after the Chinese government added artificial intelligence technology used by TikTok to its export-control list, meaning Beijing would have to approve any deal. Chinese parent company ByteDance said it would comply with the requirement.Analysts expect a TikTok deal potentially worth $35 billion-$40 billion, while CNBC reported it could come in at $20 billion-$30 billion. Oracle's rival offer is  about $20 billion, according to the Wrap.Other indicators have pointed to a TikTok deal being imminent. On Wednesday, TikTok announced CEO Kevin Mayer is quitting, just months after leaving Disney, with reports saying he wasn't part of talks on a sale.IBD Live: A New Tool For Daily Stock Market AnalysisMicrosoft, Walmart Fall On TikTok Deal NewsShares of Microsoft closed down 1.4% and Walmart fell 1% on the stock market today, paring earlier losses caused by China's export-control move. Oracle lost 1.1%.Walmart earlier was working with Japan's SoftBank on a TikTok deal. A partnership with Microsoft could give it the technology "backbone" partner that the U.S. is said to require.The retail giant confirmed last week that it's interested in participating in a TikTok deal, noting "the way TikTok has integrated e-commerce and advertising capabilities in other markets is a clear benefit to creators and users in those markets. We believe a potential relationship with TikTok US in partnership with Microsoft could add this key functionality."Microsoft also has a stake in Walmart-owned Flipkart, Amazon's chief rival in India's booming e-commerce market.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said last week the Walmart tie-up "likely seals the deal" for Microsoft. According to earlier reports, Oracle was in the lead for a TikTok deal, after President Donald Trump supported its bid."With other FAANG tech stalwarts currently up to their eyeballs in regulatory swirls, Redmond (not Oracle) is the only US technology stalwart with the treasure chest, infrastructure and distribution to get a deal like this done in our opinion," Ives said.The analyst estimated the deal could be worth $35 billion to $40 billion."We believe Microsoft buying TikTok would be like Christmas morning coming early for investors," he wrote.Find Aparna Narayanan on Twitter at @IBD_ANarayanan.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Stocks To Watch: Top-Rated IPOs, Big Caps And Growth StocksFind The Latest Stocks Hitting Buy Zones With MarketSmithSee Stocks On The List Of Market Leaders With IBD LeaderboardJoin IBD Live And Learn Top Chart-Reading And Trading Techniques From The ProsLoad-Date: September 2, 2020End of Document

International cooperation is also medicine against Covid-19CE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 11, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 570 wordsBodyThe new coronavirus has introduced among us a new mode of discomfort because it is taking away some degrees of freedom from us.The innate instinct of survival against Covid-19 makes us less gregarious and more skeptical or, rather, more suspicious of others whom we see as dangerous beings because they are potentially contagion agents.This means that we have chosen to isolate ourselves to protect our health. Something similar has happened between some international agencies and leaders of states.International bodies cannot cease to be synonymous with solidarity. The onset of the pandemic took several of them by surprise. Some were stunned. I think for example of the G7 and G20.Some of his remote meetings reigned uncoordination and the absence of joint action. True, the pandemic is born amid a complex context in the geopolitics of the United States and China; the European Union is recomposed through Brexit and Latin America is also in a process of recomposition where nationalisms are dangerously emerging, and it finds a very deep wound in Venezuela.Over the months, the global population became known to the guidelines of the World Health Agency; gradually, the signals of its director, Tedros Adhanom, were assimilated by governments and citizens. WHO became a kind of guide. But WHO was also the focus of the geopolitical debate between the United States and China, where President Trump identified it as an accomplice to the Chinese government on the issue of information cover-up. Trust in international organizations must be taken care of every day. Since the new coronavirus sprouted in Wuhan, China, and traveled the world to settle in populations, nationalist instincts led various political leaders to close borders thinking the solution was linked in the colors of the flags and passport logos. On the contrary, the solution for controlling the expansion of the pandemic lies in cooperation, and then in targeting geographical areas with high propensity of contagion. For example, in the resurgent of the new coronavirus in Beijing during the second half of June, the authorities decided to apply confinements in some areas of the city, but not throughout the capital, let alone throughout the country.Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore have shown us that the slow spread of the virus in their regions, not to mention efficient containment of the virus, can be achieved through measures where education, civics and technology become protective tools.In Taiwan, with a population of 23.5 million, seven people have died as a result of Covid-19; in South Korea, with almost 52 million people, 305 have died and in Singapore, with a population of six million, 27 people have died (Google data published yesterday August 10, August 10).Countries with cultural roots linked to Confucianism rely more on the State and are more likely to express civic traits in their public behavior. Quarantines, the use of the head cover and the use of infrastructure to carry out work activities from home, helped prevent contagion.On the other hand, the European Union has just made a quantum leap in its evolution thanks to financial solidarity translated into subsidies to countries where the new coronavirus has hit its economies more virulence. For the first time in its history, the debt will be paid among all member countries.International cooperation is also a medicine that helps spread the new coronavirus.Load-Date: August 12, 2020End of Document

Trump's rushed race to buy Tik Tok: from company to big startCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 19, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 595 wordsBodyThe race for Tik Tok has just begun and promises to be exciting. Microsoft is no longer alone in its interest in taking over a portion of the social network operations of the moment, a formula of short and generally funny videos held by Chinese capital that Donald Trump has interpreted as an espionage weapon and will not be able to operate in the United States unless it is in the hands of an American company. That's why it has given a 45-day time to close the operation that sounded like a bilateral issue between ByteDance, the owner of Tik Tok, and the Seattle-based giant. But Oracle and the millions of its founders, Larry Ellison, have entered the scene this week. Microsoft is the third most valuable company in the world - by market capitalization - and is looking to further diversify its portfolio to compete with the rest of Silicon Valley giants. The operation, valued between $20 billion and $50 billion,would give you visibility into a field unpublished so far for the company founded by Bill Gates, social media with direct access to the advertising business and data sales.At the head of the negotiations has been Satya Nadella,the CEO considered in his field as a kind of rock star, the man who closed the linkedIn purchase, launched the brand's first laptop, got the company into the cloud business, and has taken Microsoft's market capitalization into the stratosphere: $1.6 trillion from the $310 billion it was worth when it took the reins in 2014. Their experience and charisma should be key in the negotiations. However, Oracle seems better positioned. The relationship between Ellison and Trump could take precedence when decanting the balance on one side or the other. The millionaire owner of a dozen houses in Malibu and the Indian Wells tennis tournament, among other conquests, is a declared supporter of Trump's politics. You've already said you're confident he'll be re-elected as president. "I support him and I want him to do well," he said. Trump himself came to the fore this week to support him at an event in Yuma, Arizona. "I think Oracle is a great company and that its owner is a tremendous guy. A tremendous person. I think Oracle could definitely handle it. Yes. We've given them until September 15th."The move could mean a powerful backstroke for Oracle,a brand less known to the general public than some of its competitors despite being an emporium, the second largest software company in the world behind Microsoft.Jim Cramer, financial analyst and presenter of Mad Money at CNBC, believes that we are facing a "force of nature", referring to Tik Tok, "an amazing company that could completely change Oracle's face." They back up data like the 50 minutes per day that spends the 15 million users who connect to the app daily. The problem is that the agreement only includes the acquisition of Tik Tok's operations in the US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. If controlling a social network is already complicated, handling only four of its legs globally is a careful ride. Still, Tik Tok seems forced to sell after allegations of Trump and his administration. "Tik Tok is not available in China.  Your users' data in the US is stored in Virginia with a backup in Singapore and strict controls on employee access.  Tik Tok has never made it easier for himto the Chinese government user data in the US, even if they had requested it. Any insinuation to the contrary is unfounded and manifestly false," the company said in its defense. However, the forced hand shift seems imminent. It's either that or Trump's dictatorial veto.Load-Date: August 20, 2020End of Document

Microsoft wants to buy all of TikTok's global businessCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 6, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 248 wordsBodyThe tech giant, in talks to acquire the American business of the popular Chinese social network, is interested in the other international operations, including Europe.This is stated by the financial journal Financial Times in its digital edition, in which it states that Microsoft is agreed to buy Tik Tok's global business, including all operations in India and Europam according to five sources knowledgeable about the negotiations.Microsoft is already in negotiations with ByteDance, owner of Tik Tok, to purchase its services in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, in an operation that would be around $50 billion.TikTok, which in the US has more than 80 million users, is one of the most growing social networks in recent years, where it has become the main entertainment for many teenagers and a marketing channel for major celebrities.China's social network has also become the new battleground between Trump and the Asian giant within the trade war that both countries have maintained in recent years. The US president himself threatened TikTok with its closure on September 15 if he does not agree to be purchased by Microsoft, which is in negotiations for its acquisition, or another U.S. equity firm.The Trump administration, as well as leading Democratic congressmen, have insisted that the widespread use of TikTok puts Americans' data privacy and national security at risk as it is exposed through ByteDance to instructions and intervention by the Chinese government..Load-Date: August 7, 2020End of Document

TikTok sees US veto as "a dangerous precedent for freedom of expression"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 425 wordsBodyMADRID (Portaltic/EP).- The social music video network TikTok responded to the executive order signed by US President Donald Trump, which prohibits "any" transaction with the company, and has called it "a dangerous precedent for freedom of expression and open markets."TikTok criticized that this move taken by the United States, which would prevent it from continuing to function in this country in 45 days, is based on "unquoted reports" and "unjustified fears" to disinformation campaigns, as the platform owned by China's Bytedance captures in a statement.The social network argues that despite attempting to propose "a constructive solution" to U.S. concerns, the Trump Administration has "failed to pay attention to the facts" and has acted "without following the usual legal processes."Trump has already warned earlier this week that his administration will ban TikTok from September 15 if it doesn't reach a sale deal on its U.S. operations before that date.Microsoft on Sunday confirmed its interest in acquiring part of TikTok, something the president appreciated positively. The president already announced Friday that he would ban TikTok using emergency economic powers or an executive order, although he did not provide further details on it.For its part, TikTok, with 100 million users in the United States, announced that it will "pursue all available remedies" so that there is a "fair deal" for the company and its users, and does not rule out resorting to U.S. courts.Reports not citedThe executive order signed by Trump argues his decision to veto TikTok based on reports that the collection of data carried out by the application would allow actions such as "tracking the locations of federal employees and contractors, building personal information records for blackmail, and conducting corporate espionage."The social network has denounced the focus on what the Chinese company considers to be "unquoted reports" and "fears or justified" to disinformation campaigns.TikTok has also valued the data collection that its application carries out as "typical in the industry" of mobile apps worldwide."We want to make it clear that TikTok has never shared user data with the Chinese government, nor has it censored content at their request," they have secured music video on the social network.In this regard, last March TikTok announced the creation of a Transparency Center at its headquarters in the US city of Los Angeles, to allow "external experts" to examine and verify the work of his team members.TikTok threatens YouTube empireLoad-Date: August 8, 2020End of Document

TOP STEM GRADUATES HIRED FOR DISTRICT OFFICIAL ROLES IN CHINAStates News ServiceAugust 25, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 724 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Government recruiters for ruling Chinese Communist Party-sponsored jobs are requiring ever higher levels of qualification for graduate positions in district-level government organizations, RFA has learned.As China's economy continues to decline and unemployment continues to worsen, graduates with postgraduate qualifications from prestigious schools like Peking University and Tsinghua University are now being recruited by district-level government departments and neighborhood committees, according to recruitment advertisements seen by RFA.Doctoral and master's graduates from Peking University and Tsinghua University have recently been found applying for positions in neighborhood committees in Hangzhou in the eastern province of Zhejiang, social media reports have indicated.The Hangzhou Sub-district Office of the municipal government recently advertised for candidates holding PhDs in STEM subjects including biology, geophysics, materials science and engineering, according to one advertisement.Jia Lingmin, a former high-school teacher in Zhengzhou, Henan province, said the graduate labor market is getting increasingly difficult in China."There is a saying that scientists are held in the highest esteem, especially those who majored in civil and biological engineering at Tsinghua," Jia said."But now, neighborhood committees are recruiting graduates with qualifications that have nothing to do with social management," he said.Hangzhou's Yuhang district recently recruited someone with a masters degree in journalism and communication from Peking University, while Qiaosi sub-district office hired someone with a master's in software engineering from Peking University, according to social media.Meanwhile, the Linping and Donghu subdistrict offices hired graduates in Chinese philosophy, someone with a masters in Law and a PhD in geophysics.Some of the new hires were assigned to the general management office as stability maintenance personnel, an army of domestic security officials tasked with preventing social unrest by cracking down on peaceful critics of the government.Politicization of universitiesShanxi-based scholar Lu Qiang said the new trend reflects the increasing politicization of universities under the ruling Chinese Communist Party's general secretary, Xi Jinping."The focus of professors is no longer on research, and the focus of students is no longer on learning," Lu said. "Universities seem from the outside to be prospering, but they are actually very materialistic.""This process now starts in kindergarten, and education is simply a way to find a good job after college," he said. "Now the Chinese economy is in such a state that finding a job in a sub-district office is actually pretty good."An official in charge of the Communist Party's organization department of the Yuhang District Committee said in response to netizens' questions that candidates of such caliber are needed to ensure Yuhang's economic and social development of Yuhang, according to the Qiangjiang Evening News.Guo Baosheng, a current affairs commentator who graduated in philosophy from Beijing's Renmin University, said graduates are likely keen to land any job on the ruling party's payroll."Being an official is the only way to make your ancestors proud and ensure a stable income," Guo told RFA. "It also shows that Chinese universities educating people who are profit-oriented and have no ideals at all.""Nothing in China beats being an official, because they have a stable income, and the opportunity for promotion and to get rich, have a bright future," he said. "You can embezzle a lot of money as an official."Soviet similaritiesGuo drew a parallel between China now and the former Soviet Union."This situation is very similar to the situation before the disintegration of the Soviet Union, he said."Back then ... Soviet university graduates and doctoral students were vying to be officials too," Guo said. "High-quality students would rather be local officials than do academic research."Think tanks are predicting that unemployment will see a double-digit increase in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, while 8.74 million new graduates will enter the labor market.Reported by Qiao Long for RFA's Mandarin Service.

Hong Kong Hang Seng Down 1.6%; Tencent Slides After Trump Issues US Ban Against WeChat, TikTok AppsMT Newswires Live Briefs PROAugust 7, 2020 Friday 6:43 AM ESTCopyright 2020 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 247 wordsBody The Hong Kong Hang Seng Index on Friday slumped by 1.6% after US President Donald Trump on Thursday effectively banned China-based apps TikTok and WeChat from operating in the US, starting in the next 45 days.

Facebook dismantles the network of fake accounts promoting Trump from RomaniaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 464 wordsBodyExpands with campaign aimed at China ///San Francisco, 6 Aug 2020 (AFP) - Facebook dismantled a network of about 120 accounts on its platform and on Instagram involved in an operation to promote President Donald Trump's re-election campaign and run from Romania, the US group announced Thursday. The authors of the operation had fake accounts posing as Americans, with also false pages of alleged supporters of the Republican representative. The network published content about the campaign extolling President Trump's support of African-Americans, Christians, and the Qanon conspiracy movement. In total, in July, both social networks deleted more than 1,000 accounts identified as "non-authentic" for their behavior intended to deceive the public about their intentions or origins. These coordinated campaigns "manipulate public debate for strategic purposes," said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's director of cybersecurity regulations. "They blur the lines between healthy debates and manipulation." The social media giant is stepping up efforts to counter misinformation operations and foreign interference in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election on November 3. "We are attacking a part of the problem that poses a challenge to the whole of society. It is becoming increasingly clear that an organization cannot achieve this on its own," the executive said. Gleicher echoed the words of the group's head, Mark Zuckerberg, who has repeatedly asked political authorities to analyze the limits that must define what content and behavior may or may not be tolerable on digital platforms. Facebook pages for the campaign managed from Romania were followed by about 1,600 people, and Instagram accounts by about 7,200. "We haven't found any evidence of your motivations, financial or otherwise," Gleicher said at a press conference. "Maybe they were just creating an audience to monetize later." A separate campaign that was disrupted in July by Facebook was apparently targeted at China.La social network removed 303 Facebook accounts,181 pages, 44 groups and 31 Instagram accounts for violation of its policies against "un authentic behavior coordinated on behalf of a foreign entity". The campaign was operated globally, from regions including North America, Europe, Australia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Indonesia, according to Facebook. Those behind the campaign published news and global events, including Hong Kong protests, U.S. policies toward China, the Falun Gong movement, and criticism of the Chinese government, Gleicher said. Although the people behind this activity tried to hide their identities and coordination, our research linked this network to Truth Media, a digital media," Gleicher said, adding that Facebook had banned the media.juj/jul/bh/ll/lda/lp/mlsLoad-Date: August 8, 2020End of Document

Fans watched 54.3 million hours of the show that year, making it one of the top two on Netflix, according to Neilson's ratings.  Now a book is here for those desperate to restart their relationship with Monica, Rachel, Joey, Ross, Chandler and Phoebe: Friends: The Official Cookbook by Amanda Yee (by Insight Editions. It will be released on September 20) contains over 70 recipes and lots of nostalgic images.  The recipes are based on references of episodes throughout the show's 10 seasons. There are 'cult' favorites like Phoebe's grandmother's cookies, as well as random ones like G. Stephanopoulos pizza (based on a wrong cake delivery) and the Wedding Pigs in a Blanket.  When it comes to pop culture cookbooks, this is an atypical case. The results are surprisingly solid, created by a professional chef, not Monica (actress Courtney Cox), who plays one on television.  Author Yee, a big friends fan, founded Blues Woman restaurant in Copenhagen and cooked with James Beard-nominated chef Bryant Terry; the two are collaborating on the book Black Food, scheduled for 2021. Yee's recipe for a delicious grilled cheese sandwich includes an Emmy-worthy tomato jam, something you can use to enhance a multitude of dishes, including turkey burgers and cheese dishes.  Friends fans will learn the backstory of the first season dish.

National Zoo awaits birth of pandemic panda cubAssociated Press InternationalAugust 18, 2020 Tuesday 7:47 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: WASHINGTON DATELINE; STATE AND REGIONALLength: 477 wordsByline: ASHRAF KHALIL, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) — Zookeepers at Washington’s National Zoo are on furry black-and-white baby watch after concluding that venerable giant panda matriarch Mei Xiang is pregnant and could give birth this week. It’s a welcome bit of good news amid a pandemic that kept the zoo shuttered for months.“We need this! We totally need this joy,” said zoo spokeswoman Pamela Baker-Masson. “We are all in desperate need of these feel-goods.”Although so-called “phantom pregnancies” are common with pandas and other large bears, Baker-Masson said an ultrasound scan revealed a “really strong-looking, fantastic fetus” that could be delivered this week.“The image was great. She is absolutely pregnant. But things could still happen, just like in a human pregnancy,” Baker-Masson said.The zoo posted a video from the ultrasound on Instagram. “Keep your paws crossed!” the zoo posted, reporting that the fetus was “kicking and swimming in the amniotic fluid.”The announcement of the pregnancy has already touched off a fresh round of panda-mania for one of the zoo’s feature attractions. Viewership on the zoo’s panda-cam has increased 800%.The zoo reopened on a limited basis July 24, with restrictions in place to keep the crowds down. However, all indoor exhibits, including the extremely popular panda house, have remained closed. Visitors can still view the outdoor panda enclosure, but Mei has mostly been staying indoors, creating a nest out of branches. She can still be viewed on the panda cam.Panda births are inherently tricky, with stillbirths and miscarriages happening frequently. There is also a phenomenon called “resorption” whereby the fetus is unexpectedly absorbed back into the mother’s body. Baker-Masson said that is rare with a fetus this well-developed.Another potential complication is the age of the mother. Mei, at 22, would be the oldest giant panda to successfully give birth in the United States. The oldest in the world gave birth in China at age 23.“Reproductively speaking, she is an older bear,” Baker-Masson said. “But she has been a great mother in the past.”Mei Xiang has successfully given birth to three cubs: Tai Shan, Bao Bao and Bei Bei. All were transported to China at age 4, under terms of the zoo’s agreement with the Chinese government.Mei was impregnated via artificial insemination, a process which was heavily affected by precautions over the COVID-19 pandemic. The procedure was conducted shortly after the entire zoo shut down on March 14.Normally, zookeepers would have used a combination of stored frozen sperm and fresh semen extracted from male panda Tian Tian. In order to minimize the number of close-quarters medical procedures conducted, zoo staff decided to skip the extraction and inseminate Mei only with thawed out semen from 2016. If successful, it would be the first of its kind in the U.S. using only frozen sperm.Load-Date: August 18, 2020End of Document

'The whole world celebrates' on-camera birth of panda cubAssociated Press InternationalAugust 22, 2020 Saturday 5:06 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: WASHINGTON DATELINE; STATE AND REGIONALLength: 653 wordsByline: ASHRAF KHALIL, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) — A brand new giant panda cub is sparking pandemic-fueled panda-mania, and officials at the National Zoo said traffic on their livestream spiked 1,200% over the past week.“I'm pretty sure we broke the Internet last night,” National Zoo Director Steve Monfort said Saturday.The zoo's ever-popular Panda Cam traffic has been crashing since venerable matriarch Mei Xiang's pregnancy was announced this past week. When she actually gave birth Friday evening, zoo officials said they had a hard time getting into their own livestream, and they're now working to boost their capabilities.“Everybody is getting bumped off,” said Deputy Director Brandie Smith, a former curator of the zoo's giant pandas, who has overseen multiple births here. “When we have a giant panda baby, the whole world celebrates.”On camera, the actual moment of birth at around 6:35 p.m. is obscured, but the results become immediately obvious from the new cub's robust squealing. The massive mother immediately picks up and cradles the infant, which officials say is the size of a stick of butter.“We can tell the cub is doing well from its vocalizations and the mother's behavior,” Smith said. Zoo staff remain ready to intervene if something seems wrong, but Smith said Mei Xiang, who has reared three cubs to adulthood, “knows exactly what she is doing.”For now, zoo staff are letting the new pair share some private time. Mei Xiang will remain with her baby (gender still unknown) in a small indoor enclosure where she has built a modest nest. For about a week, the new mother will not leave the baby's side even to eat or drink. The cub, who will not be named for its first hundred days in accordance with tradition, will remain in the den for its first few months of life. For now it is pink and hairless; the distinctive black and white fur markings come later.Meanwhile father Tian Tian seems blissfully oblivious, rolling around his outdoor enclosure Saturday morning. Giant pandas are almost entirely solitary, and in the wild it would be normal for Tian Tian to never meet his offspring.“There's no real role for the male to play in the baby's care,” Monfort said. “He's probably more interested in what's for breakfast this morning.”Mei Xiang, was artificially inseminated in the spring shortly after the entire zoo shut down on March 14 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Normally they would have used a combination of frozen sperm and fresh semen extracted from Tian Tian. But in order to minimize the number of close-quarters medical procedures, zoo officials used only frozen semen.It was the first successful procedure of its kind in the U.S. using only frozen sperm and Mei Xiang, at 22, is the oldest giant panda to successfully give birth in the United States. The oldest in the world gave birth in China at age 23.Mei Xiang has three surviving offspring, Tai Shan, Bao Bao and Bei Bei, which were transported to China at age 4 under an agreement with the Chinese government.With the indoor section of the panda house closed due to COVID-19 restrictions, the panda cam is really the only way to view the newborn. The zoo reopened on a limited basis July 24 with visitors needing timed passes to keep the crowds down.For now, zoo officials are directing panda-maniacs to the live cam, and are expecting unprecedented interest from a global population sheltering under pandemic restrictions and desperate for a bit of good news.“Something like this is kind of a miracle for us,” Monfort said. “It lifts the spirits and of my team and the whole world.”Smith said it's also a fresh chance to direct those passions toward fundraising efforts that can help support global conservation initiatives.“Conservation only happens when people care, and people really care about giant pandas" she said.___Follow Khalil on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ashrafkhalil___Associated Press writer Carole Feldman contributed to this report.Load-Date: August 22, 2020End of Document

"They blur the lines between healthy debates and manipulation."The social media giant is stepping up efforts to counter misinformation operations and foreign interference in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election on November 3."We are attacking a part of the problem that poses a challenge to the whole of society. It is becoming increasingly clear that an organization cannot achieve this on its own," the executive said.Gleicher echoed the words of the group's head, Mark Zuckerberg, who has repeatedly asked political authorities to analyze the limits that must define what content and behavior may or may not be tolerable on digital platforms.Facebook pages for the campaign managed from Romania were followed by about 1,600 people, and Instagram accounts by about 7,200."We haven't found any evidence of your motivations, financial or otherwise," Gleicher said at a press conference."Maybe they were just creating an audience to monetize later."A separate campaign that was disrupted in July by Facebook was apparently targeted to China.The social network removed 303 Facebook accounts, 181 pages, 44 groups and 31 Instagram accounts for violation of its policies against "un authentic behavior coordinated on behalf of a foreign entity".The campaign was operated globally, from regions including North America, Europe, Australia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Indonesia, according to Facebook.Those behind the campaign published news and global events, including Hong Kong protests, U.S. policies toward China, the Falun Gong movement, and criticism of the Chinese government, Gleicher said."While the people behind this activity tried to hide their identities and coordination, our research linked this network to Truth Media, a digital media," Gleicher said, adding that Facebook had banned the media.Load-Date: August 7, 2020End of Document

However, it did not hesitate to circumvent key privacy protection in Google's Android operating system to collect unique identifiers from millions of mobile devices, the Wall Street Journal advanced Wednesday.A ploy that would have been hidden under an additional layer of encryption and that, if confirmed, would violate Google's policies that limit how apps can access data about their users, such as their location. This possible discovery comes at a time when ByteDance, TikTok's matrix, is under pressure to sell its U.S. operations before facing US President Donald Trump's ban last week alluding to national security grounds.Identifiers collected by TikTok, known as MAC addresses, are most commonly used for advertising purposes. The White House has said that it is concerned that user data could be obtained by the Chinese government and used to build detailed dossiers on many individuals.ByteDance, the parent of the above application, is currently in negotiations for the possible sale of its operations in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand to Microsoft. However, within the company led by Satya Nadella, a leaked memo to the press demonstrates opposition among the software manufacturer's employees to an acquisition they describe as "unethical" and that could call into question the integrity of the company. In an internal survey, 63% of a total of 250 workers responded against the operation. For its part, the South China Morning Post put the likelihood of a Microsoft purchase at just 20% while an acquisition by Twitter would be even less likely to occur. Meanwhile, as Bloomberg noted, Beijing is willing to include on the agenda the bans imposed on Tencent-owned TikTok and WeChat in the forthcoming Phase 1 review of the trade agreement that could be carried out as soon as this week. A controversial decision given that trade matters have so far been detached from other tensions, especially in the field of national security.During a press conference on Wednesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian stressed that China's position in the first phase of the trade agreement remains the same but recalled that TikTok "is just a platform that provides entertainment to Americans and people around the world" so "it has nothing to do with national security."Still, the fine print of the regulation that underre accepts the decrees signed by Trump on August 6th is still unknown. According to internal White House documents to which Reuters had access, prohibitions may include, for example, any kind of agreement to make TikTok available in app stores or the purchase of advertising spaces in that app. "Much of the impact and scope of these decrees remain unclear because they do not cite or can be framed within pre-existing economic policy tools, such as export controls and sanctions," explains Martin Chorzempa, an expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE). "Initially these bans do not resolve security issues related to data and privacy," he adds.commentsforum0WhatsAppFacebook  Twitter  Linkedin       Load-Date: August 13, 2020End of Document

Giant panda, Mei Xiang, becomes mother for the sixth time at age 22CE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 22, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 530 wordsBodyAlthough most of the world is experiencing complicated times due to the pandemic derived from coronavirus, there is still good news, as the Washington Zoo shared via Twitter that the giant panda, Mei Xiang, became a new mother, and also shared a video of the time of birth. The giant panda bear Mei Xiang, gave birth on Friday to a tender calf, which is considered a miracle by its caregivers due to its advanced age, since she is 22 years old.m{970676}The calf was born after more than three and a half hours of delivery at 18:35 local hours on Friday, days after it was confirmed that Mei Xiang was pregnant again.?????? Three cheers for giant panda Mei Xiang! She graced us with a glimpse of her wonderful, wiggly cub. It was born 6:35 p.m. Friday, Aug. 21. Watch along with us via the Panda Cam! ????????

The giant pandas of Washington, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, are ceded by the Chinese government and are the real attraction and symbol of the publicly owned capital zoo."Because Mei Xiang is of advanced maternal age, we knew that the chances of her having a baby were slim. However, we wanted to give it one more chance to contribute to the survival of your species," Steve Monfort said on behalf of the zoo.??????

This is Mei Xiang's sixth breed in Washington, although two died shortly after birth.Tai Shan, the first, was born in 2005; Bao Bao in 2013 and Bei Bei in 2015, the latter named by then-President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama.All three were transferred to China on the turn of four years in compliance with Beijing's giant panda exchange agreement with zoos around the world.????

TikTok Suit Trolls Trump, Dishes on CfiusThe Deal PipelineAugust 26, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 The Deal, L.L.C. All Rights ReservedLength: 584 wordsByline: by Chris NolterBodySocial media app TikTok Inc. and parent ByteDance Ltd. pushed back against actions by President Trump and provide color on the dispute with a suit in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. The plaintiffs accuse the White House of improperly using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act against the company as "a pretext for furthering the president s broader campaign of anti-China rhetoric in the run-up to the U.S. election," in pleadings filed Monday, Aug. 24. The suit, which asks the court to block an August executive order, says the White House has acted unconstitutionally and discusses efforts the app developer made to win over the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, the interagency committee that reviews cross-border mergers for national security purposes."On its face, the executive order fails to identify any unusual and extraordinary threat posed by TikTok or any actual national security threat at all," the lawsuit by Covington & Burling LLP Beth Brinkman, John Hall and others states.Based in Los Angeles, TikTok's U.S. division has 100 million subscribers, 50 million of which use the app daily, the lawsuit states. Globally, TikTok had nearly 690 million monthly active users as of July and passed its two-billionth download in August 2020.ByteDance, which has backing from SoftBank Group Corp., KKR & Co. Inc. (KKR), General Atlantic LLC and others, argues that Trump's orders do not cite evidence that the Chinese government tracks U.S. subscribers or that the app censors speech or provides disinformation.President Trump issued an Aug. 6 executive order that banned transactions with TikTok, citing national security concerns, and followed up on Aug. 14 with an order requiring the Beijing parent to sell the app. The lawsuit cites the first order, but includes Trump's commentary on a potential sale.Trump's violated the first amendment by banning the communications app, the suit alleges. Moreover, TikTok says the the administration also breached the fifth amendment by banning the app without due process and by "demanding that plaintiffs make a payment to the U.S. Treasury as a condition for the sale of TikTok."The company adds that Trump's orders ignore relevant information the company provided to Cfius."From the middle through the end of July 2020, ByteDance proposed various mitigation plans to the U.S. Treasury Department (which chairs Cfius), including spinning out TikTok s U.S. business to American investors and/or trusted U.S. technology partners that would be responsible for maintaining and operating TikTok in the United States," pleadings state.On July 30, the plaintiffs state that they told Cfius of a non-binding letter of intent with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) to purchase TikTok's U.S. business.While TikTok is known for viral music videos and visual gags, the plaintiffs state that users often "discuss more serious topics" such as politics on the app.Those posts are not likely to score points with the White House, however. The complaint cites videos by Sarah Cooper, a comedian who lampoons Trump by lip-synching videos of his speeches, and mentions that TikTok users used the app to make mass reservations for Tulsa, Okla., rally in July. Low turnout at the event embarrassed Trump.TikTok and ByteDance also cites verified prominent Democrats in its user base, such as Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, California Governor Gavin Newsom of California, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.DEAL SIZEUndisclosedLoad-Date: August 31, 2020End of Document

Microsoft has 45 days to buy Tik TokCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 4, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 226 wordsBodyIt's a light at the end of the tunnel for the approximately 100 million Tik Tok users in the United States. U.S.-based Microsoft will return to negotiations with China's ByteDance, which owns Tik Tok, to acquire the popular social network in the US. The talks come after the endorsement of President Donald Trump, who gave 45 days to the company founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen to reach an agreement. Microsoft has promised to complete the entire process by September."Microsoft will move quickly to continue discussions with TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in a matter of weeks, and in any case complete these talks no later than September 15, 2020," reads the statement issued by the U.S. company.After Trump announced that he intends to ban Tik Tok in the United States for national security reasons, the sale to Microsoft may be the last opportunity for the social network to continue operating in the country. The President believes that the popular video-sharing application, founded in 2012 by Zhang Yiming, causes several privacy problems, with the Chinese government able to collect data from U.S. citizens.In addition to the US, India and Australia also threatened to ban Tik Tok. The social network, in turn, has already made it known that the data of the North American users of TikTok is stored in the USA, with 'backup' in Singapore.Load-Date: August 5, 2020End of Document

This good news, however, is clouded by reports of an SEC investigation into iQIYI (IQ), a video-streaming service that BIDU holds a 56% ownership stake in.The investigation stems from allegations made by short selling firm Wolfpack Research, which claims that IQ has inflated numbers, including the number of users on IQ's platform. Whether the probe will lead to formal charges remains to be seen. Nonetheless, the assertion comes at a sensitive time as the U.S. government considers delisting Chinese companies that do not meet U.S. accounting standards.Rising tensions between the U.S. and China and persistent scrutiny over China's accounting practices are two significant factors negatively impacting sentiment for Chinese stocks. Today's news accentuates these concerns.More specific to BIDU, the investigation jeopardizes the company's strategy to diversify its revenue streams.Like Alphabet (GOOG), which recently reported that Q2 advertising revenue fell by 8%, BIDU's core business took a hit from the pandemic as corporations pull back on advertising spending. Increasing competition from emerging social media platforms, like Tencent's (TCEHY) WeChat, is also cutting into BIDU's market share.In order to enhance its competitive standing and boost margins, BIDU has invested in new platforms such as online gaming and iQIYI, which generated revenue growth of 4% in Q2. The growth may seem modest, but it far outpaces the 8% drop in BIDU's core online marketing services segment.Therefore, the possibility that IQ is inflating its growth potentially damages a key growth driver from BIDU, while also making the company more dependent on the slowing search advertising business.Adding to the concern is that BIDU's CEO Herman Yu commented during the conference call last night that the iQIYI probe might take longer-than-normal to resolve due to the pandemic. Therefore, investors shouldn't expect this overhang to be resolved anytime soon.The bottom line is that while BIDU managed to outperform Q2 expectations, the SEC investigation represents a growing risk to Chinese listed companies which are increasingly coming under the spotlight, and to BIDU's revenue-diversification strategy.10:27 ETApplied Materials really applied itself with a robust snap-back beat-and-raise:Applied Materials (AMAT +5%) really applied itself in its latest quarter, as demonstrated through its solid beat-and-raise report issued last night. The semi equipment giant stumbled a bit last quarter, but much of that quarter's issues were caused by pandemic-related supply constraints from facility closures at suppliers and customers. Adjusted EPS in Q3 (Jul) jumped 43% yr/yr to $1.06, amounting to a huge $0.11 beat. This was by far AMAT's largest beat in the past five years, and it was a good rebound from in-line results last quarter. Revenue also saw nice upside after a slight miss in Q2. Probably even more important in our eyes was the company's strong upside guidance for Q4 (Oct) for both EPS and revs. Not only is it great to see business booming, but as we said in our preview, a good tell in terms of AMAT's confidence in its outlook would be whether AMAT resumed providing guidance after not doing so last quarter. That AMAT feels comfortable providing guidance again is just as important as the numbers themselves. In terms of production bottlenecks, AMAT says that both its manufacturing operations and R&D labs are running smoothly at pre-COVID levels of productivity.So, what has made the chip space so strong amid a pandemic? AMAT says demand for semiconductors has strengthened in recent months as several major technology inflections have accelerated during the pandemic. Specifically, AMAT says work-from-home, homeschooling, and online retail are driving investments in cloud data centers and communications infrastructure. Plus, many companies are speeding up adoption of automation, AI, and IoT technologies.In wafer fab equipment, AMAT expects overall foundry/logic spending to grow this year, even with soft demand in specialty nodes that serve automotive and industrial markets. At the leading edge, AMAT sees a strong commitment from customers to build out fabs and aggressively drive R&D roadmaps, which gives AMAT confidence that these levels of spending will be sustainable into 2021 and beyond. On the memory side, AMAT expects investments to grow slightly faster than in foundry/logic.As we predicted in our preview, we thought there was a good chance AMAT would report a big snap-back quarter both because we expected the production issues to be solved and because so many chip companies (AMAT's customers) reported robust Q2 results. And it turned out this way in spades. Consumers are making dramatic shifts in the ways they live, work, and shop, and digital technologies (and the chips that power them) are adapting with them.

All rights reserved.This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.Length: 915 wordsBodyStory Stocks (R)Updated: 14-Aug-20Quotes at time of story, top stories today: 10:43 | 10:2710:43 ETBaidu's upside earnings report eclipsed by SEC investigation into iQIYI: After the close yesterday, Chinese internet search giant Baidu (BIDU) reported better-than-expected Q2 results, issued inline Q3 revenue guidance, and substantially increased its share repurchase authorization to $3 bln from $1 bln. This good news, however, is clouded by reports of an SEC investigation into iQIYI (IQ), a video-streaming service that BIDU holds a 56% ownership stake in.The investigation stems from allegations made by short selling firm Wolfpack Research, which claims that IQ has inflated numbers, including the number of users on IQ's platform. Whether the probe will lead to formal charges remains to be seen. Nonetheless, the assertion comes at a sensitive time as the U.S. government considers delisting Chinese companies that do not meet U.S. accounting standards.Rising tensions between the U.S. and China and persistent scrutiny over China's accounting practices are two significant factors negatively impacting sentiment for Chinese stocks. Today's news accentuates these concerns.More specific to BIDU, the investigation jeopardizes the company's strategy to diversify its revenue streams.Like Alphabet (GOOG), which recently reported that Q2 advertising revenue fell by 8%, BIDU's core business took a hit from the pandemic as corporations pull back on advertising spending. Increasing competition from emerging social media platforms, like Tencent's (TCEHY) WeChat, is also cutting into BIDU's market share.In order to enhance its competitive standing and boost margins, BIDU has invested in new platforms such as online gaming and iQIYI, which generated revenue growth of 4% in Q2. The growth may seem modest, but it far outpaces the 8% drop in BIDU's core online marketing services segment.Therefore, the possibility that IQ is inflating its growth potentially damages a key growth driver from BIDU, while also making the company more dependent on the slowing search advertising business.Adding to the concern is that BIDU's CEO Herman Yu commented during the conference call last night that the iQIYI probe might take longer-than-normal to resolve due to the pandemic. Therefore, investors shouldn't expect this overhang to be resolved anytime soon.The bottom line is that while BIDU managed to outperform Q2 expectations, the SEC investigation represents a growing risk to Chinese listed companies which are increasingly coming under the spotlight, and to BIDU's revenue-diversification strategy.10:27 ETApplied Materials really applied itself with a robust snap-back beat-and-raise:Applied Materials (AMAT +5%) really applied itself in its latest quarter, as demonstrated through its solid beat-and-raise report issued last night. The semi equipment giant stumbled a bit last quarter, but much of that quarter's issues were caused by pandemic-related supply constraints from facility closures at suppliers and customers. Adjusted EPS in Q3 (Jul) jumped 43% yr/yr to $1.06, amounting to a huge $0.11 beat. This was by far AMAT's largest beat in the past five years, and it was a good rebound from in-line results last quarter. Revenue also saw nice upside after a slight miss in Q2. Probably even more important in our eyes was the company's strong upside guidance for Q4 (Oct) for both EPS and revs. Not only is it great to see business booming, but as we said in our preview, a good tell in terms of AMAT's confidence in its outlook would be whether AMAT resumed providing guidance after not doing so last quarter. That AMAT feels comfortable providing guidance again is just as important as the numbers themselves. In terms of production bottlenecks, AMAT says that both its manufacturing operations and R&D labs are running smoothly at pre-COVID levels of productivity.So, what has made the chip space so strong amid a pandemic?

Alibaba exceeds estimates as pandemic boosts demand for cloud computingCE Noticias Financieras EnglishAugust 20, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 291 wordsBody20 Ago (Reuters) - Chinese retailer Alibaba Group Holding Ltd on Thursday surpassed quarterly revenue and profit estimates, as its key cloud trading and computing businesses continued to grow after the Asian giant's exit from coronavirus confinement.Sales of the trading business increased by 34% to 133,320 million yuan ($19.27 billion) in the quarter ending in June, a slowest advance than the previous year but enough to boost its actions after results.Alibaba's shares have skyrocketed 23% this year, as investors around the world have invested in technology companies, considered winners in the pandemic, and the company said it had recovered from the impact on Chinese consumer spending earlier this year."Our core trading business nationwide has fully recovered to pre-COVID-19 levels across the board, while cloud computing revenue grew by 59% in the year," the company's CFO, Maggie Wu, said in a statement.Alibaba is one of the multi-nations that President Donald Trump would be targeting if further action is taken against China's companies, following restrictions on TikTok and WeChat."Today we face uncertainties not only because of the pandemic but also because of the escalating tensions between the United States and China," said Alibaba's executive chairman Daniel Zhang. "We are closely following the latest change in U.S. government policies toward Chinese companies."Alibaba's net income attributable to ordinary shareholders more than doubled from 21.25 billion yuan to 47.590 million yuan. Revenues, meanwhile, were 153.750 million yuan versus a forecast of 147.770 million yuan.(1 dollar x 6,9189 yuan) (Report of Nilanjana Basu and Akanksha Rana in Bengaluru and Josh Horwitz in Shanghai.

State Dept.: Russia pushes disinformation in online networkAssociated Press InternationalAugust 5, 2020 Wednesday 11:23 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICAL NEWSLength: 784 wordsByline: AMANDA SEITZ, Associated PressDateline: CHICAGO BodyCHICAGO (AP) — The State Department says Russia is using a well-developed online operation that includes a loose collection of proxy websites to stir up confusion around the coronavirus by amplifying conspiracy theories and misinformation.The disclosure on Wednesday was rare for the Trump administration, which has been cautious about blaming the Kremlin for disinformation campaigns, especially around the U.S. election. Despite evidence that Russia launched a divisive disinformation operation on social media during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the State Department’s report did not examine how — if at all — Russia is waging another online influence campaign in this year’s election.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did, however, announce Wednesday that the U.S. would offer a reward of up to $10 million for information that identifies people working with foreign governments to interfere in the U.S. election through illegal cyber activity.The department detailed a Russian-backed misinformation cycle that spreads false information online through state officials and state-funded media reports, by infiltrating U.S. social media conversation, and leveraging a deceptive internet framework of websites. The Kremlin’s efforts have most recently focused on conspiracy theories around the pandemic, the report found.“Russia is playing a significant role in creating and spreading misinformation and propaganda around many topics,” said Lea Gabrielle, head of the State Department’s Global Engagement Center.The department named more than a half-dozen websites that, serving as “proxies” for Russia, have peddled a series of conspiracy theories about the pandemic that have been widely spreading and hotly debated across social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.The online news outlets appear independent from the Russian government, but in reality serve as a “connective tissue” between the Kremlin and state-funded media that often promote the same misinformation from their own channels, Gabrielle said.“That’s what makes them effective,” Gabrielle said. “It’s difficult for the average person online to look at these sites and know the Russian affiliation.”Russia has regularly denied claims from the U.S. that it is behind online disinformation campaigns, last week calling similar assertions “persistent phobia.”The websites the State Department identified Wednesday have promoted unsupported conspiracy theories that allege COVID-19 was created in a lab as a bioweapon, billionaire Bill Gates is plotting to use the pandemic as an excuse to microchip people, and that plans for a coronavirus vaccine are simply a ploy for pharmaceutical companies to make money. There is no evidence behind those claims.The origin of the novel coronavirus remains unknown, but the emerging scientific consensus is that humans were first infected in China, at a Wuhan animal market. Around the globe, leaders are investing in a vaccine as the best bet to beat the virus. And Gates has repeatedly rejected that he wants to start tracking people.“Russia has a long history of spreading disinformation around health and science issues,” Gabrielle said. “The Russian disinformation ecosystem exploits fear and confusion.”While building up a following on Facebook and Twitter, some of the websites have downplayed their ties to Russian intelligence or concealed funding from the Kremlin, the State Department’s report found.One of the sites, Canadian-based Global Research, has amassed an audience of nearly 300,000 followers on Facebook. The website regularly publishes articles from fictitious personas created by Russia’s military intelligence service, the GRU. The headline of a recent Global Research article suggested the coronavirus originated in the U.S., and it was shared by a Chinese spokesman on Twitter before the website took the unsubstantiated claim down.Chinese, Iran and Russian government leaders have regularly echoed one another on social media and in state media reports.Another website, NewsFront, pitches itself as an “alternative” news source to Western audiences, despite its reported Kremlin funding and being registered with the Russian government, according to the State Department's report. Facebook removed dozens of accounts and pages associated with NewsFront for inauthentic, coordinated behavior in April.Most of the other websites are far more fringe, with only small social media followings and articles pushing coronavirus conspiracy theories that have only been shared by the dozens.Last week, U.S. officials told The Associated Press that Russian intelligence are using another trio of English-language websites to push disinformation about the pandemic.Load-Date: August 5, 2020End of Document

The week in investor relations: Ant Group reveals listing plans and Storebrand kicks out anti-climate action lobbyistsirmagazine.comAugust 28, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 IR Media Group, LTD All Rights ReservedSection: TECHNOLOGY & SOCIAL MEDIALength: 612 wordsByline: Garnet RoachBody- Ant Group, the mobile payments company owned by Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba, announced plans to float on the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges, in what could become the world's largest IPO. The Guardian reported that the firm could raise as much as $30 bn in the flotation, topping the $25.6 bn raised by Saudi Aramco's IPO in December 2019. Though no details were given, the newspaper said it has been suggested the flotation could be in October, and that up to 15 percent of a $200 bn-$300 bn valuation for the firm would be sought.- In other Jack Ma news, Taiwan targeted Alibaba in a crackdown on 'hidden' Chinese investments, reported Forbes, as part of Taiwan's new regulation aimed at tightening controls around Chinese investments. Taiwan's government has ordered e-commerce service Taobao Taiwan - operated by UK-based Claddagh Venture Investment, but ultimately controlled by Alibaba, according to officials in Taiwan - to register as a company from mainland China or divest an ownership stake currently held by Alibaba Group within six months.- Storebrand, the $91 bn asset manager, has divested from ExxonMobil, Chevron and miner Rio Tinto in protest over their lobbying on climate change, reported the Financial Times (paywall). 'Climate change is one the greatest risks facing humanity and lobbying activities [that] undermine action to solve this crisis are simply unacceptable,' the paper reported Jan Erik Saugestad, chief executive of Storebrand, as saying. 'The Exxons and Chevrons of the world are holding us back.' Storebrand also dumped Southern Company, the US energy provider, and German chemicals group BASF.- The Wall Street Journal (paywall) reported that, according to data provider MyLogIQ, 87 percent of companies in the S&P 500 opted for a virtual AGM this year compared with 23 percent of meetings held remotely in 2019. Companies are finding virtual AGMs to be cheaper and less time-consuming, but some shareholders complain they don't get as much time to ask their questions. Remote investor events held by companies in the S&P 500 this year ran for an average of 32 minutes, seven minutes shorter than in-person shareholder meetings in 2019, according to a recent study of more than 90 annual meetings by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Executives allocated less time for business updates and for answering shareholders' questions compared with in-person meetings in 2019, the study noted.- TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer announced his departure just three months into the job, saying that 'in recent weeks, the political environment has sharply changed.' Citing sources, CNBC reported that the announcement indicates that a deal, likely a sale to Microsoft, could come in the next 48 hours.
