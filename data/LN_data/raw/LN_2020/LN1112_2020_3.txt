Apple welcomes first developers to App Store Small Business ProgramStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeDecember 25, 2020 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 531 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyTrade tensions between the United States and China have had a big impact.A new report indicates Apple continues to bow to its Chinese overlords in 2020, as the Chinese government ordered the Cupertino firm to remove almost 100,000 games from its App Store in the country in 2020. It's not clear whether these games were removed by the developers or by Apple, but Sensor Tower notes that 80% of those apps had less than 10,000 downloads in China since January 1, 2012. The Cyberspace Administration of China called the apps illegal without spelling out the offenses Tripadvisor or the other apps, most of which are from Chinese developers, had committed.Apple today announced an industry-leading new developer program to accelerate innovation and help small businesses and independent developers propel their businesses forward with the next generation of groundbreaking apps on the App Store. It is facing accusations by rivals of anticompetitive behavior - which Apple has disputed - and regulatory scrutiny in the US and Europe. TTP independently verified Great Fire's raw data and determined that 964 of the 3,257 apps identified as missing from the China App Store relate to politically sensitive topics of religion, LGBTQ issues, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet, secure communications, cryptocurrencies, VPNs, social media platforms, and foreign media. Another large chunk were games. "This veil of secrecy around why they're removing this information is what makes it even more concerning". While waiting for the approval Apple was allowing developers to submit and publish their apps while their application for this number was pending.Tier 4 mapped: All the areas now in Tier 4This new variant is believed to transmit much more easily, although there is now no evidence that it makes people more unwell. He said that there were nearly as many people in hospital now as there were at the peak of the spring outbreak.Apple explained again to WSJ that he had to respect the rules of each country, which sometimes means withdrawing certain applications."Apple studies these requests carefully whenever we receive them, and we contest and disagree with them often", an Apple spokesperson said. The commission rate on your paid apps and in-app purchases will be 15% by January 1, 2021, so you can invest more resources into your business to continue building quality apps that customers love.Apple said the map app violated guidelines and local laws, and Mr. Cook defended the company's actions in a memo to staff, noting the difficulties involved. In fact, we can expect more deletions in the coming weeks. "We believe this decision best protects our users". Although the company claims that the majority of apps removals in the Chinese market were related to apps deemed illegal under Chinese law, including porn and gambling apps, a review by TTP found that almost a third of all apps missing from the China App Store relate to hot button topics blocked by China's censors, including privacy tools, Tibetan Buddhism, Falun Gong, and the Hong Kong protests. Of the 96 countries included in Apple transparency reports, 10 other governments requested app removals-none to the extent of China.Load-Date: December 26, 2020End of Document

Huawei selling Honor phone brand in face of US sanctionsAssociated Press InternationalNovember 17, 2020 Tuesday 5:50 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 893 wordsByline: JOE McDONALD and ZEN SOO, AP Business WritersDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) — Chinese tech giant Huawei is selling its budget-price Honor smartphone brand in an effort to rescue the struggling business from damaging U.S. sanctions imposed on its parent company.The sale announced Tuesday is aimed at reviving Honor by separating it from Huawei’s network equipment business, which Washington says is a security threat, an accusation Huawei denies. It is under sanctions that block access to most U.S. processor chips and other technology.Huawei Technologies Ltd.’s announcement gave no financial details but said the company will have no ownership stake once the sale is completed. Huawei will retain its flagship Huawei smartphone brand.The buyer is a state-owned company in Shenzhen, the southern city where Huawei is headquartered, and a group of Honor retailers. Earlier news reports on rumors of a possible sale put the price as high as 100 billion yuan ($15 billion).“The move has been made by Honor’s industry chain to ensure its own survival,” said the Huawei statement. The buyers said in a separate statement the split was “the best solution” to protect customers and employees.Huawei, China’s first global tech brand and the biggest maker of switching equipment used by phone and internet companies, is at the center of U.S.-Chinese tension over technology, security and spying. The feud has spread to include the popular Chinese-owned video app TikTok and messaging service WeChat.Economists and political analysts expect little change in U.S. policy toward China under President-elect Joe Biden due to widespread frustration with Beijing over trade and technology.Huawei appears to be preparing for hard times by focusing its resources on its high-end smartphones, said Nicole Peng of Canalys.The sale is “definitely a sign of weakness,” said Nicole Peng of Canalys."It shows Huawei knows that the situation will not change immediately between China and the U.S.,” Peng said.Tuesday’s announcements gave no indication how Honor planned to regain access to U.S. chips and other technology including Google’s popular music, maps and other services. Other Chinese smartphone brands such as Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo operate without such restrictions.“In theory, Honor would be like any other Chinese OEM (manufacturer),” said Kiranjeet Kaur of IDC in an email. However, he said Honor needs time to restore access to suppliers and set up its own research and development.“The challenge remains how quickly it detaches itself from its dependence on Huawei and gets access to all the relevant tech,” said Kaur.U.S. security complaints focus on Huawei’s network gear and leading role in next-generation telecom technology.American officials say Huawei might facilitate Chinese spying, which the company denies. They also see Chinese government-supported technology development as a threat to U.S. industrial dominance. The Trump administration is lobbying European and other allies to exclude Huawei and other Chinese suppliers as they upgrade networks.Meanwhile, Huawei’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of company founder Ren Zhengfei, is under arrest in Canada and fighting extradition to the United States to face charges related to possible violations of trade sanctions on Iran.Sanctions imposed last year block Huawei’s access to most U.S. processor chips and other technology. Those were tightened in May when the White House barred manufacturers worldwide from using U.S. technology to produce chips for Huawei, including those designed by its own engineers.The buyer is Shenzhen Zhixin New Information Technology Co. It was founded by Shenzhen Smart City Technology Development Group Co., which was formed by the city government to develop information technology infrastructure.The Smart City company owns 98.6% of Zhixin, according to Aiqicha, a financial information service of search engine Baidu, Inc. The buyers' statement said the rest of the 40-member investment group includes Honor retailers.Honor, founded in 2013, is one of the world’s biggest-selling smartphone brands. Huawei says it ships 70 million handsets a year.Total shipments of Huawei and Honor handsets fell 5% from a year earlier in the quarter ending in June to 55.8 million, according to Canalys. Sales in China rose 8% but shipments abroad fell 27%.Huawei reported earlier total revenue for the first nine months of 2020 rose 9.9% to 671.3 billion yuan ($100.4 billion). That was down from 13.1% growth in the first half, but the company said it still was profitable.Huawei’s smartphone sales outside China have suffered because the company is barred from preinstalling Google services, which many customers expect. Huawei is allowed to use Google’s Android operating system because it is open source and involves no commercial transaction with the American company.Huawei says it has removed U.S. components from its core products, but the president of its consumer unit, Richard Yu, warned in August the company was running out of chips for smartphones.Honor might be able to line up suppliers before a new U.S. administration is formed, said Peng of Canalys. She said Honor is less likely to prompt security concerns because it will be smaller than Huawei and have no role in next-generation infrastructure.“It's much less likely to become a target of the U.S. government,” she said.___Soo reported from Hong KongLoad-Date: November 17, 2020End of Document

Guedes receives Huawei executive and remaining government avoids largest manufacturer of 5GCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 20, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 811 wordsBodyThe Minister of Economy, Paulo Guedes, was the only one to receive, on Friday (20), the global vice president of Government Relations huawei, Mark Xueman. In Brasilia throughout this week, Xueman was not served by the Office of Institutional Security of the Presidency of the Republic, the main center of resistance against the Chinese manufacturer in the government.The company also failed to schedule talks with the Vice President of the Republic, Hamilton Mourão, nor with the Minister of Communications, Fábio Faria. Guedes was the only one willing to meet Xueman, Huawei's global executive responsible for contacts with the governments of more than 170 countries in which the telecommunications equipment manufacturer operates.The target of a dispute between the U.S. and China, the company has been banned from the process of installing 5G networks by some countries under pressure from the U.S. government.The Chinese manufacturer is the one that offers the best conditions for operators in relation to the quality of the equipment and its price. By this combination, it won the largest number of contracts in the world and became the main supplier of 5G.In recent weeks, the issue has become taboo in government. Even the teles complain that there is no more dialogue with representatives of the Ministry of Communications and the Planalto Palace about huawei's possible ban.According to the operators, Minister Fábio Faria never says what he thinks about the subject. You always go out with evasive people saying the ministry is studying.The technicians of the folder, however, claim that the last word will be given by President Jair Bolsonaro, regardless of the technical evaluation contrary to the restrictions.The teles have already warned ministers Paulo Guedes and Fábio Faria that the auction will become unfeasible if Huawei is banned.They want the government to clarify how they will be compensated if they have to exchange all Huawei 4G and 3G equipment that already works on their networks for those of other manufacturers.That's because this installed device doesn't talk to other manufacturers' 5G equipment. In an interview with Folha,Huawei's president in Brazil, Sun Baocheng, confirmed this situation and said that if carried out, the restriction on the company could delay the installation of 5G in the country by up to four years.In the virtual meeting with Guedes, Xueman detailed this problem and stressed that Huawei is a signatory to several international agreements that require it to follow cybersecurity and data protection standards.According to people who followed the conversation, Guedes went to file. He said he expects competition in the installation of the new technology and that his portfolio collaborates with the government with regard to technical requirements.The minister made it clear that the decision on a possible ban will be up to President Bolsonaro.The Huawei executive made a point of reinforcing a speech that the company began to adopt more frequently since Bolsonaro's speech at the opening of the UN (United Nations) meeting.In his speech, Bolsonaro highlighted at the time that the 5G will be launched in the country with companies that ensure data security.U.S. government representatives have been lobbying the various countries where this technology is being implemented to raise suspicions about the data protection quality of Huawei equipment.In Brazil, the U.S. ambassador has been with Bolsonaro and the Minister of the Office of Institutional Security, General Augusto Heleno.Behind the scenes, the U.S. signals that several military cooperation agreements could be compromised if Brazil does not bar Huawei in 5G.Still without a practical result next to theBrazilian government, U.S. diplomacy has tried to get closer to the telephone operators, who will participate in the auction of 5G licenses, scheduled for the first half of 2021, and will buy the network equipment to start the commercial operation of the new technology.Through Conexis, an association representing the industry, operators refused to participate in the meeting with the U.S. ambassador.The companies are looking for a way to avoid a ban on Huawei as more than half of the current networks in operation are Chinese handsets.Sought, Huawei sent a statement highlighting its performance for 22 years in Brazil in partnership with operators, internet providers, industry verticals, governments and educational institutions."We follow the highest international cybersecurity standards in the more than 170 countries where we operate, respect and comply with local laws. We have already conducted 5G tests with all national operators, contributing to the arrival of technology in the country. We hope that all decisions on the subject will be made in a strictly technical, non-discriminatory manner and in favour of the free market."Load-Date: November 22, 2020End of Document

Senate Homeland Security Subcommittee Issues Testimony From American Hospital AssociationTargeted News ServiceDecember 3, 2020 Thursday 9:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4723 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Federal Spending Oversight and Emergency Management issued the following testimony by John Riggi, senior advisor for cybersecurity and risk at the American Hospital Association, as part of a video conference hearing entitled "State and Local Cybersecurity: Defending Our Communities From Cyber Threats Amid COVID-19" on Dec. 2:My name is John Riggi and I am the Senior Advisor for Cybersecurity and Risk at the American Hospital Association (AHA).On behalf of our nearly 5,000 member hospitals, health systems and other health care organizations, our clinician partners - including more than 270,000 affiliated physicians, 2 million nurses and other caregivers - and the 43,000 health care leaders who belong to our professional membership groups, the AHA thanks the Subcommittee for the opportunity to testify on, and your interest in, the important issue of cybersecurity threats faced by hospitals, health systems and the health care provider field. Now more than ever, we all realize how vital hospitals are to the nation's critical infrastructure and how important they are to our communities' health and safety.Today, within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, I will discuss increased incidences of cyber threats toward hospitals and health systems, the resulting, unique challenges confronting the health care sector, and what the federal government can and must do to help ensure appropriate mechanisms are in place to share threat information and defend the nation's hospitals and health systems from cyber attacks.The AHA has a unique national perspective on these issues, stemming from communications with thousands of trusted hospital leaders across our field and robust interaction with federal agencies. We are privileged to serve as an effective platform to facilitate communication and cooperation between the government and health care in our common interest to defend the field and the nation against cyber attacks. We also welcome the opportunity to inform the work of this committee in this capacity and stand ready to assist as needed.Hospitals and health systems appreciate the recent efforts by federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), National Security Agency (NSA) and United States Secret Service (USSS) to disseminate cyber threat intelligence and respond to cyber attacks targeting health care during this pandemic.The most recent national threat advisory of imminent ransomware attacks targeting hospitals, issued on Oct. 28, 2020, by CISA, FBI and HHS1, was a good example of timely and actionable intelligence being shared by the government in a coordinated effort across agencies.THREATS TO HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMSUnfortunately, the aforementioned alert, CISA AA20-302A, is also a good example of the tremendously increased cyber risk faced by hospitals emanating from foreign cyber criminals and spies seeking to take advantage of hospitals that labor under the strain of caring for COVID-19 patients. The alert stated that "CISA, FBI, and HHS have credible information of an increased and imminent cybercrime threat to U.S. hospitals and healthcare providers," which remain ongoing as of this date. This threat is very telling as to the nature of the cyber adversaries we face. The adversaries seek to exploit the global pandemic for financial gain, aware that ransomware attacks on hospitals disrupt patient care services and risk patient safety.This ongoing threat is the most significant and widespread cyber threat to face hospitals since the global WannaCry ransomware attacks in 2017 perpetrated by the North Korean government./2Hospitals, and the overall health care sector, have long been heavily targeted by cyber adversaries due to the various critical data sets in their possession that cyber criminals can easily monetize. Yet, during the pandemic, we have witnessed an increase in the frequency, severity and sophistication of cyber attacks on hospitals and health systems. The pandemic, therefore, has led to a cyber "triple threat" for hospitals and health systems: an expanded attack surface; increased cyber attacks of all types; and fewer available resources to bolster cybersecurity defenses.Expanded "Attack Surface"In preparation for and response to COVID-19, the health care sector rapidly deployed and expanded network- and internet-connected technologies and services to a scale never experienced in health care.For example, technologies for telehealth, telemedicine, telework and cloud based services were quickly adopted and expanded due to clinical and operational necessity at the encouragement of federal and state governments. Many hospitals and health systems have also expanded, within care units, remote monitoring of ventilators and other medical devices. These actions were taken to improve efficiency and to preserve precious personal protective equipment (PPE) in departments whose focus is on caring for COVID-19 patients.The expansion of network-connected technologies and health devices has resulted in an exponential expansion of network access points. For cyber criminals, this has translated into a greatly expanded "attack surface." In other words, there are now many more opportunities to exploit technical vulnerabilities and penetrate hospital networks. Telehealth has emerged as a lifeline for many patients during the pandemic and is one that must be sustained. Such patients rely on the access provided through telehealth; cybersecurity is, at its core, a necessary element of patient safety for hospitals and health systems.Increased Cyber AttacksCyber adversaries have launched relentless attacks on hospitals and health systems. Hacking incidents of all types targeting hospitals and health systems increased significantly throughout 2020. According to data from the HHS Office of Civil Rights (OCR) Breach Portal on 11/27/20/3 for the three month period between Sept. 1 and Nov. 27 of this year, there were 162 active and resolved hacking incidents affecting 12.6 million individuals. Comparatively, there were 218 active and resolved hacking incidents for the eight-month period between Jan. 1 and Aug. 31, affecting 7.3 million individuals.At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a dramatic increase in phishing email campaigns directed toward the health care sector and the general public. Social engineering techniques, such as COVID-19-themed phishing emails containing malware and links to malicious sites, increased by nearly 700%/4 worldwide by some accounts. Such emails are sent under the guise of providing important COVID-19 information. They make fake promises; one example might offer for sale equipment made scarce by the public health emergency, such as N95 masks and lifesaving ventilators. Instead these emails are laden with malware and malicious links.Phishing remains the primary method to introduce malware and ransomware into hospitals, requiring dedicated, diligent hospital staff to monitor and educate workforces that are already strained due to the pandemic. Phishing emails are used by criminals not only to launch cyber attacks, but to also perpetrate fraud and steal funds, again using COVID-19 as their entry point. For example, it is common for hospitals and health systems to receive emails promising to supply scarce PPE in exchange for a down payment; they later discover that the PPE was counterfeit and of inferior quality, or perhaps never existed.Foreign-based cyber criminals have taken advantage of the pandemic to steal data and threaten patient care. According to U.S. government alerts, highly sophisticated foreign intelligence services and military units from China, Russia and Iran have launched cyber campaigns targeting health care to steal COVID-19-related research, such as treatment protocols and vaccine data. In a disturbing trend, hostile foreign intelligence services are working in conjunction with cyber criminals (whose hacking capabilities and access are most useful to them) to target a wide scope of networks, including those related to health care.As evidence of this phenomena, on Sept. 16, 2020 the Department of Justice (DOJ) stated in regard to the indictment of two Iranian hackers, "Unfortunately, our cases demonstrate that at least four nations -- Iran, China, Russia and North Korea -- will allow criminal hackers to victimize individuals and companies from around the world, as long as these hackers will also work for that country's government..."/5In another example from Sept. 16, DOJ stated that, "the Chinese government tolerated the defendants' criminal activity because those defendants were willing to work on behalf of the Chinese intelligence services."/6Data breaches through businesses associated with hospitals and health systems, including third-party vendors storing sensitive patient information, also continue to be a problem. According to the HHS Office of Civil Rights (OCR), this continues to be a significant factor in large data breaches impacting millions of patients.Ransomware attacks are a considerable concern, especially for a hospital overloaded by caring for COVID-19 patients. Such an attack could interrupt patient care, or worse, shut down operations at the facility, thereby putting patient lives, and the community, at risk. This is what happened this past March 12 to Brno University Hospital in the Czech Republic. The hospital, which is among the Czech Republic's largest coronavirus testing centers, was forced to redirect patients to other hospitals. At the same time, another facility in the city of Brno, the Children's and Maternity Hospital, was also hit. There have been recent domestic examples of ransomware attacks on hospitals and health systems which result in the interruption patient-care services. Ransomware attacks on hospitals can result in the cancelation of routine appointments and surgeries, delays in treatment, denied access to electronic medical records at critical moments - including drug allergy information - and the diversion of ambulances carrying trauma patients to emergency departments that may be further away.Resource ConstraintsThe third threat hospitals and health systems are experiencing are the human, financial and technical cybersecurity resource constraints due to reduced hospital revenue. The AHA released a report in June which estimated total losses for the nation's hospitals and health systems to be at least $323.1 billion in 2020. Reduced revenue due to canceled elective surgeries and patients' reluctance to seek non-COVID-19-related medical treatment during the pandemic has significantly decreased hospitals' and health systems' financial resources, leaving limited funds available to enhance network defenses and to recruit and retain cybersecurity professionals. Hospitals' cybersecurity workforce issues are exacerbated by the fact that there is already a shortage of professionals capable of meeting the demand for cybersecurity talent across all industries and government; furthermore, the health care field often has more limited budgets for these personnel than other sectors of the economy.In summary, hospitals and health systems face a perfect storm of factors leading to expanded cyber threats and risks- an expanded attack surface, increased frequency of cyber attacks of all types and constrained resources available to bolster cybersecurity defenses. Ultimately, the issues we are discussing today are key factors for patient safety and patient access.EXPAND PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS AND CROSS-INDUSTRY EFFORTSAn increase in classified and unclassified threat information sharing through appropriate channels is an important step toward helping hospitals and health systems defend themselves. Although DHS, CISA, the FBI, HHS and the U.S. Secret Service have done a commendable job in sharing threat information with the health care field and producing timely and high quality joint intelligence products, more needs to be done.Threat information must be coordinated among the various agencies, centralized, disseminated consistently and made available in both narrative and automated fashion. Further, it must be free - entirely absent of fees paid to any cyber threat information-sharing entity. It is especially important that technical indicators of compromise (IOCs), which are the lengthy and voluminous technical malware signature codes, be automated and made readily accessible to all trusted health care entities. This was the intent of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015.Timely dissemination of threat intelligence in an automated fashion and other joint efforts can play an important role in derailing cyber attacks; it can also help organizations recover and resume operations more quickly in the event of an attack's success. Both of those outcomes reduce the financial incentive for cyber criminals to carry out ransomware attacks.The AHA, along with the Healthcare-Information Sharing and Analysis Center (H-ISAC), the Health Care Sector Coordinating Council (HSCC) and the HHS-sponsored Health Care Industry Cyber Security Task Force, has urged more public-private partnerships to improve cyber security in a "whole of nation" approach to defend against cyber threats.In the realm of cyber defense there is no competitive advantage between organizations, especially in health care. All face the same threats and, thus, the same potential consequences. As a result, all have the same incentive to freely exchange threat information for the common defense as well as for the defense of public health and safety.UNIQUE CHALLENGES FOR THE HEALTH CARE SECTORHealth care is the only economic sector that possesses a combination of highly targeted data sets such as personally identifiable information, payment information, protected health information, business intelligence, intellectual property related to medical research and innovation - including genomic studies related to the development of precision medicine - and, as a critical infrastructure sector, national security information related to emergency preparedness and response in times of national crisis or war.Each one of these data sets is heavily targeted by cyber adversaries. Individually, these data sets are highly valuable to the cyber adversary; together, they become exponentially valuable.Also, health care records continue to command a premium price on the dark web because they have enduring value to cyber adversaries. In other words, unlike credit card numbers, one cannot cancel their blood type or a medical diagnosis. Stolen health care records may be the source of repeated health care fraud, used to fund more serious crime, including violent crimes by foreign gangs or be exploited on an ongoing basis for intelligence purposes by a nation-state.VICTIMS OF CYBER ATTACKS SHOULD BE PROVIDED ASSISTANCE, NOT ASSIGNED BLAMEDespite complying with rules and implementing best practices, hospitals and health care providers will continue to be the targets of sophisticated attacks, some of which will inevitably succeed. The government often repeats the phrase, "It's not a matter of if, but when," in regard to an organization becoming a victim of a cyber attack. Organizations that are victims of breaches should be treated as victims of crime, an approach that has been codified in Presidential Policy Directive/PPD-41: United States Cyber Incident Coordination.Unfortunately, the federal government's approach toward victims of cyber attacks is sometimes inconsistent across agencies and often counterproductive.For example, federal law enforcement agencies often request and need the cooperation of victims of breaches to further their investigations and disrupt the threat to the nation. Simultaneously, a hospital or health system may be the subject of an onerous and adversarial investigation by the HHS Office of Civil Rights; this can be disruptive and have a chilling effect in regard to the government's interest and efforts to obtain victims' cooperation with federal law enforcement.The victims of attacks should be given support and resources; attackers are the ones who should be vigorously investigated and prosecuted. Even if an organization were the victim of a cyberattack, it does not mean that the organization itself was in any way at fault or unprepared. Similarly, a breach does not necessarily equate to a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule compliance failure. Instead, successful attacks should be fully investigated, and the lessons learned should be widely disseminated to prevent the success of similar attacks in the future. President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, Public Law 114-113, which included the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA). Recognizing the seriousness of the cyber threat facing the nation and the private sector, Congress established through CISA a voluntary cybersecurity information sharing process that encourages public and private sector entities to share cyber threat indicators and defensive measures while protecting privacy and civil liberties./7To encourage this sharing, CISA includes certain safe harbor protections from civil, regulatory and anti-trust liability for sharing conducted in accordance with CISA.Since the passage of CISA, the cyber threats against health care and the nation have increased significantly. Every hospital and health system in America places utmost importance on protecting the security and privacy of the patient data. However, as the government publicly acknowledges, no organization is or can be completely immune from cyber attacks. Regardless of the amount of human, technical and financial resources devoted to cybersecurity by any organization, cyber risk to the organization can be mitigated, but never eliminated.We recommend that, given the increased cyber threat environment and attacks specifically targeting hospitals and health systems, along with resource constraints imposed upon hospitals and health systems in response to COVID-19, additional safe harbor protections from civil and regulatory liability be provided to hospital and health system victims of cyber attacks. We welcome the opportunity to explore this possibility with the committee.DEFEND FORWARDA ransomware attack on a hospital crosses the line from an economic crime to a threat-to-life crime; such attacks should therefore be aggressively pursued and prosecuted as such by the federal government. We use the term "prosecuted" in all senses of the definition related to the government's capabilities and authorities, which include and extend beyond the government's law enforcement authorities found under United States Code (USC) Title 18.This situation is analogous to the attacks on our nation on Sept. 11, 2001. In the aftermath of those attacks, all of the government's capabilities were brought to bear to detect, deter and disrupt terrorist organizations - including those operating outside of U.S. borders that were beyond the reach of the FBI. In its whole-of-government approach, the U.S. leveraged its military authorities under USC Title 10 and its intelligence authorities under USC Title 50 to protect the homeland from foreign threats operating from safe harbors provided by hostile nation states and non-cooperative foreign jurisdictions.The laws typically used to prosecute cyber crimes are not commensurate with the level of harm cyber attacks on hospitals can cause. For example, USC Title 18 Sec.1030 is the Computer Fraud and Abuse statute that is used to prosecute hacking activity and other crimes related to computers. It carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. But, due to sentencing guidelines related to this statute, sentences meted out are often far less than 20 years. This is not a strong enough deterrent for an international ransomware criminal who could be reaping millions of dollars in illegal profits along with a low probability of being apprehended.We do not need more laws to improve legal deterrence for cyber crimes against hospitals. Rather, we should make better use of the laws and other law enforcement tools that are already available.For example, USC T18 Sec.1030 is most appropriate for prosecuting some ransomware attacks, but can be made more powerful when combined with, or replaced with, alternate prosecution strategies, which include other federal statutes covering Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organizations, money laundering, commercial extortion, homicide and even terrorism. These additional crimes carry far more serious penalties that are more consistent with the threat-to-life element presented by disruptive cyber attacks against hospitals.The U.S. response to cyber attacks against health care infrastructure should expand beyond heavy reliance on USC Title 18 for criminal investigation and prosecution. The authorities provided under USC Titles 10, 31 and 50 should all be invoked as necessary to provide more effective and robust options to deter and disrupt foreign-based adversaries that attack U.S. hospitals and health systems.Title 31 allows the Treasury Department, through the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), to put financial sanctions on foreign entities that have conducted or facilitated cyber attacks against U.S. organizations. OFAC sanctions also make it a crime for any other entity or person to conduct business with an OFAC-designated entity.Titles 10 (military authorities) and 50 (intelligence authorities) can improve domestic cyber defenses by putting the U.S. on the offensive. They could be invoked to take an "active" or "forward" defensive posture to proactively disable and disrupt foreign-based cyber threats. The vast resources, knowledge and capabilities of the U.S. Cyber Command, National Security Agency (NSA), CIA and the rest of the intelligence community are unmatched and could be used to augment and support law enforcement actions, in sequenced and coordinated operations as part of an overall national strategy, as was done in the during the war on terrorism in the aftermath of 9/11.In October 2020, U.S. Cyber Command conducted offensive cyber operations aimed at disrupting the Trickbot botnet used to distribute ransomware/8 and the FBI indicted six Russian military intelligence officers/9 implicated in distributing destructive malware. This is an excellent example of a unified, coordinated government approach to the global cyber threat, utilizing a combination of elements of national power.COORDINATED GOVERNMENT SUPPORT AND PARTNERSHIP ARE KEY TO STOPPING CYBER CRIMEDespite hospitals' concerted attempts to secure their cyber ecosystems, individual efforts to secure systems are insufficient to prevent all attacks. The Trump Administration has used executive orders to name 16 critical infrastructure sectors - including health care and public health - deemed essential to the security of the nation and directed federal agencies to prioritize securing federal systems. HHS is designated as the liaison for the health care sector. More broadly, the FBI has been designated as the lead authority on investigating cybercrime. Other agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service, also play key roles in combatting cybercrime and providing guidance. Coordination across these federal resources is critical to ensuring the wide, effective and timely sharing of threat intelligence and defensive strategies. In addition, these agencies must be given the resources to not only respond to attacks, but also help vulnerable health care targets prevent attacks from occurring or succeeding.We have seen that the most effective response by the government to aid health care victims of cyber attacks is a consistent unified approach in which DHS, FBI and HHS respond in a timely and coordinated manner. A call to one should be "a call to all." The National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), which also encompasses intelligence community and Department of Defense assets, may be the platform to further refine and enhance inter-agency coordination and response efforts.As referenced above, the CISA Act provided a mechanism for sharing information among private-sector and federal government entities and provides a safe harbor from certain liabilities related to that information sharing. Information sharing allows organizations to stay ahead of emerging cybersecurity risks and contribute to our collective knowledge of threats. However, the goals of information sharing have yet to be fully realized. Expedited, tailored and automated cyber threat information sharing on a regular cadence from the federal government would benefit all health care and public health organizations. Providers need actionable information that identifies specific steps they can take to secure against new threats. Large volumes of more generalized information can prove challenging to interpret and may even become a distraction.HHS also is directed under the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act to work with the private sector and other federal agencies to establish voluntary, consensus-based best practices. While the federal government is working to provide additional educational and other resources to the health care field, more action is needed to address the cybersecurity challenges facing all sectors. As a nation, we must bolster the security of our cyber ecosystem, not just place the burden on individual institutions. Indeed, the magnitude of the challenges and the growing sophistication of the attacks suggest that the federal government must provide additional nationwide resources. These include efforts to:* develop and disseminate coordinated national defensive measures, including leveraging national technical defenses which are used to protect government agencies;* strengthen and expand our cybersecurity workforce through grant programs and retraining efforts, perhaps with a particular focus on the retraining of veterans;* identify and disrupt bad actors;* increase the consequences for those who commit attacks; and* identify and support best practices by the private sector.CONCLUSIONHospitals and health systems, and the patients they care for every day, are heavily targeted by cyber adversaries, including sophisticated nation-states. They have made great strides to defend their networks, secure patient data, preserve health care services' efficient delivery and, most importantly, protect patient safety. However, our field cannot do it alone. Hospitals and health systems need more active support from the government to defend patients from cyber threats.Conversely, the federal government cannot protect our nation from cyber criminals alone either - they need the expertise and exchange of cyber threat information from the field to effectively combat cyber threats.What is truly needed is close cooperation between the government, the health care sector and all critical infrastructure via a formal exchange of cyber threat information and combined cyber defenses - truly a "Whole of Nation Approach."* * *Footnotes:1 https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a2 https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-regime-backed-programmer-charged-conspiracy-conduct-multiple-cyber-attacks-and3 https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf4 https://blog.barracuda.com/2020/03/26/threat-spotlight-coronavirus-related-phishing/5 https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-iranian-nationals-charged-cyber-theft-campaign-targeting-computer-systems-united-states6 https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/remarks-deputy-attorney-general-jeffrey-rosen-announcement-charges-and-arrests-computer7 https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/06/15/2016-13742/cybersecurity-information-sharing-act-of-2015-final-guidance-documents-notice-of-availability8 https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/cyber-command-trickbot-disrupt/2020/10/09/19587aae-0a32-11eb-a166-dc429b380d10_story.html9 https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/six-russian-gru-officers-charged-connection-worldwide-deployment-destructive-malware-andCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7311780 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 3, 2020End of Document

IT WASN'T REAL: A look at what didn't happen this weekCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 31, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 2562 wordsBodyMEXICO CITY (AP) — A summary of the most popular but completely false stories and images of the week. None of these are legitimate, even though they were widely shared on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the facts:___Mexican president has not been vaccinated against COVID-19THE AFIRMATION: Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador was given the Chinese CanSino-Biologics vaccine against COVID-19 on October 20.THE FACTS: During a press conference, López Obrador said he will wait until his turn to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and denied that he had been secretly vaccinated by the end of October.The Mexican president detailed that according to his calculations it will be in March when the vaccine is applied."Well, it's not true, but so there's a lot of things in the media, a lot of lies, imagine how I'm going to do that, that I'm going to get vaccinated, what I'm doing is taking care of myself, even when it's my turn. I'm doing my math too, it's going to touch me like for March, because of my age and hypertension, I'm in good health," the president said.On 19 December journalist Dario Celis published a tweet in which he incorrectly assured that López Obrador was emptied on October 30.The publication included a link to a column in which he claimed, without citing any source, that the representative and some foreign service officials, including foreign secretary Marcelo Ebrard, had been vaccinated with the Chinese antigen CanSino-Biologics.But this version was demented by the president during the december 24 press conference, the day the first person in Mexico was vacued against COVID-19.The inoculation with the Pfizer-BioNTech drug occurred in the Mexican capital and the one who received it was nurse María Irene Ramírez, 59, and head of nursing of the Intensive Therapy Unit of the Rubén Leñero Hospital.On December 28, López Obrador reported through his social networks that the CanSino vaccine will arrive in Mexico in January."We have a contract of 35 million doses, the commitment is to be given two million in January, three million in February, three million in March and so on. We already have signed this agreement," the Mexican president said.The representative also noted that progress is being made in the implementation of the Pfizer vaccine, mainly in health personnel, as they are a priority when facing the pandemic, and it is estimated that these doses will reach at least 700,000 health workers.___COVID-19 vaccine will not be on sale at Walmart stores in the U.S. and MexicoTHE AFIRMATION: The COVID-19 vaccine will be on sale at Walmart supermarkets in the United States and Mexico.THE FACTS: On December 10, Dr. Tom Van Gilder, Walmart's medical director, announced on the corporate's official blog that the retail giant planned to administer COVID-19 vaccines after receiving approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).However, in his publication, the doctor did not report that the vaccines would be on sale. He actually explained that stores were being prepared with freezers and dry ice to handle "any vaccine storage requirements." He added that it would be the states that would determine who would receive the first doses and when."The federal government will assign the vaccine to states and states will determine who should receive the first doses of the vaccine and when. Walmart won't have a say about who can get the vaccine, but we're ready to support states once itdo, " said the company.The statement states that Walmart will reach agreements with states to support vaccines when needed in the long run, either in their pharmacies or in care facilities, where states determine they need the company's help.After such information was released, posts began circulating on social media falsely suring that the vaccine would be sold in Walmart stores in the United States at a cost of $20.Some of these claims were accompanied by screenshots of newspaper notes announcing the news that Walmart was ready to administer the vaccines. Others showed an edited photo purportingly showing Pfizer's vaccine packaged in vaporizer format.However, the Pfizer vaccine is not applied with a vaporizer and requires storage at temperatures of -70o Celsius to ensure its effectiveness. In addition, this inoculation consists of two doses per patient.On December 28, other social media users began sharing an apocryphal statement from Walmart that ensured that the COVID-19 vaccine would be available in supermarkets across the country, but this is also not correct.Through a shared social media release, Walmart Mexico and Latin America demined this information."As a company, we first privilege the safety of our customers and partners, giving them the confidence that we act in coordination with the authorities of each community in which we operate, abiding by the appropriate protocols to safeguard the well-being and integrity of Mexican families."The vaccination schedule set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is very similar to that followed by several countries, such as Mexico. Priority will be given to health personnel and the elderly, then immunized in stages to the rest of the population.On December 23, Walmart reported that it began administering its first COVID-19 vaccines to health workers in New Mexico. The inoculation that was applied was Moderna's."We are administering the recently approved Modern vaccine to health workers at select Walmart stores and Sam's Clubs in the state of New Mexico. The New Mexico Department of Health carefully chose store locations to help ensure that the vaccine is administered safely in rural areas that need help supporting the distribution of the vaccine to health workers," says a shared publication on the corporate's website.___Dominion did not send U.S. election results to ChinaTHE AFFIRMATION: Security and election technology expert Russell Ramsland stated in a video that a forensic audit in the state of Georgia shows that Dominion tabulation machines sent election results to China. He also noted that election results from 29 states were sent to that country through servers belonging to a company called "Clearing" located in Frankfurt, Germany.THE FACTS: In the video Ramsland does not mention Dominion or any company named "Clearing". In fact, he points out that the alleged servers belong to Clarity elections, a tabulated vote viewing platform developed by the election software company Scytl, which participated in the past U.S. elections. The company has neither offices nor servers in Frankfurt, Germany.Through a statement posted on its official website from mid-November, Scytl clarified that it has no offices, servers or computers located in the German city.Inthe publication details that in 2019 the company used some servers in Frankfurt for a specific project of the European Parliament, but clarifies that these backup servers were closed in September of that year.On December 27, a Cuban news website published an article entitled "Confirm that Dominion (which also provided software service in the last elections), sent election results to the Chinese regime, according to technical analysis."The article refers to an interview in which Ramsland assured, without showing any evidence, that in Savannah, Georgia, "a thermal switch" was discovered in one of the tab rooms connected to a server reporting the votes to China."The vote count in 29 states was not only sent to social media, but went to Frankfurt, Germany, where it ended up on a server owned by 'Clearing' in that city," the text of the news website wrongly says.The video cited in the text is a fragment of Ramsland's interview in the Zooming In program and although in his participation the specialist does mention some theories of an alleged electoral fraud that Dominion would have participated in, in this specific sequence the specialist does not mention Dominion or any company named "Clearing". What it does falsely point out is that the alleged servers located in Frankfurt connected to China belong to Clarity elections.The latter is a platform that provides visual representation of votes that have been tabulated by state and local election officials and is developed by the election software company Scytl which participated in the past U.S. elections.On its website, the company explained that the technologies implemented by Scytl in the United States are hosted and managed within the country by its local subsidiary, SOE Software, based in Tampa, Florida. Currently, the company has offices in Spain, France, Greece, the United States, Canada and Australia.Dominion has also clarified that it has no servers in Germany. "All votes are counted in the United States by local election officials, not Dominion," it reads on their website. The company has also noted that it has no link to the Chinese government.The U.S. Department of Justice has found no evidence of widespread voter fraud. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Infrastructure security and cybersecurity agency (CISA) reported that "there is no evidence that any voting system has eliminated or lost votes, changed votes."On December 14, voters at the Electoral College reported official results in each state of the American union and confirmed Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the November 3 election, with 306 electoral votes.Republican President Donald Trump got 232 votes, less than the 270 needed to win the election.On January 6, in a bicameral session, the U.S. Congress will validate the results reported by the Electoral College.___Vaccinated against COVID-19 in Chile had no serious side effectsTHE AFFIRMATION: In Chile, the authorities have concealed that 19 people have had side effects after being vaccinated against COVID-19 and that some were serious.THE FACTS: The Chilean Institute of Public Health (ISP) did not hide the information. In fact, it reported that there are 21 cases of suspected adverse reaction and two of these were classified as serious, but were not considered serious.On 28 December, the PSI reported through the Pharmacovigilance Subdepartment that, until the morning,on Monday, 21 notifications of events allegedly attributed to vaccination had been received from health centres across the country.The most common symptoms reported were headache, fatigue, pain at the injection site, itching and rash, reactions considered non-serious. Of the 21 cases of suspected adverse reaction, two of them were classified as serious because they required hospitalization, but the institute did not classify them as serious.After the COVID-19 vaccination campaign began in Chile on December 24, a widely shared facebook post said that vaccinated people have had side effects and that some of these were serious. It was also falsely noted that the authorities had concealed the information."In Chile you knew there are already several people with side damage (19), some serious in the uti (Intensive Treatment Unit) who are monitoring them every minute, very serious and have it very quiet, it is 1 horror what these inso mindless are doing, experimenting as if we were rabbits. Don't get emp up," it reads in the post.However, that statement is not correct as the PSI reported on these cases since 28 December, on the same day on which the publication was shared, and detailed that up to that day there had been 21 cases of adverse reactions, not 19."People are being monitored and cases are being monitored for evaluation so they can confirm or rule out the relationship with inoculation. Twenty of the 21 cases were reported in the Metropolitan Region and 1 in the Bío Bío Region", is read in a statement on the PSI website.As of 28 December, the Ministry of Health reported that a total of 8,638 health workers had been vaccinated, so the percentage of people who had side effects up to that date was only 0.24%.Chile, Costa Rica and Mexico became on Thursday the first countries to begin coVID-19 vaccination in Latin America and in each of the three countries there were three women who received the first doses: Mexican nurse María Irene Ramírez, Chilean nursing technique Zulema Riquelme and Costa Rican Elizabeth Castillo, a 91-year-old lady. All were inoculated with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines.___Health protocols were complied with to move COVID-19 vaccine in Argentine cityTHE AFFIRMATION: The Argentine government is not complying with health protocols for moving Sputnik V vaccines against COVID-19. A video shows that to bring the antigens from Buenos Aires to Mendoza, a vehicle without freezers and an inadequate container was used.THE FACTS: Through an email, the authorities confirmed to the AP that the vaccine is already packed in a special thermal box and that it does not need to be moved in refrigerated trucks or dry ice.After COVID-19 vaccination began in Argentina on 29 December, images of health workers began circulating on social media and were vaccinated with Russian antigen Sputnik V and also on drug transfer.A video that has been shared thousands of times on Twitter shows four men unloading vaccine boxes from a red van. Around them there are several photographers capturing images of the moment.A message accompanying the recording incorrectly ensures that the images show how the antigens arrived in the province of Mendoza from the capital city of Buenos Aires."Thus, without a cold chain, without health protocols and using a supermarket cart, the government moved the Sputnik V vaccine from Buenos Aires to Mendoza.Welcome to peronia, my friends," says the shared tweet more than 4,700 times.Another similar publication notes that the Russian vaccine had arrived in a container that conserves temperature but does not refrigerate and with a vehicle without refrigerators.The head of immunizations of the province of Mendoza explained in a tweet the characteristics of the packaging in which the Russian vaccine is transferred."It comes in thermal boxes with eutectic solutions + dry ice + thermal bag + data logger of registration of T min a min from the closure of the box to its opening. With this assembly are secured the -18 degrees 90 hours. YOU DON'T NEED REFRIGERATED TRUCK WITH THAT PACKAGING," the publication says.Argentina began on Tuesday the application of the first 300,000 doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine against COVID-19 despite criticism from the international community that questioned that its authorization was hasty and that Russia did not provide the full product data.The first to receive the vaccine were health professionals from Buenos Aires and the 23 provinces, making Argentina the third country in the world to immunize with Sputnik V after Russia did so earlier this month and Belarus began doing so hours before the South American country.In Argentina, doctors, nurses and stretchers received Sputnik V in hundreds of public hospitals in the presence of officials who confirmed the "safety" of the vaccine. All vaccinated persons will need to receive a second dose after 21 days and up to a maximum of 60.There are about 1.6 million infected people in Argentina and more than 42,000 deaths from COVID-19. In recent days, contagions have increased in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area.___Find more AP verifications here: https://apnews.com/hub/ap-verifica___Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheckLoad-Date: January 1, 2021End of Document

USA: Trump government adds four other Chinese companies to Pentagon's "blacklist"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 4, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 280 wordsBodyThe U.S. Department of Defense on Thursday blacklisted four other Chinese companies for being controlled or military-owned.It is the chip manufacturer SMIC, the oil giant CNOOC,as well as China Construction Technology Co Ltd (CCTC) and China International Engineering Consulting Corp (CIECC).With these there are already 35 companies that the Pentagon under the orders of outgoing President Donald Trump has blacklisted this 2020, including Huawei, Hikvision or China Telecom.The list stems from a law passed in 1999, but until this year it was empty and it has been the Trump administration that has designated companies controlled or owned by the People's Liberation Army.Starting next year, U.S. investors will be prohibited from buying securities from companies that are on the list,which until now did not include sanctions.Trump's executive order a month ago gives leeway until November 2021 to get rid of those currently possessed."The president's order serves to protect U.S. investors from unintendedly offering capital that will strengthen the capacity of china's Army or intelligence services, which are routinely employed to attack U.S. citizens and businessesthrough computer operations," Robert O'Brien, White House National Security adviser, said in a statement.U.S.-China relations have deteriorated enormously during Trump's four-year term.The two countries are living one of the lowest moments since they established relations in 1979, which in addition to the mutual imposition of trade tariffs,has led to the closure, in the summer, of the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu City, in response to the Chinese's previous closure in Houston, Texas.Source: EFELook too       Load-Date: December 5, 2020End of Document

Qualification systems, a common practice around the worldCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 9, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 584 wordsBodyIn 2014, China's government unveiled a social credit system plan, which is in full operation as of 2020. The intention behind a national reputation system is to manage citizens' rewards or punishments based on their economic and social behavior.Penalties include flight bans, exclusion from private schools or prestigious jobs, internet connection, hotel exclusion and more.The Chinese government's fundamental reason, as reported by Wired in June 2019, was intended to build trust. In theory, a person creates credit by being trustworthy and is rewarded: on the contrary, he loses credit, and advantages or access to things, when he is not.Rating systems are a common practice around the world, from markets like Uber and Airbnb, to review platforms or sites powered by them, such as Trivago, Amazon, YouTube or Netflix. While ratings and reviews can build confidence, there's more at stake in a rating than just a good or bad experience.The moral dilemmaEach time you complete an Uber ride, you're asked to rate your driver on a one- to five-star scale and vice versa, that is, you're rated as a passenger. This encourages drivers and passengers to behave in the best possible way, and to trust that the trip will be safe and the passenger will behave well. However, people often struggle to rate others accurately. According to NPR social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam, "people don't rate people harshly because they don't want to harm them. You may not be happy as a passenger, but you don't want to ruin a person's livelihood." But not doing so could put future passengers at risk. Unfortunately, according to Vedantam, most people pass on to the bad driver or decide not to qualify at all.Ratings: all or nothingDesigning, copying, coloring, and synchronizing a grade can influence how we interact with grading systems. Five stars of mine could mean something different in someone else's version. Giving accurate and standard ratings across multiple platforms (especially when it comes to rating people or their behavior) takes time and can be difficult.m{1082875}? But when users take the time to rate, as YouTube discovered, people are usually all or nothing; users tend to react in extremes. So what could encourage users to give accurate ratings? Time magazine reported on a study conducted by Sarah Moore, a marketing professor in Canada, in which participants who explained her positive experiences as a consumer ended up scoring them lower compared to people in control groups and without explanation, and people who explained their bad experiences. ended up rating their experiences higher than those who didn't.In ratings we trustDespite the countless rating systems that exist, and how bad we are to accurately reflect our experience, ratings and reviews are influential. According to Forbes, we take ratings seriously: "85 percent of people trust online reviews as much as on a personal recommendation, and each extra star can generate a 5 to 9 percent increase in revenue. Online reviews are also an important rating signal in Google's algorithm."Remember that we should take grades and reviews with a grain of salt, and time, to make an effort to provide more accurate and honest ratings and reviews. It is possible thatqualifying people isn't easier for our conscience, but it helps to think that honest and thoughtful reviews can improve the grading systems around us. Whether we follow China or not, there is still a clear need to be able to trust each other.m{1082822}srgsLoad-Date: November 10, 2020End of Document

YINYU YE: SPORTS LED ME FROM THE RICE FIELDS TO STANFORDStates News ServiceDecember 8, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1559 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: STANFORD, Calif. BodyThe following information was released by Stanford Engineering:An aptitude for athletics helped transform a professor of management science and engineering from a rice farmer during China's Cultural Revolution into a world-renowned scholar.By Edmund L. AndrewsHad it not been for his youthful skill at basketball, Yinyu Ye might never have enjoyed his long and distinguished career as the Kwoh-Ting Li Professor in the School of Engineering.A professor of management science and engineering, Ye is also a professor, by courtesy, of electrical engineering.Born in China, Ye finished high school at the start of the Cultural Revolution and was sent with his family to undergo "re-education" in the rice fields. As Ye describes below, his basketball skills helped him at the age of 30 to gain admission to the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, where he earned a bachelor's degree in systems and control. In 1982, he moved to Stanford Engineering where he pursued a PhD in operations research.A prolific and much-honored researcher in the field of linear programming, Ye has developed mathematical models and algorithms that optimize or make the most efficient use of scarce resources in almost any kind of system: factories, transportation, smart power grids, satellites and banking, to name a few.A student of George Dantzig, the legendary Stanford professor who invented what has been called "the algorithm that runs the world," Ye helped extend Dantzig's post-World War II breakthroughs into the era of machine learning, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars. Ye, whose honors include the prestigious John von Neumann Theory Prize in 2009, has written or contributed to 12 books and more than 170 peer-reviewed papers. His topics range from algorithms for balancing financial risk to "'Muddling Through' in the Chinese Bureaucracy."From high school to hard laborIn 1970, when I was 22, I was working from sunup to sunset in China's rice fields. If it hadn't been for basketball, I might still be there today.My father had been a high school principal and math teacher and I had hoped to go to a university, but Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution put a stop to that in 1966. Almost overnight, the colleges all shut down.The government ordered millions of people back to the countryside for manual labor on farms and, in 1968, my family and I were sent to a farming village. I spent the next two years doing hard labor. It was hard to imagine any escape.Basketball to the rescueIn 1970, however, my basketball skills saved me in the first of two times. Industrial companies were recruiting young people for jobs in the cities. Every rural young person wanted one of those jobs, but your family had to have the right political background and mine did not. My father had been a member of the Kuomintang the Chinese Nationalist Party, which fled to Taiwan after World War II, although he had remained in China.My main sport in high school had been track and field. I had won several championships and even set a state high school record in the high jump. But I also played on the basketball team. I was 6 feet tall taller than the average Chinese and I could jump really high. I could easily dunk the ball. Fortunately for me, basketball was extremely popular in China and companies had basketball teams. A winning team was important to a company's stature, so they were desperately looking for good players.Those skills overcame my political shortcomings, and a major chemical company hired me, and I played forward on their basketball team, and also learned how to do electrical wiring and repair and operate power equipment and electronic devices. During my seven years with the company I met my wife, Daisun Zhow, who was in my same working group. I studied math during the night shift, which helped me to pass the university entrance exam in 1977 and once again my skill at basketball saved me.An education on the reboundBy 1977, Deng Xiaoping had become head of the Chinese Communist Party and had started to reform the economy and re-open the universities. I was excited about going, but I was almost 30 and still didn't have the proper political background. In addition to my father's past, my wife's father had owned a small manufacturing company before the Revolution, which made him a suspected "capitalist roader."But like the manufacturing companies, universities wanted to build basketball teams. I did very well on my entrance examinations, but the Huazhong University of Science and Technology accepted me at least in part because I could help their team.By 1982, as I was preparing to graduate, it became possible for students to apply to universities anywhere in the world. Stanford accepted me for a master's program in engineering, and the Chinese government gave me a scholarship for the first year. After that, I got fellowships and work as a research and teaching assistant to pursue a PhD. It was a dream come true. But I felt lonely at times, as my wife and 4-year-old daughter, Fei, had remained in China and they only joined me in 1984.Sports helped ease me into StanfordMy first night here, I stayed with a family in Los Altos Hills and watched my first American football game on TV. I didn't know anything about the game, but I was interested and asked a lot of questions. Sports offered me a common ground with other people. If I went to a party and talked about the 49ers or John Elway, who was playing for Stanford then, it was better than talking about my research.I also went to high school basketball games. Lots of parents were there, cheering and having a good time. I was very impressed that people were recording all kinds of statistics everything from minutes played to shooting percentages. For all my years playing basketball, I had never known my own percentages. It helped me understand that America is a place that emphasizes data, and I was heading in that same direction.Three mentors who became friends for lifeI remember the day I became fascinated by linear programing. It was a sunny day in 1984, and I decided to attend a guest lecture by Narendra Karmarkar of ATandT, who had just invented the first software algorithm to get a patent. The auditorium was so packed that I had to sit on the floor. I was amazed by the richness and applicability of linear programming, which can be used to optimize all sorts of real-world processes from helping farmers decide which crops to grow to balancing the electrical grid to keep the power flowing. I quickly decided to devote my PhD to this branch of mathematics.My first mentor was George Dantzig, one of the three founders of linear programming. By the time I arrived at Stanford, he had already won almost every prize in the field the very first John von Neumann Prize, the National Medal of Science and many others. I think he appreciated my academic curiosity and my desire to learn, and he helped me in many ways.George was a great advisor. I actively sought out his advice and showed him my research ideas. Thanks in large part to him, I published three papers while I was working on my PhD. I continued to seek George's advice long after I earned my doctorate and even after he retired. He and his wife became close family friends. My wife and I visited him at his bedside on the night before he died in 2005. Even at that point, he wanted to know about my latest research.My second important mentor was David Luenberger, who founded Stanford's Department of EngineeringEconomic Systems, which later merged into what is now the Department of Management Science and Engineering. Luenberger was a giant in the area of optimization. We used his book in my first course on that subject. Years later, I became a co-author with David of that same book Linear and Nonlinear Programming.A third mentor was Michael Todd, at Cornell University, one of the giants in operations research. He invited me to do postdoctoral work at Cornell, and we went on to write quite few papers together, including an algorithm that is widely implemented in current open-source linear programming problem-solving software.Mentoring as coachingOne way mentors help the next generation of researchers is by introducing them to other people in the field. Your career isn't just your research. It's a network. The most important thing my mentors gave me, however, was an understanding of scholarship, intellectual integrity, curiosity and rigorous thinking.As a professor, I like students who have a great intellectual curiosity and who are willing to look into open questions that have been studied but not solved. I challenge them to do some research around that topic, and then we hold weekly meetings and continue working together. My proudest moments are when students come into my office and tell me they have found something really eye-opening, that they've conquered a scientific mystery.After all these years, I still advise my students to take an interest in sports. I learned a lot from playing basketball: the importance of training hard, of team-work, of competitive spirit, but also playing by the rules. Trust me, I tell them, such qualities can change your life.Yinyu Ye, the Kwoh-Ting Li Professor in the School of Engineering, professor, by courtesy, of electrical engineering and member of Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering (ICME)Load-Date: December 9, 2020End of Document

Biometric surveillance: Coahuila's tortuous path to facial recognitionCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 11, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 3321 wordsBody       Coahuila is the first state in Mexico to implement a video surveillance system that identifies the faces of people, but the government of Miguel Angel Riquelme faces a number of obstacles to start the operation of this controversial technology that, in other words of experts, violates the rights of citizens. On the afternoon of September 27, in the Plaza de Armas de Saltillo, three cameras arranged in a security tower at street level, four in a building, two installed at the ends of the Government Palace and three more at the entrance door, captured the return to the streets of feminist groups after months of confinement. That day they protested the death of Alondra Gallegos García, a 20-year-old victim of femicide.It was the first time the faces of dozens of protesters and activists were etched on the servers of the state's new intelligent video surveillance system.At Torreón and Saltillo Control, Command, Communication and Computation Centers (C4), state police groups and officials monitor the streets for people with suspicious behavior. It is the first attempt in Mexico to operate at the state level a system that recognizes faces through biometric data, a mathematical compound that derives from facial geometry, and whose advancement and implementation in the world has not been free of criticism.On surveillance-enabled computers on C4s, a futuristic design interface shows the processing of faces captured by facial recognition cameras. A day after the feminist demonstration, the system already recorded more than 44.7 million image captures of faces in Coahuila.A software with artificial intelligence integrated into the cameras processes the images and compares them with other faces stored in the system and whose profiles have already been previously identified. The system automatically and in real-time compares and matches faces and if a match is generated, the program issues an alert and activates a tracking protocol by reaction-enabled police elements.In other words, the system is so advanced that it can distinguish people with water covers or balaclavas, even when the images are blurry."With this video intelligence system today Coahuila is at the forefront, we are the first state in the republic to have this software," Said Governor Miguel Angel Riquelme in April 2019. A year and a half later, everything indicates that the celebration was anticipated, as his government has not yet been able to fully start the plan. The project has faced a number of technical, legal and political obstacles. The state government has not gained access to federal databases to do matching tasks, and if it did, the computer equipment they now have would not be enough to store them while complying with regulations that approve surveillance systems in Mexico. There are also no legal frameworks governing the use of biometric data and official strategies to protect human rights in relation to technology have been superficial. But given the history of violence in Coahuila, few have been concerned about the advent of technology that has detonated debates internationally and has been banned in different parts of the world because of its potential to contravene human rights and significant technical irregularities. In Coahuila, the promise of security overlaps everything.  A momentum purchaseSince the beginning of his administration in December 2017, Riquelme assured the Coahuilenses that he would not return to the time of violence that marked the state during the sexenios of the Moreira brothers. "Coahuila will not let her guard down insecurity," the governor repeats as a slogan at his cabinet meetings and public announcements. Five months after starting his government, Riquelme led a tour of China in search of foreign investment that resulted in a commercial twinning with Jiangsu Province. Captivated by the network of cameras installed on the streets of the cities he visited, the governor embarked on an adventure to acquire a facial recognition system with which he would seek to revolutionize the security of his state. On April 1, 2019, at a masterful event in the central courtyard of the Pink Palace in Saltillo, Riquelme presented his video intelligence project. He was joined by local entrepreneurs, security officials, army members and Zhijie Li, global CEO of Dahua Technology, a Chinese-subsidized company that develops surveillance technologies and was purchased by direct award for nearly 1,300 cameras. In September of that year, government representatives met in Hangzhou with Dahua executives to review the progress of installing cameras in Coahuilense territory. A month later, Dahua was blacklisted by the U.S. Department of Commerce for his involvement in the Chinese government's crackdown, arbitrary arrests, and surveillance of minority Muslim groups. These concerns were not an isolated case, they were marked by a history of technical vulnerabilities of the company. In 2017, cybersecurity company ReFirm Labs found "backdoors" in a network of Dahua cameras that sent information to unknown IP addresses in China and allowed unauthorized people to remotely access user data and passwords. And a year ago, about a million Dahua cameras installed in Brazil, Colombia and Taiwan were hacked and turned into "bots" to exercise extortion campaigns and overload other systems being attacked. But the signs against Dahua did not derail the project in Coahuila and by 3 November 2019 95 percent of the cameras had already been installed in Torreón and Saltillo, Riquelme reported. The government went ahead with the investment of 600 million pesos, of which little is known. The Ministry of Finance reserved all information regarding the purchase, contract, checks and invoices issued. The only thing that detailed is that 273 million have been eeroged for the installation of the system in the Laguna region and another 285.7 million in the Southeast region. The governor's office declined to comment on this report. An wasted systemIntroducing his project, Riquelme stated that the video surveillance system could consult the databases of Platform Mexico and that it could even partner with the National Electoral Institute (INE) to track down potential criminals. But to this day, the coahuilense government does not have these conventions and the system is not connected to national databases. For now, the camera network is in "test state" and still does not work at full power. This was recognized by the director of the C4 platform, Luis Campos, who was called to oversee its implementation after a long history designing technology projects applied to different areas of government. "We are in the testing stage, but already functional, already in practical tests," Campos said in interview. Despite its capabilities, at this time the scope of the system is limited. To add broader databases, it would take at least three times the computational memory available in Coahuila.  Campos confirmed that image matching is only done through"exception lists" means a police concept that refers to a list of faces provided by the local prosecutor's office. The system has loaded a "blacklist" of faces of people with capture orders and a "whitelist" of missing persons faces. To date, these lists are made up of less than a hundred faces, which are automatically searched in millions of images being captured by the system. Of the nearly 1,000 cameras that were purchased from Dahua, only a third have the ability to detect faces. The others are cameras for the identification of vehicle plates and for conventional monitoring through closed circuits. This information had not been clarified by the authorities, who rather emphasized facial recognition as the distinctive quality of their new video surveillance system. Although the governor has insisted that, even on trial, the cameras have already served to solve crimes, their effectiveness in recognizing faces remains un demonstrated. The reality is that the software has not yielded any positive matches of the "blacklist" of wanted people, and from the "whitelist" the authorities have said that there have been three matches between captured images and the records, but have not offered details about missing persons finds. No regulation to operateThe video surveillance system in Coahuila is already in use, but there is no legal order that ensures the correct processing of the personal data that is collected. The Secretary of State Public Safety operates the system covered by the 2016 technical standard to standardize video surveillance systems at the federal level, which does not provide in detail for facial recognition and biometric data collection. System officials in Coahuila say the technology will not be released "totally" until it is well regulated and claim that the state government's Legal Counsel is working on the creation of a new state law for this purpose. This initiative has not yet been presented to Congress and lawmakers are unaware of its progress. "We haven't done the driving thing about it. It is already several months that this technology is working and we have not questioned in a pertinent way how the regulation of its use is going," acknowledged Deputy Juan Carlos Guerra, coordinator of the Public Security Commission at the local Congress. Quinto Elemento Lab had access to a draft of the initiative of a draft decree that would be signed by the governor to create the "Law regulating the Use of Video Surveillance and Video Intelligence Cameras for public security of the State of Coahuila de Zaragoza". The document confirms the interest in using broader databases: it provides that the facial recognition platform has access to those that make up the National Information System, which are run by Platform Mexico and whose operation is the responsibility of the National Information Center (CNI). These are databases created by public ministries and law enforcement institutions of the three government orders and contain criminal information of persons subject to criminal prosecution or investigation, convicted persons and public security and private security personnel, among others. Within the current technical protocols and security padlocks of Plataforma México it is not possible to link such databases with technologies such as Coahuila. However, David Pérez Esparza, owner of the CNI, confirmed that he was collaborating with Coahuila on an interconnection project that would allow the state to access these databases directly and in real time. Although it considered that this represented a significant technical challenge and that it would be atime-consuming and very costly process for the state. Selective installationCoahuila became one of the regions of the country most affected by organized crime between 2011 and 2017, although criminal impact data from the Federal Ministry of Public Security recorded a 36 percent decrease in crime between 2018 and 2020, with the exception of areas such as the central and coal region of Coahuila. Violence has increased in these areas for two years, particularly in the municipalities of Candela and Juárez, according to data from the Civic Council of the Coahuila Institutions. But the places where the cameras are located do not always coincide with the regions where the most crimes occur. More importantly, the system is focused on metropolitan areas and residential colonies with economic interest. The State Ministry of Public Security has denied requests to transparent the exact locations of the cameras, but a mapping carried out during this investigation in Torreón identified a large number of Dahua cameras in Torreón Jardín and Campestre La Rosita, two high purchasing power colonies, which are also home to the government house of the state of Coahuila. If it were all part of the state's program, this concentration would account for 65 percent of surveillance points across the Laguna region. The surveillance project received a warm reception from the business sector, who have even offered to make their own resources available to the government to increase the camera network. "The authority does not seek to invade privacy, just have eyes on the street," the president of the National Chamber of Commerce in Torreón, Luis Cuerda Serna, said in interview. The system was rated "fabulous" by Carlos Braña Muñoz, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry in Torreón. "We forgot that eight years ago you couldn't get out and when you came out you were afraid something would happen to you (...) If I had to decide between my privacy and my freedom, I'm going to put my freedom for encimita," he said. Human rights at riskAlvaro Cárdenas, a young lawyer, first noticed the cameras in Saltillo, while driving back to his native Torreón after living for a few years in Monterrey. As a citizen of the Lagoon, he was concerned about the deployment of a public policy that he does not consider appropriate. He now leads a legal strategy that seeks to lay jurisprudence on the issue and has promoted a number of protections before federal justice, arguing that surveillance technologies contravene privacy and that there are no legal conditions that allow the government to implement them. This coincided with Vladimir Cortés, digital rights officer of the organization Article 19, who believes that the case of Coahuila opens the opportunity for a broader debate in Mexico on the risks of these technologies to the exercise of human rights. "Knowing yourself under state surveillance or even suspecting it affects people's behavior and has an inhibitory effect on freedom of expression as well as the right of assembly and association," he added. Luis Fernando García Muñoz, executive director of Red in Defense of Digital Rights (R3D), considered that facial recognition is "unreliable", as it has severe risks of producing false positives, that is, that the system collects the face of one person believing that it is another. In 2018 the Big Brother Watch organization revealed that facial recognition technology used by London police had a rate of 98 percent false positives. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) also conducted an experiment with the Amazon Rekognition program and found errorsstrong in identification and race biases. Last June, Amazon watched the sale of its programs to U.S. police for a year, assuming that there were no strict laws governing the use of such technologies. For García Muñoz, the dichotomy between security and privacy is "false", as it is often the same police that put people at risk. In 2019, the Human Rights Commission of the State of Coahuila recorded a 50 percent increase in the number of complaints received, where municipal and state security forces are most noted by citizens. However, according to Luis Campos, in charge of the video surveillance system, the project in Coahuila has the approval of the UN High Commissioner at the national level. "He said, 'I have no doubt about the system, as far as I know, it doesn't violate people's privacy. I'm only worried about what use you give it when you're away,'" Campos said. The Office of the High Commissioner clarified to Quinto Elemento Lab that its meetings with the Co-Ahuilenses authorities were not in relation to the chambers but "around the state human rights plan". In the case of the video surveillance system, the UN Office stressed the need for the coahuila initiative to "always be in line with international standards" including the "immediate suspension of the sale, transfer and use of surveillance systems until the corresponding legal frameworks respecting human rights are established". It was until almost a year after the purchase of the system, in November 2019, that the Riquelme government signed a collaboration agreement that would seek to safeguard the rights that "could be compromised arising from the installation, use and operation of camcorders and video surveillance systems in the entity". The agreement involved the National Institute of Transparency, Access to Public Information and Protection of Personal Data, the Coahuilense Institute for Access to Public Information, the Inter-American Academy of Human Rights of the Autonomous University of Coahuila and the Commission on Human Rights of the State of Coahuila, who created a committee with a commitment to follow up on the work. In fact, the committee has proved in cash in cash. Since signing the group has not been reunited and these instances have not participated in monitoring the processes of acquisition, installation, deployment, or system review. An unknown algorithmThe state government recognizes that it has been a challenge to "tropicalize" technology into the Mexican environment. "It's just that there [in China] that human rights thing doesn't exist," Campos said of his conversations with engineers at the Asian company who joke about the obstacles facing technology in Mexico. Dahua executives declined interview requests for this investigation.  To prevent common risks in these technologies it is necessary to "continuously evaluate" the characteristics of the algorithms used for face identification, explained Carlos Duchanoy, researcher at the Computer Research Center of the National Polytechnic Institute. "To effectively validate these technologies you have to see where they're wrong, how they're wrong, and how those mistakes involve or have an effect on what we really want to achieve," he said. In Coahuila, the system is being evaluated by the same company that sold it. To date Dahua has not yet fully delivered it to the state government, as its technicians continue to make adjustments and have control over the process to discharge new faces. When they deliver the system, local officialsthey will only have access to the programs to put the cameras into use but not the algorithm from which they work. Indeed, Campos stated that only on one occasion did he "look" at the computer code and that Dahua engineers jealously safeguard it as a corporate secret. To avoid identification problems and racial biases, Coahuila's government asked Dahua to adapt its original algorithm to improve the recognition of local faces, although Campos said he did not know what this modification was technically or what criteria the company used to define an alleged "Mexican phenotype". In this regard, Vladimir Cortés, of Article 19, criticized the confidence in a consistently problematic technology and noted that as long as citizens do not have clarity "on what margins of error they are, what kind of algorithms they are using and what they have done to mitigate identification errors, there is a risk that human rights will not be respected". Among the hundreds of faces that are being searched by the system, there is an image that stands out for its colors and sharpness. In front of a pastel blue background, you can see the face of a woman with lips painted carmine red and carrying a hijab?, the veil used by Muslim women in the presence of men. Unlike the others, this face was not sent by the local prosecutor's office, as dictated by the internal protocol for adding images. The petition to search for the woman in Coahuila reached directly with Public Security Secretary Sonia Villarreal from FBI offices in Texas. It is the face of Mena Dyaha Yousif, who is believed to have crossed into Mexico across the border from Piedras Negras a few months ago along with her partner Jose Felan. Both are wanted by U.S. authorities for their participation in acts of vandalism during anti-racist protests following George Floyd's death at the hands of minneapolis police. Felan's image was captured by surveillance systems and identified in the videos by a tattoo with the name "Mena" on his forearm.

But 2020 further opened the gap between the two groups. While much of the world was dealing with rising unemployment and falling growth, 0.001 percent of the population benefited from an unprecedented increase in wealth.The world's 500 richest people added $1.8 trillion to their combined net worth in 2020 and now have about $7.6 trillion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The 31 percent advance is the highest annual gain in the eight years of the index's existence and a jump of $3 trillion compared to the lowest point on the market seen in March. Earnings were disproportionately recorded at the top, where five people now have fortunes exceeding $100 billion, andanother 20 have some of at least $50 billion. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos remainsthe richest person in the world thanks to growing enthusiasm for online retail during coVID-19 pandemic confinement. Elon Musk was the one who advanced the most in the index, in what is arguably the fastest wealth-generating episode in history, reaching second place after Tesla's market value skyrocketed. Combined, the two earned about $217 billion in 12 months,enough money to send $2,000 checks to more than 100 million Americans.You may be interested in: Republican Senate leader blocks Democratic attempt to approve $2,000 pandemic supportThe coVID-19 shock caused setbacks in industries such as real estate, but boosted fortunes in unexpected niches, in part thanks to retail investors who used free trading applications such as Robinhood.Chinese immigrant Eric Yuan rose to fame when his videoconferencing technology, Zoom Video Communications,became as ubiquitous as Kleenex. Gym closures sent its users to look for alternatives at home, sparking 'madness' by companies like Peloton Interactive that made its CEO, John Foley, a millionaire.The father-son duo behind Carvana.com, the used car site, became one of the richest families on the planet, while Winklevoss twins can be called billionaires again thanks to the resurgence of interest in cryptocurrencies.Exuberant markets and a series of public offerings propelled wealth creation in China, where the early COVID-19 crisis led to more successful containment efforts than most of the world. Chinese members of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index added $569 billion to their fortunes, more than any country other than the United States.ZhongShanshan, a water bottle tycoon nicknamed 'the Lone Wolf', became the richest person in Asia after initial offers from two of his companies helped increase his net worth by $70 billion. He snatched that post from Mukesh Ambani, who has begun to transform his conglomerate into a technological and e-commerce colossus.Not all billionaires in the region prospered. Jack Ma started the year as China's richest person, a position he was about to consolidate with the increase in sales of his e-commerce giant Alibaba, and ant Group's impending quote.However, Ant's Initial Public Offering collapsed shortly after Ma's sharp criticism of Chinese regulators, and his net worth was reduced, along with some of the country's other tech titans.The Chinese government also felt its presence on the tycoons of neighboring Hong Kong. After years of big profits, the wealth of many of the wealthiest people in the administrative region was affected by falling property prices and uncertainty over China's controversial national security law.Globally, the wild profits of the extremely wealthy have fueled populist movements and revived interest in raising taxes. In Germany, the United Kingdom, and certain US states, such as California and Washington, legislators, activists, and academics are pushing to implement wealth taxes to rebuild the government coffers drained by the pandemic."Growing multimillion-dollar wealth is a point that irritates millions of people who have lost their loved ones and experienced a decline in their health, wealth and livelihoods,"explained Chuck Collins, Director of the Inequality and Common Good Program at the Institute for Policy Studies.  "Worse, it undermines any sense that 'weare in this together',the solidarity needed to overcome the difficult months ahead," he added. But this year's crisis also underscored the role that multimillion-dollar capital and the companies that control it can play when the government's response is insufficient. Whether donating personal protective equipment, funding medical research and causes of social justice, or advocating vaccines, the ultra-trics, for good or worse, played a key role in responding to the year's problems.We recommend: The breakfast that changed the pandemic: How the founders of BioNTech decided to look for the COVID vaccineFew outside the biotechnology industry had heard of Moderna or BioNTech earlier this year. Now they are well-known names as the revolutionary vaccines based ?? courier RNA begin their crucial distribution around the world. Frenchman Stephane Bancel, CEO of Moderna, became a billionaire in the spring after the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company emerged as one of the first pioneers in the SARS-CoV-2 virus-dose race.The scientistGerman Ugur Sahin, son of Turkish immigrants, has focused his efforts on COVID-19 since January. With his wife Ozlem Tureci, medical director of BioNTech, they led the development of a vaccine that was the first to be authorized for use in the US.Sahin said his focus has always been science, not entrepreneurship, let alone wealth, but that doesn't mean his stake in the company is worth $3.6 billion. Meanwhile, MacKenzie Scott, Jeff Bezos' ex-wife, redefined what can be the 'philanthropy of the rich',donating nearly $6 billion in a few months. Despite that, he finished 2020 significantly richer than at first."This pandemic has been a 'demolition ball' in the lives of troubled Americans," Scott wrote in a medium post. "Economic losses and health outcomes have been worse for women, people of color, and people living in poverty. In the meantime, the wealth of billionaires has increased substantially."You may be interested in:21 days or 12 weeks?

Hong Kong police arrest 8 over university protestAssociated Press InternationalDecember 7, 2020 Monday 10:04 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 463 wordsByline: ZEN SOO, Associated PressDateline: HONG KONG BodyHONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong authorities arrested eight people Monday in connection with an unauthorized protest at a university campus last month, amid a widening crackdown on dissent in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.The arrests were made in relation to a demonstration at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in which more than 100 people protested a decision to hold graduation ceremonies online. Such ceremonies are often used as a way for students to express political views.Some protesters had called for Hong Kong's independence, and held up signs that read “Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our times,” which are considered to have secessionist notions and are outlawed under the city’s national security law.Police said they arrested eight people for an unauthorized protest and inciting secession, but did not specify who they were."We only arrested those who were shouting slogans, displaying flags that involved some national security concerns,” Li Kwai-wah, senior superintendent of police of Hong Kong's National Security Department, said at a news conference.Arthur Yeung, a graduate from the university who also ran in the city’s district council elections last year, is suspected to be among those arrested. A post on Yeung’s Facebook page said he was arrested at his home on Monday morning.Two district councillors, Isaac Lee and Eason Chan, were also arrested, according to posts on their respective Facebook pages.The eight arrested are currently being investigated by national security officers, according to local newspaper South China Morning Post, which cited unnamed sources.The arrests come as Hong Kong and Beijing have increasingly clamped down on dissent in the city, following Beijing’s imposition of a national security law in Hong Kong in June aimed at curbing months of political unrest and anti-government protests last year.The crackdown has prompted accusations that Beijing is violating the autonomy it promised when the former British colony was returned to China in 1997. It also has triggered warnings that the ruling Communist Party is damaging Hong Kong’s appeal as a global business center and one of Asia’s most dynamic cities.In response, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on more than 10 Hong Kong and mainland Chinese officials, including Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam.Asked about a report that the U.S. might sanction more officials, a Chinese government spokesperson in Beijing said that China would respond to any U.S. action with countermeasures.“We have made it clear many times that China has always resolutely opposed and strongly condemned U.S. interference in China’s internal affairs and the so-called sanctions against Chinese personnel on the basis of the Hong Kong issue,” foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said.Load-Date: December 7, 2020End of Document

First Solar Issues Public Comment on Ex-Im Bank NoticeTargeted News ServiceDecember 17, 2020 Thursday 6:53 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 931 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, Dec. 17 -- Mark Widmar, CEO of First Solar Inc., Tempe, Arizona, has issued a public comment on the Export Import Bank of the U.S. notice entitled "Proposal To Consider Changes to Content Policy With Respect to the Program on China and Transformational Exports". The comment was posted on Dec. 15, 2020:* * *Headquartered in Arizona, First Solar is the only American company among the worlds largest solar manufacturers by capacity, a list dominated by companies that are headquartered in and manufacture in China. First Solar employs over 2,500 people in the United States, with over half of them based in Ohio, where the company operates the Western Hemispheres largest solar manufacturing footprint.First Solars proprietary thin film photovoltaic (PV) solar module technology is uniquely American. Developed at the company's research and development (R&D) centers in California and Ohio, it is manufactured in just 4.5 hours using a sophisticated process that deposits a layer of its proprietary CadTel semiconductor that is just three percent the thickness of a human hair, on a sheet of glass.Unlike crystalline silicon (c-Si) PV, CadTel intellectual property (IP) is the result of American R&D and remains primarily in American hands thanks to First Solars commercial and financial success. In sharp contrast, China dominates the production of c-Si technology and its investment in R&D.At a time when the bulk of the worlds existing and planned solar manufacturing capacity is based in China, First Solar chose to double-down on its manufacturing investment in the U.S. to better serve its domestic customers. First Solar commissioned its second factory in Ohio in 2019, taking its total manufacturing footprint in the U.S. to 1.9GW. Through R&D and manufacturing investment, First Solars domestic footprint is expected to grow to almost 2.5GW by the end of 2021, with the potential to expand further, domestically or internationally.The ChallengeUsing direct and indirect state subsidies, China leverages the sheer scale of its companies to systematically dismantle the competition in the countries it targets, with the aim of achieving unrivalled dominance and securing the dependence of those countries on its industrial complex.Chinas rise from a nascent solar energy market to the worlds largest exporter of PV panels in just 10 years would not be possible without the mobilization of the Chinese government and a range of opaque, subsidy-driven mechanisms. China has largely succeeded in its mission to dominate global solar manufacturing with only two major companies that are not linked to or manufacture in China remaining in the game: one of these is First Solar.Today, First Solar is up against unrelenting and massive overproduction that is inconsistent with market-based investment behavior. All that production must be dumped somewhere at irrationally low prices.This threat will by no means go away, and Chinese solar companies with support from their enablers will find ways of circumventing even the most robust safeguard tariffs.Additionally, Chinese development financing institutions are known to offer opaque financing terms and debt financing schemes to developers, EPC companies, and asset owners to facilitate the use of Chinese products, actions that could also be perceived as unfair indirect subsidies.A change in mindset is necessary for American energy companies to successfully compete against China: its success is primarily driven by its ability to identify areas of strategic interest, acquire the know-how, and willingness to decimate the competition and win at all costs.Therefore, it is vital for institutions, such as the U.S. EXIM Bank, to develop an enablement strategy, in alignment with its partner agencies, designed to nurture the growth and expand the opportunity set for strategic energy sectors internationally, while staying true to the principles of free and fair trade.A Collaborative ResponseFirst Solar believes that there are relatively simple fixes that U.S. EXIM could implement to level the international playing field for transformational clean energy exports. These include:- Ensuring that projects that use US-manufactured PV modules qualify for full EXIM project financing. Sizing the debt amount based on the value of the U.S. equipment contract means that customers often have to run through hoops to acquire additional debt from other banks. This can erode the value of U.S. EXIM financing.- Decreasing exposure fees, especially in cases where U.S. exporters are competing exclusively with Chinese manufacturers.- Adding instruments to fund directly in local currencies to extend the full advantage of U.S. EXIM financing to countries where power purchase agreements are denominated in local currency, and not U.S. dollars.- Extending coverage to include more countries, especially those in Africa that could benefit from the deployment of utility-scale solar.First Solar would welcome any opportunity to work collaboratively with U.S. EXIM Bank to develop financing products that deliver an advantage.* * *The notice can be viewed at: https://beta.regulations.gov/document/EIB-2020-0011-0001TARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

U.S. ambassador makes Korean kimchi amid culinary disputeUPIDecember 15, 2020 Tuesday 12:09 PM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 338 wordsByline: ELIZABETH SHIMDateline: Dec. 15 BodyThe top U.S. diplomat to South Korea displayed his kimchi-making skills on a live-streamed cooking show in Seoul, amid a dispute between China and South Korea over the origins of the spicy cabbage dish.U.S. Ambassador Harry Harris said Tuesday he had "learned so much" about the kimchi-making process from South Korean celebrity chef "Big Mama" Lee Hye-jung, and used the hashtag #originalKimchifromKorea on Twitter to promote the dish."Looking forward to tasting it in 3 days!" Harris tweeted, referring to the fermentation process. Kimchi is made in large volumes during winter in Korea.Harris, who has often posted videos of himself cooking or enjoying Korean food, said during the show filmed at the ambassador's residence that there is "nothing more Korean than kimchi.""It's great to have Chef Big Mama Lee here at the Habib House to teach me how to make uniquely Korean, world-renowned food, kimchi," Harris said, according to Yonhap. "I had no idea that all this went into making kimchi, which I eat not every day but almost every day."Chinese media previously claimed the Chinese government deserved credit for developing standards for a dish eaten by Koreans.In November, Chinese state tabloid Global Times claimed China had been conferred recognition by the International Organization for Standardization, with a global certification for the Chinese dish pao cai. The certification also is recognition for kimchi as Chinese, Chinese media had said.The claims drew an angry response from South Koreans, and Seoul's agriculture ministry issued a statement refuting Chinese media claims."It is inappropriate to report [the pao cai certification] without differentiating kimchi from pao cai of China's Sichuan [province]," Seoul said, according to the BBC.Sandrin Tranchard, the ISO's communications officer, also corrected any claims that equated kimchi to pao cai."ISO24220 is about pao cai, and the document clearly says that it does not apply to kimchi," Tranchard said, according to Business Korea in early December.Load-Date: December 15, 2020End of Document

A NEW US-UK DEMOCRATIC AGENDA COULD BE ON THE HORIZONStates News ServiceNovember 12, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1048 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: LONDON BodyThe following information was released by Chatham House:The election of Joe Biden may confront the UK government with significant risks but, on defending democracy, there is an immediate opportunity.The UK government will have to work hard to insert itself into the Biden team's plans for a renewed transatlantic partnership as many of the new US administration's priorities, such as sanctions towards Russia, trade relations with China, taxation, and regulation of US technology companies will be US-EU negotiations with the UK excluded.A US-UK trade deal also now appears less likely in the near-term, and any failure to reach a compromise with the EU on the status of Northern Ireland could have severe repercussions for relations with the US, given the warnings from the president-elect.But opportunities certainly exist, as both governments want to see a successful climate summit in Glasgow in November 2021, both want to bring Iran back into a negotiation over its nuclear programme, and both want to strengthen NATO especially in cyber security where the UK is a world leader.And there is one area where rhetorically at least the Boris Johnson government appears to be uniquely well-aligned with a top priority for the incoming Biden administration.Prioritizing the defence of democracyDefending democracy has long been a clarion call from the US president-elect. In his speech to Chatham House in October 2018, Biden argued that the world 'is at an inflection point we have to prove that our democratic model can deliver, at home and abroad and the transatlantic community must rally together to counter the authoritarian alternative'.During his presidential campaign, Biden committed to host a Summit for Democracy in his first year in office, with the aim of participating governments pledging to fight corruption, defend against authoritarianism and the spread of the surveillance state, and advance human rights in their own countries as well as abroad.For their part, Johnson and his foreign secretary Dominic Raab have also made protecting democracy along with human rights and the international rule of law one of the top priorities for the UK government. And have backed up this rhetoric with concrete steps.After the Chinese government imposed a draconian National Security Law on Hong Kong, the UK government offered a pathway to citizenship to 2.9 million Hong Kong citizens eligible for British National Overseas passports and cancelled the UK's extradition treaty with Hong Kong.The government also inserted the so-called 'Magnitsky provisions' into the new UK Sanctions Act, immediately subjecting 49 individuals from Saudi Arabia, Russia, Myanmar and North Korea to targeted sanctions. And the UK was one of the first to sanction officials in the Belarus government over the suppression of democracy campaigners following the disputed elections.These steps can now serve as the foundation for a more modern, 21st century 'special relationship' between the UK and the US but to do so the government needs to help embed the protection of democratic values within a more institutional approach, and the UK's chairmanship of the G7 group of democracies in 2021 can help with this.Focus on the Summit for DemocracyJohnson said he will take this opportunity to galvanize a more cooperative international response to the pandemic and has also called for an expansion of the G7 to a 'Democratic 10' or 'D10' group of countries by bringing in Australia, India and South Korea.His stated goal for this new group is to develop 5G technologies to prevent China dominating this critical element of 21st century digital infrastructure, but so far his proposal reads more like a public relations exercise than a carefully thought through initiative.The proposal suffers by having a too narrow focus, bringing this new group together only on 5G cooperation, when the internal and external challenges to liberal democracies around the world are so much more far-reaching. And why then enlarge just to these three democracies, when only South Korea brings world-class 5G capabilities to the table?Consideration should be given to other democracies in Latin America, Africa or South East Asia, as inviting at least one from each region would give an expanded G7 much more relevance and credibility, especially as these are the regions where Chinese influence is increasing most rapidly.There is also the challenge of integrating an idiosyncratic India into the intimate grouping envisaged as the D10, as India has a long record of avoiding being corralled into the 'Western' camp. Even the China issue might not be enough to change its habits, especially at a time when the Modi government is being criticized for its approach to its Muslim population and has chosen not to criticize China for repression of its own Muslim Uighur population.Rather than launching the D10, the UK would do better to use its G7 chairmanship as a prelude to the US-led Summit for Democracy which promises to be more geographically inclusive, and gives Britain the opportunity to open conversations under its G7 presidency with a more diverse list of democracies than the current D10 proposal.Biden's summit also rightly promises to concentrate on the serious challenges democracies face at home. Britain could help define this agenda and host planning meetings between the NGOs and US tech giants that the Biden plan suggests bringing together as part of the process. Otherwise, Biden's summit may prove to be a recipe for contentious debate rather than action.At the very least, synchronizing US and British plans as soon as possible would avoid the risk of the two governments launching overlapping initiatives during 2021.But if they can go further and integrate their democracy agendas around meaningful steps, the US and UK would show their special relationship reaches beyond the practical realms of military, intelligence and counter-terrorism cooperation. Instead, the pair would be working together again, as they did in the 1940s, to bring about the sort of liberal democratic world order that both countries want to see.Image Boris Johnson arrives back at Downing Street in London on November 10, 2020 after chairing the weekly cabinet meeting at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.Load-Date: November 12, 2020End of Document

There is little objectivity in the arguments against HuaweiCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 6, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 763 wordsBodyThe incorporation of the 5G internet in our reality is an essential step to modernize Brazil.With 5G we will broaden the prospects of innovative solutions for cities, facilitate the day to day, incorporate higher degrees of technology into our modern agriculture, boost the efficiency of the energy sector and industry, open doors to the futuristic world of artificial intelligence, autonomous cars and the internet of things.The equation is simple: without the 5G, or if we unnecessarily postpone its installation, we will be left behind. Brazil now has 100,000 antennas for mobile phones, while China has 800,000 for 5G alone.The debate between us has acquired diffuse contours. For ideological reasons, mimicry of the Trump administration, unfounded fear of China, abstract fears of loss of sovereignty or suspicion of espionage, there are those who think that huawei company's participation in The Brazilian 5G should be banned.There is little objectivity and no technicality in the arguments that are public. In another sense, there are internet operators and all those who would like to see less ideology and more pragmatism in 5G planning.Because operators are responsible for the smoothness of services that reach people's businesses and homes, it's reasonable to believe they know what they're doing. In addition, telecommunications is a segment regulated and monitored by Anatel.Itamaraty verbally associated itself with an initiative of The Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompeo, called The Clean Network, without explaining correctly what he was adhering to. Since the support was purely declaratory and did not have the voice of the specialized bodies, let alone that of Congress, we do not have a real commitment to it. It's better that way.Some features of the internet market in the country cannot be ignored:a) 90% of the provision of telecommunications equipment is in the hands of two companies: Huawei and Ericsson. It is possible to glimpse the size of the damage at risk of efficiency and price increase for users in case of exclusion of one of them;b) there are thousands of small internet operators in remote regions who will have difficulty providing services if they no longer have access to their regular suppliers at reasonable costs;c) the delay in the incorporation of the 5G will be at least three to four years if the new antennas do not talk to the 4G equipment already installed;d) the practice of the market worldwide is that individual operators work with more than one equipment supplier;e) the price of broadband service for consumers in the USA, where there are political barriers to entry into the provision of equipment, is eight times higher than the price in Brazil or China.Huawei has publicly stated that it has been in Brazil for 22 years and has never given reason to doubt its future conduct. Invests here R $ 140 million annually in research and has two manufacturing units, in Manaus and Sorocaba. It produces equipment with 40% national content.In addition, it participates in multiple initiatives in the segments of agriculture, environment and education, following the social responsibility practices of Brazilian companies.Independent experts in Brazil have stated that it is possible to ensure the smoothness and audit of the 5G process, either through regulation or by actions aimed at ensuring the transparency of those who are in the market.Given these facts, the latest news is promising that the government will not introduce political or other elements in the process of assembling the 5G internet bid. As for China, it is necessary to properly assess the contours of our bilateral relationship.As has been recently remembered, we are suppliers of strategic products to your market. The Chinese, in turn, hold strategic assets in our reality. Several of our companies literally depend on their presence in the Chinese market to ensure profitability and even survival.We're not alone in this. Chinese gigantism has created a similar framework for European, American and Asian companies. At the same time, some Chinese companies accumulate in Brazil the experiences necessary to deepen their internationalization process.The reality that was built between the two countries offers everything to be mutually advantageous if the Brazilian and Chinese governments know how to cultivate an environment of trust. Politics, internal and external, is done so. Facing the great themes, building bridges, fostering dialogue, embracing the future in a determined way, without hesitation and without unfounded fears.Load-Date: December 7, 2020End of Document

Minister of Communications says 5G is national security issueCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 24, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 661 wordsBodyThe Minister of Communications, Fábio Faria (PSD), said on Tuesday (24) that 5G networks are a topic of "national security", which is why the GSI (Office of Institutional Security) has participated in the talks in the government about the auction of frequency of new technology that should be held next year."All countries [equivalent to] GSI participate, because it is also about national security. So GSI participates and participates. It has a fundamental role", said the minister, when answering a question about the presence of Minister Augusto Heleno (Institutional Security) at a meeting on Tuesday with President Jair Bolsonaro and with advisors of Anatel (National Telecommunications Agency) on the auction of 5G.At the meeting, Bolsonaro was presented to the counselor Carlos Baigorri, who is the rapporteur of the 5G notice at Anatel.According to Baigorri, the forecast is to complete the announcement internally at the agency early next year, and the auction of frequencies should take place at the end of the first half."The forecast is to have the notice approved by Anatel at the beginning of next year, and the bidding session should take place at the end of the first semester. This is the schedule with which we work and we will pursue it despite all the challenges that are in front of us", said the counselor, after the meeting with Bolsonaro.With preparations for the launch of the fifth generation of communications technology, Brazil has become one of the centers of the global dispute between the United States and China.The Americans have launched a diplomatic offensive to convince their allies -- including Brazil -- to prevent Chinese company Huawei from providing equipment to operators operating in the 5G market.Washington's argument is that Huawei conducts espionage at the behest of Beijing, which the Chinese government and the company deny.The Goal of the U.S. is for Brazil to create rules that prevent teles from buying Huawei, opting for equipment from suppliers such as Ericsson and Nokia.The operators, in turn, resist, since they already operate with the Chinese company currently in Brazil.Asked if the government would create any barriers to Huawei's action on The Brazilian 5G, Faria said it would not address "geopolitics.""Here we do not deal with geopolitics, what was treated here are the technicians of Anatel, the advisors who came to meet the President of the Republic", he declared.After the reporters' insistence, he said the topic was not in his area. "You want to enter an area that is not mine," he replied.Despite the minister's speech, the Bolsonaro government sent sympathy signals to the American election to bar Huawei,On November 10, for example, Itamaraty declared support for the principles of the Clean Network, an American network security initiative that aims to limit China's presence in the sector.The announcement took place in Brasilia during a visit by U.S. State Department Undersecretary of Economic Growth, Energy and environment, Keith Krach.Clean Network is the name of the American plan to exclude Huawei from 5G technology.The U.S. State Department does not use half words to define the goals of the initiative. On its website, U.S. diplomacy says the Clean Network is an approach to protecting citizens' privacy and sensitive information from companies from "aggressive intrusions of evil actors such as the Chinese Communist Party.?The support of Brazil to the initiative was celebrated on the night of Monday (23) by the son of the President of the Republic, Congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro (PSL-SP), in a series of messages on social networks.In addition, Bolsonaro received in mid-October an entourage led by Donald Trump's National Security Adviser, Robert O'Brien. The main objective of the U.S. mission was to lobby against the participation of Chinese companies in 5G, and officials in that country promised credit to Brazilian operators who bought equipment from other suppliers.Load-Date: November 25, 2020End of Document

The lack of any statement seeking to hold Russia responsible casts doubt on the likelihood of a swift response to the attacks and suggests any retaliation will be left in the hands of President-elect Joe Biden’s incoming administration. The new administration could have a menu of choices to select from in responding. They include criminal charges, sanctions or retaliations in cyberspace. Biden issued a statement Thursday saying cybersecurity would be a top priority.___States making bold new legal claims in 2 Google lawsuitsWASHINGTON (AP) — As a wave of antitrust actions surges against Google and Facebook, states in two lawsuits are stretching beyond the cases made by federal competition enforcers to level bold new claims. States are taking new legal gambits as they clamor to join the widening siege against the two once seemingly untouchable behemoths. The latest case came as dozens of states filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google, alleging that the search giant exercises an illegal monopoly over the online search market, hurting consumers and advertisers. It was the third antitrust salvo to slam Google in the past two months.___Google’s antitrust case won’t go to trial until Sept. 2023SAN RAMON, Calif. (AP) — The U.S. government’s attempt to prove Google has been using its dominance of online search to stifle competition and innovation at the expense of consumers and advertisers won’t go to trial for nearly three years. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta on Friday set a tentative trial date of Sept. 12, 2023. He also went over the ground rules for exchanging confidential documents and deposing top Google executives in the landmark case that the Justice Department filed two months ago. The lengthy wait for the trial reflects the complexity of a case seeking to defuse the power of a renowned company whose services are used by billions of people.___US stocks slide from records as wait continues for CongressNEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes pulled back from their record levels Friday as the wait drags on to see if Congress can reach a deal to send more cash to struggling workers and businesses. The S&P 500 fell 0.4%, a day after it and other major indexes returned to record heights. Hope that Congress may be nearing a deal to offer more support for the economy helped the S&P 500 post a 1.3% gain this week. So has enthusiasm about vaccines for COVID-19, which investors hope will get the economy back on the road to normalcy next year.___Fed finds big US banks in solid shape; keeps dividend limitsWASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve says the 33 largest U.S. banks are in strong shape despite the pandemic’s economic shock. The central bank says they have ample capital cushions against unexpected losses, enabling them to keep lending under the most severe straits. The Fed announced the results from a special second round of “stress tests” this year that it added because of damage to the economy from the virus outbreak. The tests showed that all 33 banks remain above their minimum requirements for capital to protect against risk. Still, regulators decided to maintain restrictions on banks paying out dividends.___US blacklists top Chinese chipmaker, alleging military tiesWASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration blacklisted China’s top chipmaker Friday, limiting the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.’s access to advanced U.S. technology because of its alleged ties to the Chinese military. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said his agency won’t allow such technology to help build the military of an increasingly belligerent adversary. SMIC has previously said it has no ties to the Chinese government. Commerce is putting more than 60 other firms on the so-called Entity List for allegedly being involved with the Chinese military, human rights violations, theft of trade secrets and the push to claim territory in the South China Sea.___Volkswagen facing ‘massive’ shortage of electronic partsFRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Volkswagen says it’s facing a massive parts shortage that’s causing production slowdowns at factories in China, Europe and North America. Suppliers of semiconductor parts diverted their sales to consumer products earlier in the coronavirus pandemic as auto sales dried up. But now the car business is bouncing back, and there aren’t enough semiconductor parts to go around.___The S&P 500 index fell 13.07 points, or 0.4%, to 3,709.41. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 124.32 points, or 0.4%, to 30,179.05. The Nasdaq composite gave up 9.11 points, or 0.1%, to 12,755.64. The Russell 2000 dropped 8.06 points, or 0.4%, to 1,969.99.Load-Date: December 18, 2020End of Document

Parallel Wireless Issues Public Comment on Ex-Im Bank NoticeTargeted News ServiceDecember 17, 2020 Thursday 4:27 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1023 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, Dec. 17 -- Parallel Wireless Inc., Nashua, New Hampshire, has issued a public comment on the Export Import Bank of the U.S. notice entitled "Proposal To Consider Changes to Content Policy With Respect to the Program on China and Transformational Exports". The comment was written on Dec. 14, 2020, and posted on Dec. 15, 2020:* * *Parallel Wireless, Inc. ("Parallel Wireless") is the leading U.S.-based Open RAN company delivering the world's first software-defined end-to-end 5G 4G 3G 2G Open RAN solutions. Parallel Wireless actively competes in markets around the world against Huawei and ZTE, among others.We offer the following comments to EXIM in support of the goal of advancing the comparative leadership of the United States with respect to China, and support United States innovation, employment, and technological standards, through direct exports in the area of Wireless communications equipment (including 5G or subsequent wireless technologies) - "Wireless Technologies".1. US leadership in the area of Wireless Technologies is an issue of critical importance to the US generally, but particularly as it relates to national security. Over the course of the last two decades, Huawei and ZTE have increasingly gained market share in the deployment of Wireless Technologies around the globe, to the point where Huawei now controls very large portions of the global telecommunications market.2. Parallel Wireless, along with other US companies, are championing a new Wireless Technology generally referred to in the industry as Open RAN. In short, traditional vendors like Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia have sold their hardware, software and professional services-based solutions in a manner that requires Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), like AT&T, Vodafone, Telefonica etc., to purchase everything from that particular vendor (i.e. vendor lock-in).Fundamentally, Open RAN splits the hardware and software components of the network and allows vendors to work with multiple players. This drives down the overall total cost of network ownership (TCO), encourages competition and, most importantly, enables innovation. MNOs around the world are adopting Open RAN to diversify their networks and the largest global MNOs have Open RAN initiatives and deployments well underway. Those initial deployments often happen in rural markets where success leads to larger deployments and ultimately to more urban markets where solution performance demands are high (i.e. "land and expand").As a result of these market dynamics, it's critical for Parallel Wireless and other new entrants to win in developing countries. We see this challenge most acutely in Africa and Latin America where Huawei is either the incumbent vendor and/or is offering extensive financing as part of their proposals. In these markets, access to EXIM financing is critical as we are effectively competing with both the resources of Huawei and the ability of the Chinese government to enable an almost limitless source of project financing (see "China 2025" generally).MNOs purchase Wireless Technology by selecting a prime vendor who is responsible for deploying the entire solution (e.g. 2G/4G coverage in a particular geography), even though in most cases that "prime" subcontracts out the majority of the required work. Please see Attachment 1 for more detail on average single site costs in Africa. Approximately 15-30% of the total cost (or "US content") is reflected in the radio and associated software supplied by the Prime, in this case Parallel Wireless. The remaining portions are commoditized materials (e.g. steel, concrete and other similar infrastructure) and services, but represent the vast majority of the initial project cost ("non-US content"). MNOs almost always require that those materials/services be provided by local suppliers. This is particularly true where the MNO is quasi-governmental and local job creation is a mandate.Given the realities of how MNOs purchase Wireless Technologies from a single prime on a "full turnkey" basis, it's very challenging to satisfy "content" rules as historically applied. Huawei, with access to its own customer-financing capital and that of the Chinese government, does not have these challenges. As strong and competitive as we believe our solutions to be, MNOs, particularly in developing countries, struggle to pass up such strong financing opportunities from Huawei and ZTE. In order for Parallel Wireless to be successful, it is critically important that we can access USG backed financing sources like those deployed by EXIM.3. The software-based solutions that Parallel Wireless and other Open RAN vendors supply represent the entirety of the actual Wireless Technology and the vast majority of the long-term value and ultimate cost-savings the MNOs are seeking. Without a change to the traditional approach on content restrictions, EXIM resources would be largely unavailable to US companies working hard to compete against Huawei and ZTE.About Parallel WirelessParallel Wireless is the first U.S.-based company challenging the world's legacy vendors with the industry's first unified ALL G (5G/4G/3G/2G) software-enabled Open RAN macro solution. Its cloud-native network software reimagines network economics for global mobile operators in both coverage and capacity deployments, while also paving the way to 5G. The company is engaged with 50+ leading operators worldwide.

The challenges of implementing the 5G network globallyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 6, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 465 wordsBodyFor several years, the world's leading telecommunications operators, smart technology manufacturers and major network equipment companies have been working and collaborating on the development of 5G network technology. While 5G's technological and commercial maturity is expected by the end of this year, some experts consider it essential to take into account a number of regulatory and innovation initiatives to experience network opportunities around the world. This in order to achieve in the coming years, adopting standards, identifying use cases, experimenting with technologies and developing the corresponding ecosystems.m{1084698}? Trade disputes between countries such as the United States and China affect competition that can be beneficial to consumers. On the other hand, the potential isolation of some 5G network developers can have negative consequences for inter-country connectivity.While Barack Obama's administration, during its later years, sought to put this issue, as well as that of industrial espionage, on the bilateral agenda with the Chinese government, Donald Trump's administration has veted the participation of certain brands in technological fields, arguing risks to national security and taking a more aggressive stance toward its Chinese counterpart, in order to achieve concessions in commercial and regional security matters.The world is the battlefield Despite political pressure from the Trump administration on countries that continue to do business and implement technology with Chinese companies, the 5G network continues to advance around the world. For example, the Norwegian government has decided to retain all partner options and set aside the ban on Chinese 5G equipment, as requested by the US country. For its part, the American administration has insisted on a possible threat to the cyber security of countries, due to the origin of the teams and an alleged relationship with defense and intelligence agencies.Another case is Portugal, where the United States lobbied the government not to use Chinese technology. In this regard, the Portuguese have stated that they are able to make their own decisions on the matter.In an interview with the Express Journal, George Glass, ambassador of the northern country to Lisbon, admitted that Portugal is a victim of the US-China trade conflict as part of the "battlefield" in Europe, where one of the conflict fronts is new technology.Portugal plans to work with China on the distribution of the radio signal.The telecommunications market needs innovative practices for the development of cities, campuses and smart businesses to integrate ICTs into industry and provide solutions tailored to each situation over the next few years to generate value for governments and businesses.m{1084697}BGHLLoad-Date: November 7, 2020End of Document

Activists are fighting for a renewable future in Sub-Saharan Africa. Chinese coal projects threaten to dirty those plansCNN WireDecember 10, 2020 Thursday 00:21Invalid date found for VDI: 1606649328 XCEDOCID: 0 LNI: 61GK-2XM1-JBSS-S0F2-00000-00. Date output 'as-is'.GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 2609 wordsDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  When the Ghanaian government agreed to coordinate with Shenzen Energy Group, a Chinese energy company, to build a 7,000-megawatt coal power plant in the country's Ekumfi district, Chibeze Ezekiel was concerned.He knew the proposed plant's wastewater, ash pit and mercury emissions posed serious health and environmental risks to the local fishing and farming communities. Access to clean drinking water was under threat from the plant's sulfur dioxide emissions and associated acid rain, and there would have been a clear impact on the regional climate.Ezekiel, who is from the capital, Accra, was already the founder of an NGO focused on good environmental governance and started what became a successful grassroots youth movement to stop the construction of the $1.5 billion plant, which included a shipping port to bring in coal. He ran a social media campaign emphasizing the threats of the proposed plans to the environment and local communities, detailing the possible long-term job creation that might come with a shift to renewable energy. The Ghanaian government canceled the project in 2016. The president, Nana Akufo-Addo, has since said new power policies will be based on renewable generation technologies such as wind and solar, as Ghana attempts to meet its carbon reduction commitments under the Paris Agreement. "If the world is trying to move away from environmental destruction because of the fossil fuel, then Africa shouldn't be seen as perpetuating that era," said Ezekiel over a webcall. He was awarded the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize for Africa on November 30, which honors the achievements and leadership of grassroots environmental activists.Ezekiel's victory is but one of many battles raging across the continent between activists, Chinese companies and African governments. Despite the reputational risk, Chinese companies have continued to finance the construction of coal plants, drawing ire from environmental activists, while African leaders are choosing quick fix solutions to electrify their countries. China's dirty belt and roadIn July, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged nations to stop financing the coal industry. "Coal has no place in Covid-19 recovery plans," he said via video link during an online summit hosted by the International Energy Agency (IEA).In September, Chinese President Xi Jinping promised that the world's biggest polluter of greenhouse gases would go carbon neutral by 2060. Speaking via video link to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, he called for a "green revolution;" this was the first time China had issued concrete goals to reach net zero carbon emissions.In 2018, Xi outlined a major push for green development in Africa as part of his global infrastructure policy, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Thirty-eight Sub-Saharan countries have signed on, hoping for improved infrastructure and energy development.But despite these promises to phase out dirty, high-carbon projects at home and abroad, Chinese banks and companies are still financing seven coal plants in Africa like the one planned for the Ekumfi district, with 13 more in the pipeline, mostly south of the Sahara.It was the China-Africa Development fund that was supposed to finance the coal power plant in Ghana, a private equity fund entirely backed by China Development Bank, a state government policy bank.Since 2000 the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China alone have supplied $6.5 billion of finance for coal projects in Africa, according to the Boston University Global Development Policy Center. China has a rapidly developing economy with many sectors dependent on fossil fuels and it currently contributes 26% of global carbon emissions, according to the Green Belt and Road Initiative Center (Green-BRI). In October, one month after Xi promised carbon neutrality, one of China's biggest energy construction firms, state-owned PowerChina, flew 223 Chinese employees into Zimbabwe to "accelerate" the expansion of the coal-fired Hwange Power Plant in the west of Zimbabwe. Two weeks later, the Chinese Ambassador to the country, Guo Shaochun, said in a tweet that the coronavirus pandemic "cannot stop the pace of cooperation between China and Zimbabwe" and that on completion of the project, the country's "power self-sufficiency capacity will be greatly improved." African governments have been happy to push ahead with dirty energy projects that only the Chinese will finance. The potential of a competent energy infrastructure fueled by cheap coal is enticing for a country like Zimbabwe, given the energy deficits slowing economic growth. The country has a national power demand ranging from 2,200-2,400 megawatts but only provides about 1,300, according to the Centre for Natural Resources Governance (CNRG). Energy shortages and power cuts are commonplace in Ghana, exacerbated by drought conditions because of the country's dependency on hydro-electricity. Its energy crisis left it vulnerable to energy developers and foreign investment before Ezekiel intervened. Like other countries investing in Africa, China also promises jobs, while taking advantage of lax policies and cheaper construction costs. Many governments choose to meet the demand for energy at the cost of a clean environment. This is despite every African country having ratified the Paris Agreement, apart from Angola, Libya, South Sudan and Eritrea."Policy on renewable projects is weak or non-existent in Africa," said Han Chen, the manager of international energy policy at the New York-based Natural Resources Defense Council, a non-profit international environmental advocacy group. "In China, environmental standards are pretty high, while South Africa or Kenya, for example, have energy policies that make it easier for investors to get involved."If current plans go ahead, the Chinese-backed coal power output in Africa currently being financed could treble by the time the country realizes its goal of carbon neutrality in 2060, according to Global Energy Monitor.The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not reply to a request for comment.Activism across the continentEzekiel is not alone in fighting for an Africa focused on renewable energy. The Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association (ZELA) has served letters to RioZim, formerly owned by London-listed mining corporation RioTinto, over plans for a 2,800-megawatt plant in the northern Gokwe region, west of the capital Harare. It will receive financial assistance from the construction company China Gezhouba Group Corporation (CGGC), and country risk insurance costs are likely to be covered by the China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), according to Global Energy Monitor. ZELA says the project is shrouded in secrecy and RioZim has not provided information on the environmental or socio-economic impacts of the plant.It is likely the land earmarked for the plant is under communal settlements, meaning there would be relocations and appropriation of land, say ZELA. Living near coal plants can cause respiratory issues, affect water quality and increase the alkalinity of soil, according to Thermal Watch. When contacted for comment, RioZim replied that "any media engagements are strictly prohibited" under the provision of their "non-disclosure agreements."South Africa's $10 billion, 3,000-megawatt Musina-Makhado power station will be financed by Chinese companies, both state-owned and private, with PowerChina alone contributing $4.5 billion, according to a memorandum of agreement signed in July 2018. It is part of the proposed Musina-Makhado Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in the Limpopo province north of Pretoria, a mega industrial hub which will span more than 6,000 hectares. A pre-feasibility study conducted by UK engineering consultancy Mott MacDonald said direct impacts of the site where the coal plant will be located include "detrimental effect on the biodiversity assets of the region," "disruption of ecological functioning and pollution of water resources" and "large-scale land transformation." There will be a "definite" release of "significant" greenhouse emissions, according to a preliminary impact assessment. "The country can't afford to be locking in to a hugely polluting, expensive and carbon-intensive mega project at a time when -- more than ever -- we need to act against the climate crisis, protect the resilience of vulnerable, water scarce areas and preserve our limited state funds and resources for projects with positive outcomes and benefits for all," said Michelle Koyama, an attorney at Cape Town's non-profit Centre for Environmental Rights (CER). CER has objected to the Musina-Makhado SEZ because of these negative climate impacts and say it will take water away from areas already experiencing deficits. South Africa has been plagued by droughts and water scarcity, and is extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The Limpopo Provincial Government, PowerChina and the Chinese embassy in South Africa did not respond to requests for comment.East of Pretoria, Kusile Power Station is being constructed with $2.5 billion from China Development Bank and sponsorship from Eskom, South Africa's biggest polluter. The South African environment department launched a criminal investigation against the electric public utility company in May 2019 over air quality concerns at its Kendal Power Station. Eskom confirmed to CNN that it has been summoned to appear in front of a regional court to answer to criminal charges related to the Kendal plant. These include exceeding the emissions limit on air pollutants and supplying false or misleading information to an air quality officer.Fossil fuel advocates argue that the energy provided by the plants is vital for development, but centralized coal has failed to deliver electricity to over 2.5 million households in South Africa and can be costly, according to Greenpeace. "Despite the government promising to provide the people of South Africa with affordable electricity, many of them cannot afford Eskom's coal-powered electricity -- the costs of which continue to escalate," said Koyama. "Ironically the same communities who live next door to these coal plants, and have to suffer their impacts daily, do not have reliable, affordable electricity in their homes."A 2017 report written by Mike Holland, a member of the European Association of Environmental and Resource Economist, estimated that more than 2,200 deaths a year could be attributed to coal-fired generation in South Africa. Lung cancer, heart disease stroke and respiratory infections were common killers. No coal plant brings health benefits and Chinese companies are not alone in receiving criticism for financing their construction. In 2014 Safi Energy Company secured $900 million from the Bank of Japan to build a coal plant in the west of Morocco. Described as a double standard and a danger to public health by Greenpeace, the environmental NGO estimated the plant is the cause of 59 premature deaths in the North African country annually, a figure that would be more than four times lower if Japanese emission limits were applied. Between 2014 and 2017 European and US banks like HSBC, JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank loaned $921 million to the potentially criminal Eskom, according to data compiled by a number of non-profit and environmental organizations."Coal investments come with a lot of human rights violations," Nqobizitha Ndlovu, a constitutional and human rights lawyer who is the legal adviser to ZELA, told CNN in a phone conversation. "There are a lot of complaints here in Zimbabwe, and across all of Africa, that these projects do not respect the right to be healthy, to have a safe and clean environment or the right to water."When asked whether they would reevaluate their relationship with Eskom in light of the criminal charges, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and JPMorgan Chase declined to comment.However while western companies have pulled back from investment in coal plants, Chinese plans are still forging ahead. "You're locking a lot of countries into a coal-dependent pathway and the pollution can be horrendous," said Chen.A green futureAfter seeing his 2016 campaign empower communities, Ezekiel is hopeful. He spent four days speaking with chiefs, elders, fishermen and other local groups in Ekumfi, explaining the positives of renewable energy, especially the possibilities for long-term employment."We agree that there are people who are unemployed and that jobs are critical," said Ezekiel. "But we believe that there's a better alternative in the area of renewable energy which guarantees employment not only for the short term, but for a long time."Chen agrees, saying there was "pushback" from communities. "There's sometimes a disconnect between a national bilateral agreement and what those on the ground actually want," he said.Ezekiel launched the Children for Climate Action (C4C) initiative to involve children (as well as young people) in the fight against climate change and the no coal debate. As a national coordinator of 350 Ghana Reducing our Carbon (350 G-ROC), Ezekiel is also encouraging other African countries (particularly Kenya, South Africa and Nigeria) to resist foreign investment in coal. "A huge mobilization of young people is needed to create more public awareness and education, but we must provide skills and facilities for the youth to be employed, so we can demonstrate that energy indeed provides more job opportunities," Ezekiel said. The pan-African activism has had some success and in recent years coal projects have been shelved in Nigeria, Mozambique and Botswana, among others. In recent months, Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa and chairman of the African Union, has dramatically shifted his country's energy stance toward renewables. About 11,800-megawatts will be added to South Africa's energy capacity by 2022, with "more than half" coming from renewable sources, he said in an address on October 15, adding that steps like these can help achieve a "sufficient, secure and reliable energy supply." CER has successfully stopped the construction of a proposed 557-megawatt plant at Thabametsi alongside environmental organizations Earthlife and Groundwork. It is challenging the environmental authorization for another at Khanyisa, where a water-use licence has already been rescinded. On the intercontinental stage, Ezekiel is encouraged by the election of Joe Biden as the next president of the United States. "I would say it is a victory not only for the US, but for the world as a whole," he said. "He has made comments to the effect that he is prepared to put America back into the Paris agreement. That's a very big plus."China has actually become the largest green finance market, with about 11 trillion yuan ($1.7 trillion) in green credit and about 1 trillion yuan ($150 billion) in green bonds, according to Green-BRI. Growing this market has helped control the pollution and ecological damage resulting from 40 years of extreme economic growth. Ultimately coal is a fading industry and China is almost alone in financing coal power in Africa. As banks in other countries continue to snub the fuel, it's likely that Chinese money will build the last ever coal plant. If the economic behemoth wants to take its commitment to fighting global warming seriously, it needs to stop financing coal plants overseas. For Ezekiel and other activists, the war is turning in their favor. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Another judge blocks Trump's TikTok ban; app still in limboAssociated Press Financial WireDecember 8, 2020 Tuesday 3:32 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 398 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has blocked President Donald Trump's attempts to ban TikTok, the latest legal defeat for the administration as it tries to wrest the popular app from its Chinese owners.The Trump administration had tried to ban the short-form video app from smartphone app stores in the U.S. and cut it off from vital technical services. TikTok sued, arguing such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.Judge Carl Nichols of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., said in a ruling Monday that the Commerce Department “likely overstepped" its use of presidential emergency powers “and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by failing to consider obvious alternatives."Nichols is the second federal judge to fully block the Trump administration's economic sanctions against the app as the court cases proceed.The Trump administration has alleged that TikTok is a security threat because the Chinese government could spy on app users’ personal data. TikTok has denied it’s a security threat but said it’s still trying to work with the administration to resolve its concerns.Trump in September gave his tentative blessing to a proposal by ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, meant to resolve U.S. national security concerns by having the U.S. companies Oracle and Walmart invest in TikTok. Oracle would manage U.S. user data under the arrangement. But a federal agency still has to review and finalize an arrangement.A government deadline for ByteDance to complete the deal passed on Friday, and it's not clear what the status of the agreement is.The Treasury Department, which chairs the agency reviewing the deal, said Friday that the agency "is engaging with ByteDance to complete the divestment and other steps necessary to resolve the national security risks arising from the transaction.”The Trump administration’s aggressive tactics are part of its latest attempt to counter the influence of China. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment.While President-elect Joe Biden has said TikTok is a concern, it’s not clear what his administration will carry on the Trump administration's ongoing attempts to secure a ban, or increase the involvement of U.S. companies.Load-Date: December 8, 2020End of Document

FCC Commissioner Rosenworcel Issues Remarks on Communications Networks and Supply ChainTargeted News ServiceDecember 11, 2020 Friday 7:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1010 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Federal Communications Commission issued the following remarks on Dec. 10 by Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel on rules to secure communications networks and supply chain through FCC programs (Docket No. 18-89):Our 5G future is about connecting everything. It is about moving to a new networked world that will open up possibilities for communications that we cannot even fully imagine today. By exponentially increasing the connections between people and things around us, this technology could become an input in everything we do--improving agriculture, education, healthcare, energy, transportation, and more. The data we derive from all of these connections is powerful. It will inform machine learning, artificial intelligence, and the next generation of innovation across the economy.This is exciting. But these opportunities also bring big security challenges. That's because they create a broader attack surface for cyber events, with more devices and a huge increase in traffic load. So we need networks that are trustworthy, resilient, and secure--and we need them right now. And we will not have secure networks in the United States if we do not first have a secure communications supply chain.That is why what the Federal Communications Commission does today is important. We take another step in our multi-year effort to secure the communications supply chain. Specifically, we put in place a system to replace insecure equipment from the Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE, to the extent that it is present in our networks today. This is critical because we know that there are vulnerabilities that come with this equipment--and those vulnerabilities could provide foreign interests with access to our networks and jeopardize the security of communications in the United States. But while we authorize this effort today, to implement it in full requires an appropriation from Congress, consistent with the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act. As this decision demonstrates, we are ready.But we can't stop here. This is only the beginning. Because we have so much more work to do to ensure that our communications future is secure. China is playing the long game. By using statesponsored technological development to extend its economic reach, it could put itself in a position to gather intelligence, steal intellectual property, and bring down regional communications in times of crisis.And despite our efforts here, the Chinese government is still actively consolidating its global 5G authority. It has been funding and building infrastructure across Africa, Latin America, and Central and Southeast Asia. It is a central player in writing international standards and securing patents for emerging 5G technologies. It is developing trade alliances like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership that could sustain its advantages in international supply chains and create more opportunities for Huawei and ZTE to produce and sell within the region.What does this mean? It means what we do here --banning two vendors and removing their equipment from our nation's networks--is a start, but it is not enough. The United States needs a more comprehensive approach to secure 5G--both at home and abroad.First, we need a coordinated national strategy for 5G security. Just two months ago the Government Accountability Office warned that there are serious deficiencies in our present national security plan developed pursuant to the Secure 5G and Beyond Act. We need to do better. When we do, it should include a robust plan for research and development, incentives for carriers to bring nextgeneration connections to rural and underserved communities so we do not deepen our digital divide, and across-the-board efforts to boost competition. In other words, rather than trying to match the tactics and scale of industrial policy in China, the United States should play to its strengths to help expand the market for secure communications equipment.Second, we need to stimulate this new market for communications equipment by supporting the development of open radio access network technology here on our shores. Today, most carriers rely on just a few European or Chinese equipment makers to build out their networks--and that market is shrinking. But we can open this ecosystem to new providers by supporting the development of open RAN, which has the potential to increase diversity and competition in communications equipment. In this new market we can make security a priority and not an afterthought. And we may be able to do so at lower cost, making this virtualized equipment more competitive with state-subsidized equipment from Huawei and ZTE. On top of that, it pushes the equipment market to where the United States is strongest--in semiconductors and software. The FCC should help this effort by establishing open RAN testbeds that bring together operators, vendors, vertical interests, and government agencies.Third and finally, we need to address the security challenges posed by Chinese equipment by building a consistent and united front with our allies and not alienating them. The United States represents roughly a quarter of global gross domestic product. When we lock arms with other likeminded nations, we are stronger. So let's not go at this alone. Let's build on multilateral efforts like the Prague Principles and use our collective leverage to shape how communications networks develop and ensure that new technologies honor democratic principles and human rights.We have our work cut out for us. As this proceeding clearly demonstrates, network security and national security go hand-in-hand. Together, they provide a foundation for 5G innovation and economic security. If we do this right, we will multiply the opportunities we have to support American values in the deployment of next generation communications both at home and abroad. And that is how we engage China from a position of strength--and grow American leadership in digital technology.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7321667 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 11, 2020End of Document

The year the world gave up waiting for Big Tech to fix itselfCNN WireDecember 28, 2020 Monday 10:34 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1501 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  The world's biggest tech companies faced a global reckoning in 2020 as the United States, the European Union and even China took dramatic steps to curb their dominance. That pressure won't be going away in the new year. Dozens of US states and the federal government sued Facebook and Google over claims that the companies engaged in anticompetitive behavior that tightened their grip on the online marketplace. Europe, meanwhile, recently unveiled legislation that would give regulators sweeping new power to take on those American tech companies.The regulatory fervor has also spread to China. Officials last week announced an antitrust investigation into Jack Ma's Alibaba, and turned up the heat on the company's financial affiliate Ant Group less than two months after blocking its blockbuster stock market debut at the last minute.While many of these developments have unfolded at a rapid pace in recent weeks, the desire to rein in Big Tech is not new. For years, governments have been grappling with the massive amount of influence these companies have over the online economy and the flow of ever-more valuable digital information. But huge antitrust fines, onerous data protection laws and interminable Congressional hearings have failed to bring tech companies to heel, and politicians are now signaling that they want to do more to prevent market abuse and an explosion of harmful online content and misinformation.Advancements in computing, data storage and global digital connectivity enabled major tech firms to balloon in size, said Dipayan Ghosh, co-director of the Digital Platforms and Democracy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School. Now, a handful of those companies have developed sophisticated artificial intelligence systems that have granted them an unprecedented amount of control over content, advertising and personal data."It's always been inevitable, but when you have kind of an open, green field for market innovation, there will be some first movers," Ghosh added. "We're going to see some monopolies emerge, and that's what's happened over the past 10 years."While this global regulatory crackdown appears to be unfolding all at once, analysts note that each of the world's major powers have their own --- and at times, competing --- reasons for expanding their oversight of the tech industry. The United States and Europe have directed their efforts on curtailing the power of America's most powerful firms. But in China, where Google and Facebook have been locked out of the market for years, authorities are looking for ways to exercise tighter control over their own tech behemoths.A flood of lawsuits in the United States The US government has been scrutinizing Big Tech for a while. A landmark federal lawsuit filed in October against Google followed a yearlong antitrust probe into the company, for example. And in the months since then, US authorities have turned up the heat even more. Dozens of states have now sued Google over claims that the company has operated an illegal monopoly in the markets for online search and search advertising. Facebook has received similar treatment, and now faces twin antitrust suits that accuse the social media giant of abusing its dominance in the digital marketplace. While the US-led crackdown has targeted these companies on antitrust grounds, the pressure comes amid broader questioning about their impact on democracy and the flow of information online. Misinformation and allegations of bias were at the forefront of concerns about the recent US election."I think basically, what you're seeing ... is essentially a question of who controls this information, and consequently, access to the electorate," said Michael Witt, a senior affiliate professor of strategy and international business at INSEAD, the international business school.It's tough to predict how these cases will be resolved. Some of the arguments the US government is now trying to make --- including that Facebook's purchases of Instagram and Whatsapp have allowed it to snuff out competition --- may not stick, since those acquisitions were cleared by authorities years ago. "The government now wants a do-over, sending a chilling warning to American business that no sale is ever final," Facebook Vice President and General Counsel Jennifer Newstead said in a statement earlier this month. And analysts have pointed out that the United States may not be willing to apply other forms of pressure, such as new legislation, on the tech industry.America probably will not want to enforce antitrust rules at the expense of losing its grip on the flow of information in many other parts of the world, Witt said, referring to the large amount of power Silicon Valley's tech giants have in Europe and elsewhere. "I think there will be considerable resistance to any kind of attempt to somehow do anything that could actually take away this advantage for the United States," he added.Striking a balance in EuropeOn the other side of the Atlantic, authorities have been focused on reining in tech companies for years. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) --- a watershed privacy law --- was enacted in 2018 and gave people much greater control over how their personal data is collected and used.This year, Europe has signaled that it wants to get even tougher. The European Commission released a set of draft policies earlier this month that would give regulators sweeping new powers to take on US tech giants, threatening huge fines and raising the prospect of breakups or bans for repeat offenders.The United Kingdom, which left the European Union earlier this year, has its own plans. Tech companies that fail to remove or limit the spread of illegal content will face fines of up to 10% of their annual sales."I'm unashamedly pro tech but that can't mean a tech free-for-all," UK Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said in a statement earlier this month. "We are entering a new age of accountability for tech to protect children and vulnerable users, to restore trust in this industry, and to enshrine in law safeguards for free speech."Witt of INSEAD noted that there's strong political support across Europe for taking some kind of action. But he added that Europe's options are somewhat limited. After all, the tech companies in the European Union's cross hairs are all based in the United States. "I think they will be taking a bit of time, trying to come up with something that is, on the one hand, legally watertight," he added. "And then on the other hand, something that does not annoy the United States."Maintaining control in ChinaBeijing has not missed out on the push for more regulatory action, though the country has been on a very different path to the West in terms of its tech industry."In China, you are dealing with a different set of players that are homegrown," said Nathan Bush, the head of antitrust and competition for Asia at the law firm DLA Piper.American companies like Google and Facebook have long been shut out of the Chinese economy, allowing domestic firms Alibaba, Tencent and others to flourish. "Chinese competition regulators are going to be confronting the same sorts of questions that they see in the rest of the world, but it's a different cast, and you've effectively factored out any concerns about foreign investment and market access, because the door is already shut," Bush added. The country's top political leaders have called out antitrust concerns as a big issue headed into 2021. At a Dec. 11 meeting, the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party --- the top decision-making body --- pledged to promote reform, "strengthen antitrust and prevent disorderly expansion of capital."It's too early to tell how far Beijing's campaign may go. Bush said he expects China to focus on issues of consumer protection, among others. That appears to already be happening: Just last week, China's top market regulator summoned representatives from Alibaba, Tencent, JD.com and other big internet firms and warned them against dumping goods at unreasonably low prices, creating monopolies and abusing consumer data for profit. It also said it would probe alleged monopolistic behavior by Alibaba.Bush and others also noted that China's central government has a lot of tools aside from conventional competition law if it wants to keep its tech companies in check. Look, for example, at Ma's Ant Group IPO, which was pulled after the Chinese billionaire met with government officials and now faces the prospect of a massive overhaul. Just over a week before the offering was scuttled, Ma had publicly criticized Chinese regulators for stifling innovation by being too risk averse. "The options are, in the end, endless," Witt said. "The objective is not necessarily to increase competition in different fields. The objective is to make sure that the [Chinese Communist Party] stays in power."TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Huawei and U.S. tensions down: began negotiating release of imprisoned heiress in CanadaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 8, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 384 wordsBodyChinese telecom giant Huawei began discussing an agreement with the US administration so that its CFO, Meng Wanzhou,can return to China two years after his arrest in Canada, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.Meng, daughter of the founder of the world's second-largest smartphone manufacturer, has been on parole in Vancouver since his arrest in late 2018 at the Canadian city airport.The United States requests its extradition. He accuses her of lying about Huawei's ties to Iran,a violation of the US embargo imposed against the Islamic Republic.His arrest caused a major diplomatic crisis between China and Canada.Two Canadian citizens, arrested in China shortly after Meng, remain in detention in the Asian country on charges of espionage.According to the paper, Meng's lawyers negotiated with the U.S. Department of Justice an agreement that would allow the detainee to return to her country,as long as she admits some of the charges against her.His lawyers and the Justice Department are negotiating this week in hopes of reaching a compromise before Donald Trump leaves office on January 20,according to this information.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying did not confirm this information on Friday and merely asked Canada again to release Meng."Meng Wanzhou is innocent," the spokeswoman stressed, accusing Canada of playing "an embarrassing role" in this matter.Consulted Friday by AFP, Huawei also declined to comment on this information.According to the paper, an agreement between the two sides could facilitate the release of the two Canadians detained in China for just under two years, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.Both the Chinese government and Huawei deny Washington's accusations against Meng, and Beijing claims that the US administration seeks to weaken a leading Chinese company.Huawei is targeted by an arsenal of U.S. sanctions, which accuses the telecommunications group without evidence of spying for the communist regime.As part of the Washington-led boycott, U.S. companies were banned from selling equipment to Huawei, including Google with the Android operating system,and convinced many of its allies to dispense with China for the installation of its 5Gnetworks, the fifth generation of mobile internet of which the Chinese giant is a world leader.Load-Date: December 9, 2020End of Document

It's a big day for Alibaba. You wouldn't know from its stockCNN WireNovember 11, 2020 Wednesday 12:47 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 994 wordsDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  Chinese consumers are flexing their muscles after a difficult start to the year. That's good news for e-commerce giant Alibaba, which has been in hot water.What's happening: China's annual Singles Day online shopping bonanza is on pace to break records despite the Covid-19 crisis. Alibaba said Wednesday morning that the sales frenzy has so far pulled in more than 372 billion yuan ($56 billion). The total includes the first 30 minutes of the event, along with an earlier three-day period that was added to boost sales. The figure is a sign of the strength of the recovery in China, the only major economy expected to grow this year, my CNN Business colleague Sherisse Pham reports."China's economy has seen a strong recovery and Chinese consumers' purchase behaviors have already returned to pre-pandemic levels, if not higher," Forrester analyst Xiaofeng Wang said.For brands scrambling to recover from months of shuttered shops and consumers stuck indoors, China is a much-needed bright spot.A survey from market research firm Oliver Wyman found that 86% of Chinese consumers are willing to spend the same as or more than what they did during Singles Day last year.But this time around, there's a shadow over Alibaba and its billionaire founder Jack Ma.Remember: Last week, Chinese regulators slammed the brakes on the highly-anticipated IPO of Ant Group, Alibaba's financial affiliate, at the very last minute. Regulators cited "major issues" that might cause Ant "not to meet the listing conditions or disclosure requirements."Industry watchers think Ma's public criticism of Chinese regulators for stifling innovation may have played a role.Public criticism of the Singles Day event may indicate that Ma is still out of favor with Beijing, casting a pall over his businesses.See here: State-run news network CCTV recently called for "fewer tricks" by shopping platforms during the Singles Day shopping season, saying they should not cheat consumers.Shoppers probably don't care, so long as they get a solid deal. But tensions between the Chinese government and some of the country's biggest tech giants are an ongoing threat.Watch this space: Alibaba's shares in New York are down more than 14% since Ant's IPO was pulled. In Hong Kong, shares of Alibaba and rival JD.com each plunged more than 10% since Tuesday, putting both stocks on track for their worst week ever.Fear has been triggered in part by signs of a crackdown out of Beijing, my CNN Business colleague Laura He reports. On Tuesday, China's top market regulator outlined guidelines it says are intended to prevent internet monopolies.The drafted rules signal a "much more vigorous regulatory environment," said Jeffrey Halley, Oanda's senior market analyst for Asia-Pacific.Wall Street to Trump: This isn't 2000The Trump campaign is waging a legal war over the 2020 presidential election results. Wall Street, on the other hand, is already moving on.Even though President Donald Trump is promising to fight and has not conceded, there's little doubt among investors that Joe Biden will become the 46th president of the United States on Jan. 20, my CNN Business colleague Matt Egan reports.Trump's flurry of lawsuits is being viewed as a sideshow, experts say. The real focus among investors, analysts and market strategists is on Pfizer's blockbuster vaccine announcement, Biden's agenda and cabinet, and expectations that Republicans will retain control of the US Senate despite runoff races in Georgia."For most investors, the perspective is that the election has been settled," Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup's chief US equity strategist, told CNN Business. "Providing evidence of shenanigans and irregularities is required in a court of law. And I haven't seen any."He added that the probability Trump is able to overturn the result is "fairly remote at this point."While the Trump campaign team has sought to draw parallels to the 2000 recount that left the outcome hazy until mid-December of that year, investors aren't buying it. They note that Trump trails by too many votes in too many states for recounts to sway the results."We see the likelihood that recounts and legal challenges could overturn this outcome as remote and favor looking through any resulting market volatility," BlackRock strategists wrote in a note to clients Monday.Can a struggling Lyft pivot to delivery?During a pandemic, people aren't eager to share cars. Delivery networks, however, are more important than ever --- and Lyft is paying attention.The company, whose business has been slashed nearly in half due to the coronavirus, needs to make some changes, my CNN Business colleague Sara Ashley O'Brien reports.The company said Tuesday that its revenue fell 48% in the third quarter compared to one year ago, to just below $500 million. Active riders dropped 44% over the same period to 12.5 million.Like its rival Uber, Lyft is striving to achieve profitability next year. It thinks it can reach that goal "even with a slower recovery." But Lyft clearly needs to find new ways to offset ride-sharing declines. Uber's Eats food delivery business has been a bright spot for the company during a rough 2020, and has been growing rapidly.The idea: Lyft executives told analysts that while the company is not interested in launching a delivery platform like Eats, it sees opportunities to help companies with transport logistics.Retailers, restaurants and small businesses "want a partner, someone to help them move their goods from point A to point B, but one that does not step in between them and their customers," CEO Logan Green said. "This delivery model plays to our strengths, including making full use of our existing technology."Investor insight: Wall Street may be on board. Shares are up 6% in premarket trading.Up nextDisney and Tencent are among the companies due to report earnings on Thursday.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Misled and misinformed: Why Vietnamese voters make up the largest Asian demographic in favor of TrumpThe Stanford Daily: Stanford UniversityNovember 10, 2020 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1607 wordsByline: Hana DaoBodyHistorically, most Asian American voters tend to vote "blue," and many Asian Americans found themselves voting for Joe Biden for this year's election. By most, I mean every Asian group aside from Vietnamese voters. A recent poll survey done by advocacy groups - AAPI Data, APIA Vote and Asian Americans Advancing Justice - in September 2020 found that Vietnamese voters were more likely than any other group of Asian Americans to vote for Trump. Vietnamese American voters have also been very vocal for their support of Trump: MAGA rallies have been held by Vietnamese Republicans in Santa Ana, California, and Houston, Texas. Vietnamese voters have always tended to lean Republican, so to some it may be no surprise that they are sticking to party loyalty and voting for Trump. This pattern reflects that of Cuban voters, who also tend to lean more conservative than other Latino groups - perhaps because both Cubans and Vietnamese refugees fled communist regimes thus sharing similar political views. Even so, the spread of misinformation that runs rampant through Facebook and other social media platforms has also contributed significantly to their strong admiration for Trump and the villainization of Biden.For example, The Washington Examiner, a paper known for having a conservative bias and right-leaning tendency, published an article implying that Biden believes America has no obligation to help Vietnamese refugees. The article, though, took past Biden's words out of context. In 1975, Biden clearly distinguished between helping Vietnamese refugees leave Vietnam and providing American military aid. He was supportive of the former, but not the latter. He stuck to the anti-war platform that got him elected, clarifying he would like to bring home American troops.The myth that Biden "does not care about" Vietnamese people because he voted against the 1975 Congress Bill H.R. 6755, also known as the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act, has also played a part in discrediting Biden and the Democratic party in the eyes of Vietnamese voters. This act was sponsored by Peter Rodino Jr. - a Democrat, not a Republican. The bill enabled 130,000 refugees from Southeast Asia to enter the U.S. and allocated $455 million to help them resettle, an amount equal to roughly over $2 billion today. While it is true that Biden did not vote in favor of this bill, it's important to note he did not vote on it at all. In 1975, Biden had difficulty commuting from Delaware to D.C. - members of his family passed away in late 1972 and his sons were seriously injured as well. During this period, Biden spent a lot of time with his family and ended up missing several votes in Congress. Due to these salient family issues, it would be inaccurate to say Biden voted against this particular bill. Biden, however, was a part of the Foreign Services Committee, whose approval was essential to getting the Bill out to the floor for a vote in the first place. In stark and ironic contrast to this welcoming of Southeast Asian refugees, Trump's administration has reduced protections for Vietnamese war refugees by expanding the category of refugees that can be deported. The administration moved to deport thousands of Vietnamese refugees back to Vietnam - despite that these refugees fled that very country 40 years ago.One aspect of Trump's campaign that has propelled his success with Vietnamese American voters is his blatant and straightforward "anti-China" rhetoric. The Vietnamese community is critical of China due to China's prior colonization of Vietnam and continued imperialist encroachment onto Vietnamese land. Tensions run high between the two countries, as seen in the conflict over territorial claims of islands, boat standoffs and anti-Chinese propaganda growing on social media in Vietnam. Trump's stance against China has allowed Vietnamese people to feel as if they are receiving sympathy. Some Vietnamese are grateful for the anti-China rhetoric as they also believe Trump will stand up against the Chinese government. Trump's actions and alignment, however, speak differently from this rhetoric: He swings back and forth from blaming China for hurting the country's economy to cozying up to the country's president at his private Mar-A-Lago club. His flip-flopping raises many questions for Americans especially when it was revealed by The New York Times that Trump pays taxes to China, approximately $200,000, which is glaringly different from the $750 in American taxes he was reported to have paid. China's relationship with Trump remains unique - Forbes reported $5.4 million flowing from a state-owned bank to Trump Tower, to which Trump maintained connections to when he became the 45th president, a possible violation of Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution that says no federal official shall "accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State" without the approval of Congress. It does not appear that all, or even most, of the profits from Trump's dealings with China have been donated to the U.S. treasury either, because only around $190,000 was donated last year from profits from working with foreign governments. Based on the arrangement between Trump Towers and its renter, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the bank still lists their address within Trump's building.Trump has been inconsistent in his critical stance to China. He reportedly approved of China imprisoning Uyghur Muslims in concentration camps and claimed that China and U.S. relations have never been better, despite his continual China-blaming since he began campaigning in 2016. Earlier this year, Trump praised President Xi Jinping multiple times for working to get the pandemic under control in China.In addition, Trump's moves to "stand up" to China have sometimes backfired. Some Vietnamese voters are under the impression that Trump has been doing good since he has set trade sanctions and tariffs on goods from China, believing that the president is standing up to the "big bully" China. The sad reality is that these tariffs have been economically damaging, hurting American consumers and industries more than helping. The cost of these tariffs fell onto consumers and businesses, mainly those relying on imported goods and export industries which faced retaliation from other countries.While many Vietnamese voters continue to be outspoken in their passion for Trump, there is a growing divide within Vietnamese families as the younger generations align their support with Biden rather than Trump. This year's intense election has revealed a strong gap between the conservative parents and left-leaning children of not just Vietnamese, but all families across America. In the case of young Vietnamese American voters like myself, the struggle to raise awareness among our traditional, conservative family members is definitely an uphill battle, but it is a necessary one.Many Vietnamese voters are not armed with a picture full enough to support a candidate who will actually work in their best interests, as well of those of the country as a whole. This lacking is especially true for the older Vietnamese generation, who often rely on foreign media sources for their news due to a language barrier. Biased news both from overseas in Vietnam and Vietnamese-language based sources has contributed significantly to the relationship with the older, conservative-leaning Vietnamese community and Trump. Some news aggregator sites including The Interpreter and PIVOT's Viet Fact Check have arisen out of progressive and young Vietnamese people's efforts to address the lack of nonpartisan and accurate news articles that are available for those who have difficulty with English. For now, the divide among Vietnamese families will continue to grow - unless we can address how neither group is on the same page, due in part to this gap in information. It is absolutely essential that more news sites make their news available in Vietnamese, Spanish and other languages for audiences. Tech companies and social media platforms also have a responsibility today as well to flag and fact-check false information circulating. And for young voters, we must realize our civic responsibility encompasses more than just voting once every four years. It is so important for us to reach out to others around us every day and respectfully encourage a greater sense of awareness to better our community.Contact Hana Dao at hanadao 'at' stanford.edu.The Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and letters to the editor.

Business HighlightsAssociated Press InternationalDecember 4, 2020 Friday 10:27 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 954 wordsByline: The Associated PressBody___Gripped by surging pandemic, US employers cut back on hiringWASHINGTON (AP) — With the viral pandemic accelerating across the country, America’s employers sharply scaled back their hiring last month, adding 245,000 jobs, the fewest since April and the fifth straight monthly slowdown. At the same time, the unemployment rate fell to a still-high 6.7%, from 6.9% in October as many people stopped looking for work and were no longer counted as unemployed, the Labor Department said. November’s job gain was down drastically from a 610,000 gain in October. Friday’s report provided the latest evidence that the job market and economy are faltering in the face of a virus that has been shattering daily records for confirmed infections.___US adds Chinese chipmaker, oil giant to security blacklistBEIJING (AP) — The U.S. government has stepped up a feud with Beijing over security by adding China’s biggest processor chip maker and a state-owned oil giant to a blacklist that limits access to American technology and investment. The restrictions add to steps taken by President Donald Trump against China since losing his re-election bid in November. The Pentagon added four companies including Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and China National Offshore Oil Corp. to a list of entities it said are linked to a “military-civil fusion” strategy. The Chinese government accused Washington of abusing national security claims to handicap fledgling Chinese industrial competitors.___More record highs for stocks as hopes grow for economic aidNEW YORK (AP) — Stocks returned to record highs on Wall Street Friday as traders took a discouraging jobs report as a sign that Congress may finally move on delivering more aid for the pandemic-stricken economy. The S&P 500 rose 0.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8%. In another bullish signal, small-company stocks, which stand to benefit greatly from an improving economy, rose much more than the rest of the market. Investors are also banking on hopes that the upcoming distribution of coronavirus vaccines will start getting the global economy on the path back to normalcy some time next year.___Biden predicts ‘bleak future’ if Congress doesn’t act on aidWILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden is predicting the economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic will only get worse if Congress doesn’t act quickly to pass an aid bill. He also expressed concern that so far he’s seen “no detailed plan” from the Trump administration on how to distribute an approved coronavirus vaccine, but said he and his team are working on their own proposal to fill in the gaps.___COVID-19 relief: What’s on the table as Congress seeks dealWASHINGTON (AP) — Optimism is finally building in Washington for a COVID-19 aid bill that would offer relief for businesses, the unemployed, schools and health care providers, among others struggling as caseloads are spiking. Under pressure from moderates in both parties, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have initiated late-game negotiations in hopes of combining a relief package of, in all likelihood, less than $1 trillion with a separate $1.4 trillion governmentwide omnibus spending bill. Success is not certain and considerable differences remain over details, such as whether to issue a second round of $1,200 direct payments to most Americans.___Google AI researcher’s exit sparks ethics, bias concernsMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) — Artificial intelligence scholar Timnit Gebru helped improve Google’s public image as a company that elevates Black computer scientists and questions harmful uses of AI technology. But internally, Gebru, a leader in the field of AI ethics, was not shy about voicing doubts about those commitments. That’s until she was ousted this week in a dispute over a research paper examining the societal dangers of an emerging branch of AI. The furor over Gebru’s abrupt departure is the latest incident raising questions about whether Google has strayed so far away from its original “Don’t Be Evil” motto that it now routinely ousts employees who challenge management.___Nissan pulls out of Trump emissions fight with CaliforniaDETROIT (AP) — Nissan says it will no longer support the Trump administration in its legal fight to end California’s ability to set its own auto-pollution and gas-mileage standards. The announcement Friday is another sign that a coalition of automakers backing the outgoing administration is fracturing. General Motors ended its support for the Trump administration’s position last week. Nissan says it’s pulling out because of its confidence that discussions between the industry, California and the administration of President-elect Joe Biden can develop one national standard.___US trade deficit rises 1.7% to $63.1 billion in OctoberWASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. trade deficit widened 1.7% in October to $63.1 billion. The politically sensitive gap in the trade of goods with China and Mexico grew. The Commerce Department reported Friday that the gap between the goods and services the United States sold and what it bought abroad rose from $62.1 billion in September. The deficit in the trade of goods with China rose 9% to $26.5 billion and the gap with Mexico rose 10% to $11.8 billion. So far this year, the overall trade gap with the rest of the world has risen to $536.7 billion, up 9.5% from January-October 2019.___The S&P 500 index rose 32.40 points, or 0.9%, to 3,699.12. The Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 248.74 points, or 0.8%, to 30,218.26. The Nasdaq added 87.05 points, or 0.7%, to 12,464.23.

Chinese tech companies bet big on India. Now they're being shut outCNN WireDecember 11, 2020 Friday 3:06 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1448 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  India and China's fast-growing tech sectors have been caught in the crossfire of an intense geopolitical standoff this year. While both will suffer from the showdown, Chinese tech companies have more to lose. Tensions between the two countries have been rising since June, when they engaged in their worst conflict in decades: a bloody clash along a disputed border in the Himalayas that left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead. In the following weeks and months, Indian officials banned apps from Chinese tech giants Bytedance, Alibaba and Tencent, and reportedly restricted embattled telecommunications equipment maker Huawei from participating in India's 5G network. Both countries agreed to deescalate military tensions in September, but that hasn't brought much relief for businesses caught in the dispute. ByteDance's marquee international app, the short-form video platform TikTok, is still banned in India. And last month, the Indian government banned dozens more Chinese apps, citing national security concerns. The pressures are a problem for companies based in both countries, but the pain is particularly acute for Chinese companies trying to grab a piece of India's explosive internet growth. India is now home to nearly 750 million internet users, more than double the number in 2016, according to the latest government data. Atlas VPN, a market research firm, estimates India will have 1 billion internet users by 2025. Locked out of that market, Chinese companies "stand to lose riding the ascent of possibly the world's third-largest economy by 2050 and the market with the world's second-largest internet users," said Shirley Yu, visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and founder of a company that assesses strategy, business, and political risk for companies working in China. They can 'do nothing'Several Chinese tech companies are already feeling the loss. ByteDance's TikTok lost 200 million Indian users when it was banned in late June. That's twice as many users as the app has in the United States. The Beijing-based company hadn't yet made money on TikTok in India, according to Greg Paull, principal at market research firm R3. But the company had spent heavily on establishing and expanding its slice of the market. "And now they can only watch the local, copy version apps taking over their users and do nothing," said Paull. ByteDance and other tech companies also need a lot of data to build better products. India's internet users are demographically diverse and speak many different languages, making the country's data highly prized, according to Gateway House, an Indian foreign policy think tank.Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a blog post earlier this year that the company's efforts in India "have deepened our understanding of how technology can be helpful to all different types of people." "Building products for India first has helped us build better products for users everywhere," he wrote. For internet applications developed by Google and other tech companies, data is like oxygen, said Gateway House director and board member Blaise Fernandes.Apps need a lot of up-to-date data to keep algorithms competitive, according to Fernandes. He predicts that the deprivation of data from India will handicap Chinese apps' development for global markets."The global strategies of Chinese tech firms are now being hijacked," said Abishur Prakash, a geopolitical futurist and co-founder of Center for Innovating the Future, a consulting firm that works on technology and geopolitics. Chinese companies that had relied on India to build and test new products have seen those plans thrown into jeopardy, he said. "As India pushes out Chinese tech, a chaotic business landscape is emerging. Now, everything that Chinese tech firms have bet on to succeed in the Indian market is being picked apart," Prakash said. Investments in valuable Indian start-ups at riskBeyond developing their own products, Chinese tech companies had been investing heavily in India's tech startups, pouring some $4 billion into the sector since 2015, according to Gateway House. But India's tightening rules on foreign investment could constrain China's ability to cash in on the country's internet boom. In April, the Indian government signaled it was taking steps to curb China's growing influence. It announced that foreign direct investments from countries that share a land border with India would be subject to more scrutiny. The move was "indicative of India's desire to carefully control the inward flow of Chinese investments and assets into the country," according to Sukanti Ghosh, South Asia head for the Washington-based think tank Albright Stonebridge Group. Then, amid the border clashes in June, the otherwise investor-friendly government of Maharashtra, a western state in India, paused or canceled a number of agreements signed with leading Chinese companies earlier this year, Ghosh said. Questions have already been raised about the long-term viability of at least one splashy tech investment.Reuters, citing four people with direct knowledge of the matter, reported last week that Alibaba affiliate Ant Group was thinking about selling its 30% stake in One97, the parent company of popular digital wallet Paytm, because of the rising tensions and tougher competitive landscape. Both companies denied the report. Ant said in a tweet that the Reuters story is "untrue." Paytm said in a statement that the story is false and misleading. "There has been no discussion with any of our major shareholders ever, nor any plans, about selling their stake or becoming the controlling shareholder," a Paytm spokesperson said.India could suffer, tooWhen it comes to digital payments and financial technology, Ant is widely considered to be a global leader. And if Ant and other Chinese tech companies disengage because of political tensions, India could miss out on leading edge technology. "In the short term, India will lose out. Tencent is the biggest 'strategic investor' in India's startup world. Meanwhile, Xiaomi invested almost $500 million in India --- in a single year," said Prakash. "Clearly, Chinese tech firms are pumping huge amounts of cash into India's economy," he added. Smartphone maker Xiaomi invested heavily to build factories in India, and has so far generated employment for some 50,000 Indians, according to local reports. The anti-China sentiment in the country and calls to boycott Chinese products could put those jobs at risk. Fernandes, of Gateway House, said that other tech companies are already rushing in to fill the void left by Chinese investors, and predicts that India will not suffer for long. "Post the ban on Chinese apps it is estimated that $25 billion [of foreign direct investment] has found its way to the Digital India story, so in no way" is India losing out, he said. Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani's digital company Jio Platforms may have accounted for much of that. It alone has secured more than $20 billion from marquee investors, including Google, Facebook and KKR, this year. Achieving digital sovereignty For the world's two most populous countries, there appears to be no resolution in sight. India's Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar suggested it could take years for negotiations between China and India to reach their conclusion given the unprecedented build-up of military forces on both sides of the border.Progress in relations with China requires peace and tranquility along the countries' shared border, Jaishankar told a local newspaper last week. If that's disturbed, as has been the case this year, then obviously, the rest of the relationship cannot be unaffected, he added.In its own way, India is taking a page out of China's playbook. Beijing has barred many foreign tech firms from operating freely in China. Some of the world's most popular platforms like Google search and Facebook are banned in China, because of the country's strict censorship laws. Locking out global players also had the added side effect of helping homegrown companies like Baidu and Tencent flourish. Even so, India still remains far more open to foreign tech firms than China. "While India may be going after Chinese tech firms, it is not going after anyone else ... [and] still remains open to the world," Prakash said. "With that said, the one area where New Delhi and Beijing are on the same page is that both nations want to define tech on their own terms," he added. "For these two nations, controlling tech is equal to sovereignty."--- Swati Gupta contributed to this report.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Australia.- Morrison tila as "disgusting" a Beijing montage of an Australian soldier slitting an Afghan child's throatCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 30, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 397 wordsBody    MADRID, 30 (EUROPA PRESS)   Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday demanded an apology from the Beijing government and described as "disgusting" a photo montage published by a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry in which an Australian soldier degregates an Afghan child, in reference to the recent report that canberra authorities published about the killings and human rights violations his troops would have committed in Afghanistan.   "Shocked by the killing of Afghan civilians and prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts and ask that they be taken responsibility," said Chinese Foreign Secretary Zhao Lijian, along with a digitally altered image in which an Australian soldier smiles as he slits the necks of a child he assures he is not to fear, because they are bringing them peace.   "The Chinese government should be totally ashamed of this publication," said Morrison, who added that it is awaiting a public apology from the Beijing authorities, as it is an "outrageous" and "deeply offensive" image for Australians."   The image published in Zhao's Twiter account adds to the other un reunions that both countries have been representing in recent years, with China imposing tariffs on some of the Australian products and Morrison's government ensuring that Beijing would be behind several cyberattacks on its institutions.   China-Australia relations worsened markedly in 2018 when Canberra banned the operations of Chinese technology giant Huawei on its 5G network. Tension has increased this year after the country supported research on the origins of coronavirus.  "There are undoubtedly tensions between China and Australia, but that's not how they need to be handled," Morrison said to the press.   An investigative team appointed by the Australian authorities themselves published a report on possible war crimes committed by their troops during their presence in Afghanistan, where "credible information" was found that 25 current or former members of the Defence Forces were involved in serious crimes, either by committing them or by being "complicit."   The document, which was presented on 18 November, calls for criminal investigation, prosecution and removal of the medals of 19 soldiers. So far, it has been confirmed that a dozen of them will be terminated due to their involvement in the killing of 39 civilians. Load-Date: December 1, 2020End of Document

House Commerce Committee Issues Report on Utilizing Strategic Allied Telecommunications ActTargeted News ServiceNovember 30, 2020 Monday 9:52 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2091 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, Nov. 30 -- The House Energy and Commerce Committee issued a report (H.Rpt. 116-589) on the Utilizing Strategic Allied Telecommunications Act (H.R. 6624), which aims to support supply chain innovation and multilateral security. The report was advanced by Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., D-New Jersey, on Nov. 16.I. PURPOSE AND SUMMARYH.R. 6624, the "Utilizing Strategic Allied Telecommunications Act of 2020" or the "USA Telecommunications Act", was introduced by Representatives Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ), Greg Walden (R-OR), Doris O. Matsui (D-CA), and Brett Guthrie (R-KY). This bill establishes a grant program to help secure communications networks in the United States through promoting competition in the supply chains of Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) 5G network equipment, accelerate deployment of Open Network Equipment, and promote the inclusion of security features that enhance the integrity and availability of such equipment. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is responsible for administering the grant program, including establishing the criteria for awarding the grants, and for establishing a committee to advise on technological developments to inform the grant program and government efforts to support Open RAN 5G Networks.II. BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATIONUnited States communications service providers rely heavily on equipment and services manufactured and made available by foreign companies. The increasingly globalized market for communications equipment and services has increased competition and opened the door to cheaper goods for consumers but poses new challenges for the United States, particularly for ensuring the security of the communications supply chain.In particular, the United States identified individual Chinese telecommunications firms, including Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd (Huawei) and its affiliates, as posing significant threats to U.S. commercial and security interests./1/ Their susceptibility to state influence over business operations results in China having "the means, opportunity, and motive to use telecommunications companies for malicious purposes," such as espionage and cyberattacks./2/ In April 2018, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission found that the Chinese Government has "invested significant state capital and influence" on state-owned enterprises to strategically place these companies in the U.S. telecommunications supply chain./3/--/1/Department of Commerce, Department of Commerce Announces the Addition of Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. to the Entity List (May 15, 2019) (press release)./2/House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Investigative Report on the US National Security Issues Posed by Chinese Telecommunications Companies Huawei and ZTE, 112th Cong.

Huawei sells its Honor brand, burdened by U.S. sanctionsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 17, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 524 wordsBodyChinese telecom giant Huawei announced Tuesday that it has sold its Honor phone brand, an operation, according to the company, needed to save this brand from the "terrible" pressures of U.S. sanctions on the supply chain.The private group based in Shenzhen, southern China, is in the spotlight of President Donald Trump who suspects he is spying for the Chinese government, refuteing the company.Huawei, one of the world's top three smartphone manufacturers, entered the Washington blacklist last year to prevent it from purchasing technologies and components that are indispensable for their phones.A consortium of 40 Chinese companies bought Honor, including distributors, agents and other companies whose survival depends on this brand, which sells cheap phones, Huawei and this consortium said Tuesday in two releases.The Chinese giant claims that production is "under terrible pressure," as the group fails to supply electronic components due to U.S. sanctions."The sale will help Honor sellers and suppliers overcome this difficult period," the group said in a statement, which hopes that as it exits Huawei's orbit, the company will be able to re-supply normally.Honor, a brand aimed primarily at young people and low budgets, sells, according to Huawei, about 70 million phones a year.Following this sale, Huawei no longer has any action and "is involved in the management of the business or the decision-making of the new Company Honor", he said.The U.S. government has taken steps to drive Huawei out of the market in the United States, deter U.S. companies from collaborating with the company, and cut off the global supply of semiconductors and other components.The military past of the company's founder, Ren Zhengfei, as well as his membership in the Chinese Communist Party, have fueled suspicions about the regime's influence on the group.Washington has multiplied pressures on its allies to prohibit Huawei's 5G equipment, arguing the risks in terms of cybersecurity.The Chinese company has categorically denied U.S. accusations, and attributes the offensive it is a victim of America's desire to eliminate a powerful competitor.In fact, the sale of Honor will undoubtedly drag the manufacturer in his career for global smartphone sales, to his South Korean competitors Samsung and American Apple.Huawei became the world number one in the second quarter of 2020, before falling to second place in the third quarter, according to the Canalys Study Office."This acquisition is a market-issued investment to save the Honor industrial chain," the consortium of buyers said Tuesday."It's the best solution to protect the interests of consumers, sellers, suppliers, partners and Honor employees."Buyers include publicly traded companies, including the retail and online sales giant Suning.com.Huawei has received a series of bad news in recent weeks.In late October, the group announced a sharp slowdown in its turnover in nine months.He was also left out of the future 5G network in Sweden following a similar decision this summer in the UK. However, Swedish justice has suspended the exclusion while ruling on the substance of the case.Load-Date: November 18, 2020End of Document

Trump blew up TikTok and now nobody knows what's going onCNN.comNovember 11, 2020 Wednesday 6:32 PM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHLength: 1205 wordsByline: By Brian Fung, CNN BusinessBodyAfter narrowly avoiding a ban in the United States earlier this fall, TikTok is again veering toward an imminent crisis with the Trump administration.On Nov. 12, TikTok faces a deadline that requires the company be spun off from its Chinese parent, ByteDance.The deadline comes from an executive order President Donald Trump signed on Aug. 14. But the order doesn't specify any penalties or consequences if the deadline is breached. That's created fresh questions about the government's intentions toward TikTok, one of the world's fastest-growing social media services with 100 million users in the United States alone.Though Trump has tentatively approved a deal involving TikTok that may satisfy him, it isn't final yet. With the Nov. 12 deadline mere hours away, TikTok filed an emergency petition with a federal appeals court on Nov. 10 to preempt it."In the nearly two months since the President gave his preliminary approval to our proposal to satisfy those concerns, we have offered detailed solutions to finalize that agreement," TikTok said in a statement Tuesday night.The company added that without an extension of the Thursday deadline, though, "we have no choice but to file a petition in court to defend our rights and those of our more than 1,500 employees in the US."What happens next is unclear, legal experts say, providing another reminder of how Trump, in the run-up to the election as he was flailing in the polls, sought to ignite an international business controversy that's plunged the future of a massive social media platform into doubt. Though he pressured TikTok to come up with a deal on a short timeline, Trump has seemingly set the issue aside as he tries to rescue his presidential campaign with baseless allegations of election fraud.Now, the rest of us are scrambling to make sense of the pieces.Trump forces a dealTrump has made TikTok a national target, fitting the company into a broader anti-China narrative that's become a hallmark of his administration as he has tussled with Beijing over trade and commerce. Trump alleges that TikTok poses a national security risk because its Chinese owner could be forced to hand over TikTok's user data to the Chinese government. TikTok has denied the claim and said TikTok stores US user data in Virginia and Singapore out of the reach of Chinese law.Cybersecurity experts called the risk largely hypothetical, but that didn't stop the White House from trying to freeze out TikTok in the United States with a pair of executive orders. In response, TikTok sued the Trump administration, calling the White House's move "heavily politicized." TikTok users have played their own role in the saga, gobbling up tickets for a Trump campaign rally in Tulsa, Okla., in an effort to reduce Trump's crowd size. The stunt prompted the Trump campaign to buy ads urging supporters to back a petition to ban TikTok, which TikTok then cited in its lawsuit as evidence that the executive orders were political and retaliatory.Trump's first executive order foreshadowed restrictions on TikTok that were to take effect in September and make it illegal to have any business dealings with the company. In carrying out that order, the Commerce Department tried to prohibit TikTok from US app stores, banning downloads of the app. And it also said that in mid-November, internet backbone companies would be banned from carrying TikTok's traffic. Both measures have now been temporarily blocked by federal judges in two separate lawsuits challenging the order.The second order, which is the target of TikTok's petition this week, requires that ByteDance divest TikTok. The order followed an investigation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a federal body chaired by the Treasury Department that reviews mergers and foreign investment deals for potential impacts on US national security.The order requiring the sale of TikTok is light on specifics, saying that the company must be divested by Nov. 12. It does not say what such a deal must look like, or what TikTok must do to keep operating in the United States. It doesn't say what happens if TikTok fails to be sold by the deadline.The White House and the Commerce Department declined to comment. The Departments of Justice and Treasury didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. TikTok declined to comment.Trump tentatively approved a deal involving TikTok, Oracle and Walmart meant to address his claims that the social media platform poses a national security risk. The proposal would see TikTok reorganized as a new, global company headquartered in the United States, with US investors accounting for a majority of the new company's ownership. Walmart declined to comment. Oracle didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.But that doesn't mean the requirements of the second order have been fulfilled. The arrangement has yet to be finalized by CFIUS or the White House, raising the possibility that Nov. 12 could come and go without a resolution. (Even if it wins US approval, the deal must still be blessed by Chinese regulators, which adds an extra wrinkle that's entirely separate from the confusion over Trump's orders.)So many questionsCould TikTok face further penalties if its divestiture deal isn't approved by the Nov. 12 deadline? We don't really know, experts say, largely because the executive orders are so open-ended.One possibility is that within the next 24 hours, CFIUS could move to accept the terms of the deal and recommend that Trump give his final approval, said Harry Broadman, a partner at Berkeley Research Group and a former CFIUS official.Another path forward may be that CFIUS could provide a 30-day extension to TikTok as the proposed deal continues to be reviewed. (TikTok has said that despite requesting the extension, the company has so far not received one, even with time running out.)A third potential outcome is that TikTok misses the deadline and Attorney General William Barr takes the company to court to have Trump's order enforced. The order authorizes Barr to "to take any steps necessary" to enforce it."At that point, the court would presumably address the issues that ByteDance raised in its petition and decide on the extent to which it will enforce the order," said Christian Davis, a CFIUS attorney at the firm Akin Gump.But even that path provides few answers. It's unclear how a court might rule, and what steps it may require of TikTok, or what penalties might apply if the company ? or the government ? fails to adhere to the court's instructions.Ultimately, despite successfully outmaneuvering Trump for now on much of the first executive order ? the ban, including the app store and internet infrastructure restrictions ? TikTok still faces an uncertain road ahead.The radio silence from the US government isn't helping. After creating an enormous outcry over TikTok ahead of the election, the Trump administration now appears unable to bring the crisis to a swift conclusion.That could mean TikTok's proposed deal might well not close until President-elect Joe Biden takes office. And how his administration might weigh in is even more ambiguous, according to experts, who say it is far too early to speculate.Load-Date: November 12, 2020End of Document

Ex-Hong Kong lawmaker asks Europe to provide 'safe haven'Associated Press InternationalDecember 2, 2020 Wednesday 3:03 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 510 wordsByline: JAN M. OLSEN, Associated PressDateline: COPENHAGEN, Denmark BodyCOPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — A Hong Kong pro-democracy activist who is visiting Denmark urged European nations on Wednesday to allow protesters in Hong Kong "a safe haven from the terror” of China's Communist Party.“The situation in Hong Kong is getting worse by the day and it is important that the world knows that Hong Kong is no longer a free city,” Ted Hui said in an email to The Associated Press.Britain has extended residency rights for up to 3 million Hong Kongers eligible for British National Overseas passports, allowing them to live and work there for five years.Britain also has followed the United States, Australia and Canada in suspending extradition agreements with Hong Kong, a city of 7.5 million people which became a special administrative region of China in 1997 after Britain returned control of the territory to Beijing, which promised it autonomy over local affairs for 50 years.Hui arrived in Denmark on Tuesday “to change the Danish government’s stance,” according to Thomas Rohden, chairman of the Danish China Critical Society, which organized his trip. A former Hong Kong legislator, Hui was able to get his passport back from the government and a visa after receiving an invitation from Danish lawmakers.“When I began in politics, I never dreamed that the day would come that I could be jailed but democracy is fragile, and it is duty of all democrats everywhere to stick together in times of crisis. I call upon European countries such as Denmark to follow in the footsteps of Great Britain and allow protesters in Hong Kong a safe haven from the terror of CCP,” he said.“All politicians around the world should stand up for democracy together and face the realities of the situation in Hong Kong. If democracies do not stand together, we will fall together,” Hui said.Denmark Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said he was not aware of the visit and had “no plans to meet him.”Denmark is “conducting a critical dialogue with the Chinese authorities on the very worrying situation in Hong Kong, as well as coordinating closely with the EU,” Kofod said in a statement.Hui’s parents, wife and two young children left Hong Kong on a flight on Wednesday, Hong Kong online news portal HK01 reported. It did not mention their destination.Since the start of the protests in June 2019, Hong Kong police have made more than 10,000 arrests.Prominent pro-democracy figures who have been arrested include activists Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow, as well as media tycoon Jimmy Lai, an outspoken advocate for democracy. Hui was arrested in May over an incident in the Legislative Council in which he dropped a rotten plant and attempted to kick it at the body’s president.Activists have accused the Hong Kong government and the central Chinese government in Beijing of tightening control over the semi-autonomous territory in response to demands for more democracy. They say authorities are destroying the autonomy promised to the city, a global financial center with greater freedoms than mainland China.___Zen Soo in Hong Kong contributed to this report.Load-Date: December 2, 2020End of Document

Science, economics and politics: the Covid narrated on podcastCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 4, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 3303 wordsBodyThis 2020 left an acceleration of years in terms of digital connection. People in confinement used platforms to order food, medicines and even remote consultations to follow the standards recommended by the World Health Organization.One of the most booming media in these months was the podcast, which, being very personal, allows a conversation in the distance, stay informed without having all the senses on and give a respite from the screens.?? Stay informed on our Google News channelIn the months of confinement we have seen social, political and economic movements around the world and in PODCAST OEM, we were given the task of registering them.In the following list you will find the development of the Covid-19 with several perspectives, which you can listen to from wherever you are. Each project will continue to develop the topics that interest you the most.Deep with Hiroshi Takahashi is a project in which the reporters of the Mexican Editorial Organization take the microphone and share their experiences and research, we share some episodes:China's disinformation epidemicChina was the focus for being the place where the contagion of the COVID-19 virus, better known as coronavirus, began. Many entities accused the Chinese government of controlling and hiding the true data about the virus. This caused the true extent of the virus to be not understood and other countries not being able to prepare properly. The international news editors Israel López de El Heraldo de México and Víctor Hugo Rico Alvarez de El Sol of Mexico, tell us the difficulty of accessing the information of a country that hides the truth.Jalisco: the state that took precautions before the PresidentIn Mexico, cases of Covid-19 coronavirus infection have only increased. Jalisco was the first state to act and take the necessary preventions even faster than the federal government. Despite this, he has suffered from lack of resources, as in many hospitals in the country, as well as cases of assault on medical personnel. Isaura López, a reporter from El Occidental, talks about how government measures have helped or affected the state during 2020.More fear of poverty than coronavirusDuring the first months of confinement many businesses in Mexico City temporarily closed to prevent the spread of Covid-19. However, in many areas of the metropolis, shops did not abide by the new rules. Many traders and tianguists live on their daily sales, and even if they wanted to, they couldn't afford to stay home. Karla Díaz, web editor at El Sol de México, tells how people who are more afraid of poverty than coronavirus are earning a living.Guerrero must fight two pandemicsEach state of the country has taken the necessary measures to serve those affected by Covid-19. However, many states already had an inefficient health system and were fighting diseases that are not related to coronavirus, such as dengue. In Guerrero, cases of dengue were on the rise and even surpassed covid-19 contagions. Pedro Radilla, reporter for El Sol de Acapulco, tells how this state is facing a health crisis generated by two different diseases.Quarantine doesn't work in prisonsOne of the health measures that has been taken to stop the spread of the Covid-19 virus has been to avoid taking to the streets. However, this measure does not work for Mexico City ins and outs. Precarious conditions in the city's overcrowded prisons pose a latent risk for the virus to spread. Cecilia Nava,Mexico's El Sol reporter tells us why contagion within prisons would become a death sentence.Sexservers won't leave their corner in the face of pandemicIn the midst of the health crisis, mexico is not only afraid of Covid-19 contagion. Added to this is the lack of work that has led vulnerable groups such as sex workers not to have to eat or where to live. Cecilia Nava, reporter for El Sol of Mexico, tells us how difficult it is for them to survive during a pandemic, especially when they carry great social stigma."We are not heroes, we also get sick"Increased Covid-19 virus infections caused hospitals to exceed capacity and doctors to do their jobs in adverse conditions. Because doctors put their health at risk by caring for those who need it in this pandemic, much of the population considers them heroes. But they don't see it that way. They're at constant risk every day. Karla Díaz, web editor of El Sol de México, tells us what the day-to-day life of a resident doctor is like during pandemic times.Spreading misinformation in ChiapasIn much of the country, coronavirus infections continue to increase. But in Chiapas, fear and misinformation have spread faster than the virus. Some municipalities have expressed their dissatisfification at the actions of sanitization and fumigation by the state government, as they fear that the authorities are spreading the Covid-19 among the population. Irrational fear caused a group of people to destroy and loot a hospital in the municipality of Las Rosas on 11 June. Faced with these violent acts, the city council decided to suspend fumigations to maintain order. Oscar Gómez, reporter for El Heraldo de Chiapas, tells us why many populations in Chiapas distrust the authorities, even if they put their health at risk.New wave of contagion in the maquiladoras of Ciudad JuárezIn mid-2020, Chihuahua was one of the first states where the traffic light reopened to the Covid-19 went from red to orange. Although new outbreaks of the virus were reported in Ciudad Juarez, several manufacturing industries in the city returned to their activities. These workplaces became sources of contagion, reporting in June at least 62 cases of coronavirus among workers, of which 25 died.This was not the first and last time contagions occurred inside the maquiladoras. Since April, hundreds of workers had expressed the absence of health measures in the workplace and the risk to which they were exposed. Paola Gamboa, reporter for El Heraldo de Juárez, tells us what the serious consequences of a new closure would be if companies do not take the necessary precautions to care for their employees.Filter hotels: accommodation for migrants in times of pandemicFaced with the risk of Covid-19 virus infection, migrant shelters in Mexico's border towns stopped accepting new guests. That didn't stop the number of migrants seeking a better life in America from declining. To ensure health and a stay worthy of newcomers, "filter hotels" were established in Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez These places provide a safe space for migrants to "stay home" even for a few days. But some local residents are against his presence. Crisstian Villicaña, reporter for El Sol de Tijuana, and Paola Gamboa, reporter for El Heraldo de Juárez, explain why the perception about these hotels is different in each border city.The Day of the Dead in Times of PandemicThe Day of the Deadit is one of the most important Mexican traditions dating back to pre-Hispanic times. The visit to the pantheons and the placement of offerings has endured and adapted to the changes without losing their essence. This year, however, colors and lights in cemeteries were turned off due to health measures that authorities have announced to prevent further covid-19 contagion. Mixquic, in Mexico City, and Pátzcuaro, in Michoacán, are two places where tradition is deeply rooted and the impact of the cancellation of the festivities was strong. Manuel Cosme, reporter for El Sol of Mexico, and Josafat Velázquez, reporter for El Sol de Morelia, tell us how the communities of Mixquic and Pátzcuaro adapted so that the Tradition of the Day of the Dead continued.Chihuahua returns to confinementThe second wave of coronavirus contagion has spread in some countries in Europe and the United States. Mexico is no exception and the first two entities in the country that filed an uptick in cases were Chihuahua and Durango. Chihuahua was the first state in the entire country to return to the red epidemiological traffic light, so the state government increased the severity of health measures and restricted mobility to prevent the collapse of the already saturated health system. Velvet González, a reporter for El Heraldo de Chihuahua, tells us what factors influenced contagions to increase dramatically.In Disruptors you will find the ventures that grew during the pandemic and the technological ideas that helped in times of greatest crisis. An example is Okidoc, know this novel way to see a doctor:Okidoc: There is no quarantine in this officeOkidoc is a digital platform where anyone can receive specialized medical care through video consultations. It has an interface in which users generate an account and access a wide portfolio of doctors with long experience.From general medicine, gastroenterology, cardiology, pediatrics and ophthalmology to physical ills, as well as therapists, psychologists, tanatologists, piscotherapists and coaches.In this interview with Cynthia Cruz, founder of Okidoc, she explains that as a result of the Covid-19 explosion Okidoc established specifically focused consultations on her platform to diagnose symptoms, detect or dispose of cases of the disease and track them by 270 pesos to avoid risks of contagion.The economic difficulties and the complete analysis in finance will be in Heavy Economy, with Luis Carriles and Mario Alavez, who were clarifying in the pandemic weeks, the most relevant movements in this area."War" economy 2: Pandemic continues to hit global economyIt is not yet certain when the spread of the Covid-19 virus will end. What is known is the impact it is having on the global economy and that will continue even when the pandemic is over. Luis Carriles, columnist for El Sol de México, Mario Alavez, co-editor of Finanzas de El Sol de México, and Enrique Hernández, explain in the most detailed way what the impact of coronavirus has been on the Mexican economy.How much does it cost to be sick with Covid-19?This episode of Heavy Economy details the cost that insurers and the government cover for treatments for patients infected with Covid-19. They also tell us what actions the Mexican government is taking to revive the tourism sector.The Covid-19 arrived to stayThe world economy must prepare to live with coronavirus, as it will be present in the coming years. Further confinement is envisaged, but noso strict with commercial and labor activities, as Mexico's weak economy could not sustain it. To overcome the crisis, if the Fourth Transformation government wants to keep Pemex and the CFE as pillars of the economy, they need to be strengthened so as not to become a burden on national finance.Communicators are essential not to lose the compass between false information circulating around the Covid-19. In Journalism at Risk, you'll learn how difficult this work has been in Latin America.The Covid-19 challenge for media and journalistsHow to protect yourself on the street? What awaits the media industry? Can you set up a newspaper from home? What opportunity is there for journalism during the pandemic? Is the SIP still operating? We try to answer all these questions.Sports journalism, victim of Covid-19How are you restructured and given new approaches to sports coverage when most sporting events have been cancelled globally? In this episode, Francisco Javier González, director of TUDN's editorial board, share his experiences; David Segoviano, director of the sports newspaper Esto and Joel Díaz, sports journalist at Imagen 104.5 fm, from Buenos Aires.After Covid-19, what's next for the pressIn this broadcast we present Alejandro Jiménez's talk with Eduardo Tessler, Brazil's international media consultant, to find out what steps the Latin American press needs and how to gain audience loyalty.You can also hear some of the tools that Julieta Shama, director of Facebook's News Media Partnerships LatAm suggests for new journalism and Marta Rocamora, Senior Manager of Strategic Alliances for LATAM at Marfeel during her "Google AMP to Increase Audiences" presentation, both for SIP Connect 2020.And at the international level, the keys of the world have given us the international landscape. The historical context of the current conflicts inherent in the pandemic.Plotists 3: Coronavirus: A Biological War or Marketing Campaign?There is always an opportunity to contradict verifiable empirical reality and line up with a more comfortable lie. Now it is the case of the Covid-19, in which groups of deniers pose a real challenge to combating the outbreak and are dedicated to proliferating false or unsustained information.Worst of all, heavyweights, such as Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, or U.S. President Donald Trump minimize the problem of turning it into a fantasy. In this episode, Jair Soto narrates several of the conspiracy theories that engulf this delicate subject that comes into the world.America, the big loser in the face of coronavirusThe United States lost control of the Covid-19 outbreak. President Donald Trump's administration has led a controversial health policy that allowed the United States to be the main focus of pandemic infection, both in the number of contagions and in death. In this episode, Victor Hugo Rico and Jair Soto explain the step-by-step failure of the Trump administration's failure in the war against the coronavirus, from the late response, minimization and disbelief of the US representative, to the uncoordination between the Executive with local governments and health specialists, to his health system, considered "the most expensive in the world" , and its esttachment from the outside.Pandemic and the world of the future: an end to capitalism and a digital police state?"The world system is on the test." Humanity faces an invisible enemy that has triggered fears and augurs for changeHistorical. Covid-19 has stopped the life of the planet and exhibited the economic system, inequalities, geopolitical conflicts, misinformation and widespread mistrust. But the pandemic will end and we will take to the streets again, although nothing will be the same anymore. In the face of this, important intellectuals begin to reflect and debate the post-coronavirus world: does this health, social and political crisis mean the end of capitalism and globalization? Are the drastic confinement measures imposed in many countries a test for further "totalitarian surveillance" and greater "nationalist isolation"? Will technology save us or condemn us? This episode discusses, in light of the ideas of South Korean philosopher Byung-Chul Han and Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari, how the decisions governments make will now shape tomorrow's world, as well as the danger of establishing a "digital police state."China's Sins: Is He Guilty of the Pandemic?China, the origin of the virus that keeps almost the entire planet locked up and in check, appears to have eradicated the Covid-19 epidemic and now its government is using so-called "mask diplomacy" to enhance its power model. Increasingly, however, criticism of the Asian superpower for crisis management is growing more and more: since allegedly hiding the first signs of the outbreak and the true number of contagions and the dead, having belatedly informed the world of what was going on in Wuhan City, the suspicious proximity to the World Health Organization, or excessive control over its population. Does Beijing seek to get rid, internally and externally, of its "original sin", that of the appearance of the virus in its territory? Is the pressure against you part of the pre-coronavirus economic and ideological struggle? Victor Hugo Rico and Jair Soto put geopolitical errors, successes and motivations on the scale at this historic moment.El Salvador, violence taught in the pandemicAmid the Covid-19 pandemic that keeps humanity abducted, images of thousands of overcrowded, indian-lined and almost naked imprisoned gangsters, just a few with water cover, caused a wave of stupor and concern around the world. El Salvador, one of the most violent countries in the world, experienced in the last week of April a sudden increase in the virus of murders by Mara Salvatrucha MS-3 (alleged head of staff) and Ward 18: more than 70 dead in four days. The coronavirus pandemic has left 11 decesses. After a gang truce agreed by the health crisis, Nayib Bukele's controversial government implemented a zero-tolerance plan in the country's prisons, denounced as a violation of human rights. In this episode we look for explanations about what suddenly changed and how El Salvador now experiences a triple crisis: prison, street insecurity, and a pandemic that has provoked questioned action.Plotists 5: Does the 5G network cause coronavirus?The world continues in the fight against the coronavirus, but also against the conspiracy theories around the pandemic that continue to flood the internet. These include the emergence, spread and lethality of the Covid-19 with 5G technology, or fifth-generation network, which has led to a series of attacks on facilities and towers in several countries.However, the relationship between the virus and 5G emerged only in January 2020, attempts to blame this technology for the weakening of the human immune system - among other things - come from years ago, with the same arguments that were used at the time to attack3G network and Wifi.Plotists 6: What's hidden from the world Bill Gates?Bill Gates, the tycoon-turned-philanthropist, is the new black beast of conspiracyists around the world for his alleged ties to the Covid-19 pandemic, a phenomenon of misinformation. But the plot theories about Gates come from much further back, from accusations of technology theft in his youth to create his Microsoft business empire, his membership in a eugenics family, his efforts to create a global digital ID, to his support - along with the Rockefeller Foundation, Monsanto and other agribusiness giants - for a strange project in the Arctic called the "seed bank of doomsday."Refugee, the eternal walkerOn World Refugee Day, this episode takes a tour of the world's current conflicts that are forcing people to flee their countries, from Venezuela to Syria and amid the pandemic. Several institutions believe that the situation will get worse from Covid-19. We interviewed Mariam Abuamer, a Palestinian singer who lives in Brooklyn and has been waiting for 6 years to be given refugee status and Dr. Andrés Alfonso Ramírez Silva, coordinator of the Mexican Refugee Aid Commission.Trump has Covid-19 and chaos in US risesJust one month after the November 3 presidential election, President Donald Trump cemented America's soul by spreading from Covid-19, the virus that had so minimized leading the country to an unprecedented health crisis. In this episode Victor Hugo Rico and Jair Soto discussed the possible scenarios in this presidential campaign that defines the direction of the United States and the world.Social media as a "biological weapon"?Terrorist groups, far-rightists and organized crime have taken advantage of the coronavirus pandemic to expand their support networks, undermine confidence in governments and incite intentional spread of the virus, mainly using social media. From Islamic State (Daesh), Al Shabaab and Al Qaeda, to far-right groups such as CoronaWaffen, incite potential terrorists and militants to intentionally propagate the Covid-19 and use it as an "improvised form of biological weapon.Here we break down a disturbing report published by the UN Institute for Research on Justice and Interregional Crime describing the new methods of instilling fear at this global juncture and also involving criminal groups such as the Sinaloa Cartel and the Italian Mafias, who seek legitimacy in the face of a population hit by the pandemic, as well as replacing the state in its territories.Load-Date: December 5, 2020End of Document

PETERS SUPPORTED MEASURES TO PROVIDE SERVICEMEMBERS A PAY RAISE, STRENGTHEN NATIONAL SECURITY AND MICHIGAN'S DEFENSE SECTOR IN FINAL NATIONAL DEFENSE BILLStates News ServiceDecember 3, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1623 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Michigan Senator Gary C. Peters:U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), who helped negotiate the final national defense bill, today highlighted provisions in it that will benefit servicemembers and their families, support Michigan's defense sector and strengthen our national security. It includes a pay raise for our men and women in uniform and Peters-led provisions to strengthen the medical supply chain and increase support for missile defense. The National Defense Authorization Act, which sets policy for the Department of Defense (DoD), must pass the Senate and House before heading to the President's desk. After the President threatened to veto the national defense bill this week, Peters emphasized the importance of this annual bill that garners strong, bipartisan support and been signed into law for 59 consecutive years. He does not believe the President should veto this bill that's critical to our national security and servicemembers over an unrelated issue."From the servicemen and women aiding Coronavirus response efforts, to the engineers leading innovative manufacturing projects right here at home to keep our servicemembers safe, Michiganders are critical to our national security," said Senator Peters, a former Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. "I was proud to help craft and negotiate this bill that would give our servicemembers a pay raise and includes provisions that strengthen key alliances, bolster our medical supply chain and support cutting-edge defense manufacturers across Michigan. It's critical that Congress quickly pass this legislation and the President sign it into law."The following provisions Peters led or supported were included in the final bill:Supporting Our Troops and Their Families:A Pay Raise for Troops: This bill includes a 3% pay increase for all servicemembers that Peters supported.Promoting Youth STEM Education Programs in Michigan: This bill authorizes $15 million for STARBASE, a DOD Youth Program that promotes STEM education. Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Harrison Township is home to the first STARBASE program, which specifically provides K-12 students unique opportunities in experiential learning, simulations and experiments in aviation and space-related fields.Supporting JROTC STEM Programs: The bill includes a measure Peters supported to form a grant program for Junior ROTC organizations that focus on STEM education, including cybersecurity training.Providing Benefits to Vietnam Veterans Suffering from Illnesses Linked to Agent Orange Exposure: This bill includes a measure Peters coauthored to expand the Department of Veterans' Affairs list of medical conditions associated with Agent Orange exposure to include Bladder Cancer, Hypothyroidism, and Parkinsonism. Tens of thousands of Vietnam veterans suffer from these three conditions due to their military service but have continuously been denied the care and benefits they have earned and deserve. Peters has led numerous efforts to end the wait for over 34,000 veterans currently suffering from those illnesses, as a result of direct exposure, who have been denied benefits and care.Strengthening Our National Security:Protecting Our Medical Supply Chain: As Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters released a 2019 report identifying the national security risks of our country's overreliance on foreign sources for critical medications and medical supplies including adversaries like China. Peters authored language that was included to require the Secretary of Defense to assess the Department of Defense's current pharmaceutical and medical device contracts and identify opportunities to invest in domestic advanced manufacturing capacity for these items.Bolstering Anti-Espionage Efforts: This bill contains a bipartisan amendment Peters co-authored to help universities protect critical defense research from espionage by our nation's adversaries, including the Chinese government. The amendment would specifically require high-ranking officials at universities that conduct sensitive defense research to receive briefings on the espionage risk to those projects.Funding the Pacific Deterrence Initiative: This bill authorizes $2.2 billion that Peters helped secure for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, which works to defend American interests in the Indo-Pacific region against aggression and coercion by the Chinese government.Strengthening the U.S.-Israeli Defense Partnership: This bill includes an amendment Peters sponsored to establish a working group between the United States and Israel focused on developing defense technology. This builds upon Peters' bipartisan legislation to increase coordination on conducting research and developing technology to combat threats faced by both the United States and Israel.Ensuring Economic Stability During a Crisis: This bill includes a requirement for the President that Peters authored to create a plan for bolstering the economy during a major incident, such as a cyber-attack or pandemic.Increasing Coordination Among National Guard During Cyber-attacks : This bill includes an amendment Peters authored that would direct the Secretaries of the Army and Air Force to create a pilot program to enable the National Guard to remotely support other state guards and governments during cyber-attacks.Strengthening the Nation's Artificial Intelligence Capabilities: As a founding member of the Senate's bipartisan Artificial Intelligence Caucus, Peters authored provisions to bolster America's artificial intelligence research, to build out artificial intelligence standards and provide new pathways to artificial intelligence jobs.Improving National Biodefense: This bill includes a provision Peters crafted to improve the National Biodefense Implementation Plan by requiring agencies to assume specific roles and responsibilities for protecting the country against a biological event, such as another pandemic, and establishing targets to measure their success in meeting goals and objectives.Reviewing Great Lakes Port Security: The bill additionally includes a Peters amendment requiring the Department of Homeland Security to review and report to Congress on Great Lakes and inland waterways seaports. The review would include scanning equipment on site or available to a seaport, staff by role, Customs and Border Protection expenses, and other information.Investing in Michigan's Defense Sector and Advanced Technology:Bolstering Missile Defense: The bill includes a requirement Peters supported for the DOD to study a layered approach to homeland missile defense. Peters offered an additional amendment requiring that study to include the possibility of locating any future missile defense sites at locations that have already been evaluated by the Department, including Fort Custer near Battle Creek.Cybersecurity Grants for Small Manufacturers: The bill contains an amendment Peters introduced to provide grants to Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) Centers to be used to assist small manufacturers with meeting new federal cybersecurity standards which are set to be phased-in as a requirement starting this year. Peters has previously worked to strengthen and cement the MEP program and the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center (MMTC), which provides technical assistance to small manufacturers.Supporting Defense Research Initiatives at the Ground Vehicle Systems Center (GVSC): This bill authorizes $42.5 million that Peters supported for projects at the Ground Vehicle Systems Center in Warren that are focused on modeling and simulation, ground robotics capabilities, and virtual experimentation enhancement efforts.Prohibits the Retirement of the A-10 Warthog: This bill includes an amendment Peters cosponsored to prohibit retiring the A-10 in Fiscal Year 2021. The A-10 still plays an important role in counterterrorism and combat search and rescue missions, and the bill prohibits divesting of that aircraft in FY21 and requires the Air Force to provide a briefing to Congress on the future of the A-10. Selfridge Air National Guard Base hosts an A-10 fighter mission.Establishing a Quantum Research and Development Program: This bill includes a provision Peters authored to improve a research and development program for quantum computers, including developing a list of problems for which quantum computers are uniquely suited.Other Provisions:Increasing Funding for CDC Study on Effects of PFAS Contaminated Drinking Water: The bill includes an amendment Peters helped introduce to increase funding for an ongoing Centers for Disease Control (CDC) study assessing human exposure to PFAS chemicals through drinking water by $5 million dollars, including ongoing work in Michigan. Peters helped establish the study in the national defense bill for FY 2018, which has been the first study to examine exposure to PFAS at multiple sites across the nation.Renaming Military Bases Currently Named After Confederates: The bill includes a provision Peters supported and that was approved unanimously by Democrats and Republicans in the Senate Armed Services Committee that instructs the DOD to remove names, symbols, or monuments that honor the Confederate States of America and those who served the Confederacy voluntarily from all Department of Defense installations.Improving Recruiting Efforts: The bill includes a provision Peters authored that instructs the Secretary of Defense to work with senior officials from the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Health and Human Services, and Justice to address issues that negatively impact military recruiting efforts.###Load-Date: December 4, 2020End of Document

U.S. Denies Extension of Friday Divesture Deadline to TikTok: ReportNewsweek.comDecember 4, 2020 Friday 8:25 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 448 wordsByline: Aila SliscoHighlight: The Trump administration has reportedly refused to extend Friday's deadline for the parent company of TikTok to divest U.S. assets.BodyThe Trump administration has reportedly denied a request to extend a Friday deadline for the parent company of popular video sharing app TikTok to divest U.S. assets.Bytedance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, was ordered to divest by President Donald Trump on August 14. A last-minute request to delay Friday's deadline was not granted, according to a Friday report from Reuters, citing two sources briefed on the matter. Regardless, talks between the government and the company are said to be ongoing.Although Trump's order gives the Justice Department the power to force the divestiture after the expiration of the deadline, it is not clear how or when that will take place. The deadline had previously been set for November 27 but was extended to Friday last week by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Prior to that, the company had been granted a 15-day extension of the order.Trump alleges that the app poses national security concerns from the Chinese government, although Bytedance has denied that it poses any threat or shares data with the government. In a court filing last month, the company said it was working towards the creation of "a new entity, wholly owned by Oracle, Walmart and existing U.S. investors in ByteDance, that would be responsible for handling TikTok's U.S. user data and content moderation."Prior to ordering divestiture in the company's U.S. assets, Trump had ordered that TikTok be banned in the U.S. on August 6, shortly after the U.S. Senate unanimously voted to approve a ban on federal employees using the app on government-issued devices."[TikTok] data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information—potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage," Trump wrote in the executive order, which had at first been set to take effect within 45 days.In a statement issued in response to the order, Bytedance said that Trump's decision set "a dangerous precedent for the concept of free expression and open markets" by "undermining global businesses' trust in the United States' commitment to the rule of law, which has served as a magnet for investment and spurred decades of American economic growth."In September, a federal judge blocked a Commerce Department order seeking to implement the ban by prohibiting U.S. downloads of the app. Arguments in the case, which will determine whether a ban can go forward, are set to begin on December 14.Newsweek reached out to Bytedance and the Department of Justice for comment.Link to ImageGraphic Government Denies Extension of Tiktok Divestiture DeadlineVALERIE MACON/AFP/GettyThe U.S. TikTok company headquarters building is pictured in Culver City, California on November 17, 2020.Load-Date: December 4, 2020End of Document

Building a secure future for Brazil starts with reliable 5G networksCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 20, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 761 wordsBodyOn my recent visit to Brazil, I discussed fifth-generation wireless technology, 5G —both its promises and its risks—with Brazilian government leaders, leading technology entrepreneurs, and executives of Fortune 500 companies.I also had the opportunity to review good friends, which I did in the years i worked as vice president of GM and executive president of Ariba and DocuSign.It made me think about the reasons that lead Brazil and the United States to have such a strong friendship 200 years ago. We share the same values. We are firm, honest, hardworking, creative and independent. We are passionate about what we believe in, and we cultivate positive feelings about each other. In my time in charge of Economic Diplomacy in the United States, I have learned that this quality is unique and should not be underestimated.Everything that is common among us —values, security, free society— influences the question of the future of 5G in Brazil. Ensuring secure 5G networks is crucial because anyone who controls data about someone controls their life, and technology providers hold the most sensitive personal, business and government information access keys.It all comes down to one question: who to trust?The choices are, on the one hand, three world-class law-abiding companies: Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung. On the other, the choice is Huawei, which serves the surveillance of the Chinese Communist Party. The same issue echoes around the world.This year leaves no doubt about the answer.China hid an outbreak that became a pandemic, evisceous Hong Kong's freedoms and perpetrated epic human rights abuses in Xinjiang. These abuses are made possible by Huawei, which facilitates the operation of the Orwellian surveillance state of the Chinese government.That's why 50 countries that share the same ideas and account for two-thirds of the planet's GDP; 180 telecommunications companies; and many industry leaders, such as Oracle, Fujitsu, HPO, Siemens, Cisco, NEC and others, have joined the growing Clean Network coalition, which only accepts trusted vendors for 5G networks.Members include Japan, India, Australia, Canada, Taiwan, Vietnam, the United States, the United Kingdom, and 26 of  27 Member States of the European Union, 27 of NATO's 30 member countries (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and — perhaps strategically more important ly for Brazil— 31 of the 37 OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries.That's also why Siemens' chief executive stated that "The Clean Grid is not just about mobile phones, but production processes, oil and natural gas platforms, power grids, sanitation systems and the internet of things. Rede Limpa will help ensure that Brazil's infrastructure is safe and reliable."Augusto Lins, one of Brazil's largest entrepreneurs, chief executive of Stone Pagamentos, said that "having a clean 5G network is especially important to combat cybercrime, data breaches and money laundering and attract investment in new products."The Clean Grid is also crucial for agriculture. Climaco Feitosa, from iLand, said that ,"in partnership with the government of Pernambuco, we will provide clean solutions to revolutionize the agribusiness sector, respecting the objectives of the Clean Network."Telecommunications companies around the world also understand that there is much at stake in 5G networks, as exemplified by José María López, Chief Executive Officer of Telefónica, who said that "security is paramount and Telefónica is proud to be a 5G Clean Network company. Telefónica of Spain and the United Kingdom already have 100% clean networks, and germany andVivo (Brazil) will soon be in the same position."When Italy passed laws giving the government the power to veto 5G technology providers and TIM (Telecom Italia) left Huawei out of competition for 5G equipment, its chief executive, Luigi Guibitosi, declared that "TIM would have no problem developing 5G infrastructure without Huawei."My diplomatic trips in recent months have led me to 25 countries. I have seen the citizens of the planet awaken to the importance of reliable 5G networks, and Brazil was no exception. I have a special appreciation for Brazil and I was very happy to hear the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ernesto Araújo, and Undersecretary Pedro Miguel Costa e Silva announce in Brasilia that Brazil would be the 50th country to adhere to the Clean Network principles.The decision to join the Clean Network sends a powerful signal to countries and companies that Brazil is a reliable partner and an excellent place to invest.Load-Date: December 21, 2020End of Document

10 of the Best Growth Stocks to Buy for 2021 - Correction AppendedUSNEWS.comDecember 29, 2020 Tuesday Correction AppendedCopyright 2020 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: INVESTING; Stock Market News; Vol.; No.Length: 1583 wordsByline: John DivineHighlight: Some of the fastest-growing stocks of 2020 look primed to outperform in 2021 and the years ahead.BodyThese are the best growth stocks to buy for 2021.Excluding areas like private equity and distressed assets, most investors are looking to back businesses that are expanding. But above-market growth prospects command above-market prices, and sometimes there's little margin for error if a business doesn't progress as quickly as the free market expects. The best growth stocks to buy for 2021 are no exception, and some carry higher-than-average risk due to high expectations. Still others carry less risk than peers due to their market positioning, size, competitive advantages or some combination of the three. Regardless, the following 10 names have a certain business momentum and long-term potential that make them the top growth stocks to buy for 2021 and beyond.Square (ticker: SQ)Payments and point-of-sale solutions company Square has been an out-and-out growth stock for a number of years. Its revenue has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 40.9% over the last five years. Last quarter, its numbers were even more stellar, with sales up about 140% year over year. A big chunk of Square's current growth comes from Cash App, its Venmo-like peer-to-peer mobile payments app. In the third quarter, Cash App's gross profits jumped 212% year over year, accounting for $385 million, or 48.5%, of Square's total $794 million gross profit. Just a year earlier, Cash App's gross profits of $123 million accounted for just 24.6% of total gross profit. Square is now worth more than $100 billion, and analysts expect earnings per share to grow 38% annually over the next five years.Amazon.com (AMZN)While indeed one of the biggest companies on earth, Amazon has proven its uncanny ability to post spectacular growth rates despite its size, making it a natural member of 2021's best growth stocks to buy. For many years, Amazon denied itself profitability, choosing instead to expand its market share through razor-thin margins while plowing every dollar back into long-term investments. Heading into 2021, AMZN remains a glorious tale of margin expansion combined with rapid top-line growth. Its international business just turned profitable in 2020, and for a company with $348 billion in trailing sales, Amazon's 37% growth rate last quarter is stunning. AMZN is still looking to disrupt other parts of the economy, reportedly planning its own primary health care services business it will offer to large employers. With health care spending accounting for more than 17% of the U.S. economy, Amazon has its eyes on the prize.NetEase (NTES)Chinese online gaming company NetEase may not be expanding as quickly as Square or Amazon, but its strong track record of growth, pipeline and valuation make it an attractive growth stock to buy for 2021. Sales growth over the last five years has clocked in at more than 38% annually and remains impressive with a 27.5% growth rate just last quarter. In development are games based on already-popular franchises such as "Harry Potter," "The Lord of the Rings," "Diablo" and "Pokemon." One of several more modestly priced stocks on this list, NTES trades for just 21 times forward earnings. In 2019, the company began a policy of paying out between 20% and 30% of earnings as a dividend each quarter, a practice that currently yields 1% for investors in the Asian growth stock.Nautilus (NLS)Peloton (PTON) is thought of as the high-end home exercise bike company, but for the money, competitor Nautilus is a better stock to buy. Nautilus doesn't just make its namesake workout equipment. The company owns Bowflex and Schwinn, and it's following Peloton's lead by getting into the subscription trainer-led workout business. Last quarter, Nautilus revenue jumped 152% year over year. This sort of pandemic-fueled growth can't last forever, but at about 13 times forward earnings, NLS looks like a steal, especially with high-margin recurring subscription revenue set to make up a larger slice of Nautilus' overall business. Nautilus was also picked as one of U.S. News & World Report's 10 best stocks to buy for 2021 overall.Alibaba Group (BABA)Investors shouldn't be entirely focused on the U.S. in their portfolios. When looking abroad, the single-largest market and most attractive investment landscape has to be China, with a population around 1.4 billion. Importantly, the Chinese middle class has been expanding rapidly, too -- it's likely China's middle class already exceeds the entire population of the U.S. This is an enormous secular tailwind for the country's largest e-commerce company, Alibaba, which, despite doing roughly $90 billion in annual sales, grew revenue by 30% last quarter. In late December, the Chinese government announced an antitrust probe into the business, leading to a sell-off -- and a nice opportunity for investors to buy BABA on the dip going into 2021 at just 17 times forward earnings.Fiverr International (FVRR)Fiverr is an e-commerce marketplace matching buyers and sellers in the fast-growing gig economy. Freelancers can seamlessly connect with parties looking to hire someone for a wide range of services, including design, marketing, translation, animation, programming, website creation, data entry and more. The "flywheel effect" is hard at work with FVRR. As more buyers use Fiverr to find freelance talent, growing demand attracts more sellers to the platform, bringing deeper talent and a wider range of services, in turn attracting more buyers. Fiverr is expected to break into the black and not look back when full 2020 results are in, and top-line growth is bonkers, with revenue jumping 88% year over year last quarter. Expect FVRR to be volatile. Shares have roared about 750% higher in 2020, and at more than 40 times sales, the stock isn't cheap. But with momentum and exploding profitability, FVRR is a risky growth stock worth the stretch for more aggressive investors.Editas Medicine (EDIT)Editas is arguably the most speculative of the best growth stocks to buy for 2021, as its value is wholly derived from its potential to successfully spearhead a futuristic groundbreaking technology. One of the few pure plays on the CRISPR gene-editing technique, one of Editas' scientific founders, Feng Zhang, conducted pioneering research critical to the development of CRISPR technology, which essentially allows humans to edit DNA. The $5 billion Editas has a leading candidate in clinical trials for the treatment of the top cause of childhood blindness and filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to begin clinical trials for a treatment of sickle cell disease. Although Editas' long-term prospects look promising, investors seeking to bet on the future of CRISPR in a more diversified way may consider owning a piece of Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) as well.iRobot Corp. (IRBT)iRobot might strike some as a silly name, but take one look at the company's financials and you'll realize it's no joke. Founded in 1990, the company makes robotic cleaning products that automate the home-cleaning process. Its two leading products are the Roomba automatic vacuum and the Braava automatic floor mop. Business is on the upswing, with revenue jumping 43% year over year last quarter as consumers placed more importance on their home surroundings amid widespread lockdowns. At about 16 times earnings, iRobot's 18% annualized earnings growth, which analysts expect in the next five years, comes at a discount. IRBT is also venturing into a new product line of educational coding robots aimed at teaching children to program.Twitter (TWTR)Among the best growth stocks to buy for 2021 is Twitter, which has enjoyed a unique position in the market for years as a live, crowdsourced tool for unearthing current events on a real-time basis. Twitter played an important role in the Arab Spring in 2011, and 10 years later, it remains a unique technological tool and increasingly vital part of modern society. Growth in Twitter's monetizable daily active users has increased sharply in the last two years. For the first four quarters, mDAU growth ranged from 9% to 17%, while the last four quarters each saw growth between 21% and 34%. Revenue is expected to jump by roughly 22% in 2021 as advertising revenue recovers from the 2020 recession. And if talk of testing a subscription model for some aspects of Twitter manifests into action, investors will likely applaud the effort to diversify its revenue streams.Roku (ROKU)Lastly, streaming TV platform Roku is an unapologetically priced growth stock, and it's not for the faint of heart. Trading at more than 28 times sales, Roku is not yet profitable, and analysts expect 2022 to be the first full year of profitability. In the meantime, growing Roku's share of the TV streaming platform market is the name of the game. Last quarter, active accounts grew 43% to 46 million while streaming hours grew 54% year over year to 14.8 billion. Advertising on the Roku platform makes up the bulk of company revenues, as platform revenue -- which includes advertising -- jumped 78% last quarter. The recent addition of HBO Max to Roku's platform illustrates how the company's rapid growth makes it more desirable to streaming apps, which makes Roku more useful to consumers, powering a feedback loop that drives its business.Ten top growth stocks to buy for 2021:-- Square (SQ)-- Amazon.com (AMZN) -- NetEase (NTES)-- Nautilus (NLS)-- Alibaba Group (BABA) -- Fiverr International (FVRR) -- Editas Medicine (EDIT) -- iRobot Corp.

Bolsonaro seeks to slow down Huawei's 5G BrazilCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 3, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 271 wordsBodyDespite being two major trading partners, the Brazilian government, headed by Jair Bolsonaro, seeks to limit the participation of The Chinese technology company Huawei in the country, for the implementation of the 5G network.President Bolsonaro has sought in the cybersecurity law some gap that could favor the blockade of the Chinese tech giant, not only by the distribution of its 5G network, but also to deprive it in the market of the sale of equipment.?? Stay informed on our Google News channelAnalysts believe that the government administration is under pressure from the United States to slow Huawei's progress in the region.Previously, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo invited all nations and businesses to join the Clean Network program, whose main function is to care for businesses and citizens of "aggressive intrusions" as they call it and the Chinese Communist Party. The program is built on alliances between various trading partners.The US accuses Huawei of working for the Chinese government, putting to its sdisposition all the data it obtains from its users not only from China, but from all over the world, an action that Washington wants to stop.Brazil is one of the most powerful and promising telecommunications markets in the world, with 227.3 million active mobile lines, of which 88% have access to the Internet.That means that 94 out of 100 inhabitants in the country are connected to the network or that there are almost as many cell phones with Internet access as The 212 million inhabitants of Brazil.Huawei wants to leverage these figures to expand its market in Latin American economic power.Load-Date: December 4, 2020End of Document

US agencies, companies secure networks after huge hackAssociated Press Financial WireDecember 14, 2020 Monday 9:32 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 1174 wordsByline: BEN FOX and FRANK BAJAK, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. government agencies and private companies rushed Monday to secure their computer networks following the disclosure of a sophisticated and long-running cyber-espionage intrusion that experts said almost certainly was carried out by a foreign state.It was not yet clear who was responsible for the intrusion, though it was reportedly conducted by Russia, and the extent of the damage is not yet known. The potential threat was significant enough that the Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity unit directed all federal agencies to remove compromised network management software and thousands of companies were expected to do the same.What was striking about the operation was its potential scope as well as the manner in which the perpetrators managed to pierce cyber defenses and gain access to email and internal files at the Treasury and Commerce departments and potentially elsewhere. It was stark evidence of the vulnerability of even supposedly secure government networks, even after well-known previous attacks.“It’s a reminder that offense is easier than defense and we still have a lot of work to do,” said Suzanne Spaulding, a former U.S. cybersecurity official who is now a senior adviser to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The campaign came to light when a prominent cybersecurity firm, FireEye, learned it had been breached. FireEye would not say who it suspected, though many experts quickly suspected Russia given the level of skill involved, and alerted that foreign governments and major corporations were also compromised.U.S. authorities acknowledged that federal agencies were part of the breach on Sunday, providing few details. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as CISA, said in an unusual directive that the widely used network software SolarWinds had been compromised and should be removed from any system using it.The national cybersecurity agencies of Britain and Ireland issued similar alerts.SolarWinds is used by hundreds of thousands of organizations around the world, including most Fortune 500 companies and multiple U.S. federal agencies. The perpetrators were able to embed malware in a security update issued by the company, based in Austin, Texas. Once inside, they could impersonate system administrators and have total access to the infected networks, experts said.“Quite honestly, my heart sank when I saw some of the details, just the amount of information they could potentially have if they are reading everyone’s emails and they are accessing sensitive files within places like Treasury or Commerce,” said Ben Johnson, a former National Security Agency cyber-engineer who is now chief technology officer of software security firm Obsidian.The Washington Post, citing unnamed sources, said the attack was carried out by Russian government hackers who go by the nicknames APT29 or Cozy Bear and are part of that nation’s foreign intelligence service.U.S. officials have declined to say who they believe is responsible. National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot said Monday only that the Trump administration was working with the CISA, U.S. intelligence agencies, the FBI and government departments that were affected to coordinate a response to whoever was behind it.Microsoft cybersecurity researchers on Monday tied the hacks to “nation-state activity at significant scale,” aimed at both government and the private sector.“It’s obviously incredibly significant and widespread,” said Chris Painter, who coordinated cyber-policy at the State Department during the Obama administration. “How much was compromised? How much was exfiltrated? There are lots of open questions now.”Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Russia had “nothing to do with” the hack.“Once again, I can reject these accusations,” Peskov told reporters. “If for many months the Americans couldn’t do anything about it, then, probably, one shouldn’t unfoundedly blame the Russians for everything.”Federal agencies have long been attractive targets for foreign hackers looking to gain insight into American government personnel and policymaking.Hackers linked to Russia, for instance, were able to break into the State Department’s email system in 2014, infecting it so thoroughly that it had to be cut off from the internet while experts worked to eliminate the infestation. A year later, a hack at the U.S. government’s personnel office blamed on China compromised the personal information of some 22 million current, former and prospective federal employees, including highly sensitive data such as background investigations.Cybersecurity experts said the nature and level of tradecraft involved in this latest effort suggest a foreign nation. Many have pointed out that the goal of the months-long effort appeared to be espionage and not information that could be quickly used for profit or to simply inflict damage. Russia was the most likely culprit, though China and perhaps others are potential candidates.In terms of scale alone, the the operation seems similar to the Office of Personnel Management that authorities suspect was carried out by the Chinese government, said Ben Buchanan, a Georgetown University cyber-espionage expert.“The operational tradecraft — how the hack was carried out — seems to have been extremely good. These operators are experienced and capable, adept at finding a systemic weakness and then exploiting it quietly for months,” said Buchanan, author of “The Hacker and The State.”If it was carried out by a foreign government, and the U.S. has the proof, then it becomes a question of what to do about it.Some obvious options would include expelling diplomats of the offending country, imposing sanctions or filing criminal charges for cyber-espionage, steps that Washington and the European Union have taken against Russia in the past.“I’m sure that the departments like NSA and Cyber Command are coming up with options, that the Treasury Department is looking at sanction options , that the State Department is looking for how they will send a strong signal,” Spaulding said. Whether they will get approval for all these things from the White House remains to be seen.”In the meantime, SolarWinds and its many private-sector clients were working to close any breaches and repair the damage.The company said in a financial filing that it believed that an unknown number of customers, though fewer than 18,000, had installed the compromised product update earlier this year. SolarWinds has said its customers include all five branches of the U.S. military, the Pentagon, the State Department, NASA, the National Security Agency, the Department of Justice and the White House, along with the top U.S. telecommunications and accounting firms, though it hasn’t identified which of its customers were using the compromised product.“We anticipate this will be a very large event when all the information comes to light,” said John Hultquist, director of threat analysis at FireEye.___Bajak reported from Boston.Load-Date: December 14, 2020End of Document

Stocks Pare Gains; What The Santa Claus Rally Says About The Stock MarketInvestor's Business DailyDecember 24, 2020Copyright 2020 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

A leading stock topped a buy point.The Russell 2000 jumped to a 0.9% lead in Thursday's early market but reversed lower and was off 0.4% at midday. The small-cap benchmark is still up about 10% this month, adding to a record 18% surge in November. For the year, the Russell 2000 is up nearly 20%, beating the S&P 500's 14.3% increase.The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 had only a sliver of a gain left, trading less than 0.1% higher at midday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat.U.S. Stock Market Today OverviewIndexSymbolPriceGain/Loss% ChangeDow Jones(0DJIA)30124.07-5.76-0.02S&P 500(0S&P5)3692.67+2.66+0.07Nasdaq(0NDQC )12781.29+10.18+0.08Russell 2000198.51-0.63-0.32IBD 5041.60-0.06-0.14Last Update: 12:04 PM ET 12/24/2020Volume was lower compared with the same time on Wednesday. That's not surprising at all, given that the stock market closes at 1 p.m. ET today and then goes into a three-day Christmas break.In Congress, a bill for $2,000 relief payments to Americans failed. The vote extends already protracted negotiations to pass a coronavirus aid package. The stock market shrugged off the news, happy to extend its Santa Claus rally.Actually, the Santa Claus Rally was initially defined as a common market advance in the final five trading days of the year and first two trading days of the following year, not just December."Whether optimism over a coming new year, holiday spending, traders on vacation, institutions squaring up their books before the holidays — or the holiday spirit — the bottom line is that bulls tend to believe in Santa," says LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.Santa Claus Rally Effect On January StocksLPL research finds that over the past 20 years, these seven days are higher, which leads to strength in January. "But what stands out to us is that the times Santa didn't come, January was lower each time."Generac Holdings rose above the 235.65 buy point of a flat base in heavy trading. The stock, which is in IBD Leaderboard, was slightly below the entry at midday as the market took back gains.Chinese stocks were broadly lower after reports said the Chinese government launched an antimonopoly probe into Alibaba. Shares of the company plunged nearly 15% at midday after gapping below the 200-day moving average in heavy volume. The stock was already compromised after tumbling below the 50-day line Nov. 10 and erasing a gain of more than 20% from its 268 buy point.KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF, in which Alibaba has a nearly 9% stake, slid 3.4% and dropped below its 50-day line. The damage did not spread much to other Chinese big caps. The iShares Trust China Large-Cap ETF fell 1.6% and continued to form a flat base. The Hong Kong Hang Seng Index closed 0.2% higher.The only two China stocks in the IBD 50 — Vipshop and Futu — were mixed. Vipshot climbed nearly 2% while Futu stumbled 4%. Innovator IBD 50 ETF reversed lower 0.2%.Juan Carlos Arancibia is the Markets Editor of IBD and oversees our market coverage.

Tik Tok takes respite from Trump and the US; give you 15 more days to sell your operationsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 13, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 362 wordsBodySAN FRANCISCO, California.- The U.S. government granted this Friday a 15-day extension to the Chinese company ByteDance, owner of TikTok, to sell its operations in the US, so that by the moment it can continue to operate normally until the end of the month.In a statement, the EEU Foreign Investment Committee (CFIUS) stated that this extension will "provide additional time for the parties to resolve this case in a manner that complies with the order (Executive of President Donald Trump)".Just a few hours earlier, the US Department of Commerce had issued a notice informing that, in compliance with a court order that had blocked TikTok's ban in the country, the veto did not take effect and, therefore, the application was still able to operate.On Tuesday, TikTok's Chinese parent company had asked US Justice for more time to prepare for the sale of its popular us-shared video app, two days before the deadline set by outgoing President Donald Trump's government was met, although the order had already been blocked by Justice and therefore there was no real risk of the ban coming into force.The case dates back to last August, when Trump issued an executive order saying that TikTok's U.S. business should be sold to a company in the country and otherwise veted.Specifically, it was established that on 12 November the use of TikTok in the US would be completely vetarated, something that then Justice knocked down and that has not finally happened.The Trump administration argues that what it wants is to prevent data from Americans using TikTok from being shared with the Chinese government, something those responsible for the popular short video app say they would never do.In September, U.S. firms Oracle and Walmart agreed that 20% of TikTok Global, a new US-based company that would lead the application's service worldwide, would still be negotiated, although it remains to be negotiated what stake ByteDance will still have in TikTok.TikTok, for its part, ensures that negotiations to complete the agreement remain open. Implementers have always maintained that all their data centers are outside China and that their data is not subject to Chinese law.  Load-Date: November 14, 2020End of Document

U.S. blacklisted Chinese microchip manufacturer SMICCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 18, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 636 wordsBodyThe U.S. government added dozens of Chinese companies this Friday, including the country's leading microchip manufacturer, SMIC, to a commercial blacklist restricting these companies' access to U.S. technology. Telecom giants such as Huawei and ZTE had already received the same sanctions in the past.The move is seen as part of President Donald Trump's latest decision to set his hard-handed legacy on China. It also occurs a few weeks before President-elect Joe Biden takes office on January 20.The shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's leading chip manufacturer and one of the largest in the world, fell 5.2% this Friday afternoon in Hong Kong after the news broke.The U.S. Department of Commerce upheld the decision early Friday, ensuring that the measure "responds to China's doctrine of military-civilian fusion and evidence of activities between SMIC and concerned entities in the complex Washington claims to have evidence that SMIC has worked with the Chinese military on the development of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles and exoskeletons for soldiers, but has been arguing with the Chinese company for months about a way to avoid sanction, which ultimately could not be avoided.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement that his portfolio "will not allow advanced American technology to help improve the army of an increasingly belligerent adversary."Ross said the government will cautiously deny licenses to prevent SMIC from accessing technology to produce semiconductors at advanced technological levels of 10 nanometers or less.The Shanghai-based company is a supplier to Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom Inc. and is at the heart of Beijing's intention to develop a world-class semiconductor industry and no longer rely on U.S. technology. Washington, in turn, sees China's rise as a possible geopolitical threat. Its blacklisting could curb the Asian country's long-term ambitions by depriving it of access to crucial equipment.In total, the United States added 77 companies and subsidiaries to the so-called redlist of exhibits, including 60 Chinese firms including Tianjin University and the Beijing Institute of Technology, as well as numerous companies. But SMIC is undoubtedly the most notable entity on the list.The remaining sanctioned entities come from Bulgaria, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Malta Pakistan, Russia and the United Arab Emirates.China's Foreign Ministry said the decision would demonstrate U.S. oppression over Chinese companies, so Beijing will continue to take the "necessary measures" to protect its rights."We urge the United States to cease its misbehavior of unwarranted oppression of foreign companies," ministerial spokesman Wang Wenbin said at his regular conference in Beijing on Friday.Designations include Chinese entities involved in alleged human rights abuses and in the construction and militarization of artificial islands in the South China Sea, the department said.He also cited entities that purchased U.S.-sourced products to support People's Liberation Army programs, as well as companies and individuals who participated in the theft of U.S. trade secrets.Previously listed firms include telecom giants Huawei Technologies Co and 150 subsidiaries, and ZTE Corp for sanctions violations, as well as camera manufacturerHikvision for its role in cracking down on China's Uighur minority.With information from Reuters, AFP and BloombergRead on:Chinese regime announced retaliation against US over sanctions on 14 senior officials involved in the dismissal of opposition parliamentariansThe United States imposed restrictions on Chinese officials and canceled five cultural exchange programsAlibaba developed a facial recognition program to identify Uighurs, the Muslim minority persecuted in ChinaLoad-Date: December 19, 2020End of Document

Huawei denies it's going to build US technology-free chip factoryCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 19, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 446 wordsBodyBeijing, Nov 19 (EFE)- China's technology company Huawei today demined that it is preparing to build a factory in which to produce chips that allow it to continue manufacturing its products in the face of supply problems that may result from the sanctions imposed by the United States.In a statement to Efe, the company says it "has no plan to build a chip manufacturing plant" and demands that Washington end restrictions on the supply of semiconductors for Huawei.Earlier this month, the British newspaper Financial Times published that Huawei was planning to build a factory in Shanghai to produce chips without U.S. technologies, starting manufacturing low-end semiconductors of 28 nanometers (nm) in 2021 and, at the end of the following year, 20 nm.This plant would, according to this information, be managed by Shanghai IC R&D; Center, an R&D;-focused company supported by local authorities."Preventing Huawei's access to chips doesn't just affect Huawei. These actions have damaged the global semiconductor industry as a whole, and have led more companies to pray about incorporating U.S. technology and components into their products," Huawei warned today.Last August, the U.S. took a number of steps to prevent Huawei from acquiring microprocessors or other components produced by other companies but partially or wholly made with U.S. "software" or "hardware".In practice, this assumes that major chip producers in Europe and Asia, such as Dutch NXP Semiconductors, Taiwanese MediaTek or Korean Samsung Electronics can only sell their products to Huawei if authorized by the United States.Technology believes sanctions will eventually affect U.S. interests as, in its view, they are causing supply chains to try to have fewer U.S.-linked parties.The latter issue is also part of the chinese government's attempt to give to the domestic technology sector: given that production of some key products is dominated by the U.S. and increasingly strained relations between the two powers could mean that Washington wanted to cut the tap on Chinese companies, Beijing is now betting on self-sufficiency.Huawei has been a major player in the Beijing-Washington trade war as it is subject to various sanctions by the United States, which considers it a danger to national security and suspects that 5G networks developed by Chinese technology could serve Chinese regime espionage purposes, a point that both the company and the government have repeatedly denied.One of the last steps the company has taken to minimize the impact of U.S. sanctions is the sale of its low-cost telephone subsidiary Honor to a consortium led by a public company to "save its industrial chain."

Japanese 'Twitter killer' sentenced to deathStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeDecember 16, 2020 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 586 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyTakahiro Shiraishi, also known as the "Twitter killer" was sentenced to death by a Tokyo court for murdering nine people whom he met on social media.There, he dosed the women with sleeping pills and tranquilizers before raping and strangling them to death.The 30-year-old had admitted to murdering and dismembering his victims - nearly all of whom were young women he met on the social media platform. The matter also triggered huge debates over how suicides are discussed online.Japan is one of the few developed nations to retain the death penalty, with more than 100 inmates on death row, and support for it remains high.How did he find his victims?Shiraishi, who set up his Twitter profile in March 2017, targeted his victims as they had expressed suicidal intentions on the platform.Shiraishi, who has been widely referred to in global headlines as the "Twitter killer", was arrested in 2017 after authorities found the bodies of eight women and one male inside cold-storage cases in his Zama apartment.What happened at the trial?A person named Takahiro Shiraishi murdered 9 people he dropped into his network on Twitter, and hid the heads and bones of the people he killed in his apartment, which is only 13.5 square meters. That, according to prosecutors, meant none of the victims had given their consent to be killed."Shiraishi did not just murder his victims but had trampled on the dignity of the dead", Naokuni held.UW Medicine administers Washington's first COVID-19 vaccinations TuesdayAfter you've received both doses of the vaccines, the CDC highly recommends continued mask-wearing and social distancing. Experts fear deaths and cases could further soar if people reject their advice to cancel year-end holiday gatherings.Takahiro Shiraishi, 30, admitted killing and butchering his young victims, all but one of whom were women. It was not immediately clear if that remained his plan.In Japan the death penalty is carried out by hanging, with execution dates not made public until after it happens.The names of those Shiraishi murdered were withheld to protect their privacy." Even now, when I see a woman my daughter's age,I confuse her for her". This pain will never go away. He said during the trial, "It was easier for me to convince people with worries and other issues and manipulate them to my way of thinking".On Tuesday, the father of another 17-year-old victim told NHK the death sentence was "appropriate". I don't know how to vent my anger, ' he said.He killed his first victim, a 21-year-old woman, after she demanded the return of a loan."It didn't sound at all like he regretted it..." It felt like I was being hurt with a sharp knife over and over again'.What impact has the case had?In Japan you can get help here. "The very threat of the law might be enough to achieve what the Chinese government intends."More from South China Morning Post: * China's ministry tells foreign journalists" club to "stop meddling in Hong Kong" after concerns raised over new police media guidelines * United States sanctions Chinese entity and individuals over "human rights abuses' against Uygurs in Xinjiang, using Global Magnitsky ActThis article China is global leader in imprisoned journalists for a second consecutive year, watchdog group finds first appeared on South China Morning PostFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app".News of the shocking crime pushed Twitter to roll out new rules against promoting or encouraging suicide and social harm on the site.Load-Date: December 17, 2020End of Document

Dow Jones Futures Jump As Moderna Coronavirus Vaccine Highly Effective; JD.com Earnings TopInvestor's Business DailyNovember 16, 2020Copyright 2020 Investor's Business Daily, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: STOCK MARKET TODAYLength: 1763 wordsByline: ED CARSONBodyhttps://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Stock-coronavirus-18-adobe-1.jpgDow Jones futures and S&P 500 futures jumped Monday morning, while Nasdaq futures turned lower, as Moderna said its coronavirus vaccine is 94.5% effective. Meanwhile, JD.com earnings beat views.The stock market rally is near highs but with leadership in flux amid soaring Covid vaccine progress and soaring coronavirus cases. Investors are moving into post-pandemic real economy stocks once again. Stay-at-home and other coronavirus plays sold off sharply last week on upbeat vaccine news.Moderna Coronavirus VaccineThe Moderna coronavirus vaccine data comes from the biotech's interim analysis of its final-stage trial. It comes one week after Pfizer and BioNTech announced that their Covid vaccine is over 90% effective. Crucially, the Moderna coronavirus vaccine can be stored at normal refrigeration temperatures for weeks, while the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine must be kept at ultra-low temperatures, complicating storage and distribution.In the coming days, Pfizer and BioNTech will report on safety data, quickly followed by Moderna. In the next few weeks, both coronavirus vaccines may go to the FDA for emergency approval. In a best-case scenario, both Covid vaccines are approved with millions of Americans vaccinated by year-end.Moderna stock leapt 14% before the open in huge volume. Shares shot up 23% last week, surging through the buy zone. on expectations that the Moderna vaccine would be as effective as Pfizer's.BioNTech stock fell 7% before the open. Shares soared 15% last week on its vaccine news, breaking out and moving past the 5% chase zone.Pfizer stock slid 2%. Shares rose 6% last week, but never closed above a buy point after briefly breaking out.Key Earnings ReportsJD.com reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings before the open, while revenue was in line. Shares fell in premarket trading. The Chinese e-commerce giant closed near record highs Friday after a wild week.Nio and Nvidia also are earnings to watch this week. Nio earnings are late Tuesday. Nio stock and Chinese electric car rivals Xpeng Motors and Li Auto greatly extended even after a negative reversal Friday, even as Tesla slumps. Nvidia earnings are late Wednesday as data-center chip stocks struggled last week amid the coronavirus vaccine news.Apple, Microsoft Holding UpWhile many tech leaders sold off, Apple stock, the biggest of them all, edged higher. Also, the Apple ecosystem did relatively well, with Taiwan Semiconductor rallying to new highs and iPhone chip suppliers Qualcomm and Qorvo holding steady after big gains.Microsoft, another Dow Jones tech titan like Apple, has formed a new handle.JD.com stock, Tesla stock, Microsoft and Taiwan Semiconductor are on IBD Leaderboard. Taiwan Semiconductor stock is on SwingTrader. Microsoft stock is on IBD Long-Term Leaders. TSM and Nvidia stock are on the IBD 50.5 Stocks Near Buy Points In Volatile MarketDow Jones Futures TodayDow Jones futures rose 1.7% vs. fair value, with Boeing, Caterpillar, Disney and Walmart among the leaders. S&P 500 futures climbed 1.1%. But Nasdaq 100 futures turned a modest gain into a 0.3% loss. Late Sunday, Nasdaq futures were outpacing Dow Jones futures.Dow futures, and individual stock action, suggest last week's move into travel and other post-pandemic, real-economy stocks will continue, with investors staying away from stay-at-home stocks.Dow Jones giant Home Depot will buy HD Supply, its former unit, for $8 billion, or $56 a share. Home Depot archrival Lowe's had been in the running for the industrial supplies distributor until recently.China industrial production rose 6.9% in October vs. a year earlier, steady with September better than expected. Retail sales climbed 4.3%, up from September but missing views. Japan's economy rebounded at a faster-than-expected 21.4% annualized in the third quarter.Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.That's been true over the past week, as Dow Jones futures — and Nasdaq futures — struggle to price in the combination of soaring Covid cases and just-around-the-corner coronavirus vaccines.Join IBD experts as they analyze actionable stocks in the stock market rally on IBD Live.Coronavirus CasesCoronavirus cases worldwide reached 54.94 million. Covid-19 deaths topped 1.32 million.Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have hit 11.36 million, with deaths above 251,000. New coronavirus cases hit a record 183,527 on Friday. Daily Covid cases in the U.S. have topped 100,000 every day since Nov. 3, Election Day.Tesla CEO Elon Musk said over the weekend that "likely" has a "moderate case of Covid."The U.S. is on a pace for one million new coronavirus cases per week, with that likely to rise in the coming days. Hospitalizations are at record levels and rising fast, with hospitals in many communities overwhelmed. Coronavirus deaths are rising, but still well below their spring peaks.Several states and cities are stepping up restrictions, while other signs point to more social distancing. All of that could slow the economic recovery.Stock Market Today: Do This Before Monday's OpenStock Market Rally Last WeekU.S. Stock Market Today OverviewIndexSymbolPriceGain/Loss% ChangeDow Jones(0DJIA)29479.61+399.44+1.37S&P 500(0S&P5)3585.19+48.18+1.36Nasdaq(0NDQC )11829.29+119.70+1.02Russell 2000173.44+3.46+2.04IBD 5037.61+0.25+0.67Last Update: 4:04 PM ET 11/13/2020The stock market rally had a solid week, if you look at the major indexes.The Dow Jones Industrial Average leapt 4.1% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index rose 2.2%. Both hit all-time highs Monday, but set record closes on Friday. The Nasdaq composite hit a record high Monday, but reversed lower on Monday and kept falling Tuesday. But the tech-heavy index bounced back to lose just 0.55% for the week.Growth stocks had a tough week, especially coronavirus plays. Zoom Video tumbled 20%, Peloton 19%, Shopify 12%.Among the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF sank 4.8%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF lost 4%, with Microsoft stock a top holding. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF only dipped 0.4%, despite hefty losses for Nvidia stock, AMD and Monolithic Power Systems. TSM stock and many chip-gear makers rallied, while Qualcomm just edged lower.JD.com EarningsJD.com earnings leapt 72% to 50 cents a share. Revenue climbed 36% to $25.66 billion. It was the second straight quarter of accelerating profit and sales growth. But while JD.com earnings per share topped views by 9 cents, revenue was just in line.JD.com fell 1.5% before Monday's open.JD.com stock closed Friday just below record highs, but that's after plunging below its buy point early last week before staging a recovery.Chinese e-commerce plays are looking strong, boosted by Pinduoduo, Tencent and Vipshop earnings last week. That's despite Beijing issuing draft rules targeting monopolistic behavior by big internet platforms. The notable exception is Alibaba, which appears to be the focus of the Chinese government's ire.Apple StockApple stock rose 0.5% last week to 119.26, but still remains relatively low in its base. The official buy point is 138.08, though investors could use 125.49 as an early entry. With the 5G iPhone cycle just underway, that could be a tailwind for Apple sales in the coming year, as well as iPhone chip plays such as Qualcomm, Qorvo and TSM stock.Microsoft StockMicrosoft stock punched above a 225.31 entry point on Monday morning, but reversed lower, closing just below its 50-day line Tuesday. Shares pared losses somewhat, to close off 3.3% at 216.51. MSFT stock now has a proper handle at 228.22, just above Monday's high.Tesla StockTesla stock popped Monday morning, but reversed lower, hitting resistance at its 50-day line and sinking 5% to 408.50. A 466 handle buy point remains.Assuming Elon Musk recovers quickly from his apparent coronavirus illness, that should negligible impact on Tesla stock. But it's unclear what will be a catalyst for the big 2020 winner. Tesla stock is slumping even as China EV stocks skyrocket in recent weeks. If Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto roll over, will investors rush back into Tesla stock or exit?Nio StockMeanwhile, Nio stock rose 7% last week, Li Auto 18% and Xpeng 21%. That's even after all three China EV stocks reversed lower Friday, perhaps sparked by a Citron Research sell rating on Nio stock. Xpeng and Li Auto reported strong sales, improving gross margins and bullish guidance last week. Investors will looking for more of the same from Nio, which has higher sales than the two 2020 IPOs do.Even with Friday's 7.7% decline, Nio stock closed 65% above its 10-week line. Investors may want to take some profits in Nio stock ahead of earnings to lock in big gains.Nvidia StockNvidia stock, which broke out on Nov. 6, tumbled 8.7% last week, though it did manage to close above its 50-day line. Investors may want to treat 587.76, just above the Nov. 9 intraday peak, as the new buy point. While Nvidia earnings were strong before the coronavirus and growth should continue after the pandemic, investors may believe data-center chipmakers got an extra boost from the stay-at-home trend. AMD stock fell 5.2%, also just above its 50-day line. MPWR stock plunged 14% last week after soaring nearly 12% in the prior week.What To Do NowInvestors should reevaluate the current holdings. Depending on the stocks they owned going into last week, they could have have a good, middling or rough week. You might have cut some stocks loose as they trigger sell rules. But you might need to do more, as the Moderna coronavirus vaccine news spurs further rotation.Do a through review of your watchlists. There likely will be a fair amount of turnover. Focus on stocks with strong relative strength and cast a wide net.This earlier Stock Market Today weekend article analyzed the stock market rally's recent action, including sector rotation and the paucity of stocks in or close to buy zones.Read The Big Picture every day to stay in sync with the market direction and leading stocks and sectors.Please follow Ed Carson on Twitter at @IBD_ECarson for stock market updates and more.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Why This IBD Tool Simplifies TheSearchFor Top StocksCatch The Next Big Winning Stock With MarketSmithBest Growth Stocks To Buy And WatchIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis TodayThe Five Best Stocks To Buy And Watch NowTesla Spikes On S&P 500 News; Tech Futures RiseLoad-Date: November 18, 2020End of Document

2020 was the year of change for the increasingly powerful and questioned tech giantsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 28, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 751 wordsBodyThe covid-19 pandemic, which accelerated the digital transition, has envisioned the power of technological giants but has also put them at the peak of states for their growing influence.Zoom meetings, Google searches, Amazon purchases, Whatsapp exchanges and Netflix evenings. Although they already had a dominant position before the pandemic, the American Gafam (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft) and the Chinese Batx (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and Xiamo) have become hegemonic by 2020.These "superstars" of digital capitalism "have given the impression in this world where so many things that seemed solid are collapsing today, of having taken off the ground and even (being) invincible," sums up the economist Joélle Toledano, a professor at Paris-Dauphine University.More than economic, its success is financial.While states spend millions and millions to avoid serial bankruptcies and mass unemployment, The prices of the Gafa shares continue to rise since January: Facebook (+35%), Amazon (+67%), Apple (+68%), and what about Zoom, created in 2011 by a Californian engineer, whose stock increased 600% in 2020? Or Airbnb that has doubled its value since the day of its I.D.?For their part, long cantoned in the local market, Chinese applications begin to spread around the world: TikTok, but also SHEIN (clothes) or Likee (videos).- Regain power -The pandemic has not only strengthened the tech giants, but has also raised awareness of the need to regulate these 2.0 conglomerates, the expansion of which continues, at the stroke of acquisitions."Until 2017, it was thought that the advantages they brought, particularly in terms of innovation, were superior to the damage they caused," but the wind is now blowing in a different direction," explains Joélle Toledano, author of "Glass: Let's Regain Power!"In addition to effectively controlling access to the digital world, the Google search engine controls 93% of the market. These quasi-monopolies lock users into "blocked ecosystems," according to the economist.Following past failures - long and late processes, unsuasive fines - Brussels has generated artillery of new rules ranging from competition to online hatred through the transparency of algorithms.Proceedings also multiply in the United States against Google and Facebook for abuse of a dominant position. Forced to account, the big big tech bosses, as the industry is known, have had to appear several times before Congress.In China, the authorities have been tightening the regulation of multi-platform containers for several months. They have also announced a new regulation of online commerce.The extremis suspension of online payment giant Ant Group's stockbroker's stockbroker was interpreted by many observers as a warning from the Chinese government to a sector that has become extremely powerful and generated colossal fortunes.- "Surveillance Capitalism" -The power of "Big Tech" also receives strong criticism from civil society, but this anger has not changed their economic models.In the United States, Facebook suffered in July the boycott of a hundred brands against the backs of the Black Lives Matter mobilization, albeit without economic damage to the relief. In California, the VTC Uber and Lyft platforms, which refuse to hire their thousands of drivers as required by state law, achieved a major triumph, which validated their economic model, in a referendum held on November 3.In France, Amazon crystallizes discontent, accused of destroying small business, exploiting employees, favoringexcessive consumption to the detriment of the environment. But the French subsidiary of Jeff Bezos' company has recorded unprecedented sales on Black Friday.Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff denounces "surveillance capitalism," based on the monetization of personal data. "The 21st century factory created by Google has no large chimneys (...). It rests on artificial intelligence and the products it manufactures are predictions of human behaviors sold to advertisers," Le Monde explained at the end of November.Advertising targeting has always existed, says Jacques Crémer of the French School of Economics in Toulouse which finds facebook, Google or Twitter "to use data they have on me to show me advertising.""Platforms need to be regulated, but not made scapegoats," adds Crémer, author of a regulatory report. "They are incredibly imaginative companies, extraordinarily well managed and offering a huge quality of service."evs/aue/af/zm/marLoad-Date: December 29, 2020End of Document

U.S. Secretary of State talks about signing 5G memorandum with Brazil 'in the near future'CE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 10, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 400 wordsBodyThe U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said on Tuesday (10) that received information from aides that Brazil supports the plan to exclude Huawei from 5G technology structures and, without giving details, added that he hopes to sign a memorandum on the subject "in the near future", although Brazilian authorities do not guarantee that a decision has already been made.U.S. State Department Undersecretary for Economic Growth, Energy and Environment Keith Krach is in Brazil and Pompeo said he received the news through the aide."I have heard from him in the last few hours that the Brazilian government supports the principles of the Clean Network and I am confident that we will sign a memorandum of understanding in the near future. I want to thank Brazil and its leaders for doing this," Pompeo said.                                                        U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo - Jacquelyn Martin - Nov 10,2020/AFP                    Clean Network is the name of the American plan to exclude the Chinese giant from 5G technology infrastructure in several countries – the auction in Brazil is scheduled for next year.Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said on Tuesday that there is no decision made on the issue, but admitted that it takes into account warnings from countries such as the U.S. and the U.S., which want to block China.Late last month, Brazil's ambassador to Washington, Nestor Forster, said decisions on the auction of the new technology in the country would not be made until early next year.The main u.S. goal is to ban or at least limit the Chinese company's participation in the auction of frequency in Brazil on the grounds that Huawei passes on sensitive information to the Chinese government, which threatens Brazil's data security and cooperation with the U.S.The Donald Trump administration has promised to offer credit, through official agencies, toBrazilian telecommunications giants acquire components from Huawei's competitors.Behind the scenes, however, representatives of Brazil's telecommunications sector say that companies have little interest in buying equipment with financing, because most of the current 4G network is equipped with Huawei components —Ericsson and Nokia also already participate.To make the transition to 5G, it would be necessary to change this device, something that would cost much more than the American fund itself has available.Load-Date: November 11, 2020End of Document

All Rights ReservedLength: 1133 wordsDateline: U.S. BodyU.S., Nov. 12 -- The top 100 most valuable nation brands in the world have suffered a monumental loss to their brand value because of the COVID-19 pandemic, amounting to US$13.1 trillion, according to the latest report by Brand Finance.2020 has put the nations of the world to the test - from the economic impacts of COVID-19 on nations' GDP forecasts, inflation rates, and general economic uncertainty, to diminished long term prospects. The Brand Finance Nation Brands 2020 report estimates that the total brand value of the top 100 nation brands dropped from US$98.0 trillion in 2019 to US$84.9 trillion in 2020, with almost every nation feeling a significant impact of the health crisis on their respective economies.US & China remain in a league of their ownThe US and China remain a cut above the rest, claiming first and second position in this year's ranking, recording brand values of US$23.7 trillion and US$18.8 trillion respectively. Relations between the two forerunners remain particularly fragile because of the US-China trade war that has consumed both economies over the past few years.Long-standing leader the US, has recorded a 14% brand value loss to US$23.7 trillion, following yet another turbulent year. Now home to both the most cases and deaths of the virus globally, the world's largest and strongest economy continues to encounter harsh criticism and questioning on the global stage. With Biden announced as the winner of the 2020 presidential election, in one of the most controversial and polarising races in American history, the country is likely to chart a new course and change many of the policies pursued under the incumbent president.Despite this political uncertainty, American brands' sheer dominance and success globally will always provide the nation's economy and reputation with a strong safety net. American brands - Amazon, Google, Apple, and Microsoft - claimed four out of the top five spots in the year's Brand Finance Global 500.Unlike the US, China's brand value has managed to remain largely stable, recording only a modest 4% drop this year. The Chinese government's quick response to the COVID-19 outbreak, paired with its targeted stimulus measures in recent months, have resulted in the nation becoming the first major economy to recover from the pandemic and is currently expected to be the only G20 economy that will grow this year.Top 10 down 14% on averageWith the pandemic wreaking havoc on nation brand values across the world, the top 10 has recorded a brand value loss of 14% on average. Japan has fared relatively better than its counterparts, recording a modest 6% brand value loss to US$4.3 trillion, and inching up to claim third spot in the ranking. Defying the odds of many that expected the nation to be one of the worst hit at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak - due to its proximity to China, its densely populated cities, and burgeoning elderly population - Japan has emerged as relatively successful compared to its counterparts, with lower Coronavirus cases and deaths and with its economy faring better.Luck of the Irish strikes againIreland has bucked the negative trend this year as the only nation brand in the top 20 to record a positive brand value growth, up 11% to US$670 billion. This strong performance is largely attributable to its forecasts being impacted less dramatically than others on the global stage - a particularly positive position given the twin threat of Brexit and COVID-19. The Irish economy has proven to be particularly resilient, being supported by strong exports and continued consumer spending. Should the UK reach a deal on Brexit, Ireland will find itself in an even stronger position as trade disruption with the UK will be reduced.The UK retains 5th positionThe UK has retained 5th position, following a 14% brand value decrease to US$3.3 trillion. Despite Brexit being forced into the shadow of COVID-19 this year, the uncertainty surrounding the outcome has persisted. The UK government are still engaged in negotiations with the EU, with fishing rights and competition rules as two sticking points for both sides.Vietnam defies global trend, up 29%Vietnam is the fastest-growing nation brand in this year's ranking, its brand value skyrocketing 29% to US$319 billion. Vietnam, which has recorded staggeringly low COVID-19 cases and deaths, has emerged as one of the top locations within the Southeast Asian region for manufacturing, and has become an increasingly attractive destination for investors - particularly from the US - that are looking to relocate their China operations following the fallout from the US-China trade war. Recent trade deals with the EU are supporting the growth of the nation further.Do cry for me ArgentinaIn stark contrast, Argentina has recorded the biggest drop in brand value this year, down 57% to US$175 billion. With COVID-19 cases recently passing the one million mark - the smallest nation by population to do so - Argentina has been struggling to respond effectively to the outbreak. Riots have erupted across the nation with protestors calling for a reform of the justice system, corruption cases to be investigated, and to demonstrate general grievances of the handling of the pandemic. The nation's already ailing economy is taking further hits and the road to recovery will not be short.Germany is world's strongest nationIn addition to measuring nation brand value, Brand Finance also determines the relative strength of nation brands through a balanced scorecard of metrics evaluating brand investment, brand equity, and brand performance. For the first time this year, the nation brand strength methodology includes the results of the Global Soft Power Index - the world's most comprehensive research study on nation brand perceptions, surveying opinions of over 55,000 people based in more than 100 countries. According to these criteria, Germany is the world's strongest nation brand with a brand strength score of 84.9 out of 100 and a corresponding AAA rating.Long renowned for its strong and stable economy and for being particularly well governed, Germany scores well across the majority of our data points. Angela Merkel's long tenure as Chancellor has provided a stable presence against the backdrop of unstable and erratic counterparts. For the most part, the German government's and Merkel's response to the pandemic has been received positively both domestically and internationally and the numbers support this with the country recording consistently lower cases per million than any of its Western European counterparts.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from US Eturbo News.

MarketBeat: Week in Review 11/16 â€“ 11/20American Banking and Market NewsNovember 21, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 American Banking and Market News All Rights ReservedLength: 1109 wordsBodyIt was Groundhog s Day for investors as this week started on more positive vaccine news. This time, the news was from Moderna (). The company cited 95% effectiveness of the vaccine in their Phase-3 trial. Of course like the news from Pfizer () and BioNTech () last week, there are still logistical hurdles to clear. But anything that offers genuine hope for investors is welcome. The gains the market made on Monday were tested as many states began instituting more restrictive measures to combat the recent surge in virus cases. However, positive economic data on home sales and better-than-expected retail numbers are keeping the markets pointed higher. Next week will be a short week for the markets that are closed Thursday and will have abbreviated trading hours on Friday. We at MarketBeat wish you health and happiness as we enter the holiday season. And now, here s a look at some of the articles our staff picked to help make you a better investor. Articles by Sean Sechler Like many investors, Sean Sechler turned his eyes towards blue chip stocks . With so many variables still up in the air, Sechler pointed investors to three stocks that are delivering steady returns, and predictable cash flow through a dividend. Sechler was also steering investors towards NextEra Energy (). Renewable energy  was gaining traction the last four years, and should get additional stimulus from a Biden administration. NextEra is a smart play because it offers investors in this sector a rare combination of a dividend and stable earnings. Another stock Sechler was informing investors about was Futu Holdings (). Financial technology (or fintech) is one of the hottest sectors in the U.S. markets, and Futu is a Chinese fintech company  that offers a fully digitized brokerage and wealth management platform. Articles by Jea YuElectric vehicle (EV) stocks  are sizzling in the United States. But with some of these newly public stocks looking overvalued, some investors are turning their attention to attractively priced Chinese EV stocks. Jea Yu was looking at one of those stocks, ). The company is drawing the attention of investors after announcing plans to enter the U.S. market with an EV that may sell for as low as $7,999 (after subsidies). Yu was also advising investors to use this recent pullback in e-commerce stocks  to buy shares of Ecommerce facilitator  stock. Turning his attention to stocks that stand to benefit from a Covid-19 vaccine , Yu was looking at beauty products and fragrance maker Coty (). The company is in the middle of a turnaround effort that was hampered by the pandemic. But Yu says shares may have finally hit a bottom which means any positive news on seeing each other face-to-face should be a catalyst for the stock. Articles by Thomas HughesAnalyst ratings are an excellent source of information for investors. Thomas Hughes was advising investors about three 5G stocks that are benefiting from a bullish upgrade  from Wells Fargo (). Hughes was also looking at the EV sector , specifically Nio (). The Chinese EV manufacturer was largely left for dead early this year but an infusion of capital from the Chinese government has righted the ship. And the stock looks ready to soar on news of growing demand and production. Retail stocks  were also in focus this week with stronger than expected earnings reports. The TJX Companies () were among them, and Hughes gave investors reasons to believe in the recovery narrative for this retail stock. Articles by Nick VascoNick Vasco was advising investors to buy the dip on Planet Fitness () stock. The company has made some savvy moves, such as the development of a mobile app, to survive the pandemic. And the fitness stock is poised to recover  when a Covid-19 vaccine is widely available. However, Vasco was not as bullish on the fitness apparel retailer , Foot Locker . After being a pandemic winner, the company is facing some unsustainable trends. And as someone who brewed a pot of hot water by accident this morning, I can relate to Vasco s bullish outlook on Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX ). Americans want their daily buzz and once they had the opportunity to get their Starbucks fit, they did . And as Vasco notes, even if the company faces some short-term headwinds due to renewed mitigation efforts, the steps they took in the initial lockdown  are now firmly in place.Articles by Sam QuirkeSam Quirke was giving investors a look at the Goldilocks side of the market. One stock Quirke wrote about, Boeing () has been a market laggard . But news that the FAA has rescinded its ban on commercial operations for Boeing s beleaguered 737 MAX plane looks to be the catalyst the company needs. Quirke was also looking at a slow-and-steady performer . Caterpillar () stock has continued to grow despite macro-economic conditions. And with the likelihood of increased attention on infrastructure, Caterpillar should continue to plow ahead. Quirke was also looking at a red-hot stock  for this year, DocuSign (). The simple fact is that the pandemic has given customers a reason to use DocuSign s electronic signature services. And once they do, they ll find there s no reason to go back to business as usual because of convenience, not safety. Articles by Steve AndersonSteve Anderson put his attention on the semiconductor arena and gave investors a bullish report on Qualcomm (). The company recently received permission to sell some smartphone processors in China  which opens up a new line of business and should give the stock a boost. One stock that hasn t needed much of a boost this year is Tesla (). Still, Anderson points out recent developments including an  overweight  rating from Morgan Stanley that should propel the stock to new heights . And Anderson also had his eyes on retail stocks . In this case, he was looking at Kohl s which as Anderson points out didn t wow investors with its earnings report, but didn t provide any reason to hate it either. A strong digital performance and a forecast to reinstate their quarterly dividend at some point in 2021 are acting as catalysts for the stock. Additional Editor s PicksThe last month has only accelerated the volatility in the market. And while the long-term outlook for stocks is improving, it s not surprising that some investors have their eyes on value stocks . Our team took a look at three value stocks that you should consider adding to your portfolio. The year 2020 will be remembered for accelerating the push into e-commerce. And while that has caused some consumer stocks to look overheated, our staff took a look at three cheap consumer stocks  that investors can pick up at a bargain right now. Load-Date: November 20, 2020End of Document

Center for Strategic & International Studies: 'Europe Reset?'Targeted News ServiceDecember 8, 2020 Tuesday 9:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 946 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Center for Strategic and International Studies issued the following commentary by William Alan Reinsch, senior adviser and chair in international business, entitled "Europe Reset?":* * *The last week or so has seen a flurry of activity from the European Union proposing a reset in transatlantic relations. A cynic would probably observe that this is an exercise in reinventing the wheel, since the Obama administration proposed the same thing in Obama's second term, and other presidents before him have launched efforts to resolve our many outstanding trade differences. The Obama effort did not get very far, largely because of European resistance among both their leaders and their public, but it was a good idea, as is the EU initiative. Hopefully, this initiative won't meet the same fate as the last one, although--spoiler alert--I am not optimistic.The main paper from the European Commission, "Joint Communication to the European Parliament, the European Council, and the Council," published on December 2, proposes "a new EU-US agenda for global change." Here is the rhetorical premise:With a change of administration in the US, a more assertive Europe and the need to design a post-corona world, we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to design a new transatlantic agenda for global cooperation - based on our common values, interests and global influence. This should be the linchpin of a new global alliance of like-minded partners. This comes at a time when there is a commonality of outlook and priorities on domestic and international agendas between the incoming US administration and the European Union.Much of the document is devoted to common action on the Covid-19 pandemic and on the environment, but I only have 900 words, so I will focus on the technology and trade section. There, the rationale is also clear:...the EU and the US need to join forces as tech-allies to shape technologies, their use and their regulatory environment. Using our combined influence, a transatlantic technology space should form the backbone of a wider coalition of like-minded democracies with a shared vision on tech governance and a shared commitment to defend it. To deliver on this, the EU must stay course for its own tech goals and ambitions as part of Europe's digital decade.The proposed instrument for this noble goal is an EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council (TTC), which is appears will primarily focus on issues involving digital trade and cyber security. There is nothing wrong with a presumably high-level forum for discussion, but I think the EU initiative glosses over two fundamental issues that will make progress difficult.The first is that the European Union, having discovered first-mover advantage in the case of the General Data Protection Regulation, clearly sees itself as a regulatory leader, even if it is not a technology leader. They are moving ahead on their own Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act which together will address a broad range of issues including policing content, platform liability, data flows, digital governance, and competition policy. They are also working on their own regulatory approach to artificial intelligence (which will likely conflict with their existing privacy regulation), and, as readers know, some of the member states have taken the lead on developing a digital services tax primarily targeting U.S. companies.The irony is that Europe is not the leader in any of the subject technologies, although the failure of the United States to develop coherent policies of its own in these areas could well mean that EU regulations end up being the default option. Creating a forum to discuss our differences is a good idea so long as Europe does not view it simply as a means to pressure the United States to adopt European standards, and the United States comes to the table with positions of its own. One of the fundamental rules of politics is that you can't beat something with nothing, and right now the United States has nothing, despite having the biggest stake in the outcome.The other fundamental issue is the growing call in Europe for "strategic" or technology autonomy. It is not entirely clear what that means--and it may mean different things to different Europeans--but it appears to reflect a determination to free Europe from what is viewed as domination by large U.S. high-tech companies. Here, the same rule of politics applies, but in this case the Europeans have nothing--though that does not seem to be stopping them from trying to punish U.S. companies for their success and Europe's failures.The tragedy of that view is that it misses the point--the United States and the European Union both face the same challenge, which is China, and that challenge is too big for either of us to take on alone. President-elect Biden knows that, which is why he is so focused on building a coalition to confront China's anti-market activities. The European Union gives lip service to that plan, but though their lips say "yes," their eyes say "not so fast." They continue to lag in recognizing the seriousness of the Chinese challenge, although the repressive policies of the Chinese government in Xinjiang and Hong Kong--an affront to democracies everywhere--are pushing them in our direction.The EU initiative presents an important opportunity to try for a reset, and the Biden administration would be wise to take the European Union up on its offer. A reset is something both sides want, but both will have to go into it with more open minds than they have shown so far if it is to succeed.[Category: Political][Category: ThinkTank1]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7317626 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: December 8, 2020End of Document

Griezmann breaks up with Huawei over possible relationship with Uighur surveillanceCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 10, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 283 wordsBodyParis, Dec 10 (EFE) - French international footballer Antoine Griezmman announced thursday that he is breaking his business relationship with Chinese electronics giant Huawei for his alleged collaboration in the "repression" against the Uighur minority in China."Following strong suspicions that Huawei may have contributed to the development of a 'Uighur alert' through a facial recognition program, I announce that I immediately ended my collaboration with this company," Griezzman said on his Instagram account.FC Barcelona's striker invited Huawei to "not be content to deny these accusations, but to take concrete action as soon as possible to condemn this massive crackdown and use its influence to contribute to respect for human rights in society."Griezmann and Huawei began their relationship shortly before the 2018 World Cup, finally won by the French national team, and during these years the player has participated in various advertising campaigns of products of the Shenzhen-based company, both France and internationally.In recent years, China has received growing criticism from human rights organizations and other countries due to the treatment of its Uighur minority (Muslims in the western Xinjiang Autonomous Region), including with the construction of internment and re-education camps.The Chinese government rejects these criticisms and claims that what it is trying to do is fight Islamist terrorism.In addition to being one of the world's leading manufacturers of mobile phones and their accessories, Huawei is a major developer of telecommunications equipment, especially material needed for new 5G mobile networks, as well as facial recognition systems from street cameras.Load-Date: December 11, 2020End of Document

Confirm Trump's Twitter password was "maga2020"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 17, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 418 wordsBodyThe Netherlands Prosecutor's Office confirmed that a Dutch hacker agreed to President Donald Trump's Twitter upon discovering that his password was "maga2020" and announced that he will not press charges against him as an "ethical hacker" who alerted US authorities to the situation."Hacker" Victor Gevers made public at the end of October that he had accessed Trump's personal Twitter account after only seven attempts with different password versions, until he found the correct one, which was "maga2020" (lowercase abbreviation of his campaign slogan, Make America Great Again).In addition, Trump had the double verification system disabled, so when trying to access it, Gevers did not need to send a message to the president's mobile phone or email to authorize access to the account, something Dutch prosecutors confirmed following an investigation by the national police cyber unit.Although both Twitter and the White House always denied that this had happened, the PROSECUTOR's Office confirmed on Wednesday that Gevers eventually agreedto the account, but did not take advantage of the situation to tweet on Trump's behalf, read his private messages, change the key or profile picture, possible options when accessing a Twitter account.Attempts to alert the president, his team at the White House, the campaign team, and even his family members to the security of the Twitter account failed, but days later, the U.S. secret services contacted Gevers to thank him for the notice.Trump changed his key and activated double verification.Although hacking is punishable in the Netherlands, the Prosecutor's Office considered that Gevers had met criteria for not being imputed: he is an ethical hacker dedicated to "responsible disclosure," and contacted the authorities under his real name, alerted them to the situation, and gave them advice on how to fix trump's account vulnerability.This isn't the first time Gevers, 44, has managed to access the U.S. President's account. As early as October 2016, he and several friends came up with Trump's password in a database leaked by hackers.So, Trump had "youarefired" as an access key.Among other discoveries, he found a Chinese database with personal information (telephone, dates of birth, employer, identity number or nationality) and locations (with GPS coordinates of places visited) of 2.7 million inhabitants of Xinjang, China's largest province and Uighur household, showing that the Chinese government is monitoring this ethnic minority in the country.Load-Date: December 18, 2020End of Document

Global $7.6 Bn Human Machine Interface (HMI) Solutions Market to 2027 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireDecember 10, 2020 Thursday 1:51 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 1319 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Human Machine Interface (HMI) Solutions - Global Market Trajectory & Analytics" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The global market for Human Machine Interface (HMI) Solutions is projected to reach US$7.6 billion by 2025, driven by the emerging new digital era where humans and machine will work alongside each other.With growing penetration of artificial intelligence (AI) in every industrial sector, key to successful realization of the promised benefits of the technology lies in humans and machines working together as a cohesive team.For effective human machine collaboration, the importance of Human Machine Interface (HMI) cannot be overstated. A key growth driver in the market is the rapid pace of digital transformation which increasingly puts humans and machines together. Digitalization is defined as the use of digital technologies to transform business models in a manner that enables new value creation opportunities and opens up new revenue avenues for companies.Digitalization is longer an option for businesses but a necessity to compete in a changing world increasingly underscored by tough economic fundamentals. Virtually all businesses have embraced digitization and have begun the journey of digital transformation. Billions of dollars are being injected into the transformation process, opening up attractive opportunities for myriad allied markets that encompass semiconductors, hardware, software, cloud services, and platform providers, among others.Technologies at the forefront of this digital transformation include cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Mobility/Social Media, Cybersecurity, 3D Printing, and Wearable Technology. Top industries at the forefront of digitalization include health & pharma, automotive, process and discrete manufacturing, oil and gas, telecom and finance.As budgets allotted for digital transformation become bigger, billions of dollars will need to be justified and their ROI measured. Companies will be under pressure to show benefits accruing from their growing technology budgets. The scenario is poised to benefit a wide range of markets for enabling hardware and software platforms including human machine interface (HMI). Digitalization means increased use of computers and digital machines. Their efficient use plays a major role in influencing ROI on CAPEX investments. In this regard, the importance of human machine interface (HMI) cannot be overstated.The United States, Japan and Europe represent large markets worldwide with a combined share of 65.7% of the market. China ranks as the fastest growing market with a CAGR of 10.2% over the analysis period supported by the Chinese government`s ambitious plans to empower the Chinese economy to become internationally competitive via digitalization.Key Topics Covered:I.

Global Plant Biostimulants Markets, 2020-2027 - Biostimulants Business Remain Buoyant amid COVID-19 DisruptionsPR NewswireDecember 30, 2020 Wednesday 12:15 PM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1222 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, Dec. 30, 2020 BodyPR NewswireThe"Plant Biostimulants - Global Market Trajectory & Analytics"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.The global market for Plant Biostimulants is forecast to reach US$4.5 billion by the year 2027, trailing a post COVID-19 CAGR of 10.2% over the analysis period 2020 through 2027.The return to growth will be led by the growing focus of governments worldwide to reduce agriculture's growing carbon footprint and make it more sustainable. This goal comes against the backdrop of the challenges involved in feeding a growing global population. Natural biostimulants are an emerging group of plant biostimulants defined as the use of microorganism such as fungi and bacteria. Popular fungi used as biostimulants include Glomus intraradices; Trichoderma atroviride; Trichoderma reesei; and Heteroconium chaetospira, among others. Bacteria, fungi and yeasts have the ability to promote plant growth by enabling biocontrol of plant pathogen that retard growth. These microorganisms produce hormone-like substances that positively influence biological processes that regulate plant physiology, metabolism, morphology and interactions within the agroecosystem.Continuous research in the area of soil based organisms is enabling greater understanding of the complex world of bacteria leading to the development of new categories of microbiome ecosystem. Crop probiotics are now poised to emerge into powerful new plant biostimulants solutions. A major factor influencing growth in the market is the projected increase in demand for organic foods to over US$300 billion by 2022 and a parallel rise in organic farming area to a record high of 75 million hectares by 2020.Expected global population growth to over 8.5 billion by 2030 brings special focus on food security, crop productivity and yields. In addition, the growing CO2 footprint of fertilizers is raising concerns forcing the regulatory authorities to crack down on indiscriminate use of fertilizers. A case in point is the growing CO2 Footprint of Ammonium Nitrate, the most common chemical fertilizer. The use of this fertilizer accounts for the largest share of emissions, approximately 40%, during its production and use.The proposed imposition of agriculture carbon tax in several developed countries worldwide is additionally encouraging robust penetration of environmentally friendly farming practices in world's farms. For instance, over 35% of farming practices worldwide is based on eco-friendly approaches. In response to the growing need for eco-friendly solutions, investments in plant science is growing as measured by projected spending on agricultural biotechnology which is projected to reach US$60 billion by 2024.All of these factors combine to provide robust growth opportunities for plant biostimulants. Interestingly, growth in hydroponics is driving increased demand for seaweed extracts. The growing trend towards greenhouse horticulture as an intensive farming method to grow crops with less water, artificially managed temperature and protected from natural climatic and environmental conditions will also spur growth of biostimulants such as protein hydrolysates, humic and fulvic acids.China will rank as a major market with a CAGR of 14.2% over the analysis period supported by the fact that the country ranks as the world's largest agrarian economy backed with strong policy level support for the adoption of environment friendly agricultural inputs. The Chinese government focuses on farmer education to enhance awareness over crop economics and risk management and stay abreast of new developments in technology, science and business.Key Topics Covered:I.

US stocks slide from records as wait continues for CongressAssociated Press InternationalDecember 18, 2020 Friday 9:49 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 852 wordsByline: STAN CHOE and ALEX VEIGA, AP Business WritersBodyWall Street capped a solid week of gains on a down note Friday as the wait drags on to see if Congress can reach a deal to send more cash to struggling workers and businesses.The S&P 500 fell 0.4%, a day after it and other major indexes returned to record heights. The decline snapped a three-day winning streak for the benchmark index, but it still notched a 1.3% weekly gain that more than made up its prior week's loss.Hope that Congress may be nearing a deal to offer more financial support for the economy has helped stocks set more record highs. The S&P clocked its 31st all-time high this year on Thursday. Enthusiasm about vaccines for COVID-19, which investors hope will get the economy back on the road to normalcy next year, has also fueled traders' optimism.Friday's selling came on a particularly busy day on Wall Street. Index funds were expected to snap up more than $80 billion worth of shares in Tesla as they moved to rebalance their holdings for the quarter ahead of the electric car maker's entry into the S&P 500, effective Monday. In addition, Friday was also quadruple witching day, Wall Street-speak for the quarterly expiration of stock options and futures contracts, which forces traders to tie up loose ends in contracts they hold, leading to particularly heavy trading volume.“This is an unusual day because we have Tesla entering the S&P and it’s quadruple witching day," said Andrew Slimmon, portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.The S&P 500 index fell 13.07 points to 3,709.41. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 124.32 points, or 0.4%, to 30,179.05. The Nasdaq composite gave up 9.11 points, or 0.1%, to 12,755.64. The Russell 2000 dropped 8.06 points, or 0.4%, to 1,969.99.Some 57% of the companies in the S&P 500 closed lower. Technology stocks, banks and companies that rely on consumer spending accounted for a big slice of the decline. They outweighed gains by household goods makers and materials stocks, among others.Much of the market’s focus recently has been on Capitol Hill, where momentum has kicked back up for on-and-off-again talks for financial aid for the economy. Negotiations on nearly $1 trillion in relief had seemed to be on the brink of success, but a final agreement has yet to be sealed. The package could include benefits for laid-off workers and cash payments sent to most Americans.Economists and investors say the need for such action is urgent, as the worsening pandemic tightens its chokehold on the economy. Reports this week showed that more workers are applying for jobless benefits and that sales for retailers slumped by more last month than economists expected.The rising coronavirus counts and deaths are pushing governments around the world to bring back varying degrees of restrictions on businesses, and fear is keeping people and companies away from normal economic activity.Wall Street’s hope is that Congress can approve big stimulus for the economy, which could carry it through what’s expected to be a dismal winter, before the widespread rollout of COVID-19 vaccines can help it begin to stand on its own next year.The nation’s first coronavirus vaccine just began being administered this past week, and Vice President Mike Pence got a shot on live television Friday in hopes of assuring Americans that it’s safe. That vaccine was developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. A second vaccine from Moderna and the National Institutes of Health may also be on the brink of regulatory approval after a government advisory panel endorsed it on Thursday.Of course, it will be months before most people will be able to get access to a vaccine, and the pandemic is likely to do even more damage in the interim.Within the S&P 500, FedEx dropped 5.7% for one of the sharpest losses in the index, even though it reported stronger revenue and profit for its latest quarter than Wall Street expected. Analysts said some of the weakness may have been due to expectations simply building too high for the company, which has been a winner of the suddenly shop-from-home economy. FedEx also reported higher costs, including expenses for keeping workers safe from the coronavirus.Shares of Tesla surged 6%. Roughly $4.6 trillion in investments directly mimics the index, and those funds will collectively be adding tens of billions of dollars of Tesla shares, which is set to become one of the 10 biggest stocks in the S&P 500.Stock markets overseas made mostly modestly moves.In Asia, some of the sharpest swings came from Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng index fell 0.7% and shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. lost 5.2%. The U.S. Commerce Department said Friday it will restrict exports to China's top chipmaker, alleging it has ties to the military. The company has previously said it has no ties to the Chinese governmentIt's the latest escalation in trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.Other Asian markets were mixed. European markets ended mostly lower.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.94% from 0.91% late Thursday.___AP Business Writer Joe McDonald contributed.Load-Date: December 18, 2020End of Document

China's space ambitions: Robot on Mars, a human on the moonAssociated Press InternationalDecember 2, 2020 Wednesday 1:26 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 888 wordsByline: JOE McDONALD and VICTORIA MILKO, Associated PressDateline: BEIJING BodyBEIJING (AP) — China’s landing of its third probe on the moon is part of an increasingly ambitious space program that has a robot rover en route to Mars, is developing a reusable space plane and is planning to put humans back on the lunar surface.The Chang’e 5, the first effort to bring lunar rocks to Earth since the 1970s, collected samples on Wednesday, the Chinese space agency announced. The probe landed Tuesday on the Sea of Storms on the moon's near side.Space exploration is a political trophy for the ruling Communist Party, which wants global influence to match China's economic success.China is a generation behind the United States and Russia, but its secretive, military-linked program is developing rapidly. It is creating distinctive missions that, if successful, could put Beijing on the leading edge of space flight.The coming decade will be “quite critical” in space exploration, said Kathleen Campbell, an astrobiologist and geologist at The University of Auckland.“This is where we’re going to transform out of near Earth orbit and back into what people will call ‘deep space,’” Campbell said.In 2003, China became the third nation to launch an astronaut into orbit on its own, four decades after the former Soviet Union and the United States. Its first temporary orbiting laboratory was launched in 2011 and a second in 2016. Plans call for a permanent space station to be launched after 2022.This week’s landing is “a historic step in China’s cooperation with the international community in the peaceful use of outer space,” said a foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying.“China will continue to promote international cooperation and the exploration and use of outer space in the spirit of working for the benefit of all mankind,” Hua said.After astronaut Yang Liwei’s 2003 flight, space officials expressed hope for a crewed lunar mission as early as this year. But they said that depended on budget and technology. They have pushed back that target to 2024 or later.The space agency gave no reason for landing its latest probe on the Sea of Storms, far from where American and Soviet craft touched down. But the choice might help to shed light on possible sites being studied for a crewed mission.Beijing's space plane would be China's version of the American Space Shuttle and the former Soviet Union’s short-lived Buran.China also has launched its own Beidou network of navigation satellites so the Communist Party’s military wing, the People’s Liberation Army, doesn’t need to rely on the U.S.-run GPS or a rival Russian system.Last year, China graduated from “me too” missions copying Soviet and American ventures to scoring its own firsts when it became the first nation to land a probe on the moon’s little-explored far side.That probe, the Chang’e 4, and its robot rover still are functioning, transmitting to Earth via an orbiter that passes over the moon’s far side. China’s first moon lander, the Chang’e 3, still is transmitting.China’s earliest crewed spacecraft, the Shenzhou capsules, were based on Russian technology. Its powerful Long March rockets are, like their Soviet and American predecessors, based on ballistic missiles developed using technology seized from Nazi Germany after World War II.China has proceeded more cautiously than the breakneck U.S.-Soviet space race of the 1960s, which was marked by fatalities. China’s crewed missions have gone ahead without incident. Some launches of robot vehicles have been delayed by technical problems but those appear to have been resolved.China is in a growing space rivalry with Asian neighbors Japan and India, which it sees as strategic competitors. Both have sent their own probes to Mars.While Chang'e 5 gathers moon rocks, Japan's space agency just pulled off the even more challenging feat of obtaining samples from an asteroid, Ryugu. The Hayabusa2 mission is due to deliver those to Earth on Saturday.As its confidence grows, Beijing’s space goals have multiplied.It has joined the race to explore Mars, and its Tianwen-1 probe, launched in July carrying a robot rover to search for signs of water, is due to complete its 470-million kilometer (292-million mile) journey in February.Plans call for a permanent crewed space station as early as 2022.China is excluded from the International Space Station due to U.S. opposition to including Chinese military officers in a venture that otherwise is operated by civilian space agencies.Plans also call for an international lunar research base at some point, the deputy director of the Chinese agency’s lunar exploration center, Pei Zhaoyu, told reporters last week.Despite its successes, the military-run Chinese program is more secretive than those of other governments.Yang and other Chinese astronauts made only a handful of brief public appearances following their flights, in contrast to Soviet and American astronauts who were sent on global publicity tours before cheering foreign crowds.The agency announced in September its space plane had completed a successful test flight but has yet to release details or even a photo of the craft.___Milko reported from Jakarta, Indonesia.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

Global Octane Improver Fuel Additives Market 2020-2025 - Growing Demand for Ethanol-Blended Fuels - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireNovember 4, 2020 Wednesday 1:35 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 957 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Octane Improver Fuel Additives Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2020 - 2025)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The market for octane improver fuel additives is expected to grow at a CAGR greater than 3% globally during the forecast periodGrowing demand for ethanol-blended fuels along with increasing demand for high-performance fuels are driving the market. On the flip side, stringent environmental regulations coupled with unfavorable conditions arising due to the COVID-19 outbreak are hindering the market growth.The octane improver fuel additives market is expected to grow during the forecast period owing to the growing demand for ethanol-blended fuels. Asia-Pacific region to dominate the market across the globe with the largest growth from countries such as China and India.Key Market TrendsGrowing Demand for Ethanol-Blended FuelsAmong all octane improver fuel additives, ethanol occupies a major share and is expected to grow rapidly during the forecast period.• Ethanol has an octane rating of about 108 and is added to fuel to increase the overall octane rating of the fuel. The use of ethanol-blended fuel reduces the emission of NOX, CO, and particulate matter. Due to the lower carbon to hydrogen ratio, the use of ethanol reduces carbon-dioxide emissions and increases fuel efficiency. The use of ethanol produced from bio-based instead of petroleum-based is expected to reduce pollution and drive the market during the forecast period.• It is found that there is a significant drop in the production of flexible fuel vehicles in 2019-20 in some parts of the United States which can run on E15, E40, and E85. However, there is a rise in demand for E15 vehicles and for the first time BMW models were approved for use of E15 and it is expecting to launch E25 by the end of 2020.• However, due to unprecedented conditions arisen due to the COVID-19 outbreak the consumption of oil & gas is down by at least 5 million barrels per day due to lockdown in various countries resulting in the complete shutdown of travel, tourism, and e-commerce are likely to affect the consumption in 2020 and is expected to reach to normal by early 2021.• The growing urbanization and increasing need for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are expected to drive the market for the octane improver fuel additives during the forecast period.Asia-Pacific Region to Dominate the MarketThe Asia-Pacific region is expected to dominate the market for octane improver fuel additive during the forecast period due to an increase in demand from countries like China, and India• To reduce the pollution and particulate matter (PM 2.5) emissions, the Chinese government proposed guideline for the mandate adaptation of 10% ethanol-blended gasoline by the end of 2020 and by encouraging corn production, China is expecting to reach it's ethanol demand through bio-based production thereby reducing the impact on the environment.• In early 2010, diesel was available at a discount price of about INR 25 to petrol, but now the difference is in single digits. As the price differential is reducing, the preference for petrol(gasoline)-based vehicles is expected to grow in the future.• The Indian diesel cars sales accounted for about 19% in FYI 2019 compared to more than 50% in the year 2012, and the mandate of BS-VI engine vehicles from April-2020 made it much more difficult. India's largest automaker announced that it will discontinue the majority of its diesel car models production. While other manufacturers are expected to follow a strategic approach and will produce only high-end and heavy model diesel cars. The growing demand for petrol-based vehicles is expected to drive the market for gasoline octane improvers during the forecast period.• The aforementioned factors, coupled with government support, are contributing to the increasing demand for octane improver fuel additives market in the Asia-Pacific during the forecast period.Competitive LandscapeThe global octane improver fuel additives market is partially fragmented with players accounting for a marginal share of the market.

Treasury Sanctions CEIEC for Supporting the Illegitimate Maduro Regime's Efforts to Undermine Venezuelan DemocracyTargeted News ServiceDecember 1, 2020 Tuesday 9:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 734 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of the Treasury issued the following news release on Nov. 30:Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated CEIEC for supporting the illegitimate Maduro regime's efforts to undermine democracy in Venezuela, including its efforts to restrict internet service and conduct digital surveillance and cyber operations against political opponents. Chinese technology companies, including CEIEC, continue to challenge democratic values of freedom and transparency by developing and exporting tools to monitor, censor, and surveil citizens' activities on the internet."The illegitimate Maduro regime's reliance on entities like CEIEC to advance its authoritarian agenda further illustrates the regime's prioritization of power over democratic values and processes," said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. "The United States will not hesitate to target anyone helping to suppress the democratic will of the Venezuelan people and others around the world."This entity was designated pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13692, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions.Nondemocratic governments use Chinese-exported technologies such as those CEIEC has provided to repress political dissent within their own borders. CEIEC has been supporting the Maduro regime's malicious cyber efforts since 2017. CEIEC has provided software, training, and technical expertise to Venezuela government entities, which was then used against the people of Venezuela. CEIEC provides cyber support and technical experts to state-run telecommunications provider Venezuelan National Telephone Company (CANTV), which controls 70 percent of internet service in all of Venezuela. The suite of software and hardware that CEIEC provided Venezuela is a commercialized version of China's "Great Firewall." The Great Firewall is China's nationwide system of web blocks and filters, used to maintain strict online censorship, control the information Chinese citizens can access outside China, and prevent the internal dissemination of content deemed undesirable by political leadership.The Maduro regime has repeatedly demonstrated its willingness to suppress its citizens' democratic rights, intimidate them from expressing their political views, or overwhelm their voices using technology-enabled means, as buttressed by CEIEC.

MEMO TO THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON COPING WITH TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS IN EUROPEStates News ServiceDecember 18, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1543 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Peterson Institute for International Economics:Background: Current technological innovation has driven Europe and the United States to rely on online platforms for intermediating commercial transactions. That trend is in turn spreading the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, and greatly increasing the value of big data accumulation. As a result, it is crucial that EU competition authorities focus on their core mission to combat market distortions in the digital, data, and state-linked entities realms. The threat of autocratic economic power from digital corporations is Europe-wide, and, in fact, international, and must be addressed with that scope in mind. The European Union is leading in terms of action and thinking when it comes to regulating the digital economy. The United States and other advanced economies should be encouraged to emulate and catch up rather than to see Europe's digital regulatory action as a threat.Key PrioritiesPRIORITY 1: Regulate digital platforms as gatekeepersThe pandemic lockdowns have promoted the online business model of digital platforms. COVID-19 has consequently accelerated the already high corporate concentration in many digitized sectors, further raising concerns that these large incumbent firms exploit their privileged position to the detriment of other suppliers. In response, the European Commission recently published its new Digital Markets Act (DMA), identifying large online platforms as "gatekeepers" and subjecting them to obligations and prohibitions aimed at ensuring a level playing field between them and the many third parties relying on their platforms. The DMA comes with biting enforcement powers, including as a last resort the breakup of a gatekeeper firm. The Commission has tasked itself with enforcing the DMA and must do so in a timely and vigilant manner. Suspected abuse of dominant positions should be preemptively sanctioned to avoid market facts on the ground becoming settled ahead of binding conclusions reached only after lengthy judicial review processes. Given that US federal and state governments, as well as US congressional committees, have recently launched similar investigations of gatekeeper firms, a preference, though no requirement, exists for the European Commission to implement the DMA in a collaborative way with the incoming Biden administration.PRIORITY 2: Limit how long digital companies can hold exclusive rights to harvested big dataDigital platforms have privileged access to large amounts of harvested data on consumers' behavior in the digital marketplace, their physical movements, and other personal preference information. This uneven access to big data is a growing market distortion.The European Commission should ensure that big data datasets above a certain threshold size[1] are made available as anonymized data to the public, including to competing firms. The collecting digital platform should have only a limited time window of exclusivity. Recent EU proposals to facilitate "voluntary data sharing" are unlikely to suffice. The value of big data datasets to digital collectors should be temporary, in the same way that time-limited patent protections are, trading off the private benefits of incentivizing collection and innovation against the public interest in wide access to the information collected (and made subject to scrutiny).Implementing similar mandatory data sharing practices must also be extended beyond the currently dominant digital platforms, as the rollout of 5G broadband cellular networks and the Internet of Things will expedite the collection of valuable big data datasets across all economic sectors. This prospect highlights the fact that mandatory data sharing is not aimed exclusively at successful US digital platform businesses. Therefore, Europe should offer to collaborate with US regulators, encouraging US oversight and regulation in a European direction. This cooperative approach is in the EU's interest and preferable to the delayed or diminished adoption of nascent US federal regulation on data harvesting. The goal should be to avoid feeding industry claims that this effort is about creating European national champions when it is actually about competition and public access.PRIORITY 3: Address competitive distortions from Chinese and other state-subsidized FDI and tender bidsAuthoritarian government influence over Chinese businesses in critical industries creates potential national security concerns, and the continued growth of outward investment by China's still often state-supported economy raises important competition policy and state aid challenges in Europe. Chinese state-linked private entities or state-owned enterprises (SOEs) can enjoy preferential access to state-owned bank financing, enabling them to outbid other interested parties in target acquisitions, or to offer below-market pricing in tender bids. This issue also exists in other countries with rising state-involvement in outward economic activities, but China's size and autocratic polity makes it rightly the focus of attention.The European Commission should implement state aid regulations compelling inward investors relying on state-linked financial resources to a priori prove that they do not enjoy a distortive nonmarket financial benefit. Failure to do so should result in acquisitions or tender bids being blocked. This initiative should be pursued with the goal of a multilateral solution within the World Trade Organization (WTO), and rapid cooperation with the United States and other allies on a plurilateral approach should be the immediate next step towards that goal.PRIORITY 4: Refocus the priorities for the Directorate-General for Competition and the Commissioners' Group on a Europe Fit for the Digital AgeThe Executive Vice-President for a Europe fit for the Digital Age should accept that completing long-term "legacy projects," like the Single Market in Services or rooting out excessive state aid in the EU banking sector, are now of secondary importance to digital-related competition issues. The Vice-President should further refrain from thrusting the Directorate-General for Competition into domestic tax and industrial policy matters. These are truly legacy issues that have little to do with the future development of the European economy as compared to the rapidly evolving transnational digital issues. The legacy issues remain a political time-sink for little gain. Thus, the Vice-President should specifically desist from the following activities:Stop the creation of European champions to allegedly better compete globallyThe merging of European firms into larger entities, which gives them a larger global presence but also the potential to dominate some EU member state markets, must continue to be resisted. Such European champions invariably consist of firms located in the two or three largest member states, which then tend to exploit their market power in smaller members. In general, given the size of the EU trade surplus, merging European businesses into larger units for competitive reasons is superfluous. European "industrial policy" might be warranted in special circumstances only in sectors with no existing EU productive capacity that also pass a critical standard for positive spillovers on productivity and unemployment.Stop the pursuit of low tax EU jurisdictions via state aid litigationThe European Court of Justice's recent annulment (currently under appeal by the Commission) of the state aid case against Ireland and Apple signals the legal difficulty of proving that governments bestow discretionary tax benefits on individual firms. The case reveals that European state aid regulations are ineffective in compelling member states to levy, and firms to pay, higher corporate taxes, even in seemingly obvious cases. In any event, deciding corporate tax rates and a possible common corporate tax base in Europe is a job for European legislators, not the Commission. Conditional on constructive engagement by the Biden administration, the potential agreement of a reform of the global corporate tax framework in the multilateral Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's base erosion and profit sharing (BEPS) process may address most of these concerns, including preempting national digital services taxes. The Directorate-General for Competition should leave this to the relevant political authorities.Note1. The threshold for "importance" of a big data dataset will depend on the sector. There is likely to be an overall simple size threshold beyond a certain level of terabytes of data, consumers or consumer transactions included, at which eventual dissemination is in the public interest. However, big data datasets specific to some sectors or particular market segments might be smaller but cover a far larger share of recent relevant transactions. Hence the well-known competition policy issue of determining what the relevant market is for legal analysis will resurface in this type of data sharing mechanism. It seems likely that case law will be important in settling the relevant data share or intensity for eventual public dissemination over time.Load-Date: December 19, 2020End of Document

North Korea: report says tens of thousands of people have died of COVID-19 in secret campsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 7, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 651 wordsBodyOne report said tens of thousands of people are dying of COVID-19 in North Korea, confined to secret quarantine camps run by the Kim Jong-un regime, which claims the country has not recorded any case of the disease.The reports are joined by the skepticism of South Korea, whose Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said Saturday at a security conference in the Middle East that he finds "hard to believe" that there has not been an outbreak in North Korea.Within the framework of the Annual Dialogue of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in Bahrain, Kang Kyung-wha added that numerous indications show how Pyongyang is very focused on controlling the disease it claims it does not have. As reported by Channel News Asia, the minister described the situation as "a little strange." A day earlier, a specialized media outlet in North Korea but based south of the border, Daily NK, claimed that more than 50,000 people were killed in the "COVID-19 quarantine facilities" established by the North Korean dictator's regime.The publication, led mainly by North Korean defectors known to be highly critical of Kim's regime, stated that nearly 4,200 North Korean soldiers are among those who have died in the alleged camps, many of whom are led by the military themselves.The Us mediaman Washington Times attempted to verify the report without getting answers, while a reputable North Korean expert said it should be analyzed with a mixture of skepticism and seriousness."We have to be skeptical of these reports, but if they're true, we need to be vigilant," said David Maxwell, a U.S. Special Forces exoficial at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington."These conditions could lead to significant instability within North Korea and kim Jong-un's crisis action decision-making," Maxwell said in comments that circulated by email on Sunday.This is not the first document that references fields. In November, a report by the Seoul-based NGO Helping Hands Korea, led by Christian activist Tim Peters, also referred to its existence. In an interview with the South China Morning Post (SCMP), Peters said the situation was "alarmed." He added that it was up to the families of quarantined citizens to go to the edge of the camps and bring them food to keep them alive along with any other health-related assistance they might gather. The claim about secret quarantine fields coincides with reports that North Korea is executing an elaborate cyberespionage operation aimed at hacking companies that develop COVID-19 treatments and vaccines, including US pharmaceutical giant Johnson &Johnson;.Sources involved in the investigation of the alleged hacking say it began in August and September, when the race to develop vaccines gained strength among U.S., British, South Korean and other research firms, according to reports from Reuters and The Wall Street Journal.Kim's regimen has not confirmed a single case of coronavirus in its isolated nation. However, officials in South Korea and the United States say there is an outbreak of unknown proportions in the country, which maintained important trade and cross-border activities with China before closing its borders shortly after it was discovered that the virus was spreading in the neighboring country in early 2020.The previous week a Japanese intelligence report circulated claiming that the Chinese government has given them the vaccineCOVID-19 to dictator Kim Jong Un, his family, and other senior officials of the North Korean regime. The report of the online publication "19FortyFive" stated that two Japanese intelligence sources said Kim and "many other" regimen officials received the vaccine "in the last two to three weeks."More on this topic: North Korea confines its COVID-19 patients into "quarantine camps" and lets them dieNorth Korean-linked hackers attacked pharmaceutical companies for COVID-19-related informationLoad-Date: December 8, 2020End of Document

Elon Musk tried to sell Tesla to AppleTesla founder and CEO Elon Musk said Tuesday that it was "strange if true" the information about Apple's alleged project to produce electric vehicles and revealed that years ago he tried to sell his company to the apple company.Musk acknowledged that "on the blackest days of the Model 3 program I contacted Tim Cook (Apple's CEO) to discuss the possibility of Apple buying Tesla (for a tenth of our current value)." 2. Facebook and Google will cooperate in the face of possible investigationFacebook and Google agreed to "cooperate and assist each other" if investigated for their digital advertising pact, according to U.S. authorities in a lawsuit to which The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) had access.The text is a full version of the complaint filed last week by a group of states against Google, which included numerous confidential passages detailing the allegations.The lawsuit alleges that the two internet giants closed an agreement in September 2018 that Facebook was committed not to compete with Google's advertising tools in exchange for favourable treatment to use them.3. IBM will "go to the cloud" with NordcloudIBM announced that it has reached an agreement to acquire European cloud computing company Nordcloud, with the aim of driving "the company's transformation and migration capabilities to the cloud."In a statement, IBM noted that Nordcloud "has become a pan-European leader in cloud transformation services in the last ten years."What the company does say is that once the transaction is completed, Nordcloud, based in Helsinki, Finland, and offices in ten European countries, "will become an IBM company."4.

'Absolute right guy for the job': New cyber chief takes reins amid the chaosPolitico.comNovember 17, 2020 Tuesday 9:30 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 2091 wordsHighlight: Colleagues say Brandon Wales, a career employee at DHS, is ideally suited to lead its Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency after the president's firing of Chris Krebs.BodyFive months before President Donald Trump fired him, federal cybersecurity chief Chris Krebs made a key addition to his leadership team - a career employee he trusted to take charge if shifting political winds threatened to leave his agency rudderless.Those winds arrived on Wednesday, and now Brandon Wales is leading the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency as it becomes the latest arm of the executive branch to take the brunt of the White House's post-election purge.Wales, CISA's top career staffer and officially its executive director, became its acting director on Wednesday after Trump fired Krebs for debunking the baseless election-related conspiracy theories that the president and his allies are promoting. At least for now, that debunking continues - the agency "Rumor Control" website that so angered the White House was still operating Wednesday afternoon, although Wales has not continued Krebs' practice of indirectly trolling the president on Twitter.The new chief is a veteran of roles both prominent and obscure at CISA's parent, the Department of Homeland Security, which he joined just a few years after its post-Sept. 11 creation. And he's the ideal person to take over at such a moment of chaos, seven current and former colleagues say. They describe him as brilliant, calm under pressure and better versed in DHS's cyber mission than virtually anyone else.One ex-colleague said Wales has even had experience in helping DHS's leadership organize efforts to secure U.S. election security at a time when the subject drew little interest from the Trump White House.In other words, Trump's purge of CISA's leadership has unintentionally elevated the very official whom Krebs put in place to protect the agency in a situation like this. And unlike Krebs and former CISA Deputy Director Matthew Travis - who submitted his resignation under White House pressure after Krebs' firing - Wales is not a political appointee who can be ousted at Trump's whim."He is one of the smartest people I've ever worked with, certainly one of the smartest guys at DHS," said Bryan Ware, who led CISA's Cybersecurity Division until he too resigned last week under pressure from the White House. "I just can't think of anybody who's better prepared for this job than him.""He's the most even-handed guy you're ever going to meet," said a current U.S. executive-branch official who has worked with Wales and requested anonymity to speak candidly. "I think he's the absolute right guy for the job."Wales is still deciding how to engage with the public, one person familiar with his plans said Wednesday. The person said Wales plans to keep CISA's Rumor Control website active but, unlike Krebs, does not plan to tweet about it.In an email to CISA employees obtained by POLITICO, Wales urged staff to stay the course. "A change in leadership is not a change in mission," he wrote.Wales noted that the 2020 election cycle continues, including in Georgia, where two run-off Senate elections will decide control of the upper chamber."We made great strides in our election security efforts," he wrote, "and we need to stay focused on continuing to provide the assistance and guidance that state and local election officials have come to rely on."While Wales was adjusting to the abrupt transition Wednesday, CISA employees tried to carry on as usual despite Krebs' firing, said one staff member, who added that they have been thanking and celebrating Krebs on the agency's Microsoft Teams chat platform. "Thank you for your service and leadership, Chris," one message said, according to the employee. Another called Krebs "a true public servant."Other than that, "it's pretty quiet, just another Wednesday doing the work," said the employee, who requested anonymity to speak freely.Wales' low public profile - he does not appear to have accounts on Twitter or even LinkedIn - belies his extensive experience in both the bowels of DHS and its highest echelons.Wales, 43, earned a bachelor's degree from The George Washington University and a master's degree from Johns Hopkins' School of Advanced International Studies before serving as a national security adviser to former Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.). But he has spent most of his career at DHS. He joined the department in 2005, shortly after its creation, ran its Homeland Infrastructure Threat and Risk Analysis Center from 2009 to 2014, and spent the next three years running its Office of Cyber and Infrastructure Analysis."He is very smart, a good analyst and terrific briefer," said Suzanne Spaulding, who created OCIA while running DHS's cyber wing during the Obama administration.From August 2017 to January 2019, while still officially an employee of CISA's predecessor division, Wales served on a detail as a senior counselor on cyber issues to DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. (For part of this time, Nielsen's chief of staff was Chad Wolf, a connection that could help Wales now that Wolf is the acting secretary and his boss.) In January 2019, Nielsen made him her deputy chief of staff. He became chief of staff that June, under then-acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan.Ware, who started working with Wales in the years after DHS's creation and later served with him when they were Nielsen's cyber advisers, said his deep knowledge of the department would prove invaluable."He's really been at the table for every major cyber event that DHS has been a part of," Ware said, "both in his capacity as an analyst and leading teams of analysts ... but also because he was the cyber adviser to the secretary, the chief of staff to the secretary, so he's had direct access and direct involvement at the highest levels across the interagency for a long time now."That meant that Wales was in place at DHS as the Chinese government breached the White House and military computer networks in 2008; Iran waged cyberattacks against U.S. banks from 2012 to 2013; Russian hackers intruded into the White House and State Department in 2014; North Korea breached Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014; China hacked the Office of Personnel Management in 2015, stealing millions of highly sensitive security clearance files; and Russia interfered in the 2016 election.Wales' work across DHS, especially in the secretary's office, prepared him to "navigate some of the competing equities and the personalities" who factor into any major decision, said the U.S. official."Brandon's reputation is one of supreme intellect - someone who understands very, very complexed, nuanced ideas in and out but also can translate that for more policy-minded folks," the official said.As DHS's leadership changed, this official recalled, Wales remained a "cornerstone person," with a reputation such that "everybody can trust him."In 2018, as the White House ignored Nielsen's requests to focus on election security and declined to convene certain National Security Council meetings, she tapped Wales to work with Krebs in her previously reported efforts to bypass the White House."Brandon was instrumental in saying, 'Fine, if the White House won't do it, we'll do it, we'll create a ghost NSC, and we'll pull together these meetings, and we'll invite all the different agencies that should be there, and we'll just do the coordination ourselves," said Miles Taylor, who was Nielsen's chief of staff at the time. Those meetings on election security created the coordination needed to effectively protect the midterm elections in 2018, he said."He was really the one who drove that train for Nielsen," Taylor said, "and it made a huge difference."In December, Wales returned to CISA to lead its strategy and planning office. "Brandon's breadth of experience in the Department and within CISA has prepared him well for this role," Krebs told employees in an email obtained by POLITICO.In June, Krebs promoted Wales to be CISA's executive director, a position he'd created to ensure that an experienced career staffer could lead the agency during a political transition - whether that was a standard handoff between administrations or a White House purge of the agency's leadership, as happened this week.When he arrived at CISA from the secretary's office, Wales "was immediately Chris's right-hand man ... because of his superb reputation and acknowledged expertise," said the U.S. official who has worked with him. "Chris was signaling to the community that he was the next in line."A Democratic congressional staffer recalled talking to Wales about cyber provisions in this year's defense policy bill."He certainly impressed me with his ability to get into some of the nitty gritty," said the staffer, who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. "He really had a firm grasp of the policy stuff."Wales also impressed people with how easily and humbly he switched from being a Cabinet secretary's senior adviser to being the top staffer at a DHS component agency."That just demonstrates who he is," said the U.S. official. "He's mission focused, and he's practical. He's not out there for the spotlight. ... He's there to do the job."Several months ago, when a transition seemed inevitable, Ware began taking Wales with him to "all of my meetings with our intelligence community partners and law enforcement partners," he said. A few days before Ware resigned, Wales led one such meeting with officials from the FBI, the NSA, U.S. Cyber Command and other CISA partners. "I think he's ready," Ware said. "He's known to and supported by CISA's partners.""I think honestly he's been mentally preparing for this job for months," the U.S. official said.Wales is no stranger to high-pressure environments, his colleagues said, though this one is particularly unusual: CISA is firmly in the president's sights after publicly disputing baseless White House claims of election fraud, amid a wholesale purge of national security leaders who have bucked Trump.People who know Wales say he is up to the task."He's been in the pressure cooker of being the chief of staff for the whole department," said Ware, "so I believe he has the experience and the wherewithal to withstand a very difficult couple of months as we transition the agency to new political leadership."As McAleenan's chief of staff, Wales fielded many "hyper-politicized" and potentially illegal requests from the White House, Taylor said, so "he's really well-equipped to protect the agency from that sort of activity in this time period."Even so, Wales' elevation comes at a precarious moment for CISA. In addition to the vacant director and deputy director positions, both the agency's Cybersecurity Division and Infrastructure Security Division lack permanent leaders. At CISA's partner agencies, including the FBI and the NSA, those division leaders' counterparts are career government employees, but at CISA, they are presidential appointees.CISA's chief of staff sent employees an email late Tuesday urging them not to "lose focus on the important work we collectively undertake on behalf of the American people."Despite his reputation for unflappability, Wales is likely feeling somewhat "overwhelmed" by his newfound responsibility for a massive national security agency, Ware said."This isn't a grab-the-brass-ring moment for Brandon," Ware added. "This is his duty, and I'm sure he feels the honor and responsibility to execute to his best ability. But I don't think this is the kind of circumstance that Brandon was aspiring for by any stretch."Looming over Wales is the possibility that Trump could appoint a new acting director, someone who would amplify rather than debunk his election claims. Similar moves have already occurred at the Pentagon, where Trump installed a new acting defense secretary who bypassed the line of succession after firing former Secretary Mark Esper.Trump said in October that he planned to appoint Sean Plankey, a top Energy Department cyber official, to lead CISA's infrastructure security division. When Plankey starts his job at CISA, he will be one of the few non-acting senior leaders there. A former DHS official, who requested anonymity to speculate about future moves, suggested that Trump could use Plankey's status to make him the new acting director and displace Wales. The former official described Plankey as a Trump supporter.If such a move is coming to CISA, employees don't know anything about it, Ware said."There have been a lot of surprises in the last week that have come from the White House," he said, "and I expect that those might continue."Martin Matishak contributed to this report.Load-Date: November 22, 2020End of Document

Fingerprint Recognition is Forecast to Grow Strongly in the Automotive Market as the Market Sees Increased Adoption of BiometricsPR NewswireNovember 17, 2020 Tuesday 12:45 PM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1084 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, Nov. 17, 2020 BodyPR NewswireThe"Biometric in the Automotive Market - Growth, Trends, Forecasts (2020 - 2025)"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.The global biometric in automotive market was valued at USD 183.59 million in 2019, and it is expected to reach USD 503.15 million by 2025, registering a CAGR of 19.06% during the period of 2020-2025. After the increased adoption of biometrics in electronic devices, the applications of biometrics in automotive vehicles have also been gaining traction in recent years. Yet the implementation of this technology has been limited to the premium vehicle segment, but in recent years, its applications are estimated to enter the general personal vehicle segment due to its better vehicle security and other accessibility advantages.Key Market TrendsFingerprint Recognition is Expected to Grow at a Significant RateFingerprint recognition technology evolved rapidly in the past few years, owing to the increased adoption of mobile devices and its increased adoption of biometric systems. Its application is majorly dominated by security and access control functions. This resulted in the advancements of fast-track technology in this segment, such as in display solutions. The increasing rate of adoption of fingerprint sensors across the consumer industries is expected to create significant opportunities for its adoption in the automotive sector. According to Credit Suisse, the global fingerprint sensing shipments are expected to reach about 1.1 billion units in 2020, which represents a projected increase of more than 200 million units in three years. The decreasing price of fingerprint sensors is making it affordable for various automakers to deploy them in their future cars without significantly impacting the price of the automobile, early adoption has prompted competitors as well to offer similar solutions. The average selling price of fingerprint sensors decreased from USD 5.5 in 2014 to USD 2.1 in 2019 and is expected to reach USD 2 in 2020. Also, the increasing trend of keyless entry in cars and push-button ignition systems has further triggered the development of fingerprint sensors in automobiles. The driver needs to place their finger on the capacitive sensor on the door handle to open the car door. Further, governments across the world are supporting the emergence of automated/connected vehicles. For instance, the standardization of ADAS and autonomous driving is accelerating in China. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the Chinese government issued the key working points of Intelligent Connected Vehicle Standardization for 2018 to promote and facilitate the development of the intelligent connected vehicles industry. Such trends are expected to boost the deployment of fingerprint recognition technology in the industry.North America Holds Significant Market ShareNorth America is one of the largest automotive manufacturing hubs in the world. The automotive industry has shown marginal growth in recent years. The automotive sector in this region is facing a stiff competition from the used car market, which constituted about 75% of the total auto sales in the United States in 2018, according to the estimates by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. Due to this, automotive manufacturers in the region rely on newer technologies, like biometrics, to create additional value and differentiation in the market.? The automotive sector in the region is the newly emerging market for the application of biometrics. The companies are strategically positioning and segmenting their biometric offerings toward the market. For instance, in November 2019, one of the key US-based players offering biometric for automotive, Nuance Communications, announced to spin-off its automotive biometric division, making a separate public company called Cerence Inc., catering only to the automotive market for biometrics. The company has mentioned this strategy to gain a first-mover advantage in developing biometric dedicated to the automotive industry.? The automotive companies in the region, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and Ford, already mentioned about integrating biometric technology in their high-end luxury segmented cars with high-security features. The companies have mentioned exploring biometric technology in various areas, including vehicular access, ignition switch, vehicle immobilizer, rationalization, and health monitoring.Key Topics Covered:1 INTRODUCTION2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY4 MARKET DYNAMICS4.1 Market Overview4.2 Industry Attractiveness - Porter's Five Force Analysis4.3 Industry Value Chain Analysis4.4 Market Drivers4.4.1 Increase in Need for Safety and Security System Across the Emerging Markets of Automobile Sector4.4.2 Benefits From Insurance Companies for Vehicles Installed with Biometric Technology4.5 Market Restraints4.5.1 Lack of Standardization4.6 Assessment of Impact of COVID-19 on the Market5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 Type5.1.1 Hardware5.1.2 Software5.2 Scanner Type5.2.1 Fingerprint Recognition5.2.2 Iris Recognition5.2.3 Palm Recognition5.2.4 Facial Recognition5.2.5 Voice Recognition5.2.6 Others Scanner Types5.3 Geography6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE6.1 Company Profiles7 INVESTMENT ANALYSIS8 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND FUTURE TRENDSCompanies MentionedSynaptics Incorporated Fingerprint Cards AB Aware Inc.

Worldwide Liner Hanger System Industry to 2025 - Increasing Demand from the Offshore Sector - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireDecember 23, 2020 Wednesday 4:05 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 888 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Liner Hanger System Market - Growth, Trends, and Forecast (2020 - 2025)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The market for liner hanger system is expected to witness a CAGR of more than 5.46% during the forecast period (2020-2025).Companies Mentioned• Halliburton Company• Schlumberger Limited• Weatherford International PLC• Baker Hughes Company• National Oilwell Varco Inc.• NCS Multistage LLC• Well Innovation AS• Innovex Downhole Solutions Inc.• Packers Plus Energy Services Inc.• Drill Quip Inc.Key Market TrendsIncreasing Demand from the Offshore SectorThe offshore oil and gas industry accounts for about 30% of the global crude oil production. The Middle East, North Sea, Brazil, and the Gulf of Mexico are the major offshore oil and gas producing regions.• In 2017, around 40% of shallow water oil production came from mature regions, such as Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific. The mechanical liner hangers are deployed in shallow waters, as they are relatively less expensive and technically less challenging for the operators to explore and drill. These systems are in high demand, where the well construction cost is the key priority for the customer.• More than 60% of the current crude oil production comes from mature oilfields, including onshore and shallow water. This, coupled with low breakeven prices in offshore oil and gas sector, has compelled the producers to shift to deepwater and ultra-deepwater resources. This factor is encouraging the industry to step up its expenditure gradually in the future.• Deepwater oil production is majorly concentrated in four countries - Angola, Brazil, Nigeria, and the United States. The Libra field in Brazil, the largest pre-salt discovery so far, began producing in late 2017 and the field development is expected to continue till 2020s.• The expandable liner hanger system is preferred for deepwater well completion and is designed for applications where long and heavy liners must be deployed in challenging environments, including deepwater, extended reach, and HP/HT wells.Asia-Pacific to Witness the Fastest GrowthThe Asia-Pacific region is expected to witness the fastest growth during the forecast period, with China being by far the largest market. In response to President Xi Jinping's call, in August 2017, to expedite domestic exploration and production activities (particularly for natural gas) to improve energy security, several companies, such as CNOOC, CNPC, and Sinopec, are set to increase their capital expenditure in exploration, development, and production activities. This will mean a significant boost to businesses for liner hanger systems, in the coming years.• In addition, the Chinese government is also undertaking significant favorable reforms to boost international participation in the oil and gas sector. As a critical part of the country's 13th five-year plan, the opening up of more acreage to independent participants is expected to diversify investments and increase drilling and completion activities, in turn, driving the liner hanger systems market in the country.• Furthermore, in India, large new field developments in deepwater are expected to be the key drivers for growth in the Indian liner hanger system market. In April 2018, BP and Reliance Industries sanctioned the 2nd phase development of the "Satellite cluster" project, located in the Bay of Bengal.• The companies in India are moving forward to develop the discovered deepwater gas fields in an integrated series of projects, and are expecting to produce 1 bcf/d, phased over 2020-22. Similar interests are being undertaken in other offshore fields as well, which are expected to result in the country witnessing greater demand for the expandable form of liner hangers in the long run.Key Topics Covered:1 INTRODUCTION1.1 Scope of the Study1.2 Market Definition1.3 Study Assumptions2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY4 MARKET OVERVIEW4.1 Introduction4.2 Market Size and Demand Forecast in USD million, till 20254.3 Global Onshore and Offshore Active Rig Count of Major Countries4.4 Estimated Number of Liner Hanger System Used in 2018, by Region and US Basin4.5 Onshore CAPEX Forecast in USD billion, till 20254.6 Offshore CAPEX Forecast in USD billion, by Region, till 20254.7 Historical and Forecast of Production from Deepwater, Oil Sands, and Tight Oil, till 20254.8 Brent Crude Oil and Henry Hub Spot Prices Forecast, till 20254.9 Key Upstream Projects for Investment Purposes4.10 Recent Trends and Developments4.11 Market Dynamics4.11.1 Drivers4.11.2 Restraints4.12 Industry Supply Chain Analysis4.13 Porter's Five Forces Analysis5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 Type5.1.1 Conventional Liner Hangers5.1.1.1 Mechanical Liner Hangers5.1.1.2 Hydraulic Liner Hangers5.1.2 Expandable Liner Hangers5.2 Location of Deployment5.2.1 Onshore5.2.2 Offshore5.3 Geography5.3.1 North America5.3.2 Europe5.3.3 South America5.3.4 Asia-Pacific5.3.5 Middle-East and Africa6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE6.1 Mergers and Acquisitions, Joint Ventures, Collaborations, and Agreements6.2 Strategies Adopted by Leading Players6.3 Company Profiles7 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND FUTURE TRENDSFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/tqp4qnView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201223005384/en/CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.comLaura Wood, Senior Press Managerpress@researchandmarkets.comFor E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900http://www.businesswire.comLoad-Date: December 23, 2020End of Document

ByteDance seeks financing before listing in Hong KongCE Noticias Financieras EnglishNovember 5, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 383 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- ByteDance Ltd. is in talks about a $2 billion round of funding before he began listing some of his businesses in Hong Kong, people familiar with the matter said, while negotiations on a sale from TikTok to Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. are stalled.TikTok's owner is in talks with a group of investors, including Sequoia on financing that would increase their valuation to $180 billion, people said, who asked not to be identified because the agreement talks are confidential. ByteDance could start preparing some of its biggest assets, including Douyin and Toutiao, for an initial public offering in Hong Kong, people said.The terms of the funding round can still change as negotiations continue, people added. A ByteDance representative declined to comment, while a Sequoia representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.ByteDance, already the world's most valuable startup, is fighting the Trump Administration's ban on TikTok in the United States, after the video service was labeled a threat to national security. He is now seeking approval from the U.S. and Chinese government for an agreement to sell an app share to Oracle and Walmart, although negotiations have stagnated during the election and for the legal battle over the implementation of the ban.This agreement, which included the condition that TikTok debut in 12 months on a U.S. stock exchange, garnered Donald Trump's initial blessing as a way to keep alive a social media phenomenon that has become the repository of music videos for more than 100 million Americans. ByteDance was looking for a $60 billion rating for the app, Bloomberg News reported in September.Zhang Yiming, the billionaire founder of ByteDance, has been reluctant to cede control over an app that turned into a real challenge for Google and Facebook Inc.TikTok emerged as a primary goal in Trump's effort to take strong action against China before the US election. Tensions between Washington and Beijing increased after his government embarked on a campaign to contain the country's technological dominance that also affected Tencent Holdings Ltd., which now fights a similar executive order prohibiting its WeChat application.Original Note:ByteDance Seeks Funds at $180 Billion Value Before IPO of Assets©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: November 6, 2020End of Document

RUBIO, CARDIN, RISCH, FEINSTEIN WELCOME PASSAGE OF THEIR BIPARTISAN BILL IN SUPPORT OF TIBETStates News ServiceDecember 22, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 486 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Jim Risch (R-ID), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), welcomed the passage of their bipartisan Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2019 (S.2539). The legislation, included in the fiscal year 2021 omnibus spending bill, seeks to update and strengthen the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 to address emerging human rights, religious freedom, and other challenges faced by the Tibetan people. Representative Jim McGovern (D-MA) introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives (H.R. 4331).Rubio is Co-Chair of the bipartisan and bicameral Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations' Subcommittee that oversees human rights, and is a member of the Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy."Passage of the Tibetan Policy and Support Act sends an important message that the United States stands with the Tibetan people and against any effort by the Chinese Communist Party to interfere with the religious process of identifying Tibetan Buddhist leaders, such as the Dalai Lama," Rubio said. "We must continue to shine a light on the grave assaults against the Tibetan people's religion, culture, and language by the Chinese Communist government, both inside Tibet and outside the PRC. I applaud the passage of this bipartisan legislation and urge the State Department to use the tools it provides to address escalating human rights abuses in Tibet.""Bipartisan passage of the Tibet Policy and Support Act sends a strong message to Chinese officials that the U.S. will not stay silent in the face of inference in the Tibetan Buddhist practices, including the deeply spiritual process of selecting the next Dalai Lama. Such actions will be met with consequences, such as the possibility of targeted Global Magnitsky sanctions," Cardin said. "Congress stands united in its support for the human rights, religious freedom and genuine autonomy of the Tibetan people.""We have come together with one voice by passing the Tibetan Policy and Support Act," Risch said. "I have long supported the rights and freedoms of the people of Tibet. I am particularly proud that this legislation reaffirms U.S. efforts to ensure that the next Dalai Lama is appointed solely by the Tibetan Buddhist faith community without interference from the Chinese Communist Party.""I'm very pleased that our bill to update the Tibet Policy Act will soon become law," Feinstein said. "It addresses the worsening human rights conditions and limitations on religious freedom in Tibet as well as China's efforts to intrude on matters best left to the Tibetan people. I thank Senator Rubio for his partnership on this bill and hope it brings about positive change for the Tibetan people."Load-Date: December 22, 2020End of Document

The checks of the weekCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 11, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 634 wordsBodyBelow is a selection of the main AFP checks this week:- NEW CORONAVIRUS -1. THE SAHIN FAMILYThe UK was the first Western country to start applying a covid-19 vaccine, developed by Pfizer and BioNTech and which had been authorised just a few days earlier. In this context, a photograph of a family of "Turkish Muslim immigrants" in Germany was circulated on social media, including Ugur Sahin, president of the pharmaceutical company BioNTech. Sahin did come to Germany from Turkey as a child, but that photo does not belong to his family.http://u.afp.com/UgurSahin2. BASELESS CONNECTIONSCoinciding also with the onset of vaccination in the UK, thousands of users shared a theory that the Wuhan laboratory in China, where the new coronavirus allegedly originated, belongs to glaxo, which would be part of a chain of connections ranging from pharmaceutical company Pfizer to investment fund manager BlackRock to Microsoft and Bill Gates. But the aforementioned Wuhan Virology Institute has no relation to Glaxo, but is owned by the Chinese government. Similarly, although Glaxo and Pfizer sealed a business alliance, they remain competitors.http://u.afp.com/GlaxoWuhan3. COVID-19, CANCER, AIDSThe unreleased speed with which different covid-19 vaccines have been developed has raised doubts and suspicions in some sectors, comparing immunization research to prevent AIDS (still non-existent) and cancer (only available for some types). But, in addition to providing incorrect data, they engage in a fallacious comparison, as these are very different diseases.http://u.afp.com/ComparaciónVacunas- OTHER THEMES -4. SAFE ABORTIONThe project to legalize abortion was debated again in Argentina, achieving its approval in the Chamber of Deputies. A similar initiative had failed two years ago, when Chinda Brandolino, a legist and denialist doctor at covid-19, gave an interview in which she claims that "there is no safe abortion." In the recently circulated recording, Brandolino makes several false claims about this practice, according to the testimony of obstetricians, medical associations and official protocols.http://u.afp.com/AbortoSeguro5. WOOD-BURNING MISSIONThe image of a truck with a sign that says "MPPA Feria Socialista Mission Leña" has been shared thousands of times since the end of October pointing out that it is the delivery of organized firewood in the face of gas shortages in Venezuela. But the photo is a montage. The original image shows a vehicle from the Venezuelan Ministry of The People's Power of Fisheries and Aquaculture in which the phrase "socialist fish fair" was inscribed.http://u.afp.com/LeñaVenezuela6. SOROS ARRESTED?Weeks after the U.S. election, publications emerged based on an article claiming that tycoon George Soros was arrested in Philadelphia for interfering in early November elections in that country. Some include an image of the alleged accusation. However, it was amended and a spokeswoman for Soros' founding stated that the claim is false.http://u.afp.com/SorosArresto7. CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGEPeru's new president, Francisco Sagasti, was given a statement stating that it is not possible to change the country's Constitution. In fact, Sagasti has been in favor of modifying Magna Carta, but assured that it will not be possible during his tenure, which ends in July 2021.http://u.afp.com/FraseSagasti8. IN A PLACE OF THE STAINThousands of people have been sharing an attributed text for monthsto Quixote in which the ingenious hidalgo would mention that "palaces are occupied by gañanes and huts by sages".

ADAS and Autonomous Driving LiDAR Technology Market Report, Edition 2020 - Integration Trends in Traditional ADAS Vehicles and Upcoming Autonomous Vehicles - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireNovember 9, 2020 Monday 11:19 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 1393 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "ADAS and Autonomous Driving LiDAR Technology Market, Edition 2020" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The report is a comprehensive analysis on the 50 LiDAR sensor manufacturers, 30 LiDAR sub-component suppliers including photodiodes, VCSEL, and optics, and over 100 OEMs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers.The report also analyses the industry sentiments by conducting in-depth interviews with some of the leading players across the ecosystem over a period of 12 months.Every company is experimenting with different technologies including mechanical scanning, MEMS, OPA, flash, FMCW, and other solid-state LiDARs according to requirements of their Tier 1 supplier and OEM partners. This report assist in identifying which technologies developed by the OEM-Tier1-LiDAR supplier partnership will be the first to witness low-price high volume production. There is a clear distinction in the technology choices made by some of the leading players in the ecosystem and the one which has the capability to mass produce automotive grade LiDAR at a relatively lower price range would win.Although the market is at a nascent stage today, the last 2 years developments and specially that took place in 2020 during the pandemic shows that the competition is intensifying aggressively. Be it the Waymo's entry in the LiDAR space by developing its own LiDAR solution after long-term use of Velodyne's LiDAR, or Velodyne recently going public shows intensifying investments to capitalise the expected future growth.It is no secret that the ADAS and autonomous vehicles industry is facing two major challenges right now in terms of development and deployment1. RegulationsUnless the regulations are in place for the higher level of autonomous driving systems, the OEMs will refrain from pushing such systems in the market. This is clear from the Audi's example, where the company after waiting for 3 years finally decided to pull-back the Audi A8 with Traffic Jam Assist system, a level 3 solution from the US market (only the functionality and not the car). On the contrary to regulations in the US, Chinese government and regulatory bodies are pushing to deploy autonomous vehicles on the roads by 2025.Such moves boost the industry moral to develop and deploy their solutions and monetise the heavy investments that goes into development process. To tackle this majority of OEMs specially American and European are now naming their systems as advanced systems like Level 2+ or Level 2++ which is more of a marketing gimmick by providing additional operational capabilities in their high-end trims (for instance hands-off driving without frequent alert).LiDAR sensors as costly find its use in high autonomy vehicles including robotic vehicles and unless the regulations are in place the demand is unlikely to pick up. This report gives in-depth analysis on the regional regulations, possible upcoming frameworks, and their impact on the ADAS and autonomous vehicles LiDAR market2. Technology ReadinessAlthough every player in the industry is investing heaving on R&D, there is quiet room for making the systems full proof. Currently the systems can handle acceleration, braking, and steering operations itself in know driving scenarios or environments. However, they are not yet fully functional in new road environments and scenarios, most of the time the driver has to take control (sometimes our of fear of possible crash). LiDAR sensing adds additional redundancy in the system by providing proper depth sensing in low-light and harsh environmental conditions. However, the pricing of the systems is a big concern in the industry currently. It is important for the LiDAR solution providers to develop an automotive grade robust system that can operate in extreme conditions considering all the possible wear and tear on roads but at low pricing.Exhaustive CoverageSince 2017, this is a third edition in the LiDAR market series reports published by the publisher on an annual basis.With a collective research database of more than 4 years, 1,500+ interviews, and a team of 5 LiDAR market consultants, we offer you the most exhaustive research study on ADAS and Autonomous Driving LiDAR Technology Market, trusted by hundreds on players in the automotive ecosystemOver 300 pages analysis, 200+ data tables, and 150+ critical market infographics this research study assists you in:• Analysis on the possible integration trends of LiDAR sensors both in traditional ADAS vehicles and upcoming autonomous vehicles in the form of robotaxis, shuttles, pods, and long-haul platooning trucks• Analysis on the requirements of LiDAR sensors across different vehicle types and expected pricing trends of LiDAR at high-volumes• Analysis on the first movers in the race for mass production of automotive grade LiDARs and their partnerships with OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers• Analysis of market trends in terms of mass production of LiDAR sensors from the technological, operational, and form factor point of view• Analysis on the market penetration, estimated shipments, market size, and pricing trends of LiDAR sensors across different levels of automation• Further deep dive analysis on the sub-component level market analysis of LiDAR sensors including photodiodes, VCSELs, and optics• Deep analysis on more than 100 companies across each layers of automotive LiDAR ecosystem including Tier 1 suppliers, LiDAR sensor suppliers, VCSEL suppliers, photodiode suppliers, among others• Special focus on three major markets globally - United States, China, and Western European countries.

Another judge blocks Trump decree that aims to ban TikTok in USCE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 8, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 340 wordsBodyA second federal judge suspended on Monday night an executive order from President Donald Trump that threatened to ban TikTok in the United States.Judge Carl Nichols of the Washington District Court said social media attorneys had shown that the Commerce Department likely exceeded its authority by trying to ban popular en application and "acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by not considering other obvious alternatives."The preliminary court order occurs more than a month after a similar one in a court in Pennsylvania.The White House claims that TikTok poses a risk to U.S. national security because of potential ties with the Beijing government through its Chinese owner ByteDance.Trump signed a decree on August 6 ordering Americans to stop doing business with ByteDance in 45 days, citing threats to U.S. "national security" and warning that TikTok users' personal data could be used by Beijing.The app has defended against these accusations, claiming that it stores user information on servers in the United States and Singapore.The latest decision follows another of October 30 at a Federal Court in Pennsylvania that temporarily blocked Trump's decree, ordering the government not to prevent other U.S. companies from providing essential services to TikTok, such as online accommodation.By the end of September, Judge Nichols had also issued a temporary order preventing the U.S. government from banning downloads of the app.On another front, TikTok is the subject of an August 14 Trump decree that forces ByteDance to sell its U.S. operations to American actors.The Treasury has repeatedly extended the deadline for the Chinese group to dispose of its assets, and on Friday it signaled that it would continue to negotiate to find a solution.TikTok has 100 million users in the United States and about 700 million worldwide.The battle is part of the Washington-Beijing confrontation, embroiled in a sour trade war, as the Trump administration has warned of China's growing economic and military might.dho/am/mtp/fox/rsr/meLoad-Date: December 9, 2020End of Document

Asian Shares Edge Higher After Trump Signs Coronavirus Relief PackageRTT News (United States)December 28, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 RTT News All Rights ReservedLength: 564 wordsByline: editorial@rttnews.com,  (RTT Staff Writer)Body       Asian stocks closed mostly higher with modest gains on Monday in subdued post-Christmas trading after U.S. President Donald Trump signed a $2.3 trillion coronavirus relief and government spending package into law on Sunday, just days after he threatened not to sign the package and called it a "disgrace".  Trump's approval of the legislation extended the unemployment benefits being paid to about 14 million people into March and also averted a federal government shutdown.  Chinese shares closed little changed, while Hong Kong shares declined after Beijing stepped up its regulation of China's technology sector.  China's central bank reportedly ordered Ant Group, an Alibaba affiliate, to rectify its operations and comply with regulatory requirements. Meanwhile, Alibaba Group said it has increased its share repurchase program to $10 billion from $6 billion. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index added 0.72 points to 3,397.29, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dipped 58.08 points or 0.2 percent to 26,328.48. In Hong Kong, shares of Alibaba fell 8.9 percent, while Meituan lost 7.8 percent and Tencent dropped 7.1 percent. Japanese shares closed higher following news that Trump signed the U.S. coronavirus relief bill. Nevertheless, investors turned cautious after data showed that Japan's industrial output stalled in November and the country confirmed its first case of the new COVID-19 strain in a Tokyo resident who recently returned from Britain. The Nikkei 225 Index rose 197.42 points or 0.7 percent to 26,854.03, while the broader Topix closed 9.63 points or 0.5 percent higher at 1,788.04. Market heavyweight SoftBank Group added 0.2 percent and Fast Retailing rose 0.7 percent. Toyota advanced more than 1 percent after the automaker said its global production increased 7 percent in November from a year earlier.  Among the major gainers, Kawasaki Heavy Industries rose more than 5 percent, while Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Hino Motors gained almost 5 percent each. The Nikkei reported that Mitsubishi Heavy is constructing the world's largest steel plant that is capable of attaining net-zero carbon dioxide emissions, at a complex of Austrian steelmaker Voestalpine. Conversely, Sharp Corp. fell more than 3 percent, while JTEKT Corp., Dena Co. and J Front Retailing all lost almost 3 percent each. In economic news, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said that industrial output in Japan was flat on a seasonally adjusted basis in November. That missed expectations for an increase of 1.2 percent following the 4.0 percent gain in October. Seoul stocks closed at a record high following news that Trump has signed the coronavirus relief and government funding bill. However, the market pared early gains amid worries about the new, highly transmissible coronavirus strain that was confirmed in three arrivals into the country from Britain.  The benchmark Kospi added 1.74 points to finish at 2,808.60, after rising to an all-time record high of 2,834.59 in early morning trades. Market bellwether Samsung Electronics added 1.2 percent, while chipmaker SK Hynix lost 2.1 percent. Automaker Hyundai Motor rose 1.3 percent and steelmaker POSCO advanced 0.9 percent. The Australian and New Zealand markets were closed on Monday in observance of Boxing Day. The U.S. and European markets were closed on Friday for the Christmas Day holidays.        Load-Date: December 29, 2020End of Document

TIBETAN MONK HELD FOR MORE THAN A YEAR WITHOUT WORD TO HIS FAMILYStates News ServiceDecember 2, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 407 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:By Richard FinneyA Tibetan monk detained by Chinese police in August 2019 on suspicion of working to split the country has been held incommunicado ever since, with family members unsure where he is being held, a Tibetan advocacy group said this week.Rinchen Tsultrim, 29, was taken into custody in Sichuan's Ngaba (in Chinese, Aba) county for peacefully expressing his thoughts on a range of Tibetan political, social and culture issues on social media, the Washington-based International Campaign for Tibet (ICT) said on Dec. 2.An inquiry notice' issued by the Ngaba County National Security Bureau summoning a Tibetan for police inquiry at the Barma (in Chinese, Waerma) Township police station stated that Rinchen was suspected of separatism, ICT said.Separatism is an accusation often leveled by Chinese authorities against Tibetans opposing the assimilation of Tibet's distinctive national and cultural identity into China's dominant Han culture, and scores of monks, writers, educators, and musical performers have been arrested under the charge in recent years.A monk of Tibet's Bon religion, Tsultrim was born in Ngaba's Kashul village, ICT said, adding that his writings on the social media platform WeChat and his personal website Skepticism on Tibet had already drawn the attention of police for several years before his arrest.Tsultrim's incommunicado status now leaves him at particular risk of torture, ICT said, calling for his whereabouts to be revealed and for his immediate release.Chinese authorities in Tibet continue to tighten controls over information flows in the region, arresting Tibetans for sharing news and opinions on social media and for contacting relatives living in exile, sometimes with news of anti-China protests, according to rights groups and other experts.Particular targets of censors and police are images of exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama shared on mobile phone and calls for the preservation of the Tibetan language, now under threat from government orders to establish Chinese as the main language of instruction in Tibetan schools.A formerly independent nation, Tibet was taken over and incorporated into China by force nearly 70 years ago, following which the Dalai Lama and thousands of his followers fled into exile in India, and Beijing maintains a tight grip on Tibet and on Tibetan-populated regions of western Chinese provinces.Load-Date: December 3, 2020End of Document

Major arms companies increased their sales by 8.5%CE Noticias Financieras EnglishDecember 7, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 300 wordsBodyCopenhagen, 7 Dec (EFE).- The top 25 arms companies increased their sales by 8.5% in 2019, compared to the previous year, to $361 billion (EUR 301 billion), according to a report released on Monday by the Stockholm International Institute for Peace Studies (SIPRI).The study finds the dominance of U.S. firms, with twelve placed among the top 25 companies, which accounted for 61% of total sales from large manufacturers.Americans are also the five largest companies: Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and General Dynamics.China ranks four companies in the top 25, with a total sales hike of 4.8%, three of them in the top ten: AVIC, sixth; CETC, octave; and NORINCO, ninth."Chinese arms companies are benefiting from the People's Liberation Army's military modernization programs," the report says.DESCENT OF RUSSIAN COMPANIESNational competition and reduced government military spending nevertheless caused the only two Russian firms between the top twenty-five, Almaz-Antey and United Shipbuilding, to suffer a drop in sales to 3.9% of the total."Russian and Chinese arms companies have a limited international presence. Sanctions against Russian firms and limits on Chinese companies set by governments appear to have played a role in restricting their expansion," the report notes.The top 25 includes for the first time a Middle Eastern-based firm, EDGE (22), from the United Arab Emirates, created in 2019 from the merger of twenty companies, reflecting how growing domestic demand and the desire for less reliance on foreign supply are driving arms sales in the region.The study also highlights that the world's 15 largest arms companies are present in 49 countries (17 developing countries) through parent-controlled subsidiaries, risk-sharing companies and research facilities.Load-Date: December 8, 2020End of Document

The week in GRC: Execs get used to remote due diligence, and GM changes tack on emissions suitCorporatesecretary.comNovember 25, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 IR Media Group, LTD All Rights ReservedSection: COMPLIANCELength: 900 wordsByline: Ben MaidenBody- The Wall Street Journalreported that index compilers FTSE Russell and MSCI are reconsidering their approach to securities from companies the US government says help the Chinese military.President Donald Trump on November 12 signed an executive order barring Americans from investing in 31 Chinese companies that the US says supply and otherwise support China's military, intelligence and security services.MSCI said it was consulting investors on the impact of the ban, including whether it needed to change existing stock indexes or introduce new ones. FTSE Russell said its policy was to exclude securities covered by US, UK or European Union sanctions. The index provider said it was 'seeking rapid feedback from clients and other stakeholders on the scope of the sanctions and the timing of the deletion of the affected securities from FTSE Russell indexes.'- CNN noted that the European Central Bank (ECB) recently said it will start conducting 'in-depth' assessments of how bank balance sheets account for climate risks in 2022. For example, banks will be expected to disclose how flooding and storms could affect the value of their real estate portfolios and customer supply chains, as well as take into account losses that could arise if businesses adjust their operations to be less carbon-intensive.'Ensuring banks' balance sheets also reflect climate-related and environmental risks is a prerequisite not only for the resilience of the banking sector, but also for the accurate pricing of these risks,' the ECB's supervisory arm said in a statement, adding that it will begin discussions with lenders on the new approach early next year.- The WSJnoted that finance executives feared due diligence - particularly reviewing a target company's books and assets - and negotiations wouldn't be doable in a remote world due to the pandemic, but that global companies have overcome those concerns to strike deals worth more than $1 trillion in the third quarter of this year, according to Dealogic. Transactions involving US companies have also soared to $531.27 billion in the third quarter, up from $140.48 billion in the second quarter and $345.69 billion in the third quarter of 2019, according to the data provider.Executives say they are getting used to signing deals with people they have never met or barely know. Talks and discussions are taking place via Webex, Microsoft Teams and other remote tools, and factory visits are conducted through video calls.- General Motors (GM) said it was reversing course and will no longer back the Trump administration's effort to prevent California from setting its own emissions rules in a continuing court fight, Reuters reported. CEO Mary Barra said in a letter to environmental groups that GM was 'immediately withdrawing from the pre-emption litigation and inviting other automakers to join us.'The change came as GM sought to work with president-elect Joe Biden, who has made boosting electric vehicles a top priority. The Detroit automaker has laid out a major strategy to increase electric vehicle sales. Barra said she believes 'the ambitious electrification goals of the president-elect, California and [GM] are aligned to address climate change by drastically reducing automobile emissions.'The White House and US Department of Justice declined to comment. An Environmental Protection Agency spokesperson said: 'It's always interesting to see the changing positions of US corporations.'- CNBC reported that Dick's Sporting Goods' president, Lauren Hobart, will succeed Ed Stack as CEO on February 1. Stack will transition to executive chair and remain chief merchant. He took over the business from his father, Dick Stack, in 1984 and took the company public in 2002.'This is the perfect time for this transition,' the outgoing CEO said in a statement. 'We have the best management team in the company's history, and the investments we have made in our people, our stores and our communities are paying off.'- According to Reuters, Swedish real estate company SBB launched a 30 billion Norwegian krone ($3.34 billion) takeover bid for Norway's Entra but was met with a swift rejection. 'While the board appreciates the interest... the potential offer will not be recommended,' Entra said of SBB's bid.'Prior to today's offer from SBB, [Entra] has received a separate non-binding proposal from another party that may or may not lead to an offer,' the Oslo-listed company said. SBB said its proposed takeover would create the largest listed real estate company in northern Europe and give increased stock market liquidity and access to capital.- Reuters reported that the SEC proposed a pilot program under which tech companies such as Uber and Lyft could pay gig workers up to 15 percent of their annual compensation in equity rather than cash, a move it said was designed to reflect changes in the workforce. The SEC said internet-based companies may have the same incentives to offer equity compensation to gig workers as they do to employees. Until now SEC rules have not allowed companies to pay gig workers in equity.Democratic SEC members Allison Herren Lee and Caroline Crenshaw opposed the proposal, saying alternative work arrangements, including independent contractors and freelancers, have existed for decades across a range of industries and it was not clear why tech companies should be given special treatment.Link to ImageLoad-Date: November 25, 2020End of Document

Trump's baseless claims of election fraud undermine US credibility overseasCNN WireNovember 5, 2020 Thursday 5:16 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 798 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN) BodyHONG KONG (CNN) --  In the early hours of Wednesday morning, the United States Embassy to Ivory Coast issued a statement calling on leaders in the West African nation to "show commitment to the democratic process and the rule of law."It was the kind of boilerplate proclamation that US diplomats issue all the time regarding elections around the world, particularly those parts of it where democracy is not completely secure. But it was undermined somewhat by comments from the US President just hours earlier. In a news conference a few hours after midnight at the White House, Donald Trump had railed against his rival, Joe Biden, saying that "all voting must stop" and baselessly accusing the Democrats of fraud. He continued to hit these points on Twitter, leading the social media platform to label several of his posts as "disputed" or "misleading." Chaotic debates and a ugly campaign had already marred the standing of the US democratic system overseas this year, but the sight of the American leader openly seeking to delegitimize the vote was still a shock for many. Trump's comments were greeted with horror in many countries, and some glee in others, where critics of the US have long accused Washington of hypocrisy regarding democratic rights. Speaking Wednesday, German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said the US faced a "very explosive situation" and a possible crisis, telling public broadcaster ZDF that "this election has not been decided ... votes are still being counted (but) the battle over the legitimacy of the result, however it turns out, has begun."In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Boris Johnson refused to comment on the election, though former foreign minister and Conservative Party lawmaker Jeremy Hunt told the BBC a "huge argument about process" would "put a smile on the face of people like President Putin and President Xi who will look at their own people and say, 'Are you not pleased we have not got any of this mess?' and that would be an absolute disaster." "We must remember that the reputation of democracy across the world is at stake here," Hunt added. For years, the US has held itself up as an arbiter of sorts for the democratic process around the world, sending monitors to polls, propping up democratic opposition and criticizing countries for rigging or undermining elections. Just this week, the US State Department condemned China's ongoing crackdown on democratic freedoms in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong. In Belarus -- a close ally of Moscow -- the US no longer recognizes Alexander Lukashenko as the "legitimately elected leader," after hotly contested elections in the former Soviet state. This sense of moral authority is now likely to be called into question in some parts of the world. After Tuesday's vote, Russian state-run broadcaster RT described the US as "battered and divided," while a number of its columnists highlighted the potential chaos that could be unleashed by Trump's comments, with one writing that "the affair paints a grim picture for American democracy."In China, alleged flaws in American democracy have long been used to prop up Beijing's own authoritarian model, and the confusion and concern over Tuesday's voting is no different. While Chinese diplomats and official government mouthpieces have stayed largely quiet on the results and ongoing contest, state-backed media was quick to highlight the discrepancy between Washington's long-held position as the standard-bearer of international democracy and Trump's own comments. The Global Times, a nationalist state-owned tabloid, published a piece Wednesday noting that "deep-seated divisions in US contradict democratic values." "Democracy is exercised in a civilized and graceful manner. The one who loses in elections is supposed to stay cool, accept the result, and call for bridging differences to move the country forward. But it seems that this does not exist in the US nowadays," writer Wang Wenwen added. Meanwhile, the Beijing News, a Communist Party-controlled paper, said that "no matter who wins the 2020 election, American society will not be able to return to the state it used to be in," having been "torn apart" by the recent contest and Trump's time in office.President Ronald Reagan once spoke of the US being a "beacon" for those who sought freedom and democratic rights, and while that claim has long faced criticism -- especially given Reagan's own support for dictators during his time in office -- it has remained a powerful and uplifting message to many. This year's election, however, may yet cause lasting damage to that message, and with it Washington's credibility when telling others how democracy should function. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.
