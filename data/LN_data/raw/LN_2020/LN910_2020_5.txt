Oracle Surges As TikTok Rejects Microsoft Ahead of U.S. Sale DeadlineTheStreet.comSeptember 14, 2020 Monday 6:41 AM EDTCopyright 2020 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 488 wordsByline: Martin BaccardaxHighlight: Cloud and software specialists Oracle could be in the driver's seat to acquire the valuable U.S. assets of China's video-sharing sensation, TikTok, but any deal needs approval in both Washington and Beijing by the beginning of next week.BodyOracle Corp.  shares surged in pre-market trading Monday after the software group appeared to emerge as the preferred buyer of TikTok's U.S. assets.However, multiple media reports suggest the deal, which still needs the approval of both the U.S. and Chinese governments, will be structured as a partnership rather than an outright sale, a move that might complicate efforts to meet a September 20 deadline put forward by President Donald Trump last month.ByteDance, TikTok's China-based parent, rejected a competing offer from Microsoft Corp. . earlier Sunday, paving the way for an Oracle-led consortium to pick up the U.S. assets, both Bloomberg and Reuters have reported. Walmart  and Microsoft were considered front-runners for the TikTok franchise, after the world's largest retailer joined the tech giant's pursuit in late August, just days after software group Oracle indicated it was also interested in the valuable American operations.  However, both President Trump, who ordered the sale of TikTok's U.S. business last month under the guise of national security concerns, and the Chinese government need to approve the sale by September 20. If that deadline passes, Trump told reporters over the weekend, TikTok will cease to operate in its second-largest market."ByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikTok's US operations to Microsoft. We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok's users, while protecting national security interests, Microsoft said in a statement Sunday. "To do this, we would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combatting disinformation, and we made these principles clear in our August statement." Oracle shares were marked 7% higher in pre-market trading Monday to indicate an opening bell price of $61.00 each, a move that would extend the stock's year-to-date gain to around 15.2%. Microsoft shares, meanwhile, were seen 0.2% lower at $203.60 while Walmart drifted 0.5% lower to $136.02 each."Walmart continues to have an interest in a TikTok investment and continues discussions with ByteDance leadership and other interested parties," the company said in a late Sunday statement. "We know that any approved deal must satisfy all regulatory and national security concerns." President Trump issued a pair of Executive Orders in early August that barred "U.S. transactions" with China-based social media apps WeChat and TikTok, citing "significant risks" to personal data and digital security.Trump has said the app , which has been downloaded over 175 million times in the United States alone and has 1 billion global users, will be banned in the U.S. if it's not sold by September 20.TikTok's fate was also a factor in the surprise resignation of U.S. CEO Kevin Mayer, a former Disney DIS executive, who left the group earlier this week after only three months at the helm.Load-Date: September 14, 2020End of Document

US holds its second high-profile visit to Taiwan in two months as Beijing escalates military pressureCNN.comSeptember 16, 2020 Wednesday 1:17 AM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 915 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott, CNNDateline: Hong Kong BodyA high-profile United States official is visiting Taiwan for the second time in two months, the latest sign of warming ties between Washington and Taipei, as Beijing escalates pressure on the self-governed island through a series of military drills and aircraft incursions.Keith Krach, the Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment, arrived in Taiwan late Thursday local time, and will represent the US at the memorial service for former Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui on Saturday.Krach's visit comes just over a month after US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar visited Taiwan in mid-August, ostensibly to discuss coronavirus prevention measures but also in a highly symbolic show of support by the Trump administration for Taipei. Azar was the highest-level US official to visit the island in decades.The US has maintained close ties with Taiwan since the island split from mainland China in 1949 after the end of a bloody civil war. But since Washington and Beijing established formal diplomatic ties in 1979, the US had largely refrained from sending high-level officials to Taipei so as to not antagonize the Chinese government, which continues to view the self-governing democracy of around 24 million people as an inseparable part of its territory.China's leader, President Xi Jinping, has been clear in his ambitions to "reunify" the island with the mainland, and has refused to rule out the use of force, even though the ruling Chinese Communist Party has never exerted direct control over Taiwan.Krach's intention to pay tribute to former Taiwan President Lee, who died on July 30 at age of 97, is highly likely to anger Beijing, experts said.Yinan He, an associate professor at the Department of International Relations at Lehigh University, said that Lee had been the first Taiwan leader to float the idea of the island being a separate distinct entity from mainland China."That makes him No. 1 or No. 2 most-hated person on Beijing's list for Taiwan. So by paying tribute to this person the Trump administration is really poking Beijing in the eye," she said.The US State Department announced Thursday that Krach was on his way to Taiwan for the memorial service, but didn't give any further information on his schedule or his plans while in Taipei. "As Taiwan's first democratically elected president, Lee ushered in a new era of democracy, economic prosperity, openness, and rule of law," State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said on her official Twitter account.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin said Thursday that the US and Taiwan must "immediately stop" official exchanges. "China firmly opposes any form of official exchanges between the United States and Taiwan. This position is consistent and clear," added Wang.An editorial in China's state-run tabloid Global Times, titled "Krach's visit to bring misfortune to Taiwan," showed a cartoon of Uncle Sam, wearing a blindfold, leading Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen into a hole. "An increasing number of people are worried that the Taiwan Straits will be the most likely powder keg in the China-US competition," the editorial said.Military tensions riseKrach's visit comes as Beijing has been ramping up military pressure on Taiwan, holding drills in waters close to the island and flying fighter jets into airspace claimed by Taipei.On Friday, China's Ministry of Defense announced new military exercises in the Taiwan Strait, which spokesman Ren Guoqiang called "a legitimate and necessary action" in response to warming US-Taiwan relations."Whether [the purpose of the liaison] is to use Taiwan to control China, or for Taiwan to rise based on foreign power, it is doomed to be a dead end. Those who play with fire will burn themselves," Ren said at a press conference.It is just the latest in a series of Chinese military exercises which have been held around Taiwan in the past few weeks. On Wednesday, less than 24 hours before Krach left for Taiwan, two Y-8 Anti-Submarine Aircraft flew two sorties into Taiwan's Southwest Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), according to the island's Defense Ministry.Taiwan's military ordered the two planes to leave the island's airspace before dispatching aircraft to monitor them.One week earlier, on September 10, Taiwan's Defense Ministry publicly admonished Beijing for entering its ADIZ multiple times during drills by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) within 90 nautical miles (166 kilometers) of Taiwan."These military actions have seriously roiled Taiwan and threaten peace and stability in the region," Vice Defense Minister Chang Che-ping said at a news conference. Taiwan's news agency CNA said that about 30 planes had taken part in the drills, crossing into Taiwan's ADIZ at least 21 times.Taiwan began the second part of its own annual Han Kuang military drills on Monday, after they were delayed for five months due to the coronavirus pandemic. CNA said that the computer-aided military drills will simulate a "similar" situation to the recent Chinese military aircraft incursions into the island's ADIZ.When asked about the PLA's extensive drills on Wednesday, China's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Ma Xiaoguang said that the drills were aimed at deterring interference by "external forces" and Taiwan separatists.Ma said that China was prepared to meet any interference in Taiwan's affairs or attempts at independence with "firm will, full confidence and sufficient capabilities."Load-Date: October 7, 2020End of Document

Tencent, a technological monster invisible to the WestCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 20, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 990 wordsBodyTencent has become that elephant in the room that no one sees, but that's there. It will be because of its Chinese origin or because of its low communication profile. It is quiet and, year after year, since its founding in 1998 at the hands of Ma Huateng and Zhang Zhidong, its growth around the world has been exponential. In China it is synonymous with everything that sounds like the Internet. Outside its borders, it is the dominator of video games. Control Riot Games, Supercell and Grinding Gear Games; owns 40% of Epic Games; and has a presence at Ubisoft and Blizzard. Or what's the same, League of Legends, Fortnite, Brawl Stars, Clash of Clans, PUBG and World of Warcraft speak Chinese. Now U.S. President Donald Trump has placed her in the spotlight by banning the download of his WeChat app.So far the best known, because their tentacles are getting further and further. As Guillermo de Haro, professor of systems at the IE, explains, it should come as no surprise that it goes unnoticed because it is a company very focused in his country. "With the pandemic we discover that there are unknown cities in China like Wuhan, with more than 10 million inhabitants. The same thing happens to their companies." But before we dely into its new businesses and where it directs investments, its origin as a telecommunications company explains the technological monster it is right now—ninth global organization and about 100 million euros of Facebook capitalization.It started as a messenger-like messaging service. It allowed the Chinese to communicate through the computer. Visionaries like few in Asia, they bet decisively on the mobile phone. So WeChat was born in 2011. Similar to WhatsApp or Telegram in its genesis, but so different with the future of the years. That was the first stone from which he used to build a digital empire. In the words of a source near Tencent, it was the hook needed to develop a series of services that accompanies the entire population daily. "You have created a layer that is above the Internet. Here lies its competitive advantage," this source argues.It refers to the that in WeChat we can order a taxi, request food at home, make the purchase, send money, make transfers or pay in an establishment. Tencent has forged from the app an environment that tops any need. When you can't organically integrate the service, you believe it, as has happened with WeBank—"it manages more capital than all the cash that Chinese society has in its possession," this same source states," the Tencent Music streaming music platform, or tencent Pictures.And now comes the leap to its neighbors and the West. His idea is similar to the strategy conceived by Amazon in its beginnings, which in its logo draws an arrow that goes from A to Z as a metaphor for its willingness to compete with whoever was necessary, with anyone who was among all these letters. To look like Jeff Bezos's, part of their efforts have been focused on the cloud for four years. Investing in this technology is the indispensable step forward in modernizing the business environment, improving data science and investing in artificial intelligence. A more present than a future bet. "It's a digital dragon. A dragon capable of pulling out his tongue and then scorching and absorbing you if necessary," zanja Miguel Angel Morcuende, expert in digital transformation.The coronavirus effectThe changes imposed by the coronavirus crisis place a colossus as Tencent in a privileged position. Your products and services grow even faster. The forced digital migration that lives around the globe strengthens your business. An opportune time to launchdecidedly for Europe and from there make the leap to Latin America. "He's going to continue to expand his influence. Whatever it has to do with connectivity, with the ability to generate businesses away from analogue, is going to succeed. Tencent can lead much of the future to come," Morcuende argues.Its large economic capacity explains some of the shadow-forged might—it owns 5% of Tesla and 10% of Universal Music. Yuanes touring the whole planet. He has created a global investment arm capable of competing with big names such as Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft. Thanks to its president's goldman Sachs past, the financial world lacks secrets. "They invest in investment funds and through them locate future flagship Internet businesses. They also invest directly in companies. They buy the ones they're interested in, not only in China, but globally," says the source near Tencent.Cybersecurity is another of the services it has turned into a spearhead. He has created even his own cyberattack response center. The management of the organization understands that it is a central issue to link its future to. One more element to add to the already extensive payroll of services it offers away from WeChat. "Large Chinese companies have long emerged from their markets, just as large Spanish companies did years ago towards the Latin American market for example. They have financial muscle to venture out and look for growth in other areas," suggests De Haro.A shadow of doubt that Tencent has never clarified is the role played by the Chinese government. It is difficult to determine whether so much vigour is due to direct public investment, a gold stock or some other type of aid. The rules of the game are different there. As this source near the company indicates, it doesn't matter because it's a country where the Executive closes your business at any time if you want to. You don't have to control anything to interfere with your decisions. "What you have to keep in mind for the future is that Tencent is very proactive investing in startups. I hallucinating when I met his investment volume. They're as or more innovative than a giant like Google," he concludes.You can follow THE COUNTRY RETINA TECHNOLOGY on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or subscribe here to our Newsletter.Load-Date: September 21, 2020End of Document

Trump administration questions Epic Games and Riot about Tencent relationshipStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 20, 2020 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 475 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyWeChat will also face technical restrictions, which will make in-app activity, like fund transfers and payments, more hard. However, the CFIUS survey could reveal more scrutiny for companies with Tencent links.Quoting cybersecurity issues, the USA government went after the popular social network video-sharing app TikTok owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that seems to be an escalation of the trade, culture, and geopolitical cold war ensues between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America. Among them are Riot Games and Epic Games.The same government body that investigated TikTok and WeChat is now looking into Epic Games and Riot Games, according to a new Bloomberg report.Tencent owns Los Angeles-based Riot Games (League of Legends maker) and has a 40% stake in Fortnite studio Epic Games. And the announcement earlier today from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross uses language that could be applied to Tencent's gaming holdings just as easily as TikTok's social media service. Epic is most well-known for "Fortnite", but also operates other popular games, including "Rocket League".For this, it is stated that information about security situations is requested from Epic Games and Riot Games, one of the leading game companies.Tencent's production company and distributor, Tencent Pictures, is involved with major Hollywood productions like Wonder Woman, Venom, and the upcoming Top Gun: Maverick. Total smartphone games revenues for the quarter were 35,988,000 renminbi, or $5.3 million, while PC client games revenues were 10,912,000 renminbi, or $1.6 million. It made a $330 million investment for a 40% stake in Epic Games in 2012.After diplomatic relations have gone sour between the Trump administration and the Chinese government, the USA authorities have toughened up against all Chinese linked companies.Envelope of deadly poison addressed to White House interceptedRepresentatives of the White House and the Secret Service did not immediately return CNBC's request for comment. Ricin is a highly toxic compound extracted from castor beans that has been used in terror plots.Any movement by the Trump Administration to further restrict the economic activity of foreign companies operating in the USA could have unintended consequences for the nation's technology industry, as well.The crackdown on game developers tied to the Chinese firm comes amid another battle brewing against Tencent over its WeChat app.Extending the same argument to gaming may open another front in the ongoing trade war that's been waged between the USA and China for the duration of the Trump presidency.ByteDance has also been targeted by the White House as they are related to TikTok.A spokesperson for Epic Games declined to comment.Tencent's American depositary receipts fell 2.4% to $66.66 at the end of Thursday's trading session.Load-Date: September 21, 2020End of Document

US to ban use of TikTok and WeChat for national securityCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 18, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 391 wordsBodyWASHINGTON (AP) — The United States will restrict the use of Chinese TikTok and WeChat applications from Sunday, with a total ban on the latter, citing national security and data privacy concerns.A total ban on the use of TikTok would be implemented on November 12, but Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Friday morning on the Fox Business Network program that access to that app could be possible if certain safeguards are in effect by then."Under the president's instruction, we have taken significant steps to combat the malicious collection of personal data of U.S. citizens, while promoting our national values, democratic norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations," Ross said in a prepared statement.The government order also raises questions about the recent agreement of California-based technology giant Oracle to take control of TikTok's U.S. operations, a requirement the Trump administration set for the application to continue operating in the country.The details of the agreement between Oracle and TikTok were vague at best. Oracle was one of several bidders, including Microsoft and Walmart, to purchase TikTok's U.S. operations.Oracle, in its confirmation that it was the winning bidder on Monday, did not refer to the agreement as a sale or acquisition and instead said it was chosen as TikTok's "reliable technology provider".At the moment it is not clear which assets, if any, would actually acquire Oracle.Some security experts have raised concerns that ByteDance Ltd., the Chinese company that owns TikTok, would maintain access to the information of 100 million users of the application in the United States, creating a potential national security hazard.Like most social networks, TikTok collects user data and moderates their posts. Collect your location and messages, as well as track what they see, to decipher the best way to target ads for them.Similar concerns have emerged around U.S.-based social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, but Chinese ownership adds an extra drawback, because the Chinese government could order companies to help it gather intelligence.TikTok said it does not store U.S. user data in China and would not hand over personal data to governments, but experts point out that Chinese authorities can obtain any information they want from companies in the Asian country.Load-Date: September 19, 2020End of Document

Just look at the data.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: President Trump hosted thousands of supporters in the battleground state of Wisconsin last night. Meanwhile, it was clear, he was watching Biden's town hall on Air Force One.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Biden wants to surrender our country to the violent left-wing mob.

The Dow is snapping a 4-day winning streak. The S&P and NASDAQ in the red for a second straight day.Joining me right now is CFRA Chief Investment Strategist, Sam Stovall; also joining the conversation all morning this morning is Fox Business' Dagen McDowell; also The Wall Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman; Republican strategist and Pinion Enterprises founder and CEO, Joseph Pinion.Great to see everybody this morning. Thank you so much for being here.And Sam, let me kick it off with you. Let's talk about the earnings picture. What you're expecting for the second half of the year, Sam?SAM STOVALL, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Well, the second half of the year we're expecting to see red ink still, but it's going to be less than we saw in the second quarter that is likely to be the nadir of this earnings recession. Right now all 11 sectors are expected to post year-on- year declines, but the S&P should be down by about 26 percent in operating results as compared with more than 30 percent shortfall in the prior quarter.BARTIROMO: All right. So in terms of growth, are you saying you're expecting a snapback in growth in the third quarter, or you're saying we will still see a negative - a contraction for this third quarter?STOVALL: Well, every quarter in 2020 is expected to show a year-on-year decline in excess of 10 percent. For the full year, expectations are from more than 20 percent year-on-year decline. But it's in 2021 when we actually are looking across the valley and looking for about a 26 percent year-on-year increase for the S&P 500, along with about a 45 percent gain with developed international stocks and about a 35 percent gain for emerging markets. So next year is the year that we are going to see an improvement in earnings, whereas this year it's just a lessoning of the year-on-year declines.BARTIROMO: Sure, sure. I guess, as states open up, things get better and better, but you're still talking about a pretty sharp contraction that we saw on the second quarter.James Freeman, jump in here.JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, thanks. Sam, I'm wondering how you look at the potential for it, another stimulus. As a taxpayer, I'm hoping there won't be one, but it does seem like a fair amount of investors are waiting for that to, I guess, believe shoveling money to a lot of state governments will drive stock prices higher. Can you tell us how that works?STOVALL: Sure. Well, basically investors are saying, we need to see an improvement in the overall economy, we need to have the Fed continued to be supportive and it wouldn't hurt if the government actually did its part as well. So we are looking for both monetary and fiscal support.I really question whether there's going to be a meaningful deal that is introduced between now and election day, because neither side wants to give the other an upper hand in terms of showing something to brag about. So yes, we will probably end up with a deal after the election, but leading up to it, I think it will remain very much a headline event.BARTIROMO: And does that impact growth, Sam? How important is a stimulus package in your view to seeing better growth numbers on the economy?STOVALL: I think it's more of a sentiment indicator or something that will improve the confidence of the general public, but I think the real benefit will come from the reopening of the states as well as the speed with which we do end up with a virus vaccine. I happen to believe--BARTIROMO: Sure.STOVALL: --that we are likely to see that vaccine in 2021, leaning a little bit more toward the scientists indicating as to when, it's likely to be introduced and distributed on a broad basis.BARTIROMO: Joseph Pinion, jump in here.JOSEPH PINION, FOUNDER AND CEO, PINION ENTERPRISES: Absolutely. Sam, Joe Pinion here. I think a lot of people, I think, are concerned about the fact that maybe in times of war, austerity is not necessarily conservatism. Certainly we are not dealing with something like world war II, but I think we might be talking about what might be kind of a 21st century kind of warfare.I'll talk a little bit about that balancing act between trying to have an infusion for Main Street and at the same time wanting to have the ability to have a leverage or a tool to infuse capital later on, if so needed. And then also, kind of, just opposing that with the obviously the rise in sovereign debt, not just here in America, but around the globe, and how all of those things might be interconnected.STOVALL: Well, good morning, Joe. Good question. Because when you think about what is going on today, the government, the Fed are doing the exact opposite as they should than when they did back to when they were trying to fight the great depression. Back in the early 1930s, the government was actually attempting to balance its budget, not go into the largest deficit that we have seen since world war II.At the same time, the Fed was looking to raise interest rates not bring rates to zero, not engage in additional quantitative easing to blow up its overall balance sheets. So I think from an fiscal and a monetary perspective, the Fed and the government is doing what it should be doing.This is something that is unprecedented at least in those memories of the people who are alive today. So I believe that, it's something that we will have to continue to work with. And when it comes to deficits, well, the market doesn't seem to be focusing on that right now. I like to say that equity investors are like nighttime drivers who only use their low beams, and right now we are only looking out about 6 to 12 months. The deficit problem is something that will be down the road a few years.BARTIROMO: Yes, I guess when you look at rock-bottom interest rates that plays into it as well, the worry is not now while you've got rock-bottom rates.Sam, it's good to see you this morning. Thank you so much. Great to get your insight this morning. Sam Stovall joining us there from CFRA.We're just getting started this morning.Coming up 2020 in focus, former senior adviser to the Clintons, Mark Penn, is here on the race with both President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden headed to Minnesota later today.And then at 7:00 a.m. this morning, the word of Wall Street, what investors are watching this morning and how you should be allocating your money.Plus Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, is here with breaking news on the TikTok deal. You don't want to miss that at 7:30.And then at 8:00 a.m., don't miss our power panel hour. Join me and Dagen, along with The Five co-host Juan Williams, and The Hill media reporter, Joe Concha, with the hottest topics making headlines.You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Election Day is now 46 days away. President Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden hitting the campaign trail again last night. The president at a rally in Wisconsin, while Biden appeared in his first prime time town hall since accepting the nomination. Both candidates talking about jobs, the economy, and of course the coronavirus.Take a watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We have 3 vaccines, right now they are in the final stage, clinical trials. We worked it for the FDA where they approved it fast, they were very fast, very quick at levels that nobody else could have ever achieved.Biden: I would like to see the governors enforce mask-wearing, period. I can do that on federal property. As president, I will do that. And we could have a fine for them not doing it. Look, this is about saving people's lives.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Biden and Trump both heading to Minnesota later today.Joining me right now is the Stagwell Group President and Managing Partner, Mark Penn. Mark, it's great to have you this morning. What is your reaction to all of this? What did you think of last night's prime time showdown?MARK PENN, CEO, MDC PARTNERS: Well, I don't think it was much of a showdown yet. I can wait till they are in the same ring or on the same stage together. I think the town hall was rather mild and I think when it comes to rallies, the president likes to go on a bit.BARTIROMO: I mean, were those questions for Joe Biden prepared? I mean, they just seemed mild to say the least.PENN: Yes, they are mild. I'm not sure if he was asked hard questions, it would make much of a difference. In these friendly settings, it will be really interesting to see what happens when Chris Wallace can come out, and you know Wallace is quite a question asker compared to Anderson Cooper.But look, I think people haven't seen much of Joe Biden and any time he can kind of get out there and state what he thinks. He probably does himself some good and I think the president is needed to get out on the rally trail, because that's really where he accelerates as kind of a stump speaker. So they probably were in their best environments last night, but I don't think it was big night for the campaign one way or the other.BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Mark, look at the backdrop. I mean, you have got the Democrats pushing not to open the economy, wanting to keep this going, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also doubling down on her call for $2.2 trillion stimulus package. She says, "It's hard to see how we can go any lower". How is this stalemate impacting the American people and what do you see in terms of the backdrop here everything laced with politics down to the unrest in our country?PENN: Well, I think, right now what happens with the facts here matter a lot more than anything said, is the virus going down or not. Numbers so far in the last few weeks have been down, is that's helpful to the president, is the economy going up or down? So far the economy has been improving. Those two background facts, very helpful to the president. I think that in terms of the stimulus, the problem solvers here really have come in and shaken everybody up by saying, "hey, let's compromise in the middle".Finally, a group has come forward and said, "Let's be about the people rather than politics", and I think that's a--BARTIROMO: Yes.PENN: --real stunning development here with less than 50 days to go on the election.BARTIROMO: I want to talk about your op-ed. You determined 7 keys to victory in the presidential race and an op-ed for The Hill earlier this week.Mark, go through those, what is influencing this year's election from your standpoint?PENN: Well, I do think likability and character, I think that's where Biden has an edge, that's what his entire convention was about. And the president has pretty low numbers when it comes to that. I think the economy, clearly that's the president's strong suit, even if he's behind in the polls, 6 or 7, he's ahead 6 or 7 on the economy. It's his strong suit. I think the virus, the president was ahead, but he receded back somewhat from that.I think that people see Joe Biden right now as better able, surprisingly, to handle civil unrest of the violence and social justice, but those numbers particularly on the violence are closing pretty quickly. And I do think there's some key demographic differences here that we are seeing, fundamentally here the working class is staying with Donald Trump, the suburbs so far have been sticking with Democrats after they moved in the midterms.But two interesting things happening here, seniors going somewhat over to Biden and Latinos going over to Trump. So you have all of these unexpected reliances, and I think you have to look at all of these factors to really figure out who is going to win, what's going on. This election is not over yet. Is it going to be about the virus, which also has been the most important issue, or is it going to be about the economy?BARTIROMO: And is it going to be decided on election night? I mean, you saw what happened just in Pennsylvania, they want to accept ballots 3 days after the election, Mark.PENN: I am worried about this. I don't understand how anyone cannot see that doing all these mail-in ballots is - when we are not really prepared, we don't have the kind of system set-up, when it's safe to come in person, this is going to be election night chaos. We all know that.BARTIROMO: Yes.PENN: I think the country has got to get together here.BARTIROMO: Well, we are going to talk about this coming up and the result of that Supreme Court decision.Dagen, jump in.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Mark, does it help Joe Biden at all to say last night that the president is responsible for every single person who has died from COVID-19, and then to continue both Kamala Harris and Joe Biden foment uncertainty, and basically stir up fear about a potential vaccine? This messaging of "I don't trust Donald Trump, I trust the sciences", I don't know, it just seems like a recipe for disaster.If you're telling the American people, many of whom are reticent about taking a vaccine, "You know what, if a vaccine comes out under Trump, I wouldn't take it, but if I'm the president then it's AOK and safe for you to take", that seems extremely dangerous. And I think the American people, when you spit in their face and tell them it's raining, they really know the truth.PENN: Well, I don't think exaggerated attacks work for anybody. It's one of the frustrations I see, when I see, in fact, we both can, but I think in this case, obviously Donald Trump isn't responsible for every death in the COVID vaccine and that's not going to (inaudible) and I do think there is concern here about the vaccine. Most people, by the way, don't think there's going to be a vaccine until next year. It'll be a surprise, if there is a vaccine certified. They will trust the FDA.BARTIROMO: Yes. All right, Mark. Great to get your insights. See you soon. Thank you so much. Mark Penn.We will be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A new controversy brewing over mail-in voting. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling to go extend the ballot deadline for the general electric - general election, rather, by 3 days. So if a ballot is received after Election Day, as long as it was postmarked by November 3, it will be counted.James, some Republicans are actually looking at this as a victory, because the Democrats wanted 7 days. They actually got 3 days decision by the Supreme Court. Your reaction.FREEMAN: Well, I guess 3 is better than 7, but our elections should be decided on election night. That's the clean result you want. If you don't want long periods of time that can tempt people when they see the count needed to prevail, to engage in shenanigans with the ballot counting, you want a clean decision on election night. That should be the goal.And unfortunately, you have a lot of states who have decided they want election night to extend over weeks, even months, and they want our elections to be decided by litigation on a regular basis. So I think that is poisonous for democracy.BARTIROMO: Yes. And which is why, Dagen, the A.G. Barr told me that it opens the flood gates of fraud. Look at the op-ed in The Journal this morning.Here is the title, " Whoops, we found 1,666 ballots".MCDOWELL: It's going to be a huge problem, and I will point this out. When the Democrats tell you, "Oh, we always vote by mail, this is nothing new", that is simply not true. It's a lie.This year 21 percent of all voters are going to have ballots mailed directly to them, because the direct mail balloting in places like California and Nevada, you will have 57 percent and this is according to The New York Times, "Absentee voting would be allowed for all with no excuse for 57 percent of voters".The New York Times has called this a rapid and seismic shift in how we vote in this country, and to think that these local election boards and county election offices are prepared for this deluge of mail, whenever it might show up, is just beyond - incomprehensible to think that they are prepared.And I will add--BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: The Democrats across the country more and more are messaging, "Hey, go out and vote in person". If you've been to a - I've said this all along, if you've been to supermarket or gone to the Wawa to buy some cigarettes and fill up your car wearing a mask, you can go out and vote. And you're hearing that more and more from Democrats, because if you - in the new Fox News poll, choice for president is voting today.Mail-in voters chose Joe Biden 71 percent to 26 percent, suggesting that a lot of mail-in voters supporting Biden. So what does that tell you?BARTIROMO: Yes.MCDOWELL: The Democrats ought to be worried about the mail-in voting, the snafus, they are surely on the horizon, and how these ballots are counted.BARTIROMO: Well, James, tell us about the editorial by the editorial board this morning. Oops moment in New Jersey. On Monday, the state found more than 1500 ballots from July's primary.FREEMAN: Yes, this has been - we have seen this in New York there is, well, just to emphasize the point Dagen was making about how this is not the normal process. Yes, we have long had absentee balloting, where a person, specific person makes a request to get a ballot and then it is mailed to that person, we are now seeing in a lot of states mailing of ballots unsolicited.This means since millions of people move every year, a lot of these ballots are going to be those who no longer live there, or who knows what happens to the ballot at that point. And it's really striking as you've seen problems in a number of places this year, where you all of a sudden, have a new type of voting and a new need to sort to collect mail, a best expansion of this kind of program, you are going to have problems as we are seeing already.MCDOWELL: I got an absentee ballot application in my apartment for somebody who has not lived in my building. It was in my mail box. That person hasn't lived in my building for a decade.And when I called, I didn't --BARTIROMO: Yes --MCDOWELL: My vote didn't count in 20 -- in the mid-term elections for President Obama, my vote didn't count when I called the County Board of Elections four years ago, the person who answered the phone in New York County hang up on me because he said there's nobody who is free right now to deal with you. That's how these county --BARTIROMO: Yes --MCDOWELL: Offices are managed. So I think that with this vast mailing of ballots, that this is going to work out well, well, I don't know what people are smoking.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly. We'll take a short break and come right back. Stay with us, we'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Friday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, September 18th, take a look at markets this morning at 6:33 a.m. on the East Coast. We are looking at a mixed picture at the start of trading this morning. Dow Industrials down 34 points, but the Nasdaq is up 47 and the S&P 500 just moving into positive territory, up about 2 points right now, this after a selloff yesterday. But markets were able to cut early losses almost in half by the close.We have the Dow Industrials down 130 points at 4 O'clock on Wall Street. The Nasdaq down 140 points and the S&P lower by 28. The Dow and the S&P 500 still on track to snap a two-week losing streak this week. Checking global markets this morning, European indices look like this and here too, you've got a mixed story underway, FTSE 100 down 13, the CAC Quarante down 14, but the Dax Index in Germany is up 20 points. In Asia overnight, China leading the gains with a pretty good rally in the Shanghai Composite up better than 2 percent overnight. Hundreds of thousands of people on the Gulf Coast meanwhile are still in the dark as we get new images this morning of the destruction and devastation left behind by Hurricane Sally. Jackie DeAngelis this morning with the details. Jackie, good morning to you.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning to you, Maria. Well, Sally is now being blamed for at least two deaths in Alabama and Florida. It was a powerful storm forcing oil and gas production to shut down, causing people to wait in long lines for gas in Pensacola, Florida. Nearly 400,000 people remain without power on the Gulf Coast this morning. Crews have been rescuing people from severe flooding all along the coast. In Florida, a firefighter using jet ski to save an elderly couple after they wrote "in attic, help" on their home's front door.And take a look at this new drone video showing the destruction left behind in Alabama. Some really amazing pictures there. Meantime, Mayor de Blasio sending parents scrambling again after a last-minute decision to delay in- person learning. Under the new plan, early learning and pre-K kids would go back to school on Monday as planned, but kindergarten through high school students won't return until September 29th or October 1st.The decision coming after teachers and critics voiced serious concerns over the city's safety protocols amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. And big news for Wal-Mart workers. The company announcing plans to give 165,000 hourly workers a raise. The retail giant also announcing a new team-base operating model similar to the one implemented at Sam's Club over the last year. Wal-Mart says that the move will increase cross-training opportunities for employees. So they end on some good news there.BARTIROMO: It sure is. Jackie, thank you, Jackie DeAngelis. Meanwhile, calling out New York's mayor, the partnership for New York City riding on behalf of CEOs. For more than 160 companies calling on Mayor de Blasio to take responsibility for the declining quality of life in the Big Apple. The letter writes, quote, "there's widespread anxiety over public safety, cleanliness and other quality of life issues. We need to send a strong, consistent message that our employees, customers, clients and visitors will be coming back to a safe and healthy work environment." Mayor de Blasio responded via tweet, saying this, "we are grateful for our business community, and are partnering to rebuild a fairer, better city. Let's be clear, to restore city services and save jobs, we need long-term borrowing and a federal stimulus. We need these leaders to join the fight to move this city forward."Joining me right now is the President and CEO of the Partnership for New York City, Kathryn Wylde. Kathryn, it is great to see you, it's been a while. Wow, what is happening to the city that we love so much, Kathryn? Nice letter there, happy that you've worked with the CEOs to send this letter. Have you spoken with the mayor's office about these issues?KATHRYN WYLDE, PRESIDENT & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PARTNERSHIP FOR NEW YORK CITY: Thank you, Maria. And, yes, what we discovered is, it was a lot easier to shut the city economy down than it is to reopen it. So, we're all going to have to work together. And the concern of the business community is to make sure that the city government is not standing, trying to do this alone, that they're calling on all the resources of the city, its business, its institutions as we seek to reopen the schools, and that's been a very difficult challenge, hopefully on its way to resolution.But also, we've got a huge impact of the COVID on our economy. We basically have small businesses that have been out of business for seven months that are desperate. We've got a million people unemployed, we've got huge fiscal deficits that we hope the federal government is going to help us fill at some point as a result of the losses incurred during the COVID, but mostly, we've got to rely on New Yorkers. And it's got to be everybody, it's not going to just be government.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's not going to be government because some of the decisions from government were really -- were really off. I mean, I would - - I would argue that you've just -- you know, laid out a whole host of issues from -- you know, the COVID pandemic shutdown to try -- to efforts to reopen. But I would argue, it all started with this change in bail reform and doing away with cash bail, putting criminals back on the street. I spoke with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo earlier in the year about changing the state's bail reform, and this was in March. He said he was going to have a solution to this a month later, but we haven't heard much, watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Will you propose or support that judges have the discretion to let out criminals as they see fit and change this bail reform situation which has caused crime numbers to go shooting up?GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): Bail reform for many years was based on how much money you had, Maria. That's what cash bail is. If you are rich, you'd get out of here, poor, you sit. That's an injustice, not justice. We made that change, we're going to make more changes. I understand the fear, I understand the criticism. I said that I'm working on it and I believe we're going to get something done in the budget on April 1.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: We haven't seen anything material --WYLDE: Understood --BARTIROMO: Happened here, Kathryn, go ahead.WYLDE: Well, I would -- I would disagree that bail reform is the source of the issue. We've got a whole series of issues that have happened all at once. And the COVID, the economic displacement was certainly a precipitating factor. The -- all the issues surrounding race relations and Black Lives Matters have raised a whole -- another series of difficult issues. We supported bail reform, we also supported judicial discretion as the governor did, that was -- that was not successful. I think that there's -- continues to be a conversation on that topic. But ultimately, it's up to every one of us as citizens, just as we did when we overcame the crisis, the urban crisis of the '70s and '80s when we had huge problems, among other things, huge crime problems, economic problems, homelessness problems, those problems come and go in big cities.And there's no single solution, there's no magic bullet, we have to figure out how we're going to address these in a sensible, rational way. Our worry today is that the city and the nation have become so divided and ideological, far right, far left, that we're not finding practical --BARTIROMO: Yes --WYLDE: Solutions. New Yorkers have always had a mercantile approach to solving problems, that put aside our political differences. We can't leave these up to the politicians to solve these problems, and we can't categorize --BARTIROMO: Yes --WYLDE: We can't take -- look for easy solutions.BARTIROMO: Yes, sure, James Freeman, jump in.JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, you were talking, Kathryn, about the city goes through cycles, we had that horrible period in the '70s, '80s into the early '90s until Rudy Giuliani. But some argue while James Altucher, investor, for example saying maybe New York doesn't come back, if it descends once again into chaos because now with all this internet broadband connections everywhere, people will take the opportunity not to live here. Comedian Jerry Seinfeld says, no, New York is always going to be the place people want to be, it's more exciting than Florida. But I'm wondering how many of your businesses think that Florida is low taxes and safe streets look pretty exciting right now.WYLDE: Well, I think the letter that we wrote, the first sentence that the business executive signed says we believe in the future of New York, and yes, it will change, yes, there will be adjustments, there will more -- be more flexibility and remote work, but, in fact, the city is a huge draw, it's a global trend. It's not just the U.S., it's not just New York. Cities are important places for social interaction, for culture, for universities, and we're the center of innovation and creativity. The arts is -- the city is great. It's going to continue to be great. There are all sorts of energetic nodes of activity going on across the five boroughs today to bring the city back. We have no doubt New York is on its way back. The question --BARTIROMO: Yes --WYLDE: Is how long, how much pain, how difficult is this path going to be and if we all work together, we think --BARTIROMO: Yes --WYLDE: That we can put it together quickly.BARTIROMO: Kathryn, we know that shootings are up, crime is up, people are not feeling safe. You just said a few minutes ago that you think New Yorkers have to partake in this. It's about all of us. The people need to be involved here. What are you saying, what do you want New Yorkers to do?WYLDE: Well, for example, we're looking at various sectors of the community, whether it's in human services, whether it's the universities, how do we come together and look at some of these chronic problems? We had a huge homelessness problem before the COVID. That hasn't gone away. It's gotten worse. We have had other issues, the education issues which were exacerbated by the --BARTIROMO: Yes --WYLDE: Fact that suddenly, we had to figure out how to do -- learning from home. But these are all issues that have existed, the affordability crisis, the fact that people can't afford housing --BARTIROMO: Yes, I understand, but you're saying -- but you're saying --WYLDE: And small business --BARTIROMO: It's not policymakers, it's New Yorkers. I just don't -- I just don't understand what you want regular New Yorkers to do. I understand this is all policy.WYLDE: Yes --BARTIROMO: These are policies that need to be changed. New Yorker -- an average New Yorker is not going to have any access to that. This is --WYLDE: Correct --BARTIROMO: Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo.WYLDE: And I think it's policies, not politics.BARTIROMO: Yes. Kathryn, it's great to have you --WYLDE: We've become too political --BARTIROMO: We'll be watching, of course -- we all want to see New York --WYLDE: Thanks, Maria --BARTIROMO: Rise once again. Kathryn Wylde, we'll see you soon, thank you, we'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, busy week for IPOs rolling on, just a day after snowflake's record-breaking offering. A healthcare technology firm surged in its debut. Amwell, a tele-medicine firm backed by Google seeing its shares jump 28 percent. Joining me right now is the Chairman and CEO of Amwell, Ido Schoenberg. Ido, it's great to have you this morning, thank you so much for being here, congratulations on such a successful deal --IDO SCHOENBERG, CHAIRMAN & CO-CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AMWELL: Thank you. Thank you very much, Maria, it's great to be here.BARTIROMO: Tell me about your business, Ido, because we are seeing something that was used not very often or, you know, at different times to now being something that people go to regularly. Do you believe this pandemic has actually deepened the penetration of tele-medicine throughout the country?SCHOENBERG: Yes, but there are many things in life, nothing is as good or as bad as it seems. Our goal is very different than many tele-health companies. We don't try to urge you to talk to a doctor you never met, doc in the box in the cloud, will get the service from someone who doesn't have access to your records. But rather, we believe that people should be able to connect digitally to doctors and nurses in hospitals that they trust. Sometimes they need to see those services in person, and sometimes it's perfectly fine to connect from remote.We are -- our goal is to basically connect all the key players in the healthcare ecosystem, main providers, pairs, digital, aggregators like Google and innovators like pharma companies and others, so they can work together better in order to provide this hybrid between supply and demand. Now to your question --BARTIROMO: So --SCHOENBERG: About the pandemic --BARTIROMO: Yes --SCHOENBERG: About the pandemic. A pandemic is an accelerator. Many people were locked in their homes, both doctors and patients, and had no choice to call each other, so it's not surprising to see a giant surge in visits. However, the goal is not to maximize visits, the goal is to improve outcomes that does not necessarily correlate. The good news is that some important changes were made most importantly, government is beginning to reimburse tele-health for seniors through CMS. That's unlikely to change for many good reasons. I also want to point out that many people tried tele-health for the first time and loved it. So it does create critical mass of people that will begin to use it.That does not mean that anyone should expect tomorrow morning, all of us will never go to our doctor's office and get all our services from home, that's a little naive.BARTIROMO: Sure, no, I think you make a really good point about these incentives from the government. That certainly is going to help the usage. Ido, this is a longer conversation. I hope you'll come back so we can talk about this way of seeing your doctor and really what people are seeing as a benefit. We so appreciate your time this morning, Ido, thank you. Ido Schoenberg, and congrats once again --SCHOENBERG: My pleasure, Maria --BARTIROMO: On the debut of American Well, that's Amwell.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, time for the Morning Buzz. First up, mask backlash at school. An 11-year-old Florida boy getting in trouble at his school for wearing a face mask with the Hooters Restaurants logo on it. The school made him change the mask, saying it was inappropriate. The boy's father speaking out, saying that there's nothing offensive about the mask, and that he and his family eat at Hooters regularly. Dagen, what do you think?MCDOWELL: There's always a class --BARTIROMO: This is ridiculous --MCDOWELL: There's always a class clown, and he would wind up, that child, an adult richer than anybody else in that school, number one. And number two, it's not like he was wearing a brassiere as a mask. The principal needs to get over himself.BARTIROMO: It's true, I mean, it's ridiculous. All it is, is that masks that says "hooters". I don't understand what the problem is. I mean --MCDOWELL: It says "hooters" --BARTIROMO: It's an operating company.MCDOWELL: Well it says "hooters".(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: So what?(CROSSTALK)That's a restaurant.MCDOWELL: Yes, it's also a term for -- part of the women's anatomy.BARTIROMO: OK, how about this, James? Comfort foods takes center stage during the coronavirus pandemic. A new survey finding the top foods Americans are eating while staying at home, pizza takes the top spot, followed by burgers, ice cream, fries, Mac and cheese, spaghetti. The survey also found Americans eat comfort foods five times a week on average during this pandemic. Joseph, what's been on your menu?JOSEPH PINION, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: I made -- I've just made -- probably having too many carbs like most people. Lots of pasta. Pasta is always a good thing. But you know, just lucky to have some food here in this post- COVID world. So, I think again, it's just important for us to make sure that we stay happy and stay humble.BARTIROMO: All right, we'll take a break, when we come back, a lot more coming up, we've got Wilbur Ross coming up live, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, stay with us, we're live on Fox Business.Load-Date: September 18, 2020End of Document

New technologies: TikTok, competition,CE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 13, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 2816 wordsBodyFor a couple of years you've been raising in your articles that behind what appears as a U.S.-China trade war rather there's a fight over both military-technological and political hegemony, well now there's the discussion about Trump's threat to the sale of Chinese-origin company TikTok. Can you explain to us what you've been raising, since that background fight between the Trump administration and the Chinese government over hegemony, especially with respect, obviously, to the technological issue?I'm going to use the TikTok example to raise the problem, because it's really a novelty. The app called TikTok belonging to the Chinese company ByteDance had a spectacular growth in recent months, has more than 800 million users in the world and is the first non-American company to achieve this reach on social networks. It is also the first Chinese company to position itself in this way globally and there we have an interesting theme. ByteDance achieves this through innovation in terms of a new way of using algorithms that allows users to stay longer online, longer on the social network.It is a key issue because for all these companies the key is precisely online permanence, because this allows advertising development. That is, the longer users are online, the more they can be exposed to advertising, which is why it is a key issue.Somehow, TikTok is becoming, some say, a kind of artificial intelligence lab and in this sense it's not that it all starts with this app, but it does appear as a new element of competition between the United States and China for cutting-edge technologies. China is actually again – not for the first time – the main competitor in terms of cutting-edge technology with the US, but in certain respects with a more global scope. I think that's an important element.In the case of TikTok we said that it has 800 million users, but in the case of Whatsapp, for example, it has many more. Then getting into the preferences and tastes of so many people allows a data extraction that in turn makes it possible to generate data packets, which in turn are sold to other companies that are not necessarily the "hightech". Some may be, but they are not companies of at least social networks or of this type. Data packets are sold largely to traditional companies, classic capitalists, and then I was interested in seeing that relationship there. Traditional capitalist companies benefit from the use of the data sold to them by such companies (the owners of the apps) that work particularly with precarious labor, spying, etc., etc.Traditional companies use these data packages precisely to increase their sales, to improve their markets, increase their profits, etc. So there's a mutual game between state-of-the-art and traditional companies, so to speak, and they're all complicit in this same game, and in all there's an interest in capturing markets.This element is interesting because it is somehow an expression of the contradiction between the internationalization of capital and the internationalization of communications on the one hand, and the place of national states on the other. In a sense, the fight for state-of-the-art technology is deeply related to the need for new spaces for capital accumulation and the need for new markets. Both are somehow part of the same thing and that's what capitalism needs: new spaces for the development of new enterprises. You can't think about the development ofnew technologies regardless of this problem.The fight over spaces for capital accumulation is not an abstraction. TikTok is a great example: a market of 800 million people who use it and can be advertised, is of course a very interesting market and is one of the spaces that China and the US are effectively fighting for. In times of crisis like this, the struggle for markets becomes a very important element. That is why we cannot detach technologies in general from the struggle for markets and accumulation spaces, nor the role of these new companies from that process. In times of crisis this type of "hightech" companies is playing a very important role, capturing markets through data accumulation and allowing different more traditional companies to increase their sales, captivate markets, open spaces for their extension, competing with others and creating monopolies such as the natural trend of capitalism.TikTok, in fact, is just a new emerging from the fight that had been unfolding until now. The most resonant example is 5G, a network that has a much higher bandwidth than 4G, which can reach different levels depending on its evolution and application, but which is the basis of the Internet of Things, which proposes a great innovation in terms of the relationships between the virtual and the real. China has a very strong weight in this field. It's very advanced in 5G and can probably move faster on the Internet of Things. But at the same time, China has a vulnerability in this area, which is the production of microchips, where the U.S. is strongest. So China is developing its own means of creating microchips. But this, in a situation like today, with so many tensions and acute global economic crisis, is complicated. China for the first time is going to grow to 1% which, although it is positive when compared to the US that will grow in negative terms by 6%, 7% is probably very negative compared to previous growth levels, much higher. All this in the context of a very deep international crisis, where tensions become more serious and these problems of uneven development between different sectors are surely going to be more difficult to combine.Now, taking what you said about the current crisis, which further motorizes this fight over capital accumulation, now that the world is in the middle of the pandemic, beyond the differences of the continents, what was seen is that these tech companies made a lot of money making billionaires to their owners etc. But it was also seen that they need human labor, from their workers. So in this crisis does it show that the idea that robotics came from the end of work no longer goes? Can you explain this to us a little bit?I think saying it like that is limited. Somehow it shows and otherwise it doesn't prove.Somehow the current situation of the pandemic, of the economic crisis, shows that all the propaganda around the end of work was limited, to say the least, because to tell you the truth the interruption of the work of millions of people led to an immediate interruption of the economy or the main nodes of the economy. This appears as a central element. So, in a way, end-of-work discourse loses a lot of weight in this context because it is precisely this situation that it is not the "robots" – as a general way to name new technologies, artificial intelligence, etc. – but workers at the fundamental core of the capitalist economy, at least for the time being. On the other hand, it is also interesting to note that job losses are not associated with technological unemployment - in thismoment I mean, during the pandemic -- but the economic crisis. The current loss of jobs is not due to technological unemployment, but is a loss directly associated with the economic crisis, the closure of companies, not the increase in technology.So these companies that achieved great capitalization have actually attracted a lot of work in this last period. Much of the essential work is linked to this type of company, which in what are avant-garde is not precisely in the dismissal of workers for technological innovation, but in the precariousness of work. Then a contradiction in the relationship between new technologies and the end of work is highlighted. In reality, the companies with the most technology incorporated are being, at the time of the pandemic, essential workplaces and are acting as precarizers.On the other hand, several of the so-called "unicorn" companies, which have an assessment of just over $1 billion, shut down or fired workers but by shrinking or closing due to the crisis. In other words, it is again not associated with the problem of technological unemployment but with the economic crisis.In this sense, the end-of-work speech shows at least one face of falsehood and I think that is important to point it out.In another sense, care must be taken to confuse the current moment with what is coming, namely the photo with the film: speech and end-of-work propaganda will necessarily continue, and it will probably deepen because the need for investment of new ongoing technologies requires greater exploitation of work, layoffs in certain sectors and the recruitment of higher quality jobs. Let's say, it's not that history repeats itself and that every time capitalism incorporates new technologies it generates layoffs on the one hand, but it creates new tasks on the other. It is a bit like this, but the notorious thing is that the new tasks it creates materialize - particularly in recent decades - in increasingly precarious, increasingly degraded jobs. So we have to pay close attention to that, because what is coming is not "more of the same", but an ever deeper struggle between capital and labor, where capitalism will try to validate new technologies through higher levels of degradation, exploitation, division, precarization, etc. of work. So I think it's important to point out that difference. The propaganda of the end of work is going to continue and for a long time.This advancement of technologies actually allows us to produce more goods, more things, but that clashes with the need to make more profit from companies. How can this contradiction be solved between, on the one hand, technologies that allow more to be produced for humanity and, on the other hand, the thirst for profits of the owners of these companies, of capitalists?Yes, new technologies allow you to not only produce more things but also produce them in less time. That's a very important aspect.The name "zero marginal cost" is a widely used term today. This means that from the development of new technologies it is verified that certain sectors of digital services – especially in the case of music playback, movies, books or other types of products – can be reproduced almost free of charge. That is, they can be reproduced – I am not saying to be produced, but reproduced – without the incorporation of work or new capital, which with physical products at the moment is totally impossible. On the other hand, certain digital services can be played in whole or almost completely free of charge. Isthat is, without human work added effectively and with virtually no added capital, that is, almost without adding costs.So this example is interesting because this means that there is an element of technological development still under the capitalist domain, where new technologies show the possibility of free reproduction in certain segments. It is actually a moment on a historic path because products, historically and as technologies develop, have been requiring less and less work. Now this idea of "zero marginal cost" that implies a level of gratuitousness appears.However, the most interesting contradiction this raises is this: is it noted that products are becoming free and that in the system abundance prevails, where most people are living better, with less effort and have more and more goods at their disposal? No, this is a long way from reality.In fact, in the course of recent times, deepened by the economic crisis, rather there is a stripping and a tendency for large majorities to find it increasingly difficult to solve the problems of their lives, live better and access the necessary basic goods.So it seems to me that this is a very important element because it marks a serious contradiction of capitalism which is as follows: gratuitousness, that is, the tendency, in a sense, to need less and less work, is not favorable to capitalism. I mean by this that the key to the capitalist system, its engine, is put into profit, if the products are free capitalism does not work.So how does capitalism solve this? Capitalism solves this sometimes by putting a price on what it doesn't have, sometimes creating sources of value where they didn't exist before, creating, for example, new needs.What do I mean by all this? For example patents, which are a way to put a price on what doesn't have it or create value where there wasn't before. Or price the reproduction of services that could eventually be free. Or the cross-subsidy mechanism, which is the way companies offer a free service, which at the same time is geared towards offering another that is much more expensive, creating a new need. So, the "free" is used by capital to accumulate through multiple mechanisms. Part of this same logic is also the inability of capital to eliminate human work because there is indeed a contradiction between the trending possibility of the end of work and the need for profit. This is a complex issue to be explained but essentially implies an increasing degradation of the workforce – at least in terms of the claims of capital – i.e. the creation, on the one hand, of larger nuclei of unemployed but, on the other hand, of occupied in worse and worse conditions, of precarious, overburdened sectors of work. Working conditions getting worse and with a higher level of exploitation.In other words, the possibility of decreasing working time does not translate into a gratuitousness for most people or goods that are becoming cheaper and in less and less working time, but results in increasing difficulties in sustaining one's life and in increasingly widespread or worse working times. This is what capital needs to regenerate its profits. It has a very interesting expression in the relative character of the terms "abundance" and "scarcity". It is not true that with better technologies that automatically implies abundance.A very interesting example for this is the development of public services. During the second post-war period, much of them became free orvery cheap and yet many decades later, in the neoliberal period, much of them were privatized, making them very expensive and very difficult to access for large popular majorityes, with greater technological advancement, of course.It is then shown here that the relationship between scarcity and abundance is not purely technical, but also shows the relationship of forces between classes. Obviously, this was different in the second post-war period and under the neoliberal decades.The essential problem is capitalist unsolvable because capitalism effectively has a contradiction between a smaller amount of built-in work and the need for profit. Free goods in a capitalist system don't make sense, capitalism needs products to have value and price, which are therefore sellable and allow them to make a profit. So the problem here is that the solution is to question capitalist gains. It is a reality that there is no other way out of this problem, however extreme, the truth is that to make the advancement of technologies become free time and in abundance for large majorities it is necessary to question capitalist gain.For example, reducing working hours is one way to question it. It was never easy to conquer it, but historically it was achieved with great struggles.We also raise the distribution of working hours, which is something that also raises, in some way, the reduction of working hours without lowering the salary. The measure of distributing working hours between busy and unemployed and not only among them, but among those who are over-worked and the millions or hundreds of millions in the world today, for example, working part-time or less than they need to work to live, is a very logical measure. But we are in a system that is not guided by the logic of the needs of the great masses, but by that of their gain.The solution is then to question capitalist gain and private ownership of the means of production, which is the great obstacle for new technologies, which allow for high productivity and high production in less time, to result in a higher and more desirable standard of living for millions of people.Of course, this is not a problem that is solved just by saying it, but necessarily involves the action of workers in all its aspects, of busy, precarious, unemployed workers, including other social sectors, and demands, of course, enormous, great struggles like all the conquests that the working class has achieved in its history, which were achieved in this way.If this is a very profound problem, it is not surprising that thinking about a real solution to this problem will raise a great social upweaur that opens the door to great transformations. It is what is required for a great solution for the positive for the broad masses, because capitalism has its own for the refusal.Interviewed: Mirta Pacheco, The Daily Left.Load-Date: September 14, 2020End of Document

AP Explains: The promise of 5G wireless - speed, hype, riskAssociated Press InternationalOctober 13, 2020 Tuesday 9:38 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 609 wordsByline: MAE ANDERSON and TALI ARBEL, Associated PressBodyA much-hyped network upgrade called “5G” means different things to different people.To industry proponents, it’s the next huge innovation in wireless internet. To the U.S. government, it’s the backbone technology of a future that America will wrestle with China to control. To many average people, it’s simply a mystery.What, exactly, is 5G wireless — and will you even notice when it comes online?WHAT IS 5G?5G is a new technical standard for wireless networks — the fifth, naturally — that promises faster speeds; less lag, or “latency,” when connecting to the network; and the ability to connect many devices to the internet without bogging it down. 5G networks will ideally be better able to handle more users, lots of sensors and heavy traffic.Before we can all use it, wireless companies and phone makers have to upgrade. Phones need new chips and radio antennas to work with the new network.Wireless companies have been getting ready. They’ve been revamping their network equipment, buying up chunks of radio spectrum for carrying 5G signals, and installing new 5G antennas on cellphone towers, utility poles and streetlights. Wireless providers will invest $275 billion in 5G-related networks in the U.S., according to CTIA, an industry trade group.WHEN WILL IT BE AVAILABLE?A true U.S. mobile rollout began in 2019, but significantly faster networks are still sparse. It will take a few years to go national, and even then more rural areas of the country will not be covered in the “millimeter wave” frequencies that promise the highest data speeds and capacities, said Michael Thelander, CEO of wireless consultancy Signals Research Group.Beware of confusion, though.

AP Explains: The promise of 5G wireless - speed, hype, riskAssociated Press Financial WireOctober 13, 2020 Tuesday 9:38 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 609 wordsByline: MAE ANDERSON and TALI ARBEL, Associated PressBodyA much-hyped network upgrade called “5G” means different things to different people.To industry proponents, it’s the next huge innovation in wireless internet. To the U.S. government, it’s the backbone technology of a future that America will wrestle with China to control. To many average people, it’s simply a mystery.What, exactly, is 5G wireless — and will you even notice when it comes online?WHAT IS 5G?5G is a new technical standard for wireless networks — the fifth, naturally — that promises faster speeds; less lag, or “latency,” when connecting to the network; and the ability to connect many devices to the internet without bogging it down. 5G networks will ideally be better able to handle more users, lots of sensors and heavy traffic.Before we can all use it, wireless companies and phone makers have to upgrade. Phones need new chips and radio antennas to work with the new network.Wireless companies have been getting ready. They’ve been revamping their network equipment, buying up chunks of radio spectrum for carrying 5G signals, and installing new 5G antennas on cellphone towers, utility poles and streetlights. Wireless providers will invest $275 billion in 5G-related networks in the U.S., according to CTIA, an industry trade group.WHEN WILL IT BE AVAILABLE?A true U.S. mobile rollout began in 2019, but significantly faster networks are still sparse. It will take a few years to go national, and even then more rural areas of the country will not be covered in the “millimeter wave” frequencies that promise the highest data speeds and capacities, said Michael Thelander, CEO of wireless consultancy Signals Research Group.Beware of confusion, though. Wireless carriers have a history of rushing to slap the latest-and-greatest label on their networks, and this time is no different. AT&T has already applied the name 5G on a service that’s not really 5G.Once the network is ready, you’ll need a 5G-enabled phone to connect to it. Android versions have been out for a while, and on Tuesday Apple launched its first 5G iPhone. But you can keep using 4G phones. They just won't connect to 5G speeds where those are available.WHAT CAN 5G DO?There’s a considerable amount of hype over the promise of 5G.

Trump COVID infection thrusts world in uncharted territoryAssociated Press InternationalOctober 2, 2020 Friday 3:52 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWS; POLITICAL NEWSLength: 1162 wordsByline: LORI HINNANT and FOSTER KLUG, Associated PressDateline: PARIS BodyPARIS (AP) — News that the world’s most powerful man was infected with the world’s most notorious disease dominated screens large and small, drawing shock, sympathy and some barbs for President Donald Trump.The outpouring from world leaders and flagging markets Friday left little doubt that Trump's illness will have global implications — even if they're still unknown. Trump's announcement on Twitter that he and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for the coronavirus prompted a multitude of responses on the same platform, as well as others.The positive test reading adds to investors' worries, especially about its effect on the Nov. 3 election between the Republican president and Democrat Joe Biden. U.S. stock futures and most world markets fell on the news as did the price of oil.From India to Qatar to Mexico, world leaders were quick to offer official sympathy from the top, many in the form of tweets directly to Trump, while something approaching schadenfreude bubbled up from elsewhere. Trump is the most prominent on a growing list of powerful people who have contracted the virus, including many who were skeptical of the disease. Among his well-wishers were at least two who have recovered from the illness.“I'm sure that your inherent vitality, good spirits and optimism will help you cope with the dangerous virus,” Russian President Vladimir Putin wrote in a direct message to Trump released by the Kremlin.World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus tweeted “My best wishes to President @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS for a full and speedy recovery.” The Trump administration in July formally notified the United Nations of its withdrawal from WHO, although the pullout won’t take effect until next year. Trump claims the U.N. health agency is in need of reform and is heavily influenced by China. The U.N. secretary-general also sent in best wishes.Italian right-wing opposition leader Matteo Salvini tweeted: “In Italy and in the world, whoever celebrates the illness of a man or of a woman, and who comes to wish the death of a neighbor, confirms what he is: An idiot without soul. A hug to Melania and Donald.\u2033British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was hospitalized for a week in April after he contracted COVID-19, wished Trump a “speedy recovery.”Former Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi, who also recently recovered from a serious bout with coronavirus, has sent a message to Trump and the first lady extending his best wishes for a speedy recovery.“I know this illness from direct experience, that can manifest itself also in an insidious way, but which can be overcome with correct and courageous behavior,\u2033 Berlusconi said in a message.Dr. Bharat Pankhania, who advises Johnson's government on communicable disease control, said he hopes that Trump’s positive test sends a message.“We need politicians, especially politicians like President Trump who has a lot of power and influence, to take this seriously and to support their scientists and clinicians in leading the outbreak management, rather than have political influence in trying to deny that this virus is in circulation and drag your feet around control measures because it suited your agenda.”Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, speaking at a weekly news conference, did not mention Trump's reluctance to wear masks when asked about his infection, but she said the news “reminded me of how widely masks are worn in Japan.”Major media across the globe played up the announcement, with bulletins crawling across TV screens in Paris and Rome, Seoul and Beijing.“To say this potentially could be a big deal is an understatement,” Rabobank said in a commentary. “Everything now takes a backseat to the latest incredible twist in this U.S. election campaign.”China’s official Xinhua News Agency flashed the news, and an anchor on state broadcaster CCTV announced it. Late Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying tweeted that he was “saddened to learn President and the FirstLady of the US tested positive. Hope they both have a speedy recovery and will be fine.”The positive test result was the most searched topic in China on the widely used social media app Weibo for hours after the announcement, with most comments mocking or critical.One user darkly joked that Trump had finally tweeted something positive.The Chinese government has bristled at Trump’s attempts to blame China, where the disease emerged, for the pandemic and called for global cooperation in fighting it. It's a message that has resonated with the public.Hu Xijin, the outspoken editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted in English that “President Trump and the first lady have paid the price for his gamble to play down the COVID-19.”Multiple Arab news media outlets continuously broadcast footage of Trump and his wife after the virus announcement.Al-Arabiya, a Saudi-owned satellite channel based in Dubai, cut to a long live shot of the White House. Qatari state-owned Al Jazeera channel brought in four commentators to discuss the “prevailing state of uncertainty” in the United States, questioning whether Trump could effectively steer a reelection campaign and run the country from quarantine. Middle East leaders closely allied to the U.S. sent out their best wishes, including Kuwait's new ruling emir.Iranian state television announced Trump had the virus, an anchor breaking the news with an unflattering image of the U.S. president surrounded by what appeared to be giant coronaviruses. Later, an anchor noted that “the American president, who treated the coronavirus almost like it was nothing, finally caught it.”U.S.-Iran ties have suffered since Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers and reimposed crushing sanctions.Social media platforms were ablaze with questions and quick reactions to all the unknowns.Would Trump blame the Chinese? Would he thumb his nose at his critics and enemies by breezing through the quarantine without serious symptoms, tweeting away from the White House? Would he become gravely ill, or worse, and, if he did, what would that mean for the U.S. election, one of the most contentious in recent history? What would it mean for U.S. leadership during tumultuous times?While the uncertainty seemed palpable on a scroll through various social media in an array of languages, many seemed to revel in the announcement.And the satirical Australian news site, the Betoota Advocate, posted a story with this headline: “Trump Family Records More Cases Of Community Transmission Than Entire State Of Queensland.”___Foster Klug reported from Tokyo.

DECISION 2020 REPORT: POLICY IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EMERGENCE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCEStates News ServiceOctober 9, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1389 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: STANFORD, Calif. BodyThe following information was released by the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace:In the twentieth edition of the Decision 2020 Report, Hoover fellows assess the economic, national security, and geopolitical implications of innovations in artificial intelligence (AI).AI a New Measure of Global CompetitivenessSenior Fellow John Villasenor argued that countries that maintain an overreliance on legacy infrastructure will face increasing challenges in sustaining global competitiveness."Why?" Villasenor asked readers. "Because geopolitics is determined in large part by many of the same domains that AI is poised to revolutionize."He explained that AI technology presents enormous economic growth opportunities because it can vastly improve efficiency in such sectors as agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, and trade. He added that AI will also force a change in thinking about how nations manage their security challenges and adapt their militaries.Villasenor contended that while China has shrewdly bet on AI as a key component of its economic growth, the US still remains a global AI leader with an ecosystem of companies pioneering such technology, including Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. The US government, he added, has also invested billions in developing AI infrastructure, and universities have bolstered the research and teaching on the subject in efforts to maintain and enhance America's advantage in AI human capital.Villasenor maintained that America's biggest challenge as a competitor in the AI domain is the threat of burdensome government regulation that reduces individual incentive and slows the engine of innovation."Maintaining AI preeminence is a multi-decade endeavora far greater time scale than the term lengths of elected officials," Villasenor explained. "This lowers the incentives to implement AI-focused policy strategies that might take several years or more to bear fruit."The Promise and Peril of AI InnovationIn an interview published by Stanford News, James Timbie, a Hoover distinguished visiting fellow and Stanford-trained physicist, explained that though society as a whole will benefit from increased productivity and lower costs as a result of artificial intelligence and advanced robotics, research indicates that half of all US workers will be adversely effected in the near term.He believes that in some cases machines will replace the jobs of manufacturing workers, drivers of heavy transport, and even educated and well-paid workers including tax preparers, radiologists, software engineers, paralegals, and financial analysts.In other fields, such as medicine and education, the labor force will be transformed with skilled humans working in close coordination with machines."Machines would continue to do the computational work they do well, while leaving other tasks to humans who see the big picture and have interpersonal skills," Timbie explained.Timbie said that the current technical revolution is unfolding at an even faster rate than in the last two centuries, a pace that will enable the creation of more national wealth, but that will also lead to greater income inequality.Timbie said that the best way to adjust to these evolving economic realities is not to provide guaranteed basic income, as some policy makers and social scientists have advocated. Rather, his view is that society should help support people in developing skills for new types of jobs."There is no shortage of work that needs to be done. . . . There are potential opportunities for displaced workers with appropriate training," Timbie said. "The rapid pace of change reinforces the benefit of a habit of life-long education."Rules of Engagement for AIIn an article for the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, Herbert S. Lin, the Hank J. Holland Fellow in Cyber Policy and Security, wrote that the emergence of AI-integrated weapons systems and their numerous capabilities may cause a dilemma for state actors in determining whether to comply with the laws of war.Lin asked readers to assume opposing militaries have the same technological capabilities and equal numbers of fielded systems that engage in combat. By this assumption, Lin argued, one can deduce that the advantage would be for the combatant that practices less restraint on the use of force and does not comply with their country's laws and international treaties.As an example, Lin provided a lesson from World War II, when German U-boat commanders violated Article 22 of the 1930 London Naval Treaty, which forbade the sinking of neutral civilian merchant ships. Since many of these merchant ships carried war materials, the Germans were not providing warnings before attacks, because they believed it reduced their operational effectiveness especially if those ships were armed.Furthermore, Lin explained, at the Nuremberg trials following the war, a tribunal ignored these violations because Great Britain and France had also been engaged in unrestricted submarine warfare."As the history of unrestricted submarine warfare demonstrates, humanitarian motivations were ignored when observing those restrictions compromised combat effectiveness," Lin said. "It's not unimaginable that a similar fate might await the laws of war when AI-enabled weapons become ubiquitous."The Emerging AI Challenge from ChinaThe Hoover Institution's new director, Condoleezza Rice, provided opening remarks on Tuesday, September 29, to a Hoover-partnered virtual conference about the Chinese government's application of artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge technologies, arguing that they pose a unique and far greater challenge than Soviet military ambitions during the Cold War."[China has] pushed its own technological frontiers by a very determined desire to be the leader," Rice said.She maintains that for authoritarians like the Chinese Communist Party, an unrestrained application of such technology allows them to "dream big." Beijing has not only created an Orwellian state apparatus that oppresses its people and leaves them no place to hide but also aims to export this mode of governance and interfere in the political affairs of democracies across the world.A lack of institutional constraints, Rice holds, provides the CCP and other authoritarians strategic advantages over the free world. However, she cautions that Americans should avoid imitating China and surrendering its democratic values to meet this challenge."We need to have a concerted effort on behalf of free peoples to make sure that the digital authoritarians don't win," Rice said. "They can't win the race for this technology, because whoever wins this race is going to have a leg up on shaping the international system."More on the Policy Implications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Other Emerging TechnologiesWatch the entire virtual conference The Rise of Digital Authoritarianism: China, AI, and Human Rights," co-presented by the Hoover Institution, the Stanford's Global Digital Policy Incubator, the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, and the Human Rights Foundation.Read Beyond Disruption: Technology's Challenge to Governance, by James Timbie, Jim Hoagland, and George P.

Beijing is unlikely to bless Oracle and Walmart deal for TikTok, Global Times saysCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 22, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 389 wordsBodyBy Josh Horwitz and Brenda GohSHANGHI, 22 Sep (Reuters) - Beijing will probably not approve the "unfair" agreement that Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. said they had reached with ByteDance about the future of the TikTok video application, the Global Times, a Chinese state-backed newspaper, said in an editorial.These two large U.S. companies said they will buy a new company whose capital will be primarily American, TikTok Global, with a board of directors composed mainly of Americans, in an attempt to appease the administration of President Donald Trump, who has planned to ban TikTok in the United States for security reasons.By contrast, ByteDance has said that TikTok Global will be its U.S. subsidiary and will have an 80% stake in it."It is clear that these articles (terms) broadly show Washington's style of intimidation and camorristic logic. They damage China's national security, interests and dignity," said the English version of the editorial published last Monday and also appears in the Chinese edition of the newspaper."According to the information provided by the US, the agreement was unfair. Respond to Washington's irrational demands. It is hard for us to believe that Beijing approves such an agreement," the publisher says, echoing tweets published the same afternoon by the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Hu Xijin.The Global Times is a tabloid published by People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, but does not speak on behalf of the party and the government unlike its parent publication.The Chinese government has largely refrained from commenting directly on the details of the agreement, although its Foreign Ministry has repeatedly said that the United States should provide a fair and non-discriminatory environment for foreign companies.The agreement requires the approval of regulators in both Beijing and Washington, ByteDance said. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce revised at the end of August a list of technology export controls that experts said would grant regulatory oversight in any TikTok agreement.ByteDance and the Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment on Tuesday.(Information by Josh Horwitz and Brenda Goh; additional information from Yingzhi Yang and Gabriel Crossley in Beijing, translated by Jose Elías Rodríguez)Load-Date: September 23, 2020End of Document

Huawei says 'survival is the goal' as US crackdown hammers its businessCNN WireSeptember 24, 2020 Thursday 9:14 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 849 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Huawei says it is in survival mode as continuous "attacks" from the United States threaten to choke off the Chinese company's access to key technology. "Huawei is in a difficult situation these days. Nonstop aggression from the US government has put us under significant pressure," the company's rotating chief executive Guo Ping said at a conference on Wednesday. "Right now, survival is the goal," he said. Washington has ramped up pressure on Huawei, issuing fresh sanctions in May and August that further restrict the company's access to the leading edge computer chips it needs to manufacture smartphones, 5G networking gear and other products. Semiconductor companies that use American software and technology to design and manufacture chips can no longer sell to Huawei without first obtaining a license from the US Commerce Department. US regulators say Huawei poses a national security risk, alleging that the Chinese government could use Huawei equipment to spy. The company has repeatedly denied those allegations. Analysts have called the latest US sanctions a "lethal blow" and a "death sentence" for the company. "The United States has been continuously attacking us and [the latest restriction] has posed great challenges to our operations," Guo told reporters. Several analysts estimate that Huawei has stockpiled enough semiconductors to last the company through at least the end of the year. But when asked how long supplies will last at a press conference on Wednesday, Guo said "we're still evaluating more details." He added that Huawei buys hundreds of millions of chipsets for its smartphone business every year, and that the company received its last shipment of chips in mid-September, when the US restrictions announced in May went into effect. Major chipmakers such as Qualcomm and SK Hynix applied for licenses to sell to Huawei, according to Chinese state broadcaster CGTN. China's biggest chipmaker, SMIC, said in a statement that it has also "submitted license applications covering several Huawei products," without going into detail. Some companies have gotten the green light, including Intel. A spokesman for the US company confirmed that it had received a license from US authorities to continue supplying Huawei, but did not specify what products it could sell. Intel has in the past supplied processors for Huawei laptops. AMD may also have obtained licenses to sell to Huawei. Forrest Norrod, senior vice president of AMD, said at a conference last week that "based on the licenses that we've been able to secure, we don't expect to see a significant impact on our business at this time" because of recent US-China trade tensions. Norrod did not specifically mention Huawei, but Jefferies analyst Edison Lee has pointed out that the California-based chip company supplies Huawei with computer processing units for laptops.AMD obtaining a license "is logical to us, since Huawei's ability to produce notebook computers should not create a national security risk to the United States," Lee wrote in a note on Sunday. Huawei's telecommunications gear is another matter. The Trump administration has been urging countries around the world to ban Huawei equipment from their 5G telecom networks. Several key countries for months resisted cutting off Huawei entirely. But that changed after US restrictions announced in May, barring chip companies from manufacturing chips designed by Huawei affiliate HiSilicon. The United Kingdom in July banned Huawei from its 5G network, reversing a January decision to allow it a limited role in the build out. UK officials cited uncertainty surrounding Huawei's supply chain as the reason for the rapid about-face. Since then, things have only gotten worse for Huawei. The company is facing the likelihood of "a near-total cutoff of semiconductors ... dealing a lethal blow to China's most important global technology company," Paul Triolo, head of geo technology at Eurasia Group, wrote in a research note last month.The US restrictions issued in August are intended to expand the number of chip companies required to apply for licenses to supply to Huawei, "with a presumption of denial," he wrote. Huawei indicated on Wednesday that Qualcomm is still awaiting a decision. "Qualcomm has always been an important partner of Huawei," Guo told reporters. "If they get the license, we're willing to procure from them and use their chipsets in our smartphones." A spokeswoman for SK Hynix said that the US government "is still reviewing" its application for a license to sell to Huawei, but declined to provide further details. Qualcomm and AMD did not respond to a request for comment outside of regular working hours.TSMC, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, confirmed in July that it would end its relationship with Huawei this month in order to comply with the US regulations.Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the status of SK Hynix's application for a US license to sell to Huawei.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Trump and Xi clashed in front of the UN and Guterres warned of a "new cold war"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 22, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 969 wordsBody         We have something to offer you With our digital subscription you will enjoy more than 300 exclusive items per month and ship our sites without limits.

This explains the support of international institutions for this campaign backed by dark interests joined by Brazilian, exploitative and anti-patriotic associations, with the aim of harming the government and Brazil itself," he added.But it was the second speech of the day that definitively marked the climate of dominant political tension this year as a pandemic - forcing all leaders to record a message from their countries - and a global economic crisis."The Chinese Government and the World Health Organization (WHO), which is virtually controlled by China, falsely stated that there was no evidence of human transmission; they then falsely said that people without symptoms would not spread the disease. The United Nations must hold China accountable for its actions," Trump said, according to the AFP news agency.In addition, the representative, who presented himself as the "peacemaker" of the world because of the recent diplomatic relations normalization agreements he achieved between Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in the Middle East and the peace negotiations in Afghanistan, made a new defense of nationalism."For decades, the same tired voices proposed the same failed solutions, pursuing global ambitions at the expense of their own people, but only when you take care of your own citizens can you find a real basis for cooperation," he said.When it was his turn, Chinese President Xi Jinping did everything to get against Trump, though he never named him."You should not be allowed to do what you want and act like a hegemon, a bully, or the head of the world; no one should be subdued by those who raise their fists, there should be no practices of exceptionalism or double standards, nor should international politics be distorted or used as a pretext to delegitimate the rights and interests of other countries," said Xi, quoted by Chinese news agency Xinhua.He also replied to UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who had opened the week of speeches with a strong warning: "avoid a new cold war."Guterres had stated that it is "moving in a very dangerous direction":"Our world cannot afford a future in which the two largest economies create a great rift that divides the planet, each with its own trade and financial rulesand their own capabilities of the Internet and artificial intelligence," he warned.Xi argued that he has "no intention of fighting a cold war or a hot one with any country" and presented himself as an advocate of multilateralism and dialogue.With that same conciliatory tone, Russia's President Vladimir Putin stressed that his country was the first in the world to pass a coronavirus vaccine - even though it is still in the final stage of development - and offered free doses to the UN to immunize its employees.This year, Putin chose to avoid controversies and sensitive issues, and only tangentially referred to one of America's most recent unilateral decisions that caused the most unrest at the UN and even among its allies: the revival of international sanctions suspended by the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal, which Trump abandoned.Putin warned in his speech of the long-term economic effects of the current crisis and defended the need for the entire international community to work together to drive growth, emphasizing the importance of removing barriers, restrictions and, above all, "illegitimate sanctions" in international trade.Clearer and more forceful was the President of France, Emmanuel Macron."France, with its German and British allies, will maintain its demand for full and full implementation of the 2015 Vienna agreement," the representative said to remind Iran that they will not accept progress in its nuclear development, but also sent a message to Trump"We will not, however, compromise on the activation of a mechanism that the United States is not in a position to activate," he added, recalling that Washington unilaterally abandoned the agreement it now invokes.Iran also joined the discussion today. "We are not an element of negotiation in the US election or in his domestic policy," President Hasan Rohani complained in a recorded speech and warned of next November's US presidential election: "Any U.S. government after the election will have no choice but to give in to the resilience of the Iranian nation."NEWSLETTER 9AM From Monday to Friday, the selection of our editors of the most relevant information for each day.

How will Oracle deal affect TikTok?; US threatened to ban app without American ownerUSA TODAYSeptember 15, 2020 TuesdayFIRST EDITIONCopyright 2020 Gannett Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: MONEY; Pg. 3BLength: 1221 wordsByline: Jessica Guynn, USA TODAYBodyByteDance, the Chinese company that owns the popular video-sharing app TikTok, has tapped Oracle as its U.S. technology partner in a bid to keep its U.S. operations going.So what does that mean for you?"The impact of the Oracle deal on TikTok users is a difficult question to answer at this point since we don't have a full picture of what Oracle's role will be," said eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson. "The biggest concern that TikTok users have is that the app that they love will continue to exist. That is their ground zero. They love TikTok so much that some TikTok users have changed their location on their phone to Canada so that they won't lose access to TikTok if it were banned in the U.S."The Oracle announcement comes a week before the Sept. 20 deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok to an American company or risk being banned because of national security concerns. With its chummy relationship with the Trump administration, Oracle may have the inside track to get a deal done."We can confirm that we've submitted a proposal to the Treasury Department which we believe would resolve the Administration's security concerns," TikTok said in a statement.A critical factor will be making sure the technology is safe for users in the U.S. under the proposal, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday."We'll be reviewing it with their technical teams and our technical teams to see if they can make the representations that we need," Mnuchin said.What would an Oracle dealmean for TikTok users?If the administration clears the deal, TikTok would continue operating in the U.S. Oracle's plans for TikTok are unclear at this point, but Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives does not expect much to change for consumers if the deal goes through."The average teen or tween using TikTok will not know the difference," Ives said.The stakes would be high for Oracle. For its legions of users, TikTok isn't just flashy entertainment, it's a vibrant community, Williamson says. "If anything were to change about that experience as a result of Oracle's involvement, they would be devastated," she said.Analysts say Oracle will need to make sure that the service retains its hold on users and its influencers. In the U.S., it's estimated that TikTok has more than 100 million monthly active users."We strongly believe that its user base has only grown as a result of stay at home orders and remote learning," Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler said in a research note. "But it may also have been negatively impacted by the uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future."Forrester analyst Jeff Pollard says Oracle should allow the U.S. TikTok team to operate independently much like Microsoft did when it acquired LinkedIn.What worries US about TikTok?TikTok, like other social networks, collects data on its users. Unlike Facebook or Google's YouTube, TikTok is owned by a Chinese company and has come under scrutiny over allegations it supplies user data to Beijing. TikTok says it does not store U.S. user data in China and would not hand over that data to the Chinese government.Is Oracle buying TikTok?No. Microsoft and Walmart were among the bidders to buy TikTok's U.S. operations, but ByteDance would not part with its secret sauce, the technology that suggests videos to users. China had warned it might block the technology from being exported.So Oracle struck a deal to be ByteDance's U.S. technology partner, meaning it will provide back-end technology to TikTok and assuage the Trump administration's concerns about the security of U.S. users' data, Ives said.Walmart on Sunday said it is continuing discussions "with ByteDance leadership and other interested parties.""We know that any approved deal must satisfy all regulatory and national security concerns," Walmart said in a statement."TikTok's back was against the wall. No company is going to buy the company outright without the algorithm," Ives said. "The alternative was a partnership, and for Oracle, it's about controlling the inflows and the outflows, making sure there are no backdoors to Beijing and the U.S. government having comfort with Oracle as a trusted vendor and stalwart U.S. technology provider."The Treasury Department-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States which reviews deals for national security issues must approve the Oracle partnership. What may worry the administration is that Beijing could alter the algorithm to push propaganda.What is Oracle's relationshipwith the Trump administration?Oracle has a close relationship with the Trump administration and a long track record with the U.S. government that analysts say could help boost the TikTok deal.Larry Ellison, Oracle's co-founder and chairman, has publicly supported Trump and hosted a fundraiser for Trump's reelection campaign in February. CEO Safra Catz was part of the president's transition team."Larry Ellison has a long history of working with the US government - specifically the intelligence community," Forrester Research's Pollard said in a blog post. "Oracle's first customer was the CIA, and the company is named after a CIA project Ellison and co-founders worked on prior to starting the company."In August, Trump called Oracle a "great company" that "would be certainly somebody that could handle it."What does Oracleget out of a TikTok deal?"I doubt that many of the youthful users of TikTok know what Oracle is or even care very much," said eMarketer's Williamson.Oracle is an enterprise software and cloud services company. Pollard says Oracle is frustrated at lagging behind competitors Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Cloud and Google Cloud so it's been pushing to win over more business customers and increase its "hip factor" by doing deals with well-known brands like Zoom. With 800 million users globally and 100 million in the U.S., "nothing is more hip than TikTok at the moment," Pollard says.Some of the moves that Bernstein's Moerdler anticipates: TikTok would move to the Oracle Cloud. Another key point: A TikTok deal would also benefit Oracle's digital advertising business as well as its e-commerce business.What are the privacyconcerns of an Oracle deal?Some in the Trump administration worry that a technology partnership does not adequately protect the data of U.S. users.The other issue is whether Oracle, which already collects so much data on Americans, would pose a privacy threat of its own, particularly to younger TikTok users, privacy watchdogs say."Unless the Trump Administration imposes safeguards for the deal, handing TikTok over to Oracle will unleash major new threats to the privacy of Americans," said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy. "Oracle has assembled a powerful array of data companies that already collects information on what we buy, shop, view, etc. By turning over the treasure trove of data gathered by TikTok, Oracle will be able to leverage its data so it can better track and target U.S. consumers."In addition, Chester says he has warned the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department that he believes TikTok is violating privacy laws that shield children 12 and under in the U.S."It would be tragic if the Trump White House allowed Oracle to operate TikTok and not first have to comply with the kids' data law," Chester said. Load-Date: September 15, 2020End of Document

Intel gets US permission to supply some products to HuaweiCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 22, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 313 wordsBodyBy Josh HorwitzSHANGHI, 22 Sep (Reuters) - Intel Corp has received licenses from U.S. authorities to continue supplying certain products to Huawei Technologies, a spokesman for the technology company said Tuesday.With U.S.-China ties at its worst in decades, Washington has been pressuring governments around the world to dispense with Huawei, arguing that the telecom giant is a spy for the Chinese government.Since September 15, new restrictions have prevented U.S. companies from providing or providing services to Huawei.This week the Chinese Securities Journal, backed by the Chinese state, said Intel had received permission to supply Huawei.Last week, China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation confirmed that it had also requested permission to continue providing Huawei. SMIC uses U.S.-origin equipment to make chips for Huawei and other companies.South Korean semiconductor manufacturer SK Hynix also applied for a US license to sell Huawei, but has not obtained approval, one person familiar with the matter said.This person, who refused to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said non-U.S. companies might not have much chance of getting the US approval, and chipmakers are developing contingency plans to increase supplies to other customers.SK Hynix declined to comment.Huawei, founded in 1987 by a former People's Liberation Army engineer from China, denies that it is spying for Beijing and claims that the United States is trying to discredit it because Western companies are falling behind in 5G technology.In what some observers have compared to the Cold War arms race, the United States is concerned that mastery of 5G technology will give China an advantage that Washington is unwilling to accept.(Information by Josh Horwitz; additional information by Hyunjoo Jin in Séul; translated by Jose Elías Rodríguez)Load-Date: September 23, 2020End of Document

Organizations such as the Confederation of Industrial Chambers, the Mexican Chamber of the Construction Industry and the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, among others, attend from the private sector.He stressed that the important thing was to move forward with a revival as soon as possible, to encourage consumption and start infrastructure investment projects, to create new jobs and to replenish what had been lost to the covid-19 pandemic.It was in November 2019 that entrepreneurs and the President announced what would be the National Infrastructure Investment Agreement, a program that envisaged an investment of 859 billion pesos, without contemplating the energy sector, however, with the covid-19 the project slowed down.In mid-August this year, the Chair reported that talks with employers had resumed as part of the economic recovery strategy to review this program and include energy projects.On this, Salazar and Del Valle agreed that there was a need to rewrite some "from scratch" initiatives to adapt them to the new reality.China to invest in MexicoThe president of the Mexico-China Chamber-Mexico Chamber-Mexico Chamber of Commerce and Technology, Aurea Amapola Grijalva, said the Asian country sees investment potential in Mexican territory, especially in industries such as automotive, electricity, photovoltaic, telecommunications, clean energy, mining, oil and gas, however, she said our country must take steps to further attract Mexican investment.Participating in the virtual event "Preparing your company to attract investment from China", organized by the Confederation of National Chambers of Commerce, Services and Tourism (Concanaco-Servytur), Grijalva noted that Asians should not be expected to see Mexico as an opportunity, but to work for it.In the opinion of concanaco-Servytur President José Manuel López Campos, China may be Mexico's best trading ally, as diversifying markets will create greater growth opportunities over domestic exports."Given the possibility of Mexico being an ally with China, private initiative and authorities need to strengthen trade relations with China, while working to open up opportunities among other regions of the country that have infrastructure to house some or a few Chinese companies planning to expand in other parts of the world," he said.Grijalva explained that over the past month the Chinese government has done "brutal" work containing the virus, so they have no longer had covid-19 cases, which has helped their economy recover more quickly.He explained that China operates under five-year plans that are fully fulfilled, "in such a way that they are also generating inertia that leads them to have a value creation process with greaterlevel of certainty than other economies in the world."In this regard López Campos emphasized that "Mexico has the historical opportunity to turn to see new international markets, new markets with great potential to invest in other nations and that they can find in our country the infrastructure conditions necessary to expand their presence on the planet".NL leads in recovered employmentAfter the confinement during the first months of 2020, which resulted in the loss of one million 117 thousand 584 jobs according to IMSS figures, the Chamber of the Transformation Industry of Nuevo León (Caintra) stated that the state leads the recovery of formal employment in August with a positive generation of 92 thousand 390 jobs.Load-Date: September 16, 2020End of Document

ByteDance chooses Oracle as partner to try to save TikTok's US businessCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 14, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 616 wordsBodyBy Echo Wang and Greg Roumeliotis14 Sep (Reuters) - Oracle Corp announced Monday that it will be a member of China's ByteDance so that TikTok can continue to operate in the United States, after overcoming Microsoft Corp's attempt to reach an agreement, which ended up being structured more as an association than a direct sale.ByteDance, TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, had been in talks to sell the U.S. business of its popular short video app to Oracle or Microsoft after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered its sale last month and threatened a possible shutdown.Although the app is best known for dance videos that go viral among teens, Washington has expressed concern that user data and information can be transferred to the Chinese government.TikTok, which has up to 100 million users in the United States, has assured that it would never share that data with Chinese authorities.Oracle said it was part of a proposal submitted by ByteDance to the U.S. Treasury Department over the weekend, in which Oracle would act as TikTok's "reliable technology provider." U.S. firm shares rose by about 6%.Under the new proposal, Oracle will be ByteDance's technology partner and will assume the management of TikTok user data in the United States, sources told Reuters, who added that Oracle is also negotiating to take a stake in TikTok's business in the US country.TikTok user data is currently stored in the Alphabet Inc cloud, backed up in Singapore.Some of ByteDance's major investors, including General Atlantic and Sequoia, will also hold minority stakes in those operations, one of the sources said.PrecedentIt is not yet clear whether Trump, who wants a U.S. tech company to own most of TikTok in the United States, will approve the deal. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC Monday that the government will review it this week."I will only say, from our point of view, that we will have to ensure that (...) Americans' data is secure, that phones are secure. We hope to have conversations with Oracle in the coming days," he added.Mnuchin said the deadline for approving the agreement is September 20 and that the current proposal includes a commitment to create a U.S.-based company with 20,000 new jobs.The U.S. Foreign Investment Committee (CFIUS), a government commission that reviews agreements in terms of national security risks, is overseeing the byte-oracle talks. Mnuchin said there will also be a security review by the Trump administration.ByteDance plans to argue that the CFIUS' approval of China Oceanwide Holdings Group's purchase of US insurer Genworth Financial sets a precedent for its proposal with Oracle, sources said.In that operation, China Oceanwide agreed to use a U.S.-based third-party service provider to manage data from US Genworth policyholders. ByteDance will argue that a similar agreement with Oracle can safeguard data from US TikTok users.ByteDance and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment and the White House did not want to speak out.China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin declined to comment on Monday when asked at a press conference about the agreement by TikTok, but said that theapplication is being "coerced" in the United States to seal a transaction."We urge the U.S. government to provide an open, equitable, fair, non-discriminatory environment to foreign companies operating and investing in the United States," he said.(Information from Echo Wang and Greg Roumeliotis in New York; additional information by David Shepardson in Washington, Melissa Fares in New York, Stephen Nellis in San Fransisco and Yingzhi Yang in Beijing, written by Joshua Franklin; edited is Spanish by Jorge Martínez and Rodrigo Charme)Load-Date: September 15, 2020End of Document

Trump administration to ban TikTok, WeChat from app stores starting SundayPolitico.comSeptember 18, 2020 Friday 3:10 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 806 wordsHighlight: The Commerce Department noted that both apps collect location data, network activity, browsing history and other information about its U.S. users.BodyThe Commerce Department said Friday it will ban Chinese mobile apps TikTok and WeChat from app stores in the U.S. starting Sunday night, taking the first steps to enforce President Donald Trump's crackdown on the two Chinese technology companies.But the Commerce Department's restrictions also give partial reprieve to TikTok to give the company time to complete negotiations with the administration on a deal that would involve Oracle and other American investors. While WeChat will essentially have to stop operating on Sunday, existing TikTok users will still be able to use that app until mid-November - after the U.S. presidential election."We took pains to not do anything in this order that might disrupt the ongoing negotiations with the parties, and the president's deliberations with whether or not to accept the arrangement which is being developed," a senior Commerce Department official said on a call with reporters.The deal between the Trump administration and TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, for the video-sharing app would involve, among other provisions, taking on American investors and board members, and moving its global headquarters to the U.S. A deal is expected as soon as Friday. An Aug. 14 executive order from Trump had already given ByteDance until Nov. 12 to line up an American buyer, but it had not previously been clear how that extension would affect an earlier order from the president saying all transactions for both apps would have to halt by Sept. 20. The Commerce Department filing definitively pushes a full ban of TikTok until after the election, alleviating some concern the president could upset millions of voters who use the app to swap dance videos and other entertainment. For the moment, new downloads and upgrades of TikTok will be prohibited.The official said the government "could have done a lot more" to penalize TikTok and WeChat, but it took a lighter approach to TikTok in particular because the app counts 100 million users in the U.S. "When there's a chance to perhaps solve those problems without having to get rid of an app, which is appreciated by literally millions of Americans, we of course want to pursue every possibility to do that," the official said. The Commerce official said the delayed restrictions on TikTok were done in coordination with other parts of the administration as the deal gets hammered out. The department could ease or eliminate restrictions on the company once an agreement is reached, he said. TikTok said in a statement Friday that the company has "already committed to unprecedented levels of additional transparency and accountability well beyond what other apps are willing to do" as part of its proposed deal with the administration. Those measures include third-party audits and government oversight over U.S. data security. It has long said that it would not share data with the Chinese government."We will continue to challenge the unjust executive order, which was enacted without due process and threatens to deprive the American people and small businesses across the US of a significant platform for both a voice and livelihoods," the company said. The company sued the Trump administration over the executive order last month. The additional restrictions on WeChat that take effect Sunday would prohibit WeChat's users from transferring funds or processing payments in the U.S. The other rules would ban WeChat from using internet hosting services, content delivery services or other technologies necessary for the app to function.TikTok will get the same restrictions as WeChat on Nov. 12 if it doesn't reach a deal.WeChat denied posing a security threat to the U.S. and said the company has offered a "comprehensive proposal" that should address the administration's concerns. "The restrictions announced today are unfortunate, but given our desire to provide ongoing services to our users in the U.S. - for whom WeChat is an important communication tool - we will continue to discuss with the government and other stakeholders in the U.S. ways to achieve a long-term solution," the company said. The Commerce Department noted that both apps collect location data, network activity, browsing history and other information about its U.S. users, as is common for social media apps, but as Chinese companies they could be compelled to turn over the information to China's intelligence services. "This combination results in the use of WeChat and TikTok creating unacceptable risks to our national security," the department said in a statement. American users in other countries will still be able to access the apps. Senior Commerce officials said they expect some U.S. users to find workarounds to continue to use WeChat after Sunday, but the administration's intent is to prevent new users and the further collection of U.S. data.Load-Date: September 19, 2020End of Document

She was 87.Ginsburg died of complications from metastatic pancreatic cancer, the court said.Her death just over six weeks before Election Day is likely to set off a heated battle over whether President Donald Trump should nominate, and the Republican-led Senate should confirm, her replacement, or if the seat should remain vacant until the outcome of his race against Democrat Joe Biden is known.Judge agrees to delay US government restrictions on WeChatFILE - Icons for the smartphone apps TikTok and WeChat are seen on a smartphone screen in Beijing, in a Friday, Aug. 7, 2020 file photo. The Commerce Department said President Trump's proposed ban of the apps WeChat and TikTok will go into effect Sunday, Sept. 20, to "safeguard the national security of the United States." The government said its order, previously announced by Trump in August, will "combat China's malicious collection of American citizens' personal data." (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, File)A judge has approved a request from a group of U.S. WeChat users to delay looming federal government restrictions that could effectively make the popular app nearly impossible to use.In a ruling dated Saturday, Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler of California said the government's actions would affect users' First Amendment rights, as an effective ban on the app would remove their platform for communication. Early on Monday, WeChat was still available for download at Apple and Android app stores.The Trump administration has targeted WeChat and another Chinese-owned app, TikTok, for national security and data privacy concerns, in the latest flashpoint amid rising tensions between Washington and Beijing. The administration contends that the data of U.S. users collected by the two apps could be shared with the Chinese government.On Saturday, President Donald Trump said he supported a proposed deal that would have TikTok partner with Oracle and Walmart to form a U.S. company. There is still a chance that TikTok could be banned in the U.S. as of Nov. 12 if the deal isn't completed, under the restrictions put in place by the Commerce Department.Utah officer charged with assault after dog bites Black manFILE - In this on Aug. 5, 2020, file photo, Jeffery Ryans points at his ankle as he discusses his encounter with Salt Lake City police at his attorney's office, in Salt Lake City.

The Salt Lake County district attorney's office said Ryans complied with officers' orders to raise his hands and remain in the backyard.K9 officer Nickolas Pearce then told Ryans to get on the ground before kicking him in the leg, forcing him to his knees, and ordering the dog to bite Ryans, prosecutors said.In body camera footage, Pearce can be heard repeatedly praising the animal and saying "good boy" while it latched onto Ryans' left leg for about 20 seconds as he was being put in handcuffs.Water shortages in US West likelier than previously thoughtFILE - In this July 20, 2014 file photo, a bathtub ring of light minerals shows the high water line near Hoover Dam on Lake Mead at the Lake Mead National Recreation Area in Nevada. Six states in the U.S. West that rely on the Colorado River to sustain cities and farms rebuked a plan to build an underground pipeline that would transport billions of gallons of water through the desert to southwest Utah. In a joint letter Tuesday, Sept. 8, 2020, water officials from Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Wyoming urged the U.S. government to halt the approval process for the project, which would bring water 140 miles (225 km) from Lake Powell in northern Arizona to the growing area surrounding St. George, Utah. (AP Photo/John Locher,File)There's a chance water levels in the two largest man-made reservoirs in the United States could dip to critically low levels by 2025, jeopardizing the steady flow of Colorado River water that more than 40 million people rely on in the American West.After a relatively dry summer, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation released models on Tuesday suggesting looming shortages in Lake Powell and Lake Mead - the reservoirs where Colorado River water is stored - are more likely than previously projected.Compared with an average year, only 55% of Colorado River water is flowing from the Rocky Mountains down to Lake Powell on the Utah-Arizona line. Due to the below-average runoff, government scientists say the reservoirs are 12% more likely to fall to critically low levels by 2025 than they projected in the spring.Load-Date: September 21, 2020End of Document

US ISSUES HONG KONG TRAVEL WARNING LINKED TO NATIONAL SECURITY LAWStates News ServiceSeptember 16, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 760 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The U.S. State Department has warned Americans that they should reconsider any travel plans to Hong Kong in the wake of a draconian national security law imposed on the city by Beijing, citing a risk of arbitrary arrest on vaguely-defined offenses under the law."Since the imposition of national security legislation on July 1, [China] unilaterally and arbitrarily exercises police and security power in Hong Kong," the State Department said in updated travel advice on its official website.It said the ruling Chinese Communist Party has a "broad range of activities" it defines as separatist, subversive, terrorist, and as collusion with foreign powers.The National Security Law for Hong Kong also applies to words and actions by non-residents of Hong Kong anywhere in the world, it warned."[This] could subject U.S. citizens who have been publicly critical of [China] to a heightened risk of arrest, detention, expulsion, or prosecution," the advisory warned."[Chinese] security forces, including the new Office for Safeguarding National Security, now operate in Hong Kong," it said.The advisory also warns U.S. citizens in Hong Kong to avoid demonstrations, as perceived participation can also be deemed an act of separatism, subversion, terrorism, or collusion with a foreign power under the new law."On July 1, 2020, as part of its color-coded system of warning flags, the Hong Kong police unveiled a new purple flag, which warns protesters that shouting slogans or carrying banners with an intent prohibited by the law could now bring criminal charges," it said.The new advisory on Hong Kong brings it into line with current advice on travel to mainland China, which the State Department said "arbitrarily enforces local laws, including by carrying out arbitrary and wrongful detentions and through the use of exit bans on U.S. citizens and citizens of other countries without due process of law."It said U.S. citizens traveling or residing in mainland China or Hong Kong could be detained without access to U.S. consular services or information about their alleged crime.They could also be subjected to prolonged interrogations and extended detention without due process of law, the advisory warned."Security personnel may detain and/or deport U.S. citizens for sending private electronic messages critical of the [Chinese] government," it said.The advisory came as news emerged that key figures in Hong Kong's democracy movement have fled overseas.Fears for safetyPro-democracy activist Sunny Cheung, 24, said he left Hong Kong in August after beginning to fear for his safety."As the situation between the US and China began to heat up, a pattern of hostage diplomacy [by China] started to emerge," Cheung said from the U.K., via his Facebook page. "I was being followed more frequently, and my partner and family were being constantly harassed.""I felt the situation was escalating and so I took the advice of many and left Hong Kong unwillingly in August due to safety concerns," Cheung wrote.Cheung was among two dozen Hong Kong pro-democracy activists prosecuted for participating in an "illegal assembly" on the anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre on June 4, 2020, the first time the candlelight vigil was banned in Hong Kong since the 1997 handover to Chinese rule.Twenty-six activists face charges linked to the event, including 2014 student leader Joshua Wong, media tycoon Jimmy Lai, and Nathan Law, who has also left Hong Kong due to the national security law.Lee Cheuk-yan, who organizes the annual vigil in Hong Kong and is among those facing charges, told journalists that the court had recorded Law's departure from the city as being on June 27, before the summons was issued.Lee said there was no crime in attending the vigil."It's ridiculous," he said. "It seems that the powers-that-be in Hong Kong have decided that we are all supposed to know this. Well, we didn't.""It is not a crime to mourn. Is it likely that tens of thousands of people would all stand there holding a candle in the full knowledge that they were breaking the law?"The defendants -- barring Cheung and Law -- appeared in West Kowloon Court on Tuesday, charged with organizing, inciting others to join, or taking part in an illegal assembly at Victoria Park, where thousands of people defied a police ban on public gatherings to commemorate those who died in 1989.The case has been adjourned until Oct. 15.Reported by Lau Siu-fung for RFA's Cantonese Service.

A judge temporarily blocks Trump's ban on downloading TikTok in the USCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 28, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 881 wordsBodyFederal Judge Carl Nichols finally accepted TikTok's request in a preliminary order at the end of Sunday, temporarily blocking the Commerce Department's ban on further downloads of the app from taking effect at midnight as planned.Previously, during sunday morning's hearing, the government argued that measures to ban TikTok downloads respond to fears that the app might send data to Chinese authorities. Daniel Schwei, a lawyer for the Department of Justice, insisted that TikTok's "First Amendment Rights (in reference to the U.S. Constitution) are not affected" by that ban.For their part, TikTok's lawyers called the ban on downloads "irrational and unprecedented." In this way they justified that withdrawing the application of digital platforms weeks before the election and at a time of greater isolation due to the pandemic would violate the rights of potential new TikTok users. John Hall, legal representative of the popular app, compared the ban to the "closure of a public forum."It should be remembered that last Wednesday, TikTok filed a preliminary court order against the Trump Administration. This legal maneuver aimed to protect its services in the US from a possible ban. The application, filed in a District of Columbia Court, thus countered regulations issued by the Department of Commerce that set a ban on TikTok downloads by midnight on September 27.TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, stated in her lawsuit that even a temporary ban would "inflict devastating and irreparable damage" on her service. "Until the administration's intervention, TikTok was one of the fastest growing applications in the US and its rapid growth is necessary to maintain its competitive position in the market," the company argued.The app has approximately 100 million users on this side of the Atlantic and 700 million worldwide, making it one of the world's leading social networks. TikTok stressed that a ban would not only lead to lost revenue, but would also inflict extraordinary damage on the reputation and goodwill of the application. At the same time, on Saturday, Eastern District Pennsylvania Court Judge Wendy Beetlestone rejected three TikTok content creators' request to temporarily block the ban on downloading the app. Douglas Marland, Cosette Rinab and Alec Chambers argued in their petition that they "make a living from the content they post on TikTok" and explained that the platform's "For You" page is unique among social media platforms, because its algorithm allows "little-known creators to display their content to a large audience." Marland has 2.7 million subscribers, Rinab about 2.3 million and Chambers another 1.8 million.The magistrate explained in her decision that although the ban would "undoubtedly be inconvenient", the three plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that they would suffer "immediate and irreparable harm" if the downloads were prohibited. After all, it became clear that the application would remain operational for current subscribers, at least for the time being. "They will still be able to create, publish, and share content for their millions of current followers," she wrote in her final opinion.For now, ByteDance confirmed thursday that it has officially submitted its agreement to the Chinese authorities to partner with Oracle and Walmart to create a new US-based company, named TikTok Global. TheChinese company requires a license after Beijing recently imposed new technology export legislation and will need the Chinese government to welcome it before moving forward with the plan announced the previous week. This situation does not provide clarity to an agreement in which the terms remain disparate, especially as regards who will control TikTok Global. ByteDance insists that you will have 80% of the new entity. Americans say they'll control a majority stake. Oracle and Walmart will own only 20% of TikTik Global but it is true that U.S. venture capitalists such as General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital already own 41% of ByteDance.Depending on how you want to calculate the resulting percentages both sides can defend a control of more than 50% of TikTok Global, which has a value of approximately $60 billion and is expected to go on the stock exchange in the coming year if the deal survives.Another important question is who will control TikTok technology. Beijing has prevented ByteDance's algorithms from forming part of the sale. Members of the U.S. National Security Council want to ensure not only that U.S. user data is protected on U.S. Oracle servers but also that no data is diverted and that the algorithm is not used to disseminate misinformation or influence trends. The source code is expected to remain in China, but Oracle will have access to it. The functioning of this relationship is still unknown.That's why the deal's still in the air. U.S. Attorney General William Barr and other senior White House officials have not yet approved it and are wary of curbing risks to national security, even though President Donald Trump offered interim support that he subsequently questioned. This shows how even within the US government there are factions confronted with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as the main supporter of the agreement.commentsforum0WhatsApp  Facebook  Twitter  Linkedin       Load-Date: September 29, 2020End of Document

Banning apps like TikTok and WeChat is a good way to ensure a country will trail in tech leadership and profitsThe Conversation - United StatesSeptember 16, 2020 Wednesday 11:22 AM ESTCopyright 2020 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights ReservedLength: 942 wordsByline: Huatong Sun, Associate Professor of Digital Media & Global Design, University of WashingtonHighlight: Despite efforts to wall off regional or national internets, social media companies will have to continue aggressively competing across borders if they are to grow.BodyThe Trump administration's decision to force the sale of TikTok to a U.S. buyer is, to many, the latest sign the global internet is splintering into national and regional blocs. This has been a concern for several years now, as authoritarian countries such as Russia, China and Iran erect walls around their cyberspace, and democracies like the U.S., India and the European Union cite national security when blocking specific foreign companies like ByteDance's TikTok and Tencent's WeChat. The reality, however, is a lot more complicated - at least when it comes to social media companies. I study global media design and the localization of technology. My research suggests that while social media users are indeed splintering regionally and nationally, the companies themselves are becoming more globally intertwined than ever. This means countries that try to restrict apps with bans and the like will end up hurting companies based within their borders as well. More users, more moneySocial media companies have little choice but to behave globally - something clear from their massive number of users. Facebook, for example, had 2.7 billion monthly active users at the end of June - representing more than a third of the world population - and only about 10% of them are in the U.S. WhatsApp had 2 billion, while WeChat and Instagram are at about 1.2 billion and 1 billion, respectively. Most social media apps are quickly translated and released in dozens of languages early on in their life spans. Tinder, Uber and Pinterest are all available in over 30 languages, while Airbnb can boast over 50.Social media technology is inherently global because of a concept known as network effects. While the costs of running a social network increase with growth at a fairly constant rate, the profits jump exponentially with each additional user. It's a simple equation. More users, a lot more revenue, a lot more profits. And most of this explosive growth is in overseas - not local - markets. Cutthroat competitionSocial media companies that don't compete globally and continue to find new users will fall behind.That's one lesson from a case study involving four leading messaging apps I examined in my recent book, "Global Social Media Design." WhatsApp, founded in 2009, was the first in this space and quickly inspired similar offerings in other countries, such as WeChat in China, LINE in Japan and KakaoTalk in South Korea. In its early days, WhatsApp had a strong position in Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, but its failure to innovate in voice messaging left an opening for WeChat, which launched a hold-to-talk feature in 2011 - two years before WhatsApp unveiled a similar feature - and quickly snared a big share of the market. And when WhatsApp finally launched its own push-to-talk voice memo feature, it helped it become one of the top social media apps in Argentina.  This proves companies need to constantly innovate and learn from one another to expand - and to avoid losing market share to rivals. This is possible by competing in as many countries as they can.Companies also invest in their global competitors to help them get ahead. China-based Tencent, for example, invested in WeChat rival Kakao, becoming one of its largest shareholders in 2012, with a 13% stake. And early this year Facebook invested $5.7 billion in Jio Platforms, an Indian ecommerce platform, to enhance its digital payment feature on WhatsApp. [Expertise in your inbox.

TikTok has managed to quickly amass 100 million mostly young users in the U.S. because of how skilled it is at recommending videos on its "for you" page. The Chinese government reinforced this fact when it threw a wrench into efforts for a U.S. company to buy TikTok by adding personalized content recommendation algorithms to its list of export-controlled products. This meant that TikTok's most valuable tool couldn't be sold with the company without government approval. While Silicon Valley excels in artificial intelligence-powered algorithms, the U.S. as a market lacks the massive quantities of users and data needed to test and refine those algorithms. China, on the other hand, has served as a testing ground to perfect TikTok's algorithm because of its large population and loose government guidance over user privacy as of now. To compete with rivals in China, India and elsewhere in the future, U.S. social media companies need access to more users and more data - which they are less likely to get if other countries put up barriers to entry in response to President Donald Trump's ban on TikTok and WeChat over their Chinese ownership. Even Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook - a company that would certainly benefit if TikTok's U.S. operations foundered - recently warned in an employee meeting that Trump's effort to ban TikTok would set "a really bad long-term precedent" - despite some short-term gains for the social network. Facebook and other Silicon Valley companies pioneered the social media world. They could lose out on social media's future if other countries decide to retaliate with bans of their own.Huatong Sun does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.Load-Date: September 16, 2020End of Document

Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights Issues Public Comment on Citizenship & Immigration Services Proposed RuleTargeted News ServiceOctober 22, 2020 Thursday 3:43 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4496 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, Oct. 22 -- Mary Miller Flowers, senior policy analyst for child protection, and Robert Cotter, policy analyst, at the Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights, Chicago, Illinois, have issued a public comment on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services proposed rule entitled "30 Day Comments Closed On 10/13/2020; 60-Day IC Comments Close On 11/10/2020. Collection and Use of Biometrics". The comment was written on Oct. 13, 2020, and posted on Oct. 15, 2020:* * *The Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights (Young Center) writes in opposition to the above-referenced proposed rule entitled "Collection and Use of Biometrics by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services," published September 11, 2020, by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services./1The Young Center serves as the federally-appointed, best interests guardian ad litem (Child Advocate) for trafficking victims and other vulnerable unaccompanied children in government custody as authorized by the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA)./2The Young Center is the only organization authorized by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to serve in that capacity. The role of the Child Advocate is to advocate for the best interests of the child. A child's best interests are determined by considering the child's safety, expressed wishes, right to family integrity, liberty, developmental needs, and identity. Since 2004, ORR has appointed Young Center Child Advocates for thousands of unaccompanied children in ORR custodyThe Young Center opposes the proposed rule, which requires the collection of an unprecedented amount of biometric data from immigrant children and their families. The proposed changes are both complex and invasive and violate the privacy rights of children. DHS has not adequately explained why there is a need for this broad expansion of biometric data collection, nor has it made any notable attempt to outline what steps would be taken to protect this data, delineate clearly when and who could have access to children's biometric information, or provide a timeframe for when such data would be destroyed.Given the sweeping changes proposed in the rule, a 60-day comment period for the public would have been appropriate to fully address its impact on immigrant children and their families. The rule is 85 pages in length, dramatically expands who will be subjected to biometrics collection, how long and how frequently the government could demand their information, and what type of information the government can collect about them. Due to the shortened comment period, we have not been able to cover every topic in the proposed rule. With this comment we seek to highlight some of the provisions that would have the most significant, negative impact on the rights of children. DHS should immediately withdraw the proposed rule and instead dedicate its efforts to ensuring that there is a robust system of protection for immigrant children which relies on the expertise and experience of professionals trained in child welfare, development and health to make sound decisions that are in children's best interests.I. The Unnecessary and Invasive Expansion of Biometric Data Collection Infringes Upon Privacy Rights and Empowers Unprecedented Surveillance of Children and their FamiliesA. The proposed rule dramatically increases the number of children subjected to expanded biometric collectionThe proposed rule, if implemented, would significantly infringe upon the privacy rights of children and their family members, subjecting them to unlawful and unnecessary surveillance. First, the proposed rule expands the definition of "biometrics" and the scope of biometric information to be collected. Under the new definition, DHS will collect iris scans, facial images, palm prints, and, in some cases, DNA test results, including partial DNA samples./3At present, Customs and Border Protection only collects fingerprints and photographs of children who are age 14 and older. The proposed rule would allow collection of biometric data regardless of age when issuing Notices to Appear (NTAs). According to the government's own estimates, these changes could lead to the collection of data from 63,000 additional children in a single year./4This number, which is already a dramatic expansion of the collection and storage of children's data, does not include the additional expansion of biometric data collection on a dozen or so forms in which collection is not currently routine.Immigrant children arrive at our borders after fleeing persecution, trafficking, abuse, and other violent and traumatic events--in many cases at the hands of or by the acquiescence of law enforcement officials. Under the proposed rule, after arriving at our border the children will be subjected to processes including fingerprinting, scans, swabs, and even blood samples, most of which would be gathered by a law enforcement agency. Children are likely to be appropriately concerned, intimidated, scared and even traumatized by these processes, especially if they are alone or have been separated from trusted adults. We therefore anticipate that children will be adversely affected by a process that to the best of our knowledge remains entirely unnecessary.B. Personal data about children is particularly sensitive and should be subject to additional protections, especially when children face challenges understanding and consenting to the collection and use of their personal informationThe need for privacy and the protection of personal data, especially in the case of children, is highly complex and controversial. It requires scrutiny and proper advance planning, none of which is evidenced in the proposed rule. Confidentiality provisions ensure that children should not have to share highly personal information to receive help or services./5Protections for children's confidential information are already enshrined in many state and federal laws across a range of issues. For instance, in California, all children, whether citizen or non-citizen, are entitled to the protection of any information or files arising out of dependency and delinquency proceedings; these cannot be disclosed to federal officials, including immigration officials, without the juvenile court's permission./6At the federal level there are strong protections for children's information in educational and child welfare settings. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) prohibits schools from disclosing almost any personally identifiable information (e.g., name, student identification number, social security number, date of birth, address, etc.) "if it can be used by a reasonable person in the school community to identify the student."/7FERPA further requires schools to give parents and students age 18 or older the opportunity to review the information contained in a student's records so that any errors can be corrected./8Privacy risks are also well understood in the child welfare context. Under federal law, states are required to closely guard the privacy and confidentiality of a range of information, including all child abuse and neglect reports, as well as records that include critical identifying information about the child, the child's family, conditions in the home, and medical records. Disclosure of this information is limited to a narrow class of circumstances./9The proposed rule offers no such protections. Yet the "privacy risks that accompany biometrics databases are extreme," particularly when databases are "multimodal," or store several different biometric identifiers; unlike an ID number or a pin code, biometrics are unique to each person and cannot generally be changed./10DHS itself confirms that children and adults required to submit biometrics under the proposed rule "could possibly be apprehensive about doing so and may be have concerns germane to privacy, intrusiveness, and security," but the agency fails to address how it would address those concerns anywhere in the proposed rule./11Nor it does not acknowledge that children cannot always provide informed consent for these invasive procedures, or their rights of their parents or legal guardians to provide informed consent. DHS plans to store this information indefinitely and subject people to "continuous immigration vetting."/12The proposed rule lacks a right to refuse biometric data collection without establishing a specialized and in-depth protection for gathering, maintaining, distributing, or destroying this information. As a result, we believe that taking this information from children, with the potential of lifelong consequences, is not in a child's best interests./13C. The accuracy of biometric data varies substantially, especially for children, which can lead to misidentificationUnaddressed concerns about the accuracy of biometric data for children is yet another reason to rescind the proposed rule. A child's age can affect the accuracy of biometric data. Fingerprints, palm scans, and even iris scans taken at a young age can be notably different than those taken of the same child years later. This can impact the accuracy of matching children to images that have been in a database for some time./14Inaccuracies can generate questions about age and identity that can disproportionately harm children seeking protection from persecution, trafficking, or abuse. If a law enforcement agency such as DHS incorrectly believes the child to be someone other than who the child is claiming to be, they could designate the child as lacking credibility, which could impact the child's ability to seek protection through an immigration benefit. Yet some of the technology specifically proposed in the rule, such as the use of facial recognition technology, has already been proven to be inaccurate and has been used in a discriminatory manner, including against children of color./15By proposing to remove all age limitations on restrictions on biometric collection, the rule places children at a heightened risk of being misidentified in ways that could increase their contact with law enforcement in the U.S. unnecessarily, and also result in their unsafe repatriation.D. Mass biometric data collection could violate children's rights to equality and non-discriminationDHS's primary objective in expanding biometric data collection to children under 14 is to allow the agency to link a child's records with later adult records, offering the agency an unprecedented level of surveillance of immigrant communities. The rule implies that immigrant populations, including immigrant children, are inherently suspect and therefore must be tracked, all but equating immigration with criminal conduct. This is an unacceptably false and unsubstantiated position, likely based on a reliance on stereotypes, implicit bias and racial animus. As written, the proposed rule paves the way for a regime of mass biometrics collection without justifying why its current practice of collecting photographs and fingerprints is insufficient to address legitimate law enforcement purposes.DHS has proposed a regime that will give it unfettered access to children's biometric data years into the future, without explaining how that information will be used or protected. Changes in politics, data breaches or new technologies could mean that biometric data is used for more purposes than is currently possible./16It is not hard to imagine a scenario in which the application of biometric technologies is expanded to facilitate profiling and discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion or other identifying characteristics./17As a 2020 United Nations (UN) report noted, "technology is never neutral - it reflects the values and interests of those who influence its design and use, and is fundamentally shaped by the same structures of inequality that operate in society."/18The UN report found that emerging digital technologies exacerbate and compound existing inequities, many of which exist along racial, ethnic and national origin grounds. Given this administration's numerous attacks on immigrant children, the rule gives DHS the information it needs to explicitly discriminate against them and their families for purposes that are insufficiently justified in the proposed rule.II. DHS fails to justify why systematic DNA testing for verification of family relationships is necessary or appropriate given the risks to childrenA. The government's data on the number of "Fraudulent Families" is inconclusive and misleadingDHS argues that expanded biometric data collection, including DNA testing, will assist with identifying so called "fraudulent families" in which an adult crosses the border with an unrelated child to gain immigration benefits. In the proposed rule, DHS states: "Beginning in July 2019 DHS has been conducting a small-scale pilot program where, with consent from individuals presenting themselves as family units, officers use Rapid DNA testing technologies as a precise and focused investigative tool to identify suspected fraudulent families and vulnerable children who may be potentially exploited. Between July 1, 2019 and November 7, 2019, DHS encountered 1747 self-identified family units with indicators of fraud who were referred for additional screening. Of this number, DHS identified 432 incidents of fraudulent family claims."/19This data is misleading and incomplete. We do not know the total number of families in the pilot program, and therefore can in no way ascertain the incidence of fraud. All we know from this data is that out of the 1747 families with indicators of fraud (emphasis added), about 25 percent had DNA mismatches. DNA mismatches do not constitute evidence of fraud; we have no information about how many of these families may have been formed through adoption or traditional caregiving relationships. Nor does this number account for any errors in administering or reading the tests. This small and inconclusive data set is highly inadequate to justify the expansion of DNA testing proposed in the rule.In our experience as Child Advocate, many families arriving at the border share caregiving and parental responsibilities in ways that are different than what might be expected by U.S. policymakers. We have been appointed to many hundreds of children whose grandparents, older siblings, or aunts, uncles and cousins act in loco parentis. Those children consider these adults to be their primary caregiver--their most trusted adults. Children's assessment of their relationships with trusted adults should be respected and valued--not assumed to be "fraudulent" and therefore a basis for the agency to engage in invasive, biometric data collection./20DHS fails to justify why it should have unfettered discretion to require invasive DNA collection and testing to prove family relationships when less invasive means--such as birth certificates or other documents--would suffice in almost all instances and where further, non-invasive inquiries could identify possible trafficking relationships. Moreover, despite citing efforts to "combat child trafficking" as a primary justification for its broad expansion of invasive data collection, DHS has routinely deported trafficking victims with pending visas applications for protection./21Rather than expanding DNA collection, the administration should rely on the expertise of child welfare professionals in making decisions related to the verification of family relationships. To date, DHS has refused to seek out experts who could evaluate the risk that children at the border were in the custody of traffickers or unrelated adults. Instead, Customs and Border Protection officers with no training in child welfare and child development separate families largely at their discretion. Moreover, if the administration was serious about reducing incidents of child trafficking, it would not have suspended protections outlined in the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) for children arriving at the U.S. southern border as it has done during the COVID-19 pandemic.B. DNA testing and Rapid DNA testing are subject to errors and inaccuraciesThe proposed rule would authorize DHS to use Rapid DNA testing, when available, to verify biological parent-child relationships as a part of assessing eligibility for immigration benefits.The rule states, "Rapid DNA testing technology [is] a precise and focused investigative tool to identify suspected fraudulent families and vulnerable children who may be potentially exploited."/22Experts do not agree, however, that Rapid DNA testing provides results of biological relationships, so as to identify possible trafficking scenarios./23As a result, Rapid DNA could lead to a significant increase in separation of families. All DNA testing, whether rapid or not, has inherent limitations and risks, including the risk of false positives or negatives./24The reality of human error in administering tests and the potential for genetic abnormalities among related people can lead to further inaccuracies./25While DNA testing can be useful for demonstrating genetic relationships, it is not fool proof. Given the invasive nature of DNA testing, the range of alternative methods to determine legitimate family relationships, and DHS's failure to outline how it will manage and protect this sensitive data, any requirement to submit to DNA testing to prove eligibility for immigration benefits should be removed.III. Removing the assumption of "good moral character" for T applicants under the age of 14 is cruel and out of step with our national valuesT non-immigrant status ("T status") is designed to offer survivors of a severe form of trafficking or attempted trafficking humanitarian immigration relief. Ignoring that purpose, the proposed rule would require applicants for T status, including children and regardless of age, to submit to invasive biometrics collection in order to establish "good moral character." Most cruelly, the proposed rule would remove the presumption of good moral character for T status applicants under the age of 14. Instead, DHS would use biometrics to "obtain the self-petitioner's criminal history."/26The rule presumes some sort of underlying criminal activity or intent--including for child survivors of trafficking.Most children in a situation of trafficking or abuse are not able to challenge those exploiting them and may be forced into illegal or "immoral" acts--such as being trafficked for purposes of sex or labor. Children who have survived trafficking are often afraid to speak up about abuse they have suffered, have few opportunities to access trusted adults, or may be unaware that their situation is abusive due to manipulation and grooming.A Young Center Child Advocate was appointed to a teenager not long after her traffickers were arrested by U.S. law enforcement. The child had been trafficked for sex on both sides of the border for many months, after intensive grooming by members of a trafficking cartel. Over time, it became clear to her Child Advocate that the young teen had formed a trauma bond with her trafficker: she did not see herself as a trafficking survivor and considered her trafficker to be her boyfriend, despite his actions. The Child Advocate worked patiently with the child--and the child's family, who had been threatened by the cartel in home country--until she decided that returning to her trafficker would not be safe. Today she is a healthy young adult, with the right to remain permanently in the United States. Under the proposed rule, however, she could have been denied the protection of T non-immigrant status if law enforcement officials decided that she was insufficiently cooperative in their criminal case, or if they believed that she lacked "good moral character" because she'd been forced into prostitution as a child. Denial of her T status would have meant returning a child trafficking survivor to the very community where she was trafficked.By removing the assumption of "good moral character" for children under 14, the proposed rule implies that all children knowingly or willingly participate in criminal or immoral activity. In addition to being in a situation of exploitation, children are developmentally different from adults. Given their maturity, vulnerability, and trauma history we must first see child trafficking survivors as children in need of protection, and any criminal history they may have must be understood through this lens. The very notion that children should have to prove their good moral character contradicts our history as a nation that offers protection and care to victims, particularly children.IV. ConclusionThe Young Center opposes the adoption of any rule that would add to the already significant barriers that children must overcome to seek protection in the United States. Instead of improving children's safety, the proposed rule would potentially expose them to greater risk, further traumatization, or possible family separation. Subjecting children under 14 to an invasive biometrics requirement raises serious concerns regarding children's rights to privacy and confidentiality. The proposed rule also furthers the administration's narrative that immigrant children are inherently dangerous and creates a scenario in which children and their loved ones will have their private biometric data stored in government databases for years to come without a legitimate justification to do so. For these reasons, we urge the agency to rescind the proposed rule.Sincerely,Mary Miller Flowers, Senior Policy Analyst, Child ProtectionRobert Cotter, Policy Analyst* * *Footnotes:1/ See Federal Regulation No. 177, Vol. 85 at 56338 - 56422.2/ William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2008, 8 U.S.C.A.

SPRINGER NATURE JOURNAL REJECTS ARTICLE BY TAIWAN DOCTOR OVER COUNTRY NAMEStates News ServiceSeptember 1, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1133 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Top academic publisher Springer Nature has once more sparked concerns over its censorship of topics regarded as politically sensitive by Beijing.A Taiwanese doctor, Wu Jo-hsuan, recently reported via Facebook that she had been asked by the editorial team at Eye and Vision, a medical journal published by the group, to add the word "China" after "Taiwan" in her paper, or have her article rejected for publication.Editors at Eye and Vision wrote to Wu telling her that the change was required under the journal's editorial policies.Wu is the first author of the paper on retinopathy with her mentor at National Taiwan University, and said she was shocked by the level of political censorship she encountered.She told RFA in a recent interview that she and her colleague have now decided to find another publisher."We're not planning to get back to them," she said. "We thought we'd look for another journal that is a bit more friendly."Catherine Chou, assistant professor of history at Grinnell College, said such problems aren't uncommon for academics from Taiwan, a democratic island that has never been ruled by the Chinese Communist Party, nor formed part of the People's Republic of China."This highlights the plight of Taiwanese scholars, who are forced to make choices in their professional careers between an honest account of their national identity and academic opportunities," Chou told RFA.RFA contacted Springer Nature to ask whether there are indeed editorial restrictions on the use of "Taiwan" as a nationality for an author.In a written reply dated Aug. 25, the publisher said it wouldn't put pressure on authors to change the name of their country of origin.It said the policy stemmed instead from Eye and Vision, which it publishes in partnership with Wenzhou Medical University in China, and operates under a separate set of editorial guidelines.Springer Nature said its relationship with Eye and Vision was simply that of "co-publisher."Springer Nature is the world's largest academic publisher, publishing more than 3,000 journals including Nature and the Scientific American.Politically sensitive articles blockedHowever, this isn't the first time that the publisher has been linked to Chinese censorship.In November 2017, Springer Nature confirmed that it had blocked access to some 1,000 journal articles to Chinese internet users because they contained banned keywords relating to political topics such as Tibet, Taiwan, or the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).Requests to Eye and Vision and the eye hospital linked to the Wenzhou Medical University for comment had met with no response by the time of writing.The eye hospital's official website describes Eye and Vision as "an international English-language journal under the aegis of Wenzhou Medical University."Launched in October 2014, it is edited by Qu Jia, director of the eye hospital, and receives funding from the ruling Chinese Communist Party to boost China's international influence.The program is jointly implemented by the government-backed Chinese Association for Science and Technology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Engineering, as well as the ministries of finance and education, and the state media regulator -- the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT).The initiative is part of a long-running policy under Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping to "take Chinese technology and culture global."In November 2019, France-based scientific publisher EDP Sciences was acquired by a holding company under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China Science Publishing and Media, or Science Press.State news agency Xinhua reported at the time that this was "an important step in China Science's internationalization strategy."Wen Liu, assistant research fellow at the Institute of Ethnology, Academia Sinica, said China's acquisition of such publishers is a serious threat to international academic freedom."China's overseas acquisitions program targeting international academic journals, as well as its censorship of researchers' institutional identities and the content of papers is a serious violation of the principle of academic freedom," Liu told RFA.She said she was also asked in August 2020 not to include the word "Taiwan" in her byline in a psychology paper for a SAGE journal.She said her two authors from the United States and South Africa experienced no such restriction.Austin Wang, assistant professor of political science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said some Taiwanese scholars have had their country of origin changed to "China" or editorial changes suggested that describe Taiwan as a "province of China.""Sometimes you can appeal to the editor to reject the proposed modification, but sometimes you get rejected by the journal because of this," Wang told RFA."This is quite common, so complaints need to be loud enough to force journals to change," he said.Controlling the global narrativeJessica Drun, a guest researcher at the Washington think tank Project 2049 Institute, said China's censorship of Taiwan scholars also relates to Beijing's policy of extending its official narratives far beyond its borders."This isn't just about Taiwan, but also China's attempt to control the global narrative and shape it into a view that is more in line with the interests of the Chinese Communist Party," Drun said.She said China's growing influence at the World Health Organization (WHO) was also a case in point.People working in all fields should be aware that the price of Chinese political censorship entering the scientific domain doesn't just stop Taiwanese academics from making a contribution: it runs counter to global public health interests, she warned.Taiwan was ruled as a Japanese colony in the 50 years prior to the end of World War II, before being occupied by the Kuomintang (KMT)'s 1911 Republic of China as part of Tokyo's post-war reparation deal with the allies. It remains a sovereign state using the name Republic of China.The island began a transition to democracy following the death of President Chiang Ching-kuo in January 1988, starting with direct elections to the legislature in the early 1990s and culminating in the first direct election of a president, Lee Teng-hui, in 1996.Chinese leader Xi Jinping said in a Jan. 2, 2019 speech that Taiwan must be "unified" with China. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) echoed the sentiment in a military white paper later that year.But Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen has repeatedly responded that Taiwan's 23 million population have no wish to give up their sovereignty, or democratic way of life.Reported by Jane Tang for RFA's Mandarin Service.

WeChat and TikTok censor more content in THE US and other countriesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 8, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 633 wordsBodyThe most popular Chinese-owned social networks, such as WeChat or TikTok,are increasingly censoring content in the United States and elsewhere, shifting practices perfected for years behind the Great Chinese Firewall to an international audience. TikTok of ByteDance often burys or hides words that reflect political movements, gender and sexual orientation or religion in most of the countries where it operates, the Australian Institute of Strategic Policy said in a report published on Tuesday. Most of the content censored on WeChat supported pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, as well as messages from US and UK embassies regarding a new national security law enacted by Beijing in late June that has sparked protests across the city. TikTok, which began as a platform where teens synchronised their lips with music, has become a political protest forum,including the Black Lives Matter movement, said Fergus Ryan, one of the authors. LGBTQ+ tags were also deleted in several languages, according to the report. Other issues censored in the past included criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The findings could provide ammunition to Tencent's TrumpAdministration, which banned TikTok and WeChat, after accusing applications of yielding to Beijing's will by censoring content, which could influence November's election.While social media services like Facebook remove content like hate speech,Washington accuses services like TikTok of blocking content deemed sensitive to the Communist Party. WeChat has long complied with controls at the national level, while TikTok, which operates only outside China, has rejected claims that it is influenced by the Chinese government. "TikTok is a more edited experience where the platform has enormous power to decide what content to offer users," Ryan said. "Most of these tags are categorized in TikTok code in the same way as terrorist groups, illicit substances and swear words." A Tencent representative refused to comment, while a ByteDance spokesperson made no comment immediately when contacted. The Australian institute stated that TikTok claimed that some terms "were partially restricted due to relevant local laws." He also noted quotes from the service that "strongly supports our LGBTQ creators around the world, and prides itself on LGBTQ content being among the most popular category on the platform with billions of views." Washington's measures against TikTok and WeChat underscore how the concept of internet decoupling is becoming a reality. The TikTok and WeChat Administration ban comes into effect in mid-September, when both apps are likely to be removed from app stores, but may still be accessible to many U.S. users. WeChat can be a powerful vector in countries like the US, where the Chinese diaspora is considerable, because oftenis an important source of information for that population. But principles such as freedom of expression are not part of the core values of these applications, but are more likely to over-censure to align with the wishes of local government, according to the report. ByteDance now participates in sensitive conversations about an acquisition of TikTok in the US. Interested companies include Microsoft and Oracle and the agreement is estimated to reach more than $20 billion. But uncertainty surrounding the agreement intensified dramatically last week after China asserted its right to approve or block the sale of technology abroad,complicating an already complex process under white house scrutiny. The law highlighted how Beijing wants to retain some control over content moderation and considers ByteDance's algorithms to be a matter of state security," Ryan said. "The really important thing is the algorithm,"he said. "TikTok's algorithms are extremely sophisticated and powerful."Load-Date: September 9, 2020End of Document

ChinaAid Statement on Death Threats Against President and Founder Bob FuChristian NewswireOctober 7, 2020 Wednesday 11:11 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Christian Communication, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 420 wordsByline: By China Aid Association, Inc.BodyClick on Image for High ResolutionNEWS PROVIDED BYChina Aid AssociationOct. 7, 2020MIDLAND, Texas, Oct. 7, 2020 /Christian Newswire/ -- China Aid Association acknowledges and denounces the accusations and calls for violence against President and Founder, Pastor Bob Fu.On September 26, 2020, protesters arrived outside of Fu's house. He was out of town, but his wife and children were home. Since then, the number of protestors has continued to increase as well as the calls for violence. On Monday, October 5, it escalated when a bus of over 50 protesters showed up outside his home.While the identity and origins of the protestors are unknown at this time, they are listening to the instructions of one particular bad actor who is utilizing social media and the internet to place monetary rewards for violence against Pastor Fu.Local law enforcement and federal agencies have responded and are protecting the Fu family and ChinaAid staff. The investigation into the bounty and the man calling for it are ongoing.In response to the serious threats, Pastor Fu said, "I pray God uses this threat to expose the Chinese Communist's agenda to destroy Christianity. Americans in general and Christians specifically need to know what is really happening in China and now even here in the USA. Please pray for me and my family."After participating in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and becoming an underground house church pastor, Fu fled China with his wife in 1996 due to religious persecution by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Since then, he has become a leading dissident voice for democracy and religious freedom in China. The accusations of being a "fake pastor" or member of the CCP and taking money from the Chinese government are blatantly false and slanderous.The support from partner organizations like the Lantos Foundation, Family Research Council, and the City of Midland further show proof of the character and integrity of Pastor Fu and his work.As egregious and illegal as these death threats are, this will not stop nor will it distract from the work of ChinaAid as an international non-profit Christian human rights organization committed to promoting religious freedom and rule of law for all in China.

TikTok and WeChat downloads soar ahead of banCNN WireSeptember 20, 2020 Sunday 1:26 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 540 wordsDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  People in the United States rushed to download TikTok and WeChat after the Commerce Department announced plans to restrict access to both apps starting Sunday. The Trump administration's executive orders against the two Chinese-owned apps were set to take effect Sunday but restrictions impacting TikTok have been delayed at least one week. On Saturday, President Donald Trump said he approved a deal between TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, and Oracle.TikTok downloads rose 12% to 247,000 in the US on Friday, compared to Thursday, according to preliminary estimates from Sensor Tower, which tracks mobile apps. WeChat reached 10,000 installs on Friday, up 150% from the previous day. That's the most downloads the app has seen in a day since October 2019, according to Sensor Tower.WeChat's rank among all free iPhone apps in the US climbed to number 100 as of noon on Friday, up from number 1,385 in the early morning, Sensor Tower data showed. The firm said this is the first time WeChat has ranked in the top 500 so far this year. Many people rely on WeChat as the main way of keeping in touch with family and friends in China. Anyone who has already downloaded TikTok or WeChat will still be able to use the apps -- if they're already on their phone despite the restrictions. But at midnight between Sunday and Monday, WeChat is likely to vanish from US app stores, including those operated by Apple and Google.However, even if you downloaded the app on your phone prior to the deadline, you won't be able to receive security patches or other updates, which could cause outages or glitches within the app in the future. For months, the Trump administration has claimed that TikTok is a risk to national security because of its Chinese ownership. The administration has alleged its parent company ByteDance could be required to hand over TikTok's user data to the Chinese government, compromising the safety and privacy of US users. TikTok has repeatedly said that it stores data outside of China and that it would refuse any request by Beijing for data about US users. In a statement Friday, TikTok said that it disagreed with and was disappointed by the Trump administration's announcement. "Our community of 100 million US users love TikTok because it's a home for entertainment, self-expression, and connection," the company said, "and we're committed to protecting their privacy and safety as we continue working to bring joy to families and meaningful careers to those who create on our platform." Tencent, which owns WeChat, called the restrictions outlined by the Commerce Department "unfortunate.""Following the initial executive order on August 6 we have engaged in extensive discussions with the US government, and have put forward a comprehensive proposal to address its concerns," Tencent said in a statement Friday. "...(G)iven our desire to provide ongoing services to our users in the US -- for whom WeChat is an important communication tool -- we will continue to discuss with the government and other stakeholders in the US ways to achieve a long-term solution."CNN Business' Brian Fung contributed reportingTM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

DOD: Esper Says Artificial Intelligence Will Change the BattlefieldTargeted News ServiceSeptember 10, 2020 Thursday 9:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1015 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of Defense issued the following news on Sept. 9:One aspect of the return of great power competition is the race to develop artificial intelligence, Defense Secretary Dr. Mark T. Esper said at the virtual Joint Artificial Intelligence Center symposium.Artificial intelligence has the potential to change the battlefield, and the country that's first to field it will have enormous advantages over competitors, he told participants today."History informs us that those who are first to harness once-in-a-generation technologies often have a decisive advantage on the battlefield for years to come," the secretary said. "I experienced this firsthand during Operation Desert Storm, when the United States' military's smart bombs, stealth aircraft and satellite-enabled GPS helped decimate Iraqi forces and their Soviet equipment."Artificial intelligence has the potential to be even more far-reaching than those technologies. "Unlike advanced munitions or next-generation platforms, artificial intelligence is in a league of its own, with the potential to transform nearly every aspect of the battlefield, from the back office to the front lines," he said. "That is why we cannot afford to cede the high ground to revisionist powers intent on bending, breaking or reshaping international rules and norms in their favor -- to the collective detriment of others."Esper noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin said the nation that leads in AI will be the "ruler of the world," and Russia has increased investments in the technology. "His intent is to employ any possible advantage to expand Russia's influence and chip away at the sovereignty of others," Esper said.The Russians used a sophisticated and well-coordinated combination of unmanned aerial vehicles, cyberattacks, and artillery barrages to inflict severe damage on Ukrainian forces when they invaded that country. "Since then, Moscow has announced the development of AI-enabled autonomous systems across ground vehicles, aircraft, nuclear submarines and command and control," he said. "We expect them to deploy these capabilities in future combat zones.""These principles make clear to the American people -- and the world -- that the United States will once again lead the way in the responsible development and application of emerging technologies, reinforcing our role as the global security partner of choice."- Defense Secretary Dr. Mark T. EsperThe Chinese Communist Party has a goal of being the AI world leader in 10 years. The People's Liberation Army sees AI as a leap-frog technology that will allow the largest military on Earth to field low-cost, long-range autonomous vehicles and systems to counter America's conventional power projection. "At this moment, Chinese weapons manufacturers are selling autonomous drones they claim can conduct lethal, targeted strikes," the secretary said. "Meanwhile, the Chinese government is advancing the development of next-generation stealth UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicle], which they are preparing to export internationally.""Beijing is constructing a 21st-century surveillance state designed to wield unprecedented control over its own people," Esper said. "With hundreds of millions of cameras strategically located across the country and billions of data points generated by the Chinese Internet of Things, the CCP will soon be able to identify almost anyone entering a public space, and censor dissent in real time."The Chinese system can be used to invade private lives, leaving no text message, internet search, purchase or personal activity free from Beijing's ever tightening grip, the secretary said. "As we speak, the PRC is deploying -- and honing -- its AI surveillance apparatus to support the targeted repression of its Muslim Uighur population," he said. "Likewise, pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong are being identified, seized, imprisoned or worse by the CCP's digital police state -- unencumbered by privacy laws or ethical governing principles. As China scales this technology, we fully expect it to sell these capabilities abroad, enabling other autocratic governments to move toward a new era of digital authoritarianism."The U.S. is pioneering a vision for the emerging technology that protects the U.S. Constitution and the rights of all Americans. U.S. officials would like to see allies and partners adopt the standards of individual liberty, democracy, human rights and respect for the rule of law."We approach AI as we have other high-tech breakthroughs throughout our department's history -- with rigorous standards for testing and fielding capabilities and the highest ethical expectations," Esper said. "Technology may constantly change, but our commitment to our core values does not."Earlier this year, DOD adopted ethical principles for the use of AI-based on core values, such as transparency, reliability and governability. "These principles make clear to the American people -- and the world -- that the United States will once again lead the way in the responsible development and application of emerging technologies, reinforcing our role as the global security partner of choice," he said.Esper touted the work of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center saying its more than 200 civil service and military professionals work diligently to accelerate AI solutions and deliver these capabilities to the warfighter.The JAIC helps the joint force organize, fight and win at machine speed. For example, AI helps in enhancing wildfire and flood responses through computer vision technology. "The JAIC is utilizing every aspect of artificial intelligence as a transformative instrument at home and abroad," he said. "The JAIC is also lowering technical barriers to AI adoption by building a cloud-based platform to allow DOD components to test, validate and field capabilities with greater speed, at greater scale. The goal is to make AI tools and data accessible across the force, which will help synchronize projects and reduce redundancy, among many other benefits."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7229677 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 10, 2020End of Document

ESPER SAYS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WILL CHANGE THE BATTLEFIELDUS Fed NewsSeptember 9, 2020 Wednesday 8:11 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 946 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, Sept. 9 -- The U.S. Department of Defense issued the following news release:Artificial intelligence has the potential to change the battlefield, and the country that's first to field it will have enormous advantages over competitors, he told participants today."History informs us that those who are first to harness once-in-a-generation technologies often have a decisive advantage on the battlefield for years to come," the secretary said. "I experienced this firsthand during Operation Desert Storm, when the United States' military's smart bombs, stealth aircraft and satellite-enabled GPS helped decimate Iraqi forces and their Soviet equipment."Artificial intelligence has the potential to be even more far-reaching than those technologies. "Unlike advanced munitions or next-generation platforms, artificial intelligence is in a league of its own, with the potential to transform nearly every aspect of the battlefield, from the back office to the front lines," he said. "That is why we cannot afford to cede the high ground to revisionist powers intent on bending, breaking or reshaping international rules and norms in their favor - to the collective detriment of others."Esper noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin said the nation that leads in AI will be the "ruler of the world," and Russia has increased investments in the technology. "His intent is to employ any possible advantage to expand Russia's influence and chip away at the sovereignty of others," Esper said.The Russians used a sophisticated and well-coordinated combination of unmanned aerial vehicles, cyberattacks, and artillery barrages to inflict severe damage on Ukrainian forces when they invaded that country. "Since then, Moscow has announced the development of AI-enabled autonomous systems across ground vehicles, aircraft, nuclear submarines and command and control," he said. "We expect them to deploy these capabilities in future combat zones."The Chinese Communist Party has a goal of being the AI world leader in 10 years. The People's Liberation Army sees AI as a leap-frog technology that will allow the largest military on Earth to field low-cost, long-range autonomous vehicles and systems to counter America's conventional power projection. "At this moment, Chinese weapons manufacturers are selling autonomous drones they claim can conduct lethal, targeted strikes," the secretary said. "Meanwhile, the Chinese government is advancing the development of next-generation stealth UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicle], which they are preparing to export internationally.""Beijing is constructing a 21st-century surveillance state designed to wield unprecedented control over its own people," Esper said. "With hundreds of millions of cameras strategically located across the country and billions of data points generated by the Chinese Internet of Things, the CCP will soon be able to identify almost anyone entering a public space, and censor dissent in real time."The Chinese system can be used to invade private lives, leaving no text message, internet search, purchase or personal activity free from Beijing's ever tightening grip, the secretary said. "As we speak, the PRC is deploying - and honing - its AI surveillance apparatus to support the targeted repression of its Muslim Uighur population," he said. "Likewise, pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong are being identified, seized, imprisoned or worse by the CCP's digital police state - unencumbered by privacy laws or ethical governing principles. As China scales this technology, we fully expect it to sell these capabilities abroad, enabling other autocratic governments to move toward a new era of digital authoritarianism."The U.S. is pioneering a vision for the emerging technology that protects the U.S. Constitution and the rights of all Americans. U.S. officials would like to see allies and partners adopt the standards of individual liberty, democracy, human rights and respect for the rule of law."We approach AI as we have other high-tech breakthroughs throughout our department's history - with rigorous standards for testing and fielding capabilities and the highest ethical expectations," Esper said.

Portaltic.-Bytedance holds talks with US to avoid TikTok saleCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 10, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 350 wordsBody   MADRID, 10 (Portaltic/EP)   Bytedance, the Chinese company that owns the TikTok social network, holds talks with the U.S. government about possible agreements to prevent a full sale of its operations in the country, according to people familiar with the matter.   In early August, U.S. President Donald Trump said his government would ban the application of TikTok in his country as of September 15 if he does not reach a sales agreement on his operations in the country before that date.   Talks between ByteDance and the U.S. government have been going on for months, although they have now become more urgent as September 15 approaches, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.   According to sources cited by the newspaper, at least one of TikTok's leading investors recently met with representatives of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to discuss data security.   Since Trump's announcement, some U.S. companies had made bids to buy TikTok's U.S. operations, such as Microsoft and WalMart, which have teamed up to make a joint bid, while Oracle is considering one of its own. The last one to join this list is his rival, Triller.   For its part, China announced by the end of August a number of restrictions on technology exports, including two technologies that could directly affect the social network: interactive interfaces powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and personalized recommendations and notifications based on data analysis.   These new rules imposed by the Chinese government could curb the sale of TikTok's U.S. operations, as Bytedance would have to apply for a permit to sell the use of any technology to a foreign entity, something it would not achieve before the date set by the United States.   ByteDance later stated that it would comply with China's new restrictions on technology exports, even though they may affect the sale of its business in the United States.   TikTok also filed a complaint in federal courts to challenge the US government's decision to ban the application in the country "without evidence to justify it" and endangering thousands of jobs.Load-Date: September 11, 2020End of Document

Netflix CEO Reed Hastings: "Entertainment makes people more open without sobering it"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 19, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 2580 wordsBody       PremiumEDUARDO FERNANDEZeduardfdzMadrid                        Saturday, 19 September 2020 - 22:47                Share on FacebookShare on TwitterEmailComment-I hope you're not comparing all Netflix premieres to dog food.-There is very good dog food out there...-I have four dogs, so what are you going to tell me?At Reed Hastings' house, the first rays of sunshine are barely filtered and some willingness to not be taken seriously already appears. We must resist this unreleased epidemic that, beyond the health cataclysm, has only confined the consumer and his leisure, putting him at home in coexistence with this American entertainment company. This time, the screen is not occupied by series or movies, but by the low-resolution image of a poorly lit man in the early morning, the same one who once rebelled with the penalty of returning the Apollo 13 tape out of time. Blockbuster, which at the time dominated the physical video store market (what memories), generated a discontent that Hastings' restless mind would remembrance a few years later. On April 14, 1998, the first video store for DVD rental was born over the internet. Netflix.Today, the on-demand flow of streaming has successfully replaced the shipment of disks through the US postal service. Netflix already has more than 190 million subscriptions in more than 190 countries. And there are still a few chapters to look at this business that emerged in the Californian city of Santa Cruz.In this surfing town there is also the house of Hastings, which connects from a disused room that belonged to one of his sons: "I refuse to fix it, because I want the vaccine to be applied to me and be able to be back. It's a real shame not being able to be in Madrid right now doing this interview," he says in videoconference with Actualidad Económica.The office does not exist"Actually, I don't have an office anywhere, " the manager tells about one of the circumstances that come to shine in his latest book, Here there are no rules (Penguin Random House), which has been published this week in Spain and which serves to expose the policy of brutal honesty that Netflix apparently governs: unlimitedvacation, absence of premiums, salaries above those of any other company, criticisms from all fronts, sharing of financial results with employees before they are even made public... All this in a listed company whose capitalization has reached $230 billion, about 190 billion euros."Netflix's corporate culture reflects the different dilemmas its employees face on a daily basis, rather than staying in absolute terms, as is the case in most companies. People outside the company are surprised that she has never seen anything like it," explains Erin Meyer, a professor at Insead business school and co-author of the book with Hastings. Diego Ovalos,Vice President of Content in Spain of Netflix, corroborates in another talk those same practices: "That makes you feel part of the company, even if at first you can not believe it. My first day at Netflix I discovered that Reed goes back and forth without a notebook or computer; sat down with me and knew many things about my life, for I had researched myself. His first sentence was, 'Tell me about you.'"The platform itself continues to learn about user preferences and then leverages that data, which appears to have replaced gold or oil as a paradigm of something valuable. "When you have a large selection of movies and series, it's very important to catalog them according to your tastes. In the age of the internet, it is essential to have recommendations. If you like Korean series, like Crush landing on you, they're going to propose you more series like that. Now, a subscriber may suddenly find that we propose a Korean series. The system just wants to know if you'vechanged," Hastings explains. Trial and error.  And try again until you get it right.Netflix's equisWhen Netflix's visible head (and this remote-mode interview) shuffled ideas to create a new company hand-in-hand with Marc Randolph, he came to propose to enter thepet feed business, individualized by the animal, an option that Hastings of course discarded without contemplation. In truth, that idea was but an attempt to achieve the long-awaited customization of a product, a chimera that the digital environment has made possible thanks to a process of constant refinement, Korean series included. Although Hastings laughs at comparing Netflix to animal food, one of the names was shuffled for this entertainment company was Kibble, which means exactly pet feed. The Netflix trademark, something like network movies, ended up convincing the founding team even if the final equis raised more than one question in case any customer interpreted it as a reference to pornographic cinema,as Randolph recalled in another book, that will never work (Planet). It did work. Netflix is currently aiming for its planetary deployment: "Two-thirds of our subscribers are not in the United States. We want to produce very good content in Germany, United Kingdom, Japan, Korea, Brazil, USA and of course Spain, since The Paper House is our big global hit", reviews Hastings.The connected world... less ChinaWhile this 59-year-old Bostonian has criticized Donald Trump's "anti-American" behavior, it is not as stark to the technological cold war that the US administration has waged with China. "I find it difficult to pronounce myself, because for a few years we have been trying to open our service there, something that we have achieved in any other country in the world, and we find that in China we are blocked. We've asked for that blockade to be lifted, but they refuse. Disney or Apple have also had to shut down services. We knew the Chinese government was going to be against the Western media, so we stopped trying, so that we ran into a closed market... for us it's already started a few years ago," says Hastings, who in any case refuses to agree with Trump: "I'm basically a globalist. I like that cultures aremixed, that you can see the entertainment that is done elsewhere, and that is the great contribution of Netflix, so I look forward to entering Chinese consumption and that in the rest of the world you can see the stories coming from China [...] Entertainment is part of how the world connectsand he's not trying to suck anyone away; people are simply more receptive when they see something on the screen."Hastings's professional profile, shaped at Stanford, has also spanned trips to Southern Africa, where he taught mathematics in his youth, with the American Peace Corps; in fact, this entrepreneur is now fully involved with the educational cause. Some of his early companions compared him to Star Trek's Spock, as he was degreasing in his book Randolph, although he recalls that that sci-fi character "is almost always right." Despite the separation of paths between the two Netflix founders, a breakup that ended the company in Hastings' hands and Randolph's departure, Heolph has no qualms about describing the company's current CEO as "one of the greatest entrepreneurs of all time" yes, "brutal and severely sincere".The boss doesn't matter.According to Netflix's business policy, reviews are welcome; also if they come from subordinates. Teams work with open Google Docs documents that are hosted on Google Drive (this interview with Hastings is conducted through Google Meet), so that internal discussions are the order of the day. "At first so much feedback takes you out, but then it's like a gift to improve your work," defends Ovals. In that situation, some employees have spoken of fear; to the evaluation of others, to end up fired. Meyer justifies this: "To understand it better, let's think of an Olympic team. Participating in a Games may impose respect; when you're given a lot of freedom, too." Hastings says: 'Our culture proposes to set aside the model that is in many companies from 'how do I make my boss happy?' Faced with that, we say, 'Try to make the customer happy.'"This contextualizes the fact that Hastings himself finds that content manager Ted Sarandos had launched himself into producing his own content full and with a massive disbursement. "It was 2011 and, by size, we could already afford to get into entertainment in a big way, but when he told me that he had acquired the House of Cards series for $100 million, I was in shock."In drawing that line, Netflix no longer relies on third-party productions and, last July, Sarandos was appointed co-CEO of the company, at the same level as Hastings, who does not hesitate to admit his "lack of knowledge" from show business. "Ted is a creative genius and in practice has been co-owning the company for a long time. He focuses on Los Angeles and I in Silicon Valley, so we've created a fantastic society. He knows everyone in Hollywoood and I don't."Hastings does go to the moviesLos Gatos, home to Netflix's current headquarters, is in that technology area that Hastings knows so well, five hours north (if traffic jams don't stop it) from Los Angeles, a mecca for an inevitablely reformed industry to adapt to streaming times. Despite the reluctance of the big theaters, Netflix has already made its way even at Alfonso Cuarón's most recent Oscars, with Rome; Story of a marriage, by Noah Baumbach, or The Irishman, by Martin Scorsese himself.-How long has it been since you've been in a movie theater?-I watch about 20 movies a year in the movies, but that's only a small part of my views.-So that activity is not endangered?-Once we have the vaccine, we will return to cafes, restaurants, stadiums and cinemas. Humans like group activities, we just think about music: it's available to anyone and evenso people keep going to concerts. Cinema is an experience, a part of the ecosystem, but unlike other sectors, they are thought to have exclusive content. A restaurant does not claim exclusivity over chicken. Therein lies the difference: thecinemas want to be the first to give the content and also have it in ownership.With the HBO of The Sopranos as a reference and based on the success of House of Cards, Netflix has strived to create its own content, at a pace of investment that has given it some advantage over the expansion of HBO, Apple, Disney or Amazon itself. The latter already completed the purchase of Netflix in 1998, when the company had just been released as a DVD service. If that agreement had been closed before a reluctant Hastings, Jeff Bezos' power would now break all brands.Pandemic-proofNetflix's frenzy investor in order to make a hole in households around the world involves debt that, in the long run, it is already $15.2 billion (12.8 billion euros) according to the latest Netflix accounts, which Hastings minimizes: "If you have a house that costs a million euros, you may feel comfortable with a mortgage of around 500,000, half the value. In the case of Netflix, we are worth about $230 billion [190 billion euros] and we have a debt of only $15 billion [12.8 billion euros]. This is a large number for you or me [for one more than the other], but it's much smaller than Disney's or Time Warner's [where HBO is framed]. Compared to the value of the company, it's a small figure and we're comfortable with that debt."In the second quarter of this year, deastrous for all types of companies precisely because of the confinement, Netflix recorded 10.1 million subscriptions, well above the previously estimated 7.5 million. However, the company counts on the impact of covid to be seen in this second half of the year, when viewers' pockets have already been left empty.On everyone's mouth, also by Pedro SánchezThe sector is readjusted and at the same time European legislation tries to get new platforms to assume the obligations that traditional television networks do face. It goes unnoticed that Netflix's continental headquarters are located in the Netherlands, a lax tax territory where much of corporation taxes are concentrated. President Pedro Sánchez has come to afflict this company since Congress with the low tax burden it has been carrying in Spain.-On Netflix, door-in data is shared, as we talked about, but the door-out behavior is very different. Is the company willing to break down its accounts, country by country?-We already do. Unlike free services like Facebook, WhatsApp [part of Facebook] or Google, we charge an amount each month, about 10 euros, and VAT is collected for each subscription, which will stop at the hands of the government, so you know how much we enter and, implicitly, are also aware of the number of subscriptions. We're trying to be more open in this regard. I think Spain has about five million subscriptions. We're not looking for stealth. We are aware that taxes must be collected and that all companies have to pay them, both internationally and locally.-In audiovisual businesses, in the midst of a conversion in the face of the rise of streaming, generalist networks retain live television as one of their tricks. Is that scope totally ruled out for Netflix?"I don't think we're going in there.The sport is very well distributed by generalist televisions in homes, hotels and bars. Broadcasters specialize in getting to many places at once. The Internet, on the other hand, is good for individual elections and recommendations. I'd say the sport and the news will stay on the broadcasters for a long time.The interview concludes. Enter the room from which Hastings connects, provisionally if the pandemic is finally left behind. On either side, the screens remain on. Life goes on, but at home."I WISH EVERYONE WAS SPAIN"                "The paper house is the first Spanish series to be exported to the entire planet and we want there to be more," Hastings warns.  So much so that Netflix opened its first European production center in Madrid last year, at Sequoia Studios. Diego Ovalos participated in the activation of the project, to the point that he ended up in Tres Cantos to lead it. "The first series for which we acquired broadcast rights was The time between seams and we perceived a great reception in Latin America. Then came The Ship, Gran Hotel, Vis a vis [all antenna 3 ficciones] and not only interested in Latin America, but also in the USA. Then came The Paper House. Following our company culture, we wanted independent decisions to be made from Spain. What better come to me from Los Angeles?" argues Ovalos.Hastings gets rid of praise for the country: "I wish everyone was Spain. There are incredible storytellers, very good weather, a very practical government, great consumers and also Telefónica has deployed so much fiber that there is more network per population than almost anywhere in the world," he says.A CROWDED SCREEN                Netflix rushed to enter Spain in October 2015, but already shares a screen with many other on-demand offers. At the end of 2016, Amazon Prime Video and HBO were presented, which this September premieres the audiovisual adaptation of Patria and has had claims for seriephiles such as The Wire and the biggest commercial phenomenon of recent fiction, Game of Thrones. Last year, Apple made its way with its own platform, although more anticipation seems to have generated Disney, which opened last March in full alarm and has recently given up on releasing Mulan in theaters, for the greater glory of its streaming service. Of course, there is a Spanish offer, from the Movistar+ off-road platform to film catalogues such as Filmin's.Load-Date: September 20, 2020End of Document

Cascade of downloads and the opportunity for Facebook, what's coming for TikTokCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 18, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1399 wordsBodyAs of the night of this Sunday, September 20, users, in the United States, who wish to download TikTok from one of the app stores, both in the App Store and on Google Play, will no longer be able to do so; while for the nearly 100 million people who use the app in this country nothing will change, until an update arrives that they will no longer be able to access. These changes will take effect after the U.S. Department of Commerce, by Wilbur Ross, issued an order prohibiting these downloads, as well as those of the Chinese messaging app WeChat, on the grounds that the way they collect data from their users poses a risk to U.S. security. 45 days ago, Donald Trump's administration said that for TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, to operate in that country, it should be acquired by a U.S. company so that it would have better control over its systems. To date Microsoft, Walmart and Oracle- which remains in negotiations - have offered interest in the Asian company, but the issue has not been resolved beyond the new order. For Andrés Velázquez, President and founder of MaTTica, a strategic cybersecurity company that has Latin America's first digital research lab, the consequences of the order issued this Friday open the way to two things: a wave of downloads in days prior to September 20 and a window of opportunity for some other company that can capture users looking for an alternative to TikTok. "What I see in a wave of downloads. How many people won't be downloading the app these two days making people's reaction, from a cybersecurity point, more users on the platform and more American data, as Trump thinks, in the possession of the Chinese," Velázquez said. As for the purchase of TikTok by an American firm you will have to see how the issue progresses or not. "Let's see if Oracle doesn't back down," Velázquez projected. The taste of the audience, especially the youngest, by TikTok has placed it as the most downloaded app in the world and has also made it a useful marketing and brand recognition tool for large retailers, artists and influencers. EMarketer's numbers, in February 2020, estimated that by 2024 the number of TikTok users in the United States would be 45 million and projected that the app would add 15 million users in four years, in the United States alone; however, the app registered 12 million new users in March 2020 alone and currently accounts for 100 million users in that country, with penetration of about 20% of all U.S. internet users. Although today is too early to measure the pace of downloads of the app, following the government order, if the boom for the app continues, users can look for ways to get it and continue to use it with legally questionable mechanisms, using techniques like jailbreak, which opens up a risk of cybersecurity rather than closing it. "These measures can generate a wave of applications or methods that do allow the user to do something. If apps ever get to be only blocked in the United States, there's a chance there's someone who takes advantage of alternate ways to give users the same service," Velázquez said. The opportunity for Reels? For Paola Orozco, Mexican user of TikTok who now lives in Boston, Massachusetts, the short video app has become her "quarantine playful escape" and news about the future of this software and how she will be able to continue using it in the long run baffles her. "I went down TikTok for quarantine because I despaired Instagram, I always saw the same thing and TikTok becamean escape for me for four months. I always have my time a day to see tiktoks, to see what new thing I find, it makes me laugh and it really is an escape. I don't upload tiktoks, I only use it to entertain myself, but it makes me conflict to know that there will come a time when I no longer have an update," Orozco said in interview. While the young woman claims to be aware of the authorization she gives about her data to the application, she considers this measure to be a blockade of something she uses to entertain herself and that she does not find on another platform, even though she has already tried following "TikTokers" in other similar formats such as Reels, from Instagram, owned by Facebook. "On TikTok I found things that don't work out on Instagram, as you only see what people you want to follow post are different, TikTok is like a Pinterest but more fun. I found things of craft, cooking, sustainable fashion and I was father discovering something new in TikTok every day," said the 32-year-old user. Mark Zuckerberg's firm launched Instagram's Reels feature last August as one more option for creating short video content, with filters, music and friendly editing, almost the same as TikTok offers; however, the rise of Reels has not been as successful as other Facebook family apps, such as Instagram itself; However, Velázquez de Mattica sees that the scenario facing TikTok can now be favorable for Reels. "Now is the time for an application that can host everyone who doubts TikTok, it's an opportunity for other platforms. (...) The strong candidate is Instagram's Reels who could seize the opportunity," the analyst told Expansión. Some of the "TikTokers" that Orozco follows have already moved to Instagram, to use the Reels feature and continue to generate content with other functions of the app in short format, such as Stories or the same Photo Feed; however, followers of these influencers on Instagram are not equated into numbers within reach they already had on TikTok. Fashion and makeup blogger Emma Nortons has 4.6 million followers on TikTok while only adding 226,000 on Instagram. Another example is Charli D'Amelio who as TikToker has 87.4 million followers and 29 million followers on Instagram. Orozco says one of the things he doesn't like so much about Reels is that TikTok allows for the most open discovery of content, both makeup tutorials, sustainable fashion, comedy and other themes, while Instagram only shows you the content of those you follow. However, this same opening is what worries those who don't use the app. In an exercise on Facebook and Instagram, five young people in their 30s living in the United States agreed to stop TikTok on U.S. territory, considering that he collects too much personal data. Ana Elena Ortiz, also a Mexican living in the United States, believes that TikTok has much more access to data than it should, more than other networks like Facebook or Twitter collect, and poses a security risk. "I don't think it's appropriate for a social media app to save fingerprints, clipboard or my exact location. Wow, I don't think it's justifiable enough for an app to share and watch videos, it collects so much information. Facebook and Twitter are other types of networks that give you as much as they take away from you. FB allows me to stay in touch with the world, share photos, statuses, videos, groups, events, sell things, leave reviews, remember birthdays, see memories, anniversaries... Etc. Twitter allows you to stay in touch and communicate Live and follow news, comments, events. Tik tok is simply a silly video platform. So they want to monitor the location of a 23-year-old chamaco even though the app is in the background?" commented theUser. Security is not the point While the U.S. government's argument for slowing down TikTok downloads, and possibly adding restrictions towards November 12, revolves around the cybersecurity risk it poses, Velázquez says there is no evidence yet to prove that this app sells information to the Chinese government or that it misuses its users' data , which tilts the discussion to one more topic in the political environment, which also gains traction months from the election in the United States. "In terms of cybersecurity, there's not much to talk about. There are other American apps that ask for the same or more data that TikTok and WeChat asks for, which makes this look more like a political issue, more oriented that can happen with information control. (...) For the US to have control over certain personal user information is not a worrying issue but if it does its Chinese counterpart then it is," the analyst warned.

US to ban use of TikTok and WeChat for national securityCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 18, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 379 wordsBodyA total ban on the use of TikTok would be implemented on November 12, but Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Friday morning on the Fox Business Network program that access to that app could be possible if certain safeguards are in effect by then."Under the president's instruction, we have taken significant steps to combat the malicious collection of personal data of U.S. citizens, while promoting our national values, democratic norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations," Ross said in a prepared statement.The government order also raises questions about the recent agreement of California-based technology giant Oracle to take control of TikTok's U.S. operations, a requirement the Trump administration set for the application to continue operating in the country.The details of the agreement between Oracle and TikTok were vague at best. Oracle was one of several bidders, including Microsoft and Walmart, to purchase TikTok's U.S. operations.Oracle, in its confirmation that it was the winning bidder on Monday, did not refer to the agreement as a sale or acquisition and instead said it was chosen as TikTok's "reliable technology provider".At the moment it is not clear which assets, if any, would actually acquire Oracle.Some security experts have raised concerns that ByteDance Ltd., the Chinese company that owns TikTok, would maintain access to the information of 100 million users of the application in the United States, creating a potential national security hazard.Like most social networks, TikTok collects user data and moderates their posts. Collect your location and messages, as well as track what they see, to decipher the best way to target ads for them.Similar concerns have emerged around U.S.-based social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, but Chinese ownership adds an extra drawback, because the Chinese government could order companies to help it gather intelligence.TikTok said it does not store U.S. user data in China and would not hand over personal data to governments, but experts point out that Chinese authorities can obtain any information they want from companies in the Asian country.The US entry will prohibit the use of TikTok and WeChat for national security was first published in Diario La República.Load-Date: September 19, 2020End of Document

U.S. Justice Prevents Trump from Banning TikTok for nowCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 28, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 833 wordsBody A U.S. judge has issued an order on Sunday preventing Donald Trump's administration from banning downloads and updates from China's TikTok social network, something that could have happened this midnight, at least until Justice re-utters. The government will abide by the court order but appeal it. Judge Carl J. Nichols of the Federal Court of the District of Columbia thus agreed to the request of the Chinese firm's attorneys, who sought a temporary blockade of the possible ban while the two sides face off in court.Nichols' decision definitively brings to Justice a dispute that began in August, when Trump issued an executive order threatening to ban TikTok in the U.S. if the owner firm, China's ByteDance, did not sell its business in the country to U.S. companies.Judge Nichols' decision supported the petition of TikTok's lawyers, who sought a temporary blockade of the ban while the two sides clashed in court.Last August, Trump issued an executive order threatening to ban TikTok in the U.S. if the proprietary firm, China's ByteDance, did not sell its business in the country to U.S. companies.To justify that ban, Trump alluded to national security issues, considering that, as an application owned by a Chinese company, he could hand over personal data from U.S. users to the Chinese Communist Government.Commerce has highlighted in a statement that it is "a preliminary court order" and announced it." "The Government will comply with the court order and has taken immediate steps to do so, but it intends to vigorously defend the executive order" ordering the ban, the official note reads.He adds that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will continue his "implementation efforts" of Trump's decision.The executive order is "fully compliant with the law and promotes legitimate national security interests," he insists. Freedom of expression TikTok, which has 100 million users in the U.S. and 700 million worldwide, is one of the most growing social networks in recent years. TikTok's lawyers have advocated that the company share data with Chinese authorities and argues that Trump's goal is to restrict freedom of expression. According to the U.S. President, the fact that it is an application owned by a Chinese company poses a national security threat because of China's ties between the private sector and the Chinese Communist Party government.After weeks of negotiations, ByteDance came to a beginning in agreement with the American Oracle and Walmart, which came to receive preliminary approval from the White House, but in recent days the talks were not paying off and there was a real possibility that Trump would execute his threat to ban downloads of the app when Sunday ended.A few hours before the ruling, on Sunday morning, Nichols held a hearing in which he heard the government's arguments, which stated that TikTok is a threat because it collects data about its users and, being a Chinese company, then must necessarily collaborate with that country's intelligence services. For their part, TikTok's lawyers denied that the company shares data with Chinese authorities and argued that Trump's goal is actually to restrict freedom of expression. "This case is about freedom of expression and freedom of communication. It's an inherent part of the business that's been targeted by the attack. TikTok is aapp, but it's much more. It is a modern version of communication in the electronic age that has gained popularity especially in the pandemic," said one of the company's lawyers, Alexander Berengaut. Had the judge not given ByteDance the reason and the White House had decided to go ahead with their threat, Google and Apple, which control the two major mobile virtual stores, would have been forced to withdraw TikTok from them in the United States, in compliance with the presidential order. Although only two weeks ago, the agreement between ByteDance on the one hand and Oracle and Walmart on the other seemed on track, in recent days the two sides have offered conflicting versions of whether ByteDance would continue to be a major part of the new company's shareholding believed to run TikTok's business in the US. According to the Oracle and Walmart version - which will control 20% of the future firm - most of the new company will be U.S.-owned, but according to ByteDance, they will control the remaining 80% until their IBRO takes place with an initial public offering within about a year. The version of the agreement offered by ByteDance would therefore not satisfy the terms of Trump's executive order. This order further states that on 12 November Commerce would completely vetate the use of the application in the country, something that could still happen, since for the time being the judge has not prevented it. TikTok, which has 100 million users in the U.S. and 700 million worldwide, is one of the most growing social networks in recent years, and has become the main entertainment for many teens and a marketing channel for major celebrities.Load-Date: September 29, 2020End of Document

TikTok bans weight-loss, fasting ads as 'harmful content'UPISeptember 23, 2020 Wednesday 1:09 PM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 473 wordsByline: DON JACOBSONDateline: Sept. 23 BodyTikTok on Wednesday banned advertisements for fasting apps and weight loss supplements from its social media platform, citing the need to keep users safe from "harmful content and behavior."The short-form video app also moved to restrict ads it says "promote a harmful and negative body image.""As a society, weight stigma and body shaming pose both individual and cultural challenges, and we know that the Internet, if left unchecked, has the risk of exacerbating such issues," TikTok U.S. Safety Policy Manager Tara Wadhwa wrote in a blog post."That's why we're focused on working to safeguard our community from harmful content and behavior while supporting an inclusive -- and body-positive -- environment."The company said it's concerned frequents ads for such products have a negative effect on teenage users -- who comprise a good share of TikTok's 49 million U.S. users.Also Wednesday, new backlash emerged over a partnership that would allow TikTok to avoid being banned in the United States by President Donald Trump on national security grounds.Trump's orders have been delayed until Sunday to allow officials time to review the deal between TikTok and Oracle, which would create a new entity to control the the app's U.S. operations.The Chinese company ByteDance, which owns TikTok, would not have a controlling interest in the new firm known as TikTok Global, Trump said after giving preliminary approval to the deal last week.Under its terms, Oracle and Walmart would have a combined 20% stake in the new company, with most stock owned by U.S. investors who would comprise four out of its five board members.To allay concerns that ByteDance is giving user data to the Chinese government, the new firm's operations would be based in the United States and Oracle would host the user data on its cloud platform.But state-run Chinese media this week carried editorials blasting the terms of the deal, raising concerns that Communist Party officials may be lining up against it."What the United States has done to TikTok is almost the same as a gangster forcing an unreasonable and unfair business deal on a legitimate company," state-run China Daily wrote in an editorial, noting that ByteDance would, in effect, have to surrender the app's source code to Oracle."China has no reason to give the green light to such a deal, which is dirty and unfair and based on bullying and extortion.""It is clear that these [terms] extensively show Washington's bullying style and hooligan logic," the Global Times, also state-owned, added. "They hurt China's national security, interests and dignity.""The U.S. suppresses [ByteDance] with all its national strength and forces it to sign a deal under coercion. China, also a major country, will not yield to U.S. intimidation and will not accept an unequal treaty that targets Chinese companies."Load-Date: September 23, 2020End of Document

Donald Trump announced an agreement with Oracle and Walmart that would allow TikTok to continue operations in the USCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 19, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 504 wordsBodyThe deal with Oracle, Walmart arrives weeks after the Chinese-owned application was labeled a threat to national securityPresident Trump said he has "in concept" accepted an agreement under which chinese-owned video application TikTok will partner with Oracle Corp and Walmart Inc. to become a US-based company, ending negotiations that have sparked debate about national security and the future of the Internet."I've given my blessing to the agreement, if they get it too, if they don't, it's okay too," Trump told reporters at the White House on Saturday.According to The Wall Street Journal, the deal calls for the creation of 25,000 jobs, most in Texas. The president explained that the new company will continue to be called TikTok but "it will have nothing to do with China."He added that Oracle and Walmart plan to create a $5 billion fund for the education of young Americans.(Reuters) (Florence Lo/)Negotiations on TikTok's U.S. operations began after the president signed an executive order in August calling TikTok a threat to national security, forcing its beijing-based owner, ByteDance Ltd., to pursue a sale or partnership with a U.S. company.The administration contends that the data that TikTok collects from U.S. users could be shared with the Chinese government. In response to the executive order, Commerce issued regulations Friday prohibiting U.S. companies from providing downloads or updates for TikTok after 11:59 p.m. on Sunday. The order also applies to WeChat, another popular Chinese-owned application that is not part of the settlement discussions.TikTok, which has more than 80 million users in the United States, is one of the most growing social networks in recent years, which has become the main entertainment for many teenagers and a marketing channel for major celebrities.Oracle, headquartered in Redwood City, California and founded in 1977, is one of Silicon Valley's pioneering companies and its software is used by millions of companies worldwide.Oracle CEO and co-founder Larry Ellison - the world's fifth-largest fortune, according to Forbes - is one of the few prominent tech industry executives to publicly express support for Trump, and even held a fundraising event for the president's re-election campaign in February.Oracle's main rival in the bid for TikTok was Microsoft, which, despite being considered the favorite for several weeks, admitted the defeat on Sunday afternoon. Another company that had taken an interest in TikTok.In August TikTok surpassed 2 billion downloads worldwide and claims to be present in more than 200 countries. In the United States, the social network claims to have 100 million monthly users.The war over TikTok comes as part of a broader deterioration in relations between the two major world economies for months, with the United States and China launching harsh recriminations in the commercial, human rights or coronavirus pandemic.In development...MORE ON THIS TOPIC:Chinese regime announced new sanctions system to pursue foreign companiesLoad-Date: September 20, 2020End of Document

Morey said he's leaving the team Nov. 1.“It has been the most gratifying experience of my professional life to lead the Rockets basketball organization, and I look forward to working with Tilman and the management team on the transition," Morey said in a statement. “I am very confident that the future – for the Rockets, and for our incredible fans – is in great hands, and that the Rockets will continue to perform at the highest level.”Tilman Fertitta, who has owned the Rockets since 2017, thanked Morey for everything he did in his years with the team.“Daryl is a brilliant innovator who helped the Rockets become a perennial contender," he said in a statement. “I have truly enjoyed working with Daryl and couldn’t have asked for a better general manager to have at the start of my ownership."Morey caused an international uproar last year when he tweeted support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. Morey tweeted an image that said: “Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.” His tweet was in reference to pro-democracy demonstrations in the semiautonomous Chinese territory that had been mired in escalating violence between protesters and law enforcement.The tweet caused businesses in China to cut ties with the Rockets and broadcasters there refused to air the team’s games this season. NBA telecasts in China, however, resumed during the recent NBA Finals.The Rockets have made the playoffs 10 times since Morey was hired in 2007, including the last eight seasons for the longest active streak in the NBA.Morey was responsible for the blockbuster trade that brought James Harden to Houston from Oklahoma City. The Rockets reached the Western Conference finals twice under Morey but were unable to win their first championship since consecutive titles in 1994-95.The move comes after coach Mike D’Antoni told the team he would not return after the Rockets lost to the Lakers in the conference semifinals.Houston went 640-400 with Morey as the general manager and won a franchise-record 65 regular-season games in the 2017-18 season. That was the second time they lost in the conference finals under Morey, falling to the Warriors in seven games after also losing to them in the conference finals in 2015.Morey is an MIT graduate who became one of the early proponents of the use of analytics in the NBA. He was always making a trade or deal of some kind and was also responsible for the signing of Dwight Howard in 2013 and for trading multiple players to the Clippers in 2017 for Chris Paul. He then dealt Paul to the Thunder before this season for Russell Westbrook.In perhaps his most unconventional move, he got rid of center Clint Capela in a three-team trade in February and the Rockets played “small ball" the rest of the season without a true center.Morey worked as Houston's assistant general manager for one season under Carroll Dawson before he retired after the 2007 season and Morey was promoted to his job.Load-Date: October 15, 2020End of Document

Oracle and Walmart Make Preliminary Deal to Achieve Majority American Ownership of TikTokThe Villanovan: Villanova UniversitySeptember 30, 2020 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 582 wordsByline: Sarah SweeneyBodyAs if 2020 has not been strange enough, the popular comedic video-sharing app TikTok is now one of the most heated sources of political tension in the U.S., worsening the strained relationship between the U.S. and China.TikTok is a fast-paced and entertaining video-sharing social media app, which is currently  Apple's most downloaded application. Created in 2016 by Chinese technology company ByteDance, TikTok has more than 800 million active users, over 40% of which are between 16 and 24 years old. It is estimated that 90% of all TikTok users access the app on a daily basis, spending an average of 52 minutes on it each day. Part of what makes TikTok so addicting, and therefore successful, is its "For You Page," the landing screen when users open the app. Facilitated by a powerful algorithm, the "For You Page" provides users with videos tailored to their interests based on their previous interactions with TikTok videos. The algorithm collects and analyzes data so well that users often find videos related to their geographic location, gender, sexuality and other personal demographic information.  This collection of personal data has alarmed some, including President Donald Trump, who threatened to ban TikTok in late July. His executive order, issued on Aug. 6, cited numerous security concerns. "[TikTok's] data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information - potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail and conduct corporate espionage," Trump said.Trump later agreed to forgo this outright ban if TikTok could divest its U.S. operations, meaning transition to a majority American ownership, by Sept. 20. Immediately, three main potential buyers came to the forefront: Microsoft, Oracle and Walmart. After an exhaustive bidding process, a tentative deal has emerged: Oracle and Walmart will both invest in TikTok Global, Oracle with a 12.5% stake and Walmart with a 7.5% stake. Although ByteDance would retain an 80% stake in TikTok, about 40% of ByteDance is owned by American investors. This, combined with Oracle and Walmart's new investment, would provide a majority American ownership of TikTok. However, the deal is far from over. There is a large confusion over ownership breakdown, with a spokesperson for ByteDance claiming it would directly hold an 80% share of TikTok Global, and Oracle stating that ByteDance will have no ownership in TikTok Global. The deal is also awaiting approval from the Chinese government, which recently expanded trade restrictions to restrict the export of content-recommendation algorithms, like the one that powers TikTok's "For You Page." Under the preliminary agreement with Oracle and Walmart, the algorithm would not be part of the sale, although they would be allowed to review the application's source code. Although President Trump extended the deadline for the proposed Sept. 20 ban, the threat of one still remains. The White House hinted at a download ban beginning on Sunday, Sept. 27. However, this was not confirmed. The Commerce Department also hoisted Nov. 12 as a proposed date for a complete ban if a deal achieving majority American ownership is not reached before then. This uncertainty about whether TikTok will be banned or not has left many wanting to ask the United States government a Doja Cat lyric and popular TikTok sound - Why Don't You Say So?Load-Date: October 1, 2020End of Document

And while current U.S. users might still be able to use the app, they will no longer be able to make updates.But the judge could also suspend the ban on downloading or updating the humorous and music video app, used by 100 million Americans each month.An agreement between the Trump administration and TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, is not ruled out.In early August, Trump signed a decree to force ByteDance to sell the platform to a U.S. company, arguing an alleged threat to "national security," as repeated by the representative without providing evidence, TikTok spies for Beijing.- "Agora" -TikTok filed an emergency appeal this week in federal Washington court, claiming that his ban does not conform to the U.S. Constitution as it is against freedom of expression."TikTok is much more than an app, it's the modern version of the public forum, it's a community, it's a means of communication (...) all the more important in pandemic times," company attorney John Hall said Sunday. "If the ban comes into force, it is as if the government is preventing 2/3 of the country from reaching the agora."The platform also argues that blocking downloads would cause him irreparable damage, as in early summer borealis was getting about 424,000 new American users daily.The representative has accused TikTok, for a long time and without evidence, of spying on its users for the benefit of Beijing by collecting data. While for the company Trump's attacks are motivated by the political agenda.Blocking downloads is a "punitive" action, "a brutal way to hit the business doing nothing" for security, Hall said.The latest sales project, announced last weekend, involves the creation of a new company, TikTok Global, involving two U.S. emporiums: Oracle as a technology partner and Walmart as a business partner.In addition, Oracle would get a 12.5% stake and Walmart would gain a 7.5% stake. The Americans would occupy four of the five chairs on the board of directors.But the concreteness of this project depends on the goodwill of the US president and the Chinese government.TikTok became the new symbol of the U.S.-China battle for dominance of the state-of-the-art technology sector.- Emergency resource -On Monday, Trump, campaigning for re-election, insisted that he would not give his approval if TikTok remained under Chinese control, and claimed that Oracle and Walmart would own most of the new group.ByteDance, which includes U.S. investors, called this information "false rumors."If negotiations are unsuccessful, a full ban on TikTok's activities on U.S. soil could take effect from November 12, the Treasury Department warned.However, ByteDance announced that it made an "authorization request" for technology export, without specifying the purpose.This initiative could involve the famous algorithm that has made TikTok a success: it allows users to show users the content with the most possibility ofinterest them, depending on their tastes, and lead them to spend as much time as possible watching one video after another on the platform.China refuses to allow this precious computer system to fall into American hands.juj-jul/lo/els/yo/gma/lpLoad-Date: September 28, 2020End of Document

Cornellian Content Creators Relieved as TikTok and WeChat Survive Latest Legal ChallengeCornell Daily Sun: Cornell UniversityOctober 2, 2020 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 635 wordsBodyPresident Trump's announcement in August that TikTok may be banned sent the popular social media app's creators and users into a flurry. However, two months later, the ban was halted by a federal injunction - allowing Cornellians, at least for now, to continue using the app.On Aug. 6, Trump issued an executive order that called for the removal of TikTok and WeChat from U.S. app stores, claiming that the Chinese-owned social media companies - Tencent and ByteDance - posed a significant threat to national security and U.S. privacy. Key leaders from both parties have raised similar concerns over the safety of the two platforms.The ban, which intended to prevent Americans from downloading the two apps, was initially supposed to go into effect last Sunday on Sept. 27, before a ruling by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia temporarily scuttled the administration's plans.Cornell TikTok star Melissa Kwakye-Dankwa '22 - who currently has nearly 240 thousand followers on the platform - said she would be disheartened if the app was ultimately banned. Her channel, which she said sprung out of the boredom of quarantine, made her feel more connected with other creators in the African community."There has never been a social media that unifies groups of people, allows you to build community, in this way," said Kwakye-Dankwa, who expressed faith that the app would ultimately survive its legal challenges.TikTok however is not the only app potentially on the cutting board: WeChat, one of the world's most used social media and mobile messaging apps, was also threatened to be barred.Valentina Xu '22, vice president of development with Cornell's Mainland China Student Association, said the announcement left her wondering how she would talk to family members abroad."It was a stressful situation to find out how we - my mom, brother and I - were going to communicate with my dad, who is currently on business duties in China," Xu said. "My parents were on the call for a long time, downloading things like WhatsApp just in case."According to Xu, WeChat is the most effective way for her organization to connect with incoming freshmen, who often use the platform to ask questions about how to pay tuition, enroll in courses and recruit for clubs."[WeChat] is the easiest way to keep in touch ... sometimes this is not limited to the Chinese community, but other Asian and communities as well," said Xu, pointing out that, despite the company's ownership, it is not just those with ties to China who will be affected by its removal.Zoya Mohsin '21, president of the International Student Union, said that while she uses WhatsApp rather than TikTok or WeChat, the proposed bans are needlessly capricious; banning apps during a pandemic, she said, "just makes life hard on everybody.""There is so much going on in the world, why are you focusing on this?" Mohsin said. "It further alienates and stigmatizes a group of people that have not done anything wrong to deserve this."Despite the injunction issued last week, the Trump administration has vowed that it will continue to fight for a ban in the event that an American buyer for ByteDance's North American operations is not found.Oracle and Walmart have so far emerged as the Chinese company's most promising suitors. In a deal tentatively approved by the Trump administration, the two corporations would own up to 20 percent of an American-headquartered spin-off.

All Rights ReservedLength: 854 wordsByline: David SimsBodyData gathered this weekend appeared to hold seismic news for Hollywood-specifically Disney. A report from Yahoo suggested that a shocking 9 million Disney+ users had streamed the studio's Mulan remake in its first 12 days of release, translating into a gross of $261 million. That's a staggering number for an on-demand rental and for an industry that's been struggling through pandemic-related cinema closures. If Disney can make that kind of money without American theaters, does it need American theaters at all?The only problem is, Mulan didn't actually make $261 million in 12 days. Yahoo had misinterpreted numbers from an analytics firm that estimated Mulan's viewership, and the firm's co-founder clarified that grosses were more likely $60 million to $90 million-well below the movie's reported budget of $200 million. Not only does it seem that Mulan made modest sums in the United States (though Disney has yet to release official numbers), but the movie also had a disappointing theatrical rollout in China. Another grand experiment by Hollywood in the COVID-19 era, another flop. As the end of 2020 draws near, studios still haven't figured out a sustainable way to bring their most expensive blockbusters to audiences.[Read: Hollywood's ~Tenet' experiment failed]As with Warner Bros.' release of Christopher Nolan's Tenet, which has had its own difficulties, Mulan's mediocre release had many complicating factors. Disney took two parallel swings domestically and globally, each approach laden with risk. In America, the studio decided to offer the film only to Disney+ subscribers for an extra $30. Mulan was also put in theaters abroad, given the lower COVID-19 rates in other countries; Disney's hope was that the film's story (rooted in Chinese myth) and its array of Chinese stars (Liu Yifei, Donnie Yen, Gong Li, Jet Li, and others) would help make it a box-office success in China.Neither bet really paid off. American viewers probably balked at the idea of paying $30 on top of a Disney+ subscription fee. The film may have also been affected by the revelation that parts were shot in Xinjiang, the region of China where Uighur Muslims have been imprisoned in internment camps, although Disney issued no official apology, which would have angered the Chinese government. Disney's CFO, Christine McCarthy, nonetheless acknowledged that the controversy "generated a lot of issues for us." Another possible reason for the film's underwhelming performance in China? Lack of interest. China's movie industry already makes plenty of splendid medieval epics along the same lines as Mulan, and Disney's remake didn't offer anything especially new.Stateside, one could argue that Disney made the right gamble. Tenet is playing in mostly empty theaters and has grossed $36 million domestically; even the lower end of the estimates cited by Yahoo would suggest that Mulan made twice as much online. Because Disney released the film exclusively on its own platform, it gets to keep all of that money, as opposed to having to split it with cinemas or with companies such as Apple and Amazon. Even so, the film needs to make far more than $90 million to cover its budget, so the overseas release was crucial. But Mulan stumbled-its grosses dropped a disastrous 72 percent in its second weekend in China.[Read: The question that ~Mulan' doesn't ask]Tenet has had the opposite problem. While its theatrical play in America hasn't worked, its overseas numbers have been tremendous, making the film's global total roughly $250 million in the past month. That number could plausibly tick up above $400 million as the fall wears on, which would be a huge win for Warner Bros., given the circumstances. Still, neither the Mulan nor the Tenet approach has been entirely successful, and existential concerns about the health of America's cinemas persist as moviegoers remain skittish about returning to theaters in the middle of a public-health crisis.The simple fact is that no major studio has been nimble enough to get around the pandemic's biggest obstacles. This is partly due to Hollywood's increasing reliance on blockbusters. In decades past, Hollywood churned out plenty of cheaper movies that relied on word of mouth and could play for months on end, slowly racking up profits. But modern tentpole releases such as Mulan and Tenet are designed to have spectacular global rollouts, packing theaters and securing massive opening-weekend grosses. Think hundreds of millions of dollars rather than merely tens of millions.Hollywood knows how to function in only one way anymore, and that has made the industry devastatingly vulnerable this year. Funnily enough, the best-case scenario is probably something along the lines of Tenet or Mulan, films that simply break even. Until the U.S. returns to normal (which might not be until late 2021), cinema will have to take many more swings and misses. In the meantime, audiences get the worst of both worlds: They're being pressured by studios to return to theaters in droves and being charged big bucks to watch new movies at home, all while waiting for life to be good again.Load-Date: September 23, 2020End of Document

Bans could be lifted if necessary," Commerce said.Read also: Banksy lost legal battle for the rights to one of his most iconic graffitiTikTok, which belongs to the Chinese group ByteDance, had been operating under conditions in the United States since early August.Trump, who accuses him of spying for the Chinese government, then signed a decree to demand the sale of his U.S. activities by September 20, under penalty of ban in the country.American giants Microsoft and Walmart made an offer to buy those TikTok activities, but ByteDance turned it down on Sunday.California's Oracle software group submitted an offer to become TikTok's "trusted technology partner," although no details have been disclosed."Although the threats posed by WeChat and TikTok are not identical, they are similar. Each collects significant amounts of user data," Commerce said.The WeChat platform, which belongs to Chinese giant Tencent, is ubiquitous in chinese life for messaging, remote payments and bookings, among other uses.Load-Date: September 19, 2020End of Document

Pro-democracy activists are again calling on people to boycott 'Mulan'CNN WireSeptember 4, 2020 Friday 8:05 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 482 wordsDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  Disney's live-action remake of "Mulan" is now released -- but some people won't be watching.Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong are reigniting calls to boycott the film, now joined by activists in Thailand and Taiwan. The calls erupted last year when the film's lead actress Liu Yifei expressed support for Hong Kong police, who anti-government demonstrators accuse of using excessive force to quell unrest."This film is released today. But because Disney kowtows to Beijing, and because Liu Yifei openly and proudly endorses police brutality in Hong Kong, I urge everyone who believes in human rights to #BoycottMulan," prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong tweeted on Friday.Yifei, a Chinese-born US citizen, waded into the conversation last year at the height of the protests in Hong Kong, which began as largely peaceful demonstrations and eventually morphed into frequent clashes between protesters and police."I support the Hong Kong police. You can all attack me now. What a shame for Hong Kong," she posted on Weibo in August 2019.Calls to boycott "Mulan" followed immediately after and soon enough, #BoycottMulan was trending on Twitter -- which is banned in China. Meanwhile, comments on Yifei's post on Weibo, the dominant social platform in China, echoed her support for Hong Kong police and Beijing.International audiences are key for 'Mulan'Now after multiple delays due to the coronavirus pandemic, "Mulan" is out on Disney+ in the US and is set to hit theaters abroad soon. International audiences, particularly in China, are a key part of the film's theatrical strategy.But tensions are still high in Hong Kong after Beijing imposed a controversial national security law on the city in June. And now, renewed calls to boycott "Mulan" have also spread to activists in Thailand and Taiwan -- propelled in large part by the #MilkTeaAlliance, an online movement uniting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, Thailand and Taiwan with concerns about China's influence in the region.In recent weeks, Thailand has been seeing demonstrations with thousands of people calling for reforms of the country's monarchy. Many protesters in Hong Kong have expressed support for the movement, while protesters in Thailand and Taiwan are standing with those in Hong Kong who are calling to boycott "Mulan.""I invite everyone to #boycottMulan #banMulan to make Disney and the Chinese government know that state violence against the people is unacceptable," Thai student activist Netiwit Chotiphatphaisal tweeted, according to The Guardian.But in China, where people were supportive of Yifei's comments last year, the film is expected to be a hit with audiences.

TikTok's ban and our waning freedom to choose our entertainmentDaily Princetonian: Princeton UniversityOctober 8, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 686 wordsByline: Kelsey JiBodyTikTok, a popular video-sharing app, was due to disappear from Apple and Android App stores last Sunday, Sept. 27, under President Donald Trump's executive order. Just hours before midnight, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols temporarily blocked the ban.If the government doesn't reach a deal about how the app handles user data and privacy by Nov. 12, however, the app will become completely inaccessible. Over the past few years, since ByteDance bought Musical.ly in 2017 and through its recent partnership with Oracle and Walmart, the app has brought entertainment and comfort to millions of Tiktokers - a large portion of them high school and college students - through videos of adorable cats and smiling babies.To others, the app has served as an important source of income, especially during the coronavirus pandemic. And despite the Trump administration "pushing for the narrative" of forcing China to "surrender the American operations" of TikTok, the download ban would have been a no-win situation - not for the company, certainly not for its users, and not even for the U.S. government. But above all, the party that would suffer the heaviest loss from such a ban is ­­­the global online community.Much remains uncertain regarding how ByteDance and Oracle will overcome discrepancies over the app's ownership - ByteDance claims 80 percent ownership, while Oracle holds that the Chinese government shall have none. In the face of such uncertainty, competing apps such as Dubsmash, Facebook's Reels, and Triller have rushed to fill the void.Surely the TikTokers themselves have nothing to gain, either. Fears over the app's safety and the uncertainty of its future have driven TikTokers to switch to "safer" platforms. TikTok-famous accounts risk losing followers and income in these moves. Almost 60,000 users have signed the ongoing petition to "keep TikTok in the United States" because, once deleted - by mistake or a moment's determination - there's no going back.Does the Trump administration really gain from its ban on TikTok? The executive branch ostensibly ordered the ban on TikTok to protect national security. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has scrutinized TikTok for over a year and found nothing notable.A recent report by the Central Intelligence Agency also found no evidence of Chinese intelligence authorities intercepting data. Counterintuitively, the ban has created a higher risk; hackers have used the public's panic over TikTok's download ban to create scam apps such as Tik Tok Pro to install spyware and steal credentials.Who, then, is the real winner in the deal?What happens to TikTok today happened to many apps yesterday and may happen to many more in the future. What does this all spell for the future? Social media offers a worldwide platform, which facilitates global entertainment and communications. Mistrust among countries and deteriorating international relations, however, are pushing countries to halt the influence of foreign social media apps in their own country. Such virtual boundaries entirely defeat the purpose of the worldwide web.This raises many more questions and concerns. Are we headed toward a future in which countries resort to only their own apps? Are even the apps we use becoming politicized? Will the government have the power to decide which apps its citizens have access to on their phones?People are much more than politics, and their online activity should not be determined by their countries' political standpoint. The Trump administration took unprecedented action against TikTok - a presidential executive order that banned access to a single app.Like puppetry, the government is the one pulling on the general public, whose own choice over the entertainment that they enjoy are now not theirs to make. Especially with a large portion of TikTokers in their high school and college years, is this not a form of political indoctrination of its own?Get the best of 'the Prince' delivered straight to your inbox.

The global market for Temporary Power is projected to reach US$8 billion by 2025; driven by the growth in construction projects and the need for site preparation with the necessary infrastructure that includes electrical power supply. Temporary power is critical for construction projects to power onsite construction machinery and tools such as powered tools, and lighting etc.GlobeNewswireOctober 21, 2020 Wednesday 6:42 PM PTCopyright 2020 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: MARKET RESEARCH REPORTSLength: 5922 wordsBodyNew York, Oct.  21, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report "Global Temporary Power Industry" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p05799785/?utm_source=GNW  required to support the construction activities, site workforce and equipment. Residential construction, commercial construction and public works require electricity to be delivered onsite. Temporary power can be provided in two basic configurations i.e. overhead and underground. Long-term projects with higher electrical loads and safety issues often require underground provision of temporary power via underground placement of electrical cables, trenching, and wiring. The market is therefore benefiting from the recovering construction activity in most countries across the global and the huge opportunities in the retrofit market driven by global `green` building standards will also influence growth in the market. Recovery in construction which began in 2011 in the aftermath of the great recession is continuing even today, albeit with slight bumps and turns. This is largely because of the success with which the industry has and continues to evolve and adapt to changes in labor availability, technology and economic turmoil. Digital technologies for concept, design, engineering and building; rise of AR/VR in digital construction; connected construction; smart on-site equipment; increase in modular and prefabricated construction; use of Building Information Monitoring (BIM), automation , robotics, AI, Drones and 3D Printing etc. have helped the industry fight the changing economic realities and remain afloat. Healthy outlook for global investments in construction technologies (Contech) also bodes well for the overall outlook for the construction industry in 2020.  The rise of smart cities will emerge as the single most important factor driving demand for temporary power in the construction industry. Growth of megacities will fuel residential and infrastructure construction projects worldwide. The over 9,280 ongoing megacity construction projects worldwide create robust demand temporary job site power. Dubai flaunts the highest megacity pipeline project value and will remain an attractive market for temporary power solutions. In addition to construction, demand for temporary power solutions and services is also benefiting from the increase in trade shows/fairs, exhibitions, conventions and special events being organized. Growing competition and increased focus on innovation and new product development are stepping up the importance of showcasing products and services to leverage new business opportunities. Number of exhibition venues globally stands at an approximate 1,300 covering over 36.8 million sqm of space. The scenario benefits demand for temporary electrical power supply and distribution to support digital display areas, special lighting, sales demos and presentations, live entertainment production and operation of equipment such as lifts, scissor lifts and forklifts, among others. The United States, Europe, Latin America. Middle East and Africa represent large markets worldwide with a combined share of 76% of the market. China ranks as one of fastest growing markets with a CAGR of 12.8% over the analysis period supported by the Chinese government`s plans to step up infrastructure investment as a way of boosting its slowing economy.Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05799785/?utm_source=GNW I.

Sweden bans Huawei and ZTE equipment for new 5G networksCE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 20, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 305 wordsBodySweden banned the use of equipment from Chinese technology firms Huawei and ZTE for their new high-speed 5G wireless networks, after a senior security official rated China as one of the european country's biggest threats.Swedish telecoms regulator announced Tuesday that four wireless operators bidding on frequencies at an upcoming spectrum auction for new 5G networks should not use Huawei or ZTE equipment.Wireless operators planning to use existing telecommunications infrastructure for 5G networks will also need to remove any existing Huawei or ZTE equipment, the Swedish Postal and Telecommunications Authority added.The agency said the new conditions are based on assessments from the Swedish military and security service. Huawei said it was "surprised and disappointed" by the announcement of the new rules.Sweden is the latest country to ban Huawei equipment from being used in the construction of 5G networks. The decision is likely to increase tensions between the Chinese government and several Western powers.U.S. authorities have been conducting an intense lobbying campaign in Europe to persuade allied governments to reject the company, saying China's communist rulers could force Huawei to facilitate cyber-espousing actions. The company has systematically denied such signs.The ban means more opportunities for Huawei's main rivals, such as Swedish company Ericsson and Finnish Nokia.The new 5G networks, which are expected to lead to a wave of innovation such as smart factories and remote-controlled surgeries, are considered a critical infrastructure.The head of Sweden's national security service, Klas Friberg, said Tuesday that foreign powers have stepped up their intelligence activity in recent years, so 5G networks must be built safely from the start.___Kelvin Chan is in: https://twitter.com/chanmanLoad-Date: October 21, 2020End of Document

Commerce Dept. announces ban on TikTok and WeChat, citing 'malicious collection' of U.S. citizens' dataInside Cyber SecuritySeptember 22, 2020Copyright 2020 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights ReservedLength: 692 wordsBody September 18, 2020 | Charlie Mitchell The Commerce Department today banned transactions "relating to mobile applications WeChat and TikTok," Chinese-owned services that the U.S. says can be used by Beijing to collect data on U.S. citizens for espionage and other purposes, including fueling China's artificial intelligence initiatives."The Chinese Communist Party has demonstrated the means and motives to use these apps to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the U.S. Today's announced prohibitions, when combined, protect users in the U.S. by eliminating access to these applications and significantly reducing their functionality," Commerce said.The Commerce actions follow executive orders issued on Aug. 6 determining "that the apps capture vast swaths of information from U.S. users, leaving the data vulnerable to CCP access for nefarious purposes."John Demers, national security chief at the Justice Department, last month said the bans help counter the Chinese government's "appetite for large volumes of personal data" about U.S. citizens and others, as Beijing tries to leverage artificial intelligence as part of its espionage and national security strategy.Video-sharing app TikTok in August announced it is suing the Trump administration over the executive order blocking the service from transactions with its parent company Byte Dance, arguing the order violates its right of due process under the U.S. Constitution.Commerce was directed in the EO "to identify transactions within 45 days to protect national security and the private data of millions of people across the country. Today's announced prohibitions fulfill the President's direction and mitigate national security risks."Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement: "Today's actions prove once again that President Trump will do everything in his power to guarantee our national security and protect Americans from the threats of the Chinese Communist Party. At the President's direction, we have taken significant action to combat China's malicious collection of American citizens' personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations."Commerce said WeChat and TikTok both collect "vast swaths of data from users, including network activity, location data, and browsing and search histories. Each is an active participant in China's civil-military fusion and is subject to mandatory cooperation with the intelligence services of the CCP. This combination results in the use of WeChat and TikTok creating unacceptable risks to our national security."Commerce as of Sept. 20 is prohibiting:1. Any provision of service to distribute or maintain the WeChat or TikTok mobile applications, constituent code, or application updates through an online mobile application store in the U.S.;2. Any provision of services through the WeChat mobile application for the purpose of transferring funds or processing payments within the U.S.Further, the department said,As of September 20, 2020, for WeChat and as of November 12, 2020, for TikTok, the following transactions are prohibited:1. Any provision of internet hosting services enabling the functioning or optimization of the mobile application in the U.S.;2.

Organized crime, beneficiary of economic reopeningCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 14, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 486 wordsBodyAccording to an article that appeared a few months ago in www.vice.com, the Covid-19 pandemic strongly affected drug trafficking around the world and especially the Mexican cartels that control it.The suspension of most economic and government activities in most countries complicated the business for those who produce, export or use illegal or regulated drugs.The article published by VICE, titled Sinaloa Cartel Drug Traffickers Explain Why Coronavirus Is Very Bad for Their Business, states that in mid-March, which is when we all started taking the severity of the pandemic seriously, the main bosses and allies of the aforementioned cartel received a message via WhatsApp from Ismael , head of the so-called Pacific Cartel, where he ordered that from that moment on and due to the scarcity of inputs to manufacture it, a half kilo of methamphetamine (crystal), all had to sell it at 15,000 pesos, that is six times what its price was before the new coronavirus made its appearance.Depending on the source that provided this information to VICE, the message warned that anyone who did not obey the order would be responsible for the consequences.Reporter Keegan Hamilton's article explains that, as in other industries, "the cartel's supply chain is complex and international. The raw chemical ingredients used for the manufacture of methamphetamine and fentanyl come mainly from China" and that "due to coronavirus, there is very little distribution or import from China to Mexico City" and adds that "all industries that depend on China for labor or raw materials have been affected, especially companies that manufacture medical supplies and pharmaceuticals , which are essential for treating sick people and containing the spread of the virus. Drug cartels have not been immune."Previously, fentanyl came directly to the United States from China through the international postal system. By closing this route and limiting its production and export by the Chinese government, the manufacturers of their raw materials chose to sell them directly to the Mexican narcos that control the sea and air ports, and the customs of our country.That is why the closure of activities caused by the pandemic complicated the Sinaloa Cartel and its competitors for months. Overnight they stopped receiving the chemicals required to manufacture the methamphetamine and fentanyl demanded by their customers.Not only have narcos resented the effects of the pandemic, but organizations such as the Tepito Cartel, which stopped receiving Chinese counterfeit luxury goods such as women's shoes and bags sold without control in the country, have also suffered a drop in income.Opening up the national economy will benefit some sectors, including organized crime. This will be reflected in an increase in the number of crimes recorded in the coming months.Facebook: Eduardo J Ruiz-Healy Instagram: ruizhealy Site: ruizhealytimes.comLoad-Date: September 15, 2020End of Document

Pending the verdict on ByteDance and Oracle, Trump will ban TikTok downloads starting SundayCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 18, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 487 wordsBodyThe U.S. Department of Commerce will issue an order this Friday banning users in the country from downloading both the Chinese-owned WeChat messaging app Tencent and the popular TikTok as of September 20.As forward by Reuters and the Financial Times, TikTok's removal from the various app stores on this side of the Atlantic could still be overturned by US President Donald Trump if it ended up giving the green light to the agreement presented by ByteDance, the application's Chinese matrix, and Oracle.Both companies and other stakeholders, such as Walmart, Sequoia Capital, or General Atlantic have proposed to create a new U.S.-based company to address national security concerns that instigated Trump's August decrees to force a sale or cease its U.S. activities. According to the latest information, Oracle and Walmart will have a significant stake in the new company that encompasses much of TikTok's operations. This new entity is expected to go public next year in a U.S. stock market. The revised plan already approved by the Treasury Department requires the new TikTok to have an independent council, overseen by the U.S. government, that is made up entirely of U.S. citizens. This council would include a national security committee, led by a U.S. data security expert, which will be the primary contact with the U.S. Foreign Investment Committee (Cfius).The transaction does not include the sale of algorithms, so ByteDance believes that China will give the go-ahead to the agreement as it would not violate Beijing's new technology export law. It has been stated, however, that Oracle will have access to the source code of these algorithms to determine how they work and to ensure that they do not hide any gateways to unwanted entities, including the Chinese government. For his part, Trump must still decide in the coming hours whether to support or block the proposal. Pending an official announcement, commerce's order, which also affects WeChat, Tencent's messaging service, will prohibit the Apple app store, Google Play, and other platforms from offering downloads of them in the US.The order will not prohibit U.S. companies from doing business with WeChat outside the US, which is a relief for U.S. companies like Walmart and Starbucks, which use WeChat to facilitate the purchase of their products among Chinese consumers.Nor will it prevent transactions with other Tencent Holdings businesses, including its online gaming operations, and will not prohibit Apple, Google and other platforms from allowing downloads of TikTok or WeChat in other countries outside U.S. jurisdiction. These bans come in response to the two trump-issued executive orders on August 6 that offered commerce 45 days to determine which transactions to block after considering this apps to pose a threat to the country's national security. This deadline expires on Sunday.commentsforum0WhatsApp  Facebook  TwitterLinkedin       Load-Date: September 19, 2020End of Document

TikTok hopes three-party agreement between ByteDance, Oracle, Walmart to resolve United States concernsStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 20, 2020 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 514 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyThe Trump administration says that WeChat is a national security threat, as it allegedly sends massive amounts of data to the Chinese government.A source tells CNBC's Alex Sherman that with the investor makeup of ByteDance, TikTok should end up with a 53% USA ownership.Oracle and Walmart have rights to buy 12.5% and 7.5% respectively of a newly established TikTok Global under an agreement that won the approval of President Donald Trump, the person said, asking not to be named discussing private negotiations.The government on Saturday delayed a plan to prohibit downloads of TikTok, the popular video-sharing app.Read Also: The U.S.to Ban TikTok, WeChat: What Difference Would it Make?The new company, TikTok Global, will have a majority of USA directors along with a USA chief executive and security expert.Mr Trump said the new TikTok company will be based in Texas.IPL 2020, Match 2At the time of writing this article, there hasn't been any official confirmation on Gayle's absence. I'm confident and so is the entire team, great opportunity to go out and play some cricket.Trump said the "security will be 100 percent" and that the companies would use separate cloud servers.U.S. President Donald Trump said Saturday that he supports a proposed deal "in concept" that could pave the way for Chinese video-sharing app TikTok to continue to operate in the United States on the grounds that security and data privacy concerns have been resolved.The Commerce Department simultaneously created a window for the potential deal by delaying the ban on TikTok's app by a week, until the end of September 27th.Hacktivist group Anonymous has shared their sentiments regarding the issue, agreeing with the reports, and even calling the short-video app as a "Chinese malware", but the company has remained adamant that they haven't stolen or used any information against TikTok users in the United States.Four of the five board members of TikTok Global will reportedly be Americans, including Walmart CEO Doug McMillon.US Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler has blocked a Commerce Department order requiring that Apple and Google remove WeChat from their app stores starting late Sunday from taking effect.China's long-expected "unreliable entities list" is seen as a weapon for Beijing to retaliate against the United States, which has used its own "entity list" to shut Chinese telecom giant Huawei out of the U.S. market, in addition to the recent moves against TikTok and WeChat. Oracle will now house all of the United States user data to ensure that nothing nefarious happens to it, though security breaches are still very much possible at this point in time. In a filing early on Sunday, a judge issued a preliminary injunction that blocked Commerce order that would have prevented United States companies from conducting transactions with the company. The ban was to go into effect Sunday, but the order has been delayed until September 27 at 11:59 p.m. local time, the Treasury Department said after Trump said he approved Oracle Corp.'s bid for the USA operations of TikTok "in concept".Load-Date: September 21, 2020End of Document

Oracle and Walmart agreed to take stakes in TikTok Global of 12.5 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively.On Monday, Oracle said TikTok's ByteDance property would be distributed to ByteDance investors and that the Beijing-based company will not have a stake in TikTok Global.On the other hand, media in this Asian country called it "an American trap" and a "dirty and deceptive trick."According to Bloomberg, two of China's most prominent state-backed media spokesmen denounced the deal."What the United States has done to TikTok is almost the same as a gangster forcing an irrational and unfair trade deal to a legitimate company," the China Daily newspaper wrote in an opinion paper wednesday.Hu Xijin, influential editor-in-chief of the Global Times, tweeted that Beijing would probably not approve the current agreement, as it jeopardizes China's national security.With information from Reuters and BloombergLoad-Date: September 25, 2020End of Document

IMRAN: 'Mulan' filming, blatant ignorance of human rights abuseDaily Targum: Rutgers UniversitySeptember 21, 2020 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1098 wordsByline: Maryam ImranBodyIMRAN: 'Mulan' filming, blatant ignorance of human rights abuseColumn: A Brown Girl's PerspectiveSeptember 21, 2020 12:00am|By Maryam ImranPhoto by Disney |The Daily TargumIf you have not watched it already, skip out on "Mulan." Disney's handling of the filming process has been despicable, to say the least.On Sept. 4, the highly anticipated live-action remake of "Mulan" was released on Disney+, available to subscribers who pay the premier access fee.Like many others, I was extremely eager to watch the film. Mulan happened to be one of my favorite Disney princesses, and the original 1998 movie remains as one of my favorite Disney films of all time. I loved everything about it, from the heroism and selflessness displayed by the female lead, to its comedic moments, beautiful plot and entertaining musical numbers.And because the original film held such a dear place in my heart, I was desperately hoping that the live-action remake would not end up being another cinematic disaster like its predecessors (namely, "Dumbo" and "The Lion King").But while "Mulan" ended up doing pretty well at the box office and garnered a fair number of positive reviews, it turned out to be exactly what I feared it would be: a complete and utter disappointment.When I say "disappointment," I am not referring to the content of the movie itself. In fact, I have not even seen the movie, and it is for the following reason that I probably will not end up watching it at all.Upon the release of "Mulan," social media users have noticed that in the ending credits, Disney thanks several government entities in Xinjiang, a place where mass human rights abuses are taking place, for helping it make the film.For those who do not know, here is a brief description of what is happening in Xinjiang. For the past few years, as many as 2 million Muslims have been rounded up by government authorities and placed in internment camps throughout the Xinjiang province, where they are tortured for months, endure forced labor and are coerced into giving up their religious practices.They are susceptible to brainwashing and often endure beatings, unhygienic conditions, inadequate access to food and water and according to some, are subjected to harassment and sexual assault. Additionally, women are forbidden from wearing religious head coverings and men from growing long beards. Dozens of mosques have also been demolished or vandalized.But the list does not end there. China has also been accused of slashing birth rates among Uighurs by forcing women to take contraceptives and to have abortions, even as members of the Han majority are encouraged to have more children. It is truly despicable and can only be described as a genocide.Amid all the backlash, Disney's Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy had this to say about the controversy."It has generated a lot of publicity," she said, according to Deadline. "Let me just put something into context. The real facts are that 'Mulan' was primarily shot - almost in entirety - in New Zealand. In an effort to accurately depict some of the unique landscape and geography of the country of China for this period drama, we filmed scenery in 20 different locations in China. It's common knowledge that, in order to film in China, you have to be granted permission. That permission comes from the central government.""I would just leave it at that," she concluded, "but (the Uighur controversy) has generated a lot of issues for us."Nowhere in her response does she acknowledge the human rights abuses that are taking place in Xinjiang, but actively tries to defend her company's decision to film there. Of course, no one is arguing that it is wrong to thank the people who allowed you to film in their location.The issue is where you are filming and the kinds of people you choose to be affiliated with in the process of making your movie. Filming in Xinjiang was wrong, and McCarthy's tone-deaf response to the backlash for "Mulan" does not serve as a good look for Disney.Not to mention, a multi-billion-dollar company like Disney could afford to film anywhere in the world, right? So why Xinjiang? Why in a place where human rights abuses have been clearly documented, especially back in 2018, when filming for this movie first began?McCarthy says that it was to "accurately depict some of the unique landscape and geography of the country of China for this period drama," something that, apparently, can only be accomplished from filming scenes in Xinjiang and is clearly more of a pressing issue than that of human rights.Disney's decision to film near these internment camps and to thank the government entities responsible for these oppressive practices is indefensible. McCarthy's response to the controversy demonstrates a complete lack of regard toward China's crackdown of Uighur Muslims and suggests that Disney prefers corporate greed over morality.This is only one controversy that has sparked a "Boycott Mulan" campaign on social media. In addition, the lead actress, Liu Yifei, has been criticized for openly supporting the Hong Kong police in its crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, despite playing a character that fights for equality and freedom. Talk about being tone-deaf.While Disney has yet to release a formal statement in response to these issues, these are the reasons why I cannot bring myself to watch the film, and I encourage others to refrain from watching it as well.I refuse to support a corporation that chooses to kowtow to the Chinese government and turn a blind eye to the genocidal practices against ethnic minorities. Disney needs to take accountability for this and vow to do better in the future.Maryam Imran is a School of Social Work junior majoring in social work.

Trump raises concerns over ByteDance's role in possible TikTok dealPolitico.comSeptember 17, 2020 Thursday 2:35 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 470 wordsHighlight: "I mean, just conceptually, I can tell you I don't like that," Trump told reporters.BodyPresident Donald Trump expressed concern Wednesday with any deal involving TikTok that would allow its Chinese parent company to retain control over the video-sharing app - casting doubt on the company's latest effort to keep the app alive in the U.S.The president issued an executive order last month that would ban TikTok, arguing it could potentially funnel data belonging to its 100 million American users to China. The company has denied it would do so.This week, Beijing-based ByteDance proposed creating a global headquarters in the U.S. and bringing on American tech company Oracle as its "trusted technology partner." The exact ownership structure is not yet clear, though some media outlets have reported ByteDance would keep a majority stake in the company."I mean, just conceptually, I can tell you I don't like that," Trump told reporters. "So, if that's the case, I'm not going to be happy with that. Assuming that ByteDance is China, which I think it probably is."Trump said he would be briefed on the deal Thursday morning and had only seen media reports about its terms. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., an inter-agency panel led by the Treasury Department, reviewed the proposal at its meeting Tuesday and is slated to make a recommendation to Trump this week."They're giving me studies on the deal," he said. "It has to be 100 percent as far as national security is concerned. And, no, I'm not prepared to sign off on anything. I have to see the deal."Republican allies in the Senate, including. Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) have pushed back on any deal with would not remove ByteDance from TikTok's ownership structure.Trump signed an executive order Aug. 6 requiring ByteDance to stop doing business in the U.S. effective this Sunday out of concern about its alleged ties to the Chinese government. TikTok has denied providing data to Beijing and has pledged it would never do so.Nevertheless, Trump then issued a second executive order giving the company time to find a U.S. buyer for TikTok. Those negotiations led to a proposal involving Oracle, and potentially other U.S. firms, taking on a role in the company's U.S. operations but not purchasing them outright.Trump has previous said he wants the Treasury Department to collect money on any deal, arguing his executive orders made a sale possible and the government should be compensated. On Thursday, he expressed disbelief that lawyers have determined such payments are unprecedented."Amazingly, I find that you're not allowed to do that. You're not allowed to accept money," Trump said."What kind of a thing is this? If they're willing to make big payments to the government, they're not allowed because there's no way of doing that. There's no legal path to doing that," he continued.Load-Date: September 17, 2020End of Document

All people spoke on condition of anonymity due to the active nature of the discussions.The White House referred questions to Commerce, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Representatives of TikTok, Microsof and Oracle did not respond immediately to requests for comment.TikTok has been embroiled in a clash between the two most important powers in the world. Trump has stepped up his campaign of pressure on China before what is augured will be a much-contested presidential election in November. U.S. officials have criticized the security and privacy practices of the app, suggesting that user data collected through the app could be shared with the Chinese government.The actual deadline for ByteDance remains an open question in the U.S. due to a series of statements and orders from Trump that have generated confusion. While Trump has said he wants a deal by September 15, the ban on TikTok's U.S. operations he signed last month in an attempt to force a sale requires the company to act before September 20.Documentation implementing such a ban, possibly under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows the president to regulate international trade in response to any unusual threat to the country, will be published in the Federal Register near September 20, Bloomberg reported on September 2.A subsequent order issued by Trump on August 14 on the recommendation of an inter-agency national security panel requires ByteDance to sell TikTok's business in the U.S. within 90 days—giving the company time until after the November 3 election—further clouding the schedule for TikTok's sale.The parties are still rushing to submit a preliminary agreement to the White House before this month's deadline, although no agreement can be finalated prior to Beijing's approval. ByteDance may also withdraw completely from a sale if it determines that it cannot satisfy both governments and bidders as well as its own shareholders.Original Note:Trump Team Eyes Giving TikTok's Owners More Time to Line Up Sale©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: September 11, 2020End of Document

Editorial | We need to talk about WeChatThe Pitt News: University of Pittsburgh - Pittsburgh CampusSeptember 21, 2020 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 498 wordsBodyOutrage over President Donald Trump's attempts to ban TikTok in the United States has erupted on social media over the past few months. But there's another app, WeChat, that the administration is looking to place restrictions on. This proposed ban has gotten far less media attention, but if carried out, will cause far more harm.WeChat is a Chinese-owned communication app that, amongst other things, allows people to stay in touch with friends, family and other loved ones who reside in China without paying hefty international fees. WeChat had over 3.3 million users as of August, according to the Washington Post. A federal judge halted the Trump administration's ban on TikTok and WeChat on Sunday morning, which, if implemented, would have blocked people from downloading the application to their devices. But it's clear that this is still an ongoing battle.The administration's proposed ban on WeChat is harmful to families who need the app to communicate, and it's yet another example of Trump's blatant xenophobia. Even though banning WeChat won't directly affect the lives of many Americans the way banning TikTok will, we can't let WeChat slide under the radar.This all began on Aug. 6, when the Trump administration released an executive order calling for the bans. The order cited the Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives Trump the ability to regulate international commerce in the case of "unusual or extraordinary threats," according to the Los Angeles Times. The administration said it believed that WeChat and TikTok are national security threats because they could be giving U.S. user information to the Chinese government. While it's true that the apps do collect data which could be exploited, there's little clear evidence that this is being acted upon. It's more likely that these bans are being driven by the administration's long-standing anti-China stance.Since most popular communication apps used in the United States are banned in China, including WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Telegram, people have little means of communication with others in China. Many of the alternatives are complicated and may be inaccessible for some people, such as getting a new SIM card to talk with people in China. This is also bad news for journalists, like those who work for major news sources such as the New York Times, who use the app to communicate with people in China."Bans on WeChat and TikTok violate the First Amendment by restricting our ability to communicate and conduct important transactions," the American Civil Liberties Union wrote on Instagram. "Restricting WeChat in particular will harm many communities with loved ones in China ... The move reflects Trump's xenophobic and racist agenda."Losing TikTok would be unfortunate and certainly unfun, but losing WeChat would be detrimental to people communicating with family members and loved ones, as well as journalists. We need to focus on both, even if all U.S. citizens aren't directly affected by it.Load-Date: September 21, 2020End of Document

Is NIO (NYSE:NIO) Stock an EV Company Worth Watching?American Banking and Market NewsSeptember 24, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 American Banking and Market News All Rights ReservedLength: 849 wordsBodyThere are so many advantages associated with Electric Vehicles, it s only a matter of time before we see widespread adoption of them around the world. With benefits like lower costs, less maintenance, environmental tax credits, and eco-friendliness, it makes sense that there are plenty of investors interested in EV stocks at this time. However, with so many competing companies and several businesses facing controversy, navigating the EV sector can be challenging. That s why it pays to dive into what makes a company compelling before taking action. • NIO s Position In EV Market Should Not Be Overlooked One EV company in China has attracted a lot of attention and has many investors wondering if it s worth a look. NIO (NYSE:NIO ) stock is up over 500% this year and is seeing solid growth as it works towards profitability. Is this a company that can compete with Tesla and grow into a dominant EV company in China or is it fool s gold? Let s take a deeper look at NIO below and decide whether or not it should be on investor s watch lists going forward. China s Answer to Tesla• NIO Limited (NYSE: NIO) Stock is Triggering a Blow Off Top NIO is an interesting company because it operates in the world s largest automobile market. The China-based company was founded in 2014 and designs, manufactures, and sells smart and connected electric vehicles. NIO is investing in next-generation technology like autonomous driving and artificial intelligence as well. While it s easy to draw comparisons to leading EV company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA ), NIO is at a completely different stage in its business cycle. The company is working towards profitability and is seeing strong growth, but it still has a long road ahead. It s worth noting that NIO has an advantage in its home-country during a time when U.S. companies face risks related to heightened trade tensions between the U.S. and China. There are currently two premium electric SUVs that the company offers, the ES8 and the ES6. Each vehicle is priced starting at around $51,000. While the Tesla Model 3 is the best selling electric vehicle in China at this time, there s certainly room for another EV company to succeed. China is the largest automobile market in the world and it appears that the country wants to become the global leader in Electric Vehicles. The country has announced new policies such as extending EV tax breaks and investments in battery charging infrastructure that could accelerate the growth of electric vehicle use. All of this bodes well for NIO, which is why it is a noteworthy company at this time. Battery Swap TechnologyOne of the interesting things to note about NIO is that it allows its drivers to swap batteries in 5 minutes and continue driving versus having to wait hours for them to charge. Batteries are one of the big limitations of electric vehicles at this time, as many drivers still prefer the convenience of going to the gas station versus finding a battery charging station and waiting. Nio is handling the issue by launching a unique Battery as a Service (BaaS) subscription model that allows owners to sign up for different battery sizes and get a fresh battery pack installed when needed. NIO sells some of its vehicles without a battery at a discount, which can knock about $10,000 off the price of the purchase. Drivers can then have a battery installed in their vehicle in minutes at one of NIO s Power Swap stations. While most EV companies are working on improving the lifespan of batteries and how quickly they charge, NIO s battery swap technology offers an interesting solution to one of the biggest downsides of electric vehicles.    Strong Q2 NumbersWhile the COVID-19 crisis hit NIO s sales hard in the first half of the year and the company was dealing with liquidity issues , it appears there has been a strong turnaround when you take a look at the company s Q2 numbers. Revenues grew by 146% year-over-year in Q2 to $526.4 million and the company narrowed its net loss by 64.2% year-over-year. The company s balance sheet is looking a lot better now and NIO recently took advantage of a strong rally in the stock by issuing a $1.7 billion secondary stock offering. Perhaps the most impressive figure from the company s Q2 numbers was the 120% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries, which crossed the 10,000 per quarter mark for the first time in the company s history. NIO reported 3,965 deliveries in August, which was a record month for the company and a sign that vehicle sales are rebounding quickly in China. It will be interesting to see how things play out for NIO during the remainder of the year from an earnings and sales standpoint. Final ThoughtsAlthough there is a lot of competition in the EV space , NIO is a company that is worth watching going forward. The company reported impressive Q2 earnings and appears to have some backing from the Chinese government that could lead to more upside for the stock. Keep NIO on your watch list and consider adding shares if you believe that the company has a chance to become a key player in the Chinese EV market. Load-Date: September 23, 2020End of Document

Federal judge postpones Trump ban on popular app TikTokAssociated Press Financial WireSeptember 28, 2020 Monday 1:15 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; DOMESTIC NEWSLength: 905 wordsByline: ANNE D'INNOCENZIO and MATT O'BRIEN, AP Business WritersDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge on Sunday postponed a Trump administration order that would have banned the popular video sharing app TikTok from U.S. smartphone app stores around midnight.A more comprehensive ban remains scheduled for November, about a week after the presidential election. The judge, Carl Nichols of the U.S District Court for the District of Columbia, did not agree to postpone the later ban.The ruling followed an emergency hearing Sunday morning in which lawyers for TikTok argued that the administration's app-store ban would infringe on First Amendment rights and do irreparable harm to the business.Earlier this year, President Donald Trump declared that TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, was a threat to national security and that it must either sell its U.S. operations to American companies or be barred from the country.TikTok is still scrambling to firm up a deal tentatively struck a week ago in which it would partner with Oracle, a huge database-software company, and Walmart in an effort to win the blessing of both the Chinese and American governments. In the meantime, it is fighting to keep the app available in the U.S.TikTok said in a statement that it was pleased with the court ruling and continues to work to turn its deal proposal into an actual agreement. The Commerce Department, which is responsible for the specific orders banning TikTok, said it will comply with the judge's order but intends to vigorously defend the administration's efforts against the app.Judge Nichols did not explain his reasoning publicly, and instead filed his judicial opinion under seal. Initially both the U.S. government's brief in the case and the entire Sunday morning hearing were also due to be sealed from the public, although the court later relented.In arguments to Judge Nichols, TikTok lawyer John Hall said that TikTok is more than an app, since it functions as a “modern day version of a town square."“If that prohibition goes into effect at midnight, the consequences immediately are grave,'" Hall said. “It would be no different than the government locking the doors to a public forum, roping off that town square" at a time when a free exchange of ideas is necessary heading into a polarized election.TikTok lawyers also argued that a ban on the app would affect the ability of tens of thousands of potential viewers and content creators to express themselves every month and would also hurt its ability to hire new talent. In addition, Hall argued that a ban would prevent existing users from automatically receiving security updates, eroding national security.Justice Department lawyer Daniel Schwei said that Chinese companies are not purely private and are subject to intrusive laws compelling their cooperation with intelligence agencies. The Justice Department has also argued that economic regulations of this nature generally are not subject to First Amendment scrutiny.“This is the most immediate national security threat," argued Schwei. “It is a threat today. It is a risk today and therefore it deserves to be addressed today even while other things are ongoing and playing out."Schwei also argued that TikTok lawyers failed to prove the company would suffer irreparable business harm.The Justice Department laid out its objections to TikTok's motion for a temporary injunction in a brief under seal, but it was unsealed in redacted form to protect confidential business information.Trump set the process in motion with executive orders in August that declared TikTok and another Chinese app, WeChat, threats to national security. The White House says the video service is a security risk because the personal information of its millions of U.S. users could be handed over to Chinese authorities.Trump has given tentative approval to a proposed deal in which Oracle and Walmart could initially own a combined 20% of a new U.S. entity, TikTok Global. But Trump also said he could retract his approval if Oracle doesn’t have “total control" of the company; the president did not explain what he meant by that.The deal remains unfinalized, and the two sides have also appeared at odds over the corporate structure of TikTok Global. ByteDance said last week that it will still own 80% of the U.S. entity after a financing round. Oracle, meanwhile, put out a statement saying that Americans “will be the majority and ByteDance will have no ownership in TikTok Global.”Government-owned media in China have criticized the deal as bullying and extortion. ByteDance said Thursday it has applied for a Chinese technology export license after Beijing tightened control over exports last month in an effort to gain leverage over Washington’s attempt to force an outright sale of TikTok to U.S. owners.China's foreign ministry has said the government will “take necessary measures” to safeguard its companies but gave no indication what steps it can take to affect TikTok’s fate in the United States.TikTok is also asking a federal court to declare Trump’s Aug. 6 executive order unlawful.The Chinese firm said the president doesn’t have the authority to take these actions under the national-security law he cited; that the ban violates TikTok’s First Amendment speech rights and Fifth Amendment due-process rights; and that there’s no authority for the restrictions because they are not based on a national emergency._______Follow Anne D’Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzioLoad-Date: September 29, 2020End of Document

Containing the Crisis: A look into UW figures predicting the pandemic, and those searching for the endBadger Herald: University of Wisconsin - MadisonOctober 6, 2020 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: FEATURES; Pg. 1Length: 2315 wordsByline: Mary MagnusonBodyThe coronavirus outbreak originated in China in Dec. 2019 and spread outwards, shocking the globe and the people all across it to their core. By March 2020, travel came all but to a standstill, schools started sending their students home and people across the United States started adjusting to what would be their new reality for a long time. Healthcare workers struggled as their hospitals reached capacity, elderly Facebook moms sewed handmade masks, gourmet restaurants switched to takeout and everyone downloaded Zoom.Across the pond in Oxford, a group of leading medical researchers worked on what would soon be known as the 'AstraZeneca vaccine.'"The process of developing a vaccine happened ... almost immediately," Dr. Bill Hartman, director of the AstraZeneca phase III vaccine trials at the University of Wisconsin, said. "The Chinese government published the RNA sequence of the virus before the first person died of the coronavirus in China. When that happened, some of the other companies that make the mRNA vaccines, like Moderna, were able to, within a couple of hours' time, use computer algorithms to figure out how to build those vaccines. So those were all being developed purely in real-time as the virus was just beginning to kill people."Fast forward to August, when students at UW received an email about a phase III vaccine trial happening on campus - sign up, and get paid $100 for each test visit for a span of two years. At universities and in major cities across the world, college students and others received the same kind of promotion - get compensated to help scientists test the AstraZeneca vaccine, the innovation that could save thousands of lives.Only a few months after the virus's emergence in a Chinese game market and the world had several tangible, injectable vaccines. Maybe, just maybe, the cure was in sight.But it's not that simple, scientists say."Developing a vaccine is just the first step in vaccinating the public," UW Pharmacy professor Mary Hayney said.  "Public health officials and health care workers need to devise plans to make the vaccine available to a population of millions."Just working to disseminate a vaccine can take months, Hayney said. And when this disease is killing people every single day, there's no time to waste.As terrible as the pandemic has been, it's brought together a concerted, interdisciplinary research effort like no other, Associate Director of the Global Health Institute Dr. Janis Tupesis said. From epidemiologists and virologists to global health practitioners, engineers, social scientists and beyond, the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in unexpected collaborations and pioneering research. The vaccine itself, while an integral part of the COVID-19 research narrative, is still only one facet in a much larger mosaic. This research started on day one and will continue for years to come.Predicting a PandemicOzughan Alagoz works in UW's College of Engineering as an industrial engineer. Before the pandemic, he and his team applied mathematical models to important questions pertaining to logistical areas in healthcare manufacturing. But when COVID-19 hit Wisconsin, a group of researchers at UW Health recruited him to help them mitigate the spread of the disease.For the past few months, Alagoz has spent his time creating predictive AI models that map the spread of the disease. With his models, he said he can predict the number of cases weeks into the future using a set of determining factors - and so far, his models have proven strikingly accurate."I developed a model that got started in like mid-March," Alagoz said. "I was able to accurately predict the number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and all sorts of things. Pretty much on a weekly basis, I was updating those projections."When creating these models, Alagoz said he takes things like disease contagiousness, population age structure and distribution, the extent of social distancing and travel, testing capacity and more into consideration.But, Alagoz said he can't predict certain aspects of human behavior. When students came back to campus in August, some of his predictions fell off because he couldn't know whether or not students were going to social distance, or go to bars or hold large parties."Beginning of September, I was expecting a spike in the university population, but things went a little worse than what I was predicting," Alagoz said. "There is a huge human behavior element. And even if you can work with experts in human behavior, it's not easy to put that into quantity."When it comes to modeling what the spread might look like once a vaccine gets developed, Alagoz said this human behavior aspect introduces even more variables - we don't yet know the vaccine's effectiveness or how many people will choose to get it, Alagoz said.In order for the vaccine to effectively control the disease and prevent future outbreaks, a large percentage of the population has to get the vaccine, Alagoz said. And at first, it's likely only vulnerable populations will get the vaccine, so everyone else will have to wait another few months.But Alagoz also said at this point, the vaccine is really the only way to truly control this pandemic in the U.S."Of course, if there is a vaccine, that's the type of development that may completely transform the environment that we are living in," Alagoz said. "If we have a vaccine, then we have a really good chance of controlling this pandemic. Otherwise - looks like that's not going to happen anytime soon."Vaccine in the VicinityDr. Bill Hartman got his start as a molecular biologist and anesthesiologist. After attending the University of Chicago Medical School, doing a prestigious residency at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota and working in the field for several years, Hartman took a position as an assistant professor of anesthesiology with UW Health in 2019.Not long after moving to Madison, his research focus shifted along with the rapidly changing world. As the director of the UW Health phase III trials of the AstraZeneca vaccine, Hartman works with other researchers and trial participants to test the new vaccine and determine its efficacy.Hartman said his colleagues in Oxford, who developed the vaccine, built off existing research they had for SARS and MERS vaccines. Both SARS and MERS are coronaviruses from 2002 and 2012, respectively."They had a platform with which to build on for the novel coronavirus that came from Wuhan in December," Hartman said. "They knew that spike proteins - the appendages that stick out of the virus - are important for the virus to be able to attach to cells and get into cells to cause the infection. And so the idea was to figure out how to generate antibodies to stick to those spike proteins and prevent the virus from being able to get into cells."Because of the existing foundation of research, the mass amounts of funding directed to the project by governments and partnerships, and the field-leading researchers in charge, the AstraZeneca vaccine was able to be developed in a much shorter amount of time than a normal vaccine, Hartman said.But that doesn't mean it's risky. It's still going through the same rigor of clinical trials as a regular vaccine would, and it will still have to reach the same standards, Hartman said."When we do these large scale, worldwide trials like UW is part of ... you're able to observe any effects in large groups of people, which should give you a pretty significant sampling of people in different populations all over the world to make sure that it's safe," Hartman said. "And each of these patients is really evaluated very, very closely. So that we know what symptoms could develop, and what we can predict will happen when people become vaccinated."In fact, only a few weeks after starting the trials in Madison, the vaccine trials paused to monitor abnormal symptoms in a participant in England. For those few weeks, Madison researchers couldn't introduce anyone new to the vaccine and instead just monitored those who had already taken the vaccine.Hartman said pausing the trials isn't a bad thing - it happens even for minor instances, and it's just an opportunity to fix a potential problem. In fact, the AstraZeneca trials have restarted in most trial areas outside the U.S. as of early September."This is a guardrail that we should be actually pretty happy about, that the system worked," Hartman said. "So that we can assure everyone that this is being done safely, without cutting any corners."Aside from working as associate director of the Global Health Institute, Tupesis does work on emergency healthcare systems globally. He said the importance of an interdisciplinary approach when combatting a pandemic like this and developing a vaccine for one cannot be understated. For example, at the Global Health Institute, they have an infectious disease specialist who works on vaccine distribution, but also a veterinary medical researcher working on emerging diseases, a climate scientist looking at the role of the environment, a social scientist working on the safety and risk side of the issue and more. International organizations like the World Health Organization often have a similar setup when it comes to combating pandemics, Tupesis said."There's no way to do this effectively if there's not an interdisciplinary approach," Tupesis said.And once the vaccine gets completed, Tupesis said the challenges will extend beyond the medical sphere - leadership has to figure out how to build up an infrastructure that can create hundreds of thousands of doses and then transport them where they need to be. That's an effort that cannot be done alone.Secondly, Tupesis said communicating the vaccine and other kinds of necessary medical information can prove difficult."Some of the nonmedical challenges that we face right now are - and I've seen this innumerable times in emergency departments over the last six months - is that there is a divide about how willing people are to accept the medical information and the medical facts," Tupesis said. "That's going to be a real challenge to wage a mass vaccination campaign."Communicating COVIDDavid O'Connor is a pathologist at UW researching HIV and AIDS vaccines. While O'Connor said that vaccines inevitably come with risks - they can trigger immune responses that cause side effects in patients - large-scale clinical trials like the AstraZeneca trials minimize these risks until they're all but moot."The vaccine platforms that are being tested right now have shown good safety profiles in early-stage testing," O'Connor said. "In fact, my wife and I are both volunteers in the AstraZeneca vaccine trial."Infectious disease epidemiologist Ajay Sethi said the key to communicating vaccine risk is to be open - hiding the science and potential risks behind closed doors won't help anyone.Keeping the information open and accessible also helps curb the spread of misinformation, Sethi said."The public should understand the FDA approval process, demand transparency of findings from phase I-IV studies, and scientists and policymakers should be clear and honest about any risks associated with vaccines that have been approved," Sethi said. "Vaccination is among public health's greatest achievements ... Informing the public of the vaccine development and approval processes helps build trust in vaccination and an understanding of its importance to save lives."Like Alagoz, Hartman agreed that in order for the vaccine to effectively protect a large population, around 70% of people will have to get it.Right now, Hartman said he's seeing polls that around half the people in the county won't take a vaccine even when it becomes available due to concern about potential risks. Since Hartman and others are working tirelessly to make sure their careful clinical trials span a broad audience and minimize risk as much as they can, he said communication becomes key to controlling the pandemic."It's our job to prove that [the vaccine] is safe and effective, and also to convince the public that it's safe and effective so that we can get up to that 70% threshold, so we can get as many people vaccinated as possible," Hartman said.Hayney, as someone who studies the effects of vaccines, said she feels it is part of her responsibility to help people understand the benefits of vaccines. She said she likes to have the opportunity to communicate with people one-on-one about vaccines in order to figure out what specific questions or concerns they may have.Generally, Hayney said, people hesitant to get a vaccine have good intentions - they want to keep themselves and their families safe. That's why it's important to be compassionate and not condescending."One of the strategies I often take is again to ask to find out what the specific question is, and it might be more than one question, about a vaccine. And then I use the information that I know to answer that question," Hayney said. "My strategy is that I try to make a personal connection with the patient and tell a story that says that I am invested in both my family and that patient."Dr. Freddy Caldera works with vaccines in immunocompromised patients, and he said one of the important things to stress is how important and how impactful having a vaccine can be for a population.Caldera said despite some false claims made about vaccines - such as their link to autism - vaccines are overwhelmingly safe, and getting immunized benefits not just the individual, but potentially an entire population."This is our world without one vaccine," Caldera said. "What makes me passionate about my work is these are real diseases. I forget what the number of people who died in the U.S. is, but there's even a lot more people who are suffering from post-COVID issues ... making sure that even once we get a vaccine that people get immunized."Load-Date: October 6, 2020End of Document

Students React To Tiktok Controversy With Trump AdministrationCW Post Pioneer: Long Island University - C W Post CampusOctober 1, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: SPORTS; Pg. 1Length: 674 wordsBodyBy Zachary Taber, Staff WriterTiktok, a social media platform that has over 100 million active users in the United States, has garnered national attention because the Trump administration has put pressure on the app's owners to strike a deal with a U.S. based company. According to President Donald Trump, the deal would require the Chinese based company that owns Tiktok, ByteDance, to transfer ownership of the app entirely to a U.S. based company. This comes out of a concern the Trump administration has that the app has been sharing information about its U.S. users with the Chinese Government.Trump has spoken about his concerns regarding the app being controlled by ByteDance since July. Originally, Walmart and Oracle were to take a share in the app alongside ByteDance; however, in a recent statement, Trump said he won't approve the deal unless 100% of the app's ownership is transferred to a U.S. company. If a deal isn't worked out on his terms, the president has threatened to ban Tiktok in the U.S. altogether.This back and forth regarding whether or not Tiktok will be allowed to have continued use in the U.S. has Post's community of Tiktok lovers and influencers feeling conflicted about the future of the social media platform."Both the left and right sides of the government are joining together for the ban. As much as I love the app, I am worried about my own privacy since a lot of my personal information can be found on it," Emily Szalkowski, a freshman business major, said. She currently has over 220,000 followers on her Tiktok account, @sourrpatchkidz.Students have, for a long time, been actively engaged in and enjoyed the Tiktok community."TikTok allowed me for the first time in my entire life to truly showcase my own personal differences in a way that I can be proud of," Jack Tomlinson, a junior physical and health education major said. Tomlinson is a Tiktok influencer who has amassed over 130,000 followers on his page, @JackTomlinson2000.Szalkowski also reflected positively on the platform the app has provided people."Tiktok is one of the only platforms where the content is so genuine and real. A lot of creators touch on current events, so viewers are able to see different perspectives on modern day issues," Szalkowski said.With the intrusion of Trump's administration into the safe space Tiktok has become for many users, some students have been worried about how this will impact the future of the app."I started creating content on this app to not only entertain myself but entertain others," Tomlinson said. "With the involvement of politics, I feared it would take away from the true meaning of why I create [content]."Some Tiktok influencers at Post have also been worried about how government influence might affect their ability to monetize their content."I would say most creators are concerned about losing the ability to make money and losing [their] followers if the platform just disappears completely," Szalkowski said.Still, students have acknowledged the occasional necessity for politics to play a part in Tiktok and other social media platforms. "The Trump administration posed a legitimate threat of potential challenges that could meet our country due to Tiktok's ties with China," Tomlinson said.In fact, Tomlinson has an optimistic view about what Trump's jurisdictions may do for the future of the app."Personally I do not see this deal doing anything to Tiktok in a negative aspect," Tomlinson said. "I see this as a great opportunity to grow a still up and coming entertainment platform in the entertainment capital of the world; which is America."Szalkowski echoed Tomlinson's optimism regarding Trump's dealings and the future of Tiktok."I believe that Trump's dealings will help [ensure user's privacy]. Although he hasn't been the greatest president, I do think that the government knows what they are doing with this," she said.Trump has not yet reached a final deal regarding Tiktok, but the future of this popular platform remains uncertain as negotiations continue. Load-Date: October 5, 2020End of Document

How TikTok's Value Per User Compares To Facebook And Other Social Media PlatformsBenzinga.comSeptember 1, 2020 Tuesday 12:44 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Accretive Capital LLC d/b/a Benzinga All Rights ReservedLength: 495 wordsByline: Wayne DugganBodyBreakout social media platform TikTok is in the middle of a bidding war after President Donald Trump said he is banning U.S. transactions on TikTok starting on Sept. 20 unless Chinese parent company ByteDance finds an American buyer for the company by that date. A TikTok sale is reportedly imminent at a price tag reportedly in the $30 billion range.The Bidders:TikTok has two main interested parties offering to buy the company. The first party consists of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT). Microsoft is no stranger to large social media buyouts. It acquired a popular professional social media platform LinkedIn for $26.2 billion back in 2016.The other major bidder is Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL), which is reportedly teaming with venture capital firms such as General Atlantic and Sequoia to put together its offer. Oracle would presumably use TikTok to expand its cloud business and potentially even establish a large-scale advertising business.The Valuation: Investors won t know TikTok s true valuation until the deal is official and the details of the winning bid are announced. However, ByteDance is seeking $30 billion, according to the New York Times.Assuming the $30 billion valuation is in the ballpark of the ultimate buyout price, it would make TikTok users among the most valuable social media users in the world.A $30 billion valuation equates to roughly $259 per user, according to Bank of America analyst Justin Post. That valuation per user is slightly below Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) at $293 per user. However, it s significantly above Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP) at $86/user, Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) at $74/user and Pinterest Inc (NYSE: PINS) at $51/user, according to Post. On a per unit of time basis, a $30bn valuation would represent $3.29 per total daily minute of time, roughly in the middle of their peer group at $2.68-$5.32,  Post wrote in a note.What s Next? Even if the valuation is reasonable, a TikTok sale is far from a done deal. On Monday, ByteDance filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government.Post said the U.S. government would likely approve a sale to either major bidder group, but investors should be prepared for potential  pushback  from the Chinese government, which has compared the forced sale to intellectual property theft.Benzinga s Take:ByteDance and China may drag their heels on a potential sale of TikTok in an attempt to wait and see how things share out in the November U.S. presidential election. Cracking down on China has been one of the centerpieces of Trump s administration, but ByteDance may be hopeful it can negotiate some kind of compromise of Democratic nominee Joe Biden takes over the White House.Related Links:TikTok Has Taken Over: Here Are The Big Money Players Behind The Social Media AppForget Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter: TikTok Is The Breakout COVID-19 Social Media Platform© 2020 Benzinga.com.

Study Finds Federal Incentives for Domestic Semiconductor Manufacturing Would Strengthen America's Chip Production, Economy, National Security, Supply ChainsTargeted News ServiceSeptember 17, 2020 Thursday 9:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 900 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON Body(TNSRep) -- The Semiconductor Industry Association issued the following news release on Sept. 16:The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), in partnership with the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), today released a study analyzing the impact of proposed federal incentives for domestic semiconductor manufacturing. The report, titled Government Incentives and U.S. Competitiveness in Semiconductor Manufacturing, finds robust federal incentives would reverse the decades-long trajectory of declining chip production in America and create as many as 19 major semiconductor manufacturing facilities (fabs) and 70,000 high-paying jobs in the U.S. over the next 10 years. Congress is considering legislation that calls for substantial investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research. SIA represents 95 percent of the U.S. semiconductor industry by revenue and nearly two-thirds of non-U.S. chip firms."Federal incentives for U.S. semiconductor manufacturing are an investment in America's economic strength, national security, supply chain reliability, and pandemic response," said Keith Jackson, president, CEO, and director of ON Semiconductor and 2020 SIA chair. "With swift, ambitious action, the U.S. government can help turn the tide of decades of decline in the share of global chip manufacturing done in the U.S., which now stands at only 12 percent, and make America one of the most attractive places in the world to produce semiconductors."Key report findings:* A strong domestic semiconductor manufacturing presence is critical to America's economic competitiveness, national security, and supply chain resilience. Strengthening U.S. chip manufacturing will help ensure America out-innovates the world in the strategic technologies of the future - artificial intelligence, 5G, quantum computing, and more - that will determine global economic and military leadership for decades to come. Producing more semiconductors domestically would also make America's semiconductor supply chains more resilient to future global crises and ensure the U.S. can domestically produce the advanced chips needed for our military and critical infrastructure.* The share of global semiconductor manufacturing located in the U.S. has plummeted in recent decades, mostly because competing governments offer large incentives and the U.S. does not. While U.S.-headquartered companies account for 48 percent of the world's chip sales, U.S.-based fabs - including those operated by companies headquartered abroad - account for only 12 percent of the world's semiconductor manufacturing capacity, down from 37 percent in 1990. Seventy-five percent of the world's chip manufacturing is now concentrated in East Asia. China is projected to have the world's largest share of chip production by 2030 due to an estimated $100 billion in Chinese government subsidies. Depending on the type, a new fab in the U.S. costs approximately 30 percent more to build and operate over 10 years than one in Taiwan, South Korea, or Singapore, and 37-50 percent more than one in China. As much as 40-70 percent of that cost differential is directly attributed to government incentives.* Robust federal incentives for semiconductor manufacturing are needed to strengthen national security, attract substantial chip manufacturing to the U.S., and create tens of thousands of American jobs. Federal manufacturing grants and tax relief totaling $20-50 billion would re-position the U.S. from an unattractive investment destination to the most attractive (excluding China) and create as many as 19 fabs in the U.S. over the next 10 years, a 27 percent increase over the current number of U.S. commercial fabs (70). Federal manufacturing incentives would create up to 70,000 high-paying jobs in the U.S., ranging from highly educated engineers to fab technicians and operators to material suppliers. The global semiconductor industry is expected to increase manufacturing capacity by 56 percent in the next decade. With a $50 billion federal investment, the U.S. is projected to capture nearly a quarter of new global capacity that is not yet in development, compared to only 6 percent with no government action.The report also highlights several other areas where government action could help enable a thriving domestic semiconductor manufacturing sector. These include fundamental research in materials and manufacturing sciences, training to ensure the U.S. can have a robust and talented pool of workers, a continued commitment to maintaining U.S. R&D leadership, and ensuring access to global markets."The country that leads in advanced chip research, design, and manufacturing will have a big leg up in the global race to deploy new game-changing technologies, such as 5G, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing," said John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO. "Leaders in Washington should seize this opportunity, level the global playing field to attract chip production, and invest boldly in domestic manufacturing incentives and research initiatives that will strengthen U.S. tech leadership for decades to come."* * *Report: https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Government-Incentives-and-US-Competitiveness-in-Semiconductor-Manufacturing-Sep-2020.pdf[Category: Computer Technology]Contact: Dan Rosso, 240/305-4738, drosso@semiconductors.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7236244 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: September 17, 2020End of Document

Trump announces deal with Oracle and Walmart to keep TikTok in U.S.CE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 19, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 497 wordsBodyThe deal with Oracle, Walmart arrives weeks after TikTok, the Chinese-owned app, was labeled, according to Trump,as a threat to national securityPresident Trump said he has "in concept" accepted an agreement under which chinese-owned video application TikTok will partner with Oracle Corp and Walmart Inc. to become a US-based company, ending negotiations that have sparked debate about national security and the future of the Internet.Trump's battles with Tiktok"I've given my blessing to the agreement, if they get it too, if they don't, it's okay too," Trump told reporters at the White House on Saturday.According to The Wall Street Journal, the deal calls for the creation of 25,000 jobs, most in Texas. The president explained that the new company will continue to be called TikTok but "it will have nothing to do with China."He added that Oracle and Walmart plan to create a $5 billion fund for the education of young Americans.(Reuters)Negotiations on TikTok's U.S. operations began after the president signed an executive order in August calling TikTok a threat to national security, forcing its beijing-based owner, ByteDance Ltd., to pursue a sale or partnership with a U.S. company.The administration contends that the data that TikTok collects from U.S. users could be shared with the Chinese government. In response to the executive order, Commerce issued regulations Friday prohibiting U.S. companies from providing downloads or updates for TikTok after 11:59 p.m. on Sunday. The order also applies to WeChat, another popular Chinese-owned application that is not part of the settlement discussions.TikTok, which has more than 80 million users in the United States, is one of the most growing social networks in recent years, which has become the main entertainment for many teenagers and a marketing channel for major celebrities.Oracle, headquartered in Redwood City, California and founded in 1977, is one of Silicon Valley's pioneering companies and its software is used by millions of companies worldwide.Oracle CEO and co-founder Larry Ellison - the world's fifth-largest fortune, according to Forbes - is one of the few prominent tech industry executives to publicly express support for Trump, and even held a fundraising event for the president's re-election campaign in February.Oracle's main rival in the bid for TikTok was Microsoft, which, despite being considered the favorite for several weeks, admitted the defeat on Sunday afternoon. Another company that had taken an interest in TikTok.In August TikTok surpassed 2 billion downloads worldwide and claims to be present in more than 200 countries. In the United States, the social network claims to have 100 million monthly users.The war over TikTok comes in the context of a broader deterioration in relations between the two major world economies for months, with the United States and China launching harsh recriminations in the field of trade, human rights or responsibility for the pandemiccoronavirus.Load-Date: September 20, 2020End of Document

TikTok Owner Seeking $60 Billion Valuation in U.SStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 20, 2020 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 575 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyEarly Sunday morning, U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in San Francisco halted the Trump administration's ban on WeChat, reported by Reuters. The US president claimed that the social media apps are tools of the Chinese Communist Party, which, asWashington maintains, is bent on stealing the personal data of American users.ByteDance was pressured into a deal for TikTok when Trump threatened to ban the app in the US over national security concerns."So, everybody will be happy".Oracle Corp.'s agreement to take a stake in TikTok has won the long-awaited blessing of U.S. President Donald Trump. And that's it. That's it."I approved the deal in concept", Trump said, addressing reporters at the White House, according to reports. "If they get it done, that's great. If they don't, that's fine too". And Trump said Saturday he wants $5 billion from companies creating a new US -based TikTok venture directed toward teaching American children "the real history of our country".TikTok Global will be a new company created to manage the USA operations and most of the users in the rest of the world."We are a 100% confident in our ability to deliver a highly secure environment to TikTok and ensure data privacy to TikTok's American users".The statement also said both American companies will take part in TikTok's global pre-IPO financing round in which they can take up to 20 percent cumulative stake in the company.Payal's allegations: Kangana calls for Anurag Kashyap's arrestResponding to sexual assault allegations by Ghosh, Kashyap rejected all the accusations saying they were "baseless". After Payal Ghosh accused Anurag Kashyap of sexual misconduct, many came in support of the actor-filmmaker.Her 22-page order added the prohibitions "burden substantially more speech than is necessary to serve the government's significant interest in national security, especially given the lack of substitute channels for communication".Given the likelihood of a lawsuit proceeding and the immediate damage a ban would have if implemented, the judge initiated a nationwide injunction against implementation of the Commerce Department's order to ban the app.Moreover, TikTok has promised that they will be setting up a headquarters in the USA, which should open up 25,000 jobs. Beijing previously announced the addition of several artificial intelligence technologies, including "personalized content recommendations based on data analysis", to its list of restricted exports, which created a major roadblock for ByteDance to sell TikTok's USA operations.TikTok - owned by China's ByteDance - confirmed the agreement ahead on the Sunday night deadline.Nevertheless, the deal between TikTok, Walmart, and Oracle is final yet as the Chinese government's approval is required, so the fate of the company hasn't been set in stone yet.WeChat is an all-in-one mobile app that combines services similar to Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram as well as Venmo and is essential to the daily lives of many in China, boasting more than one billion users.In the absence of any evidence, the United States has repeatedly used state power to suppress the two enterprises for unwarranted reasons, which seriously disrupted their normal business activities, undermined the confidence of worldwide investors in the USA investment environment and damaged the normal global economic and trade order, the MOC said in a statement.TikTok is facing a US ban if a deal is not reached.Load-Date: September 21, 2020End of Document

TIBETAN WRITER AND FORMER POLITICAL PRISONER IN FAILING HEALTH IN QINGHAI HOSPITALStates News ServiceOctober 12, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 457 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A Tibetan blogger and journalist is in rapidly failing health in a Qinghai hospital following his release in December from prison, where he was serving a three-year sentence imposed during a secret trial in which he was denied an attorney, Tibetan sources said.Tsegon Gyal, a resident of Qinghai's Kangtsa (in Chinese, Gangcha) county in the Tsojang (Haibei) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, was released on Dec. 6, 2019, Pema Gyalan analyst at the Dharamsala, India-based Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD)told RFA's Tibetan Service."His health condition was already extremely grim, and so on Jan. 14, 2020, he was admitted to the hospital for surgery. But now his health condition is even more critical," Pema Gyal said, citing sources in the Kangtsa region."He has been admitted to the hospital again, and he is in terrible physical pain. He is also worried about his livelihood, as the Chinese government has imposed many political restrictions on him. His parents and relatives are also under tight scrutiny these days," he said.Tibetan political prisoners are routinely subjected to physical abuse in prison, Pema Gyal said."They are forced to 'confess' to the charges made against them, and prison officials frequently resort to torture, which has left many Tibetan prisoners disabled, with some even permanently losing their memories."Tsegon Gyal had most likely been charged because of a blog post he had published criticizing China for implementing a restrictive policy of "ethnic unity" in the Tibetan areas under its control, TCHRD said on Feb. 18, 2018.First detained on Dec. 9, 2016, Gyal was held for eight months in Kangtsa county and then tried in secret on May 3, 2017. He was sentenced on Jan. 10, 2018 by the People's Intermediate Court in Tsojang and was taken to a prison in Qinghai's capital Xining to serve his sentence, sources told RFA in an earlier report.Gyal's family was not informed of his trial, at which he was denied the assistance of an attorney, and no explanation was given for the long period of time that passed between the trial and his sentencing, sources said.Formerly a freelance journalist for newspapers and other media outlets in Qinghai, Gyal also founded a performing musical group for Kangtsa county residents with disabilities which he was later required to hand over to Chinese authorities for management.China has jailed scores of Tibetan writers, artists, singers, and educators for asserting Tibetan national and cultural identity and civil rights since widespread protests swept the region in 2008.Reported by Lobsang Gelek for RFA's Tibetan Service.

Hong Kong arrests 3 activists under national security lawAssociated Press InternationalOctober 27, 2020 Tuesday 11:35 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 332 wordsByline: ZEN SOO, Associated PressDateline: HONG KONG BodyHONG KONG (AP) — Three members of a former student group advocating independence for Hong Kong were arrested Tuesday under the city’s new national security law on suspicion of publishing content inciting secession on social media platforms.The three include former Studentlocalism leader Tony Chung and former members William Chan and Yanni Ho. The arrests of the three were confirmed on the now-disbanded group’s Facebook page.Police said they arrested two men and one woman between the ages of 17 and 21 on secession charges, but did not name them.Chung was arrested near the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong on Tuesday morning, a police official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The other two were detained while reporting to police stations, Studentlocalism said.The three had previously been arrested under the national security law in July, on charges of inciting secession.Studentlocalism was a student group in the city that advocated localism, and aimed to set up a “Republic of Hong Kong.” Hong Kong, a former British colony, was handed over to China in 1997 and now runs as a semi-autonomous Chinese territory under the “one country, two systems” framework that allows Hong Kong certain freedoms not found on the mainland.In June, the group announced that it ceased activities in the city in light of the national security legislation.The law, which was imposed on Hong Kong by the central Chinese government and took effect on June 30, is widely seen as a means to curb dissent after anti-government protests rocked the city for months last year.The legislation outlaws secessionist, subversive and terrorist acts, as well as collusion with foreign forces in the city’s internal affairs. The maximum punishment for serious offenders is life imprisonment.Others who have been arrested under the legislation include media tycoon Jimmy Lai, who founded the pro-democracy tabloid Apple Daily, and prominent pro-democracy activist Agnes Chow.Load-Date: October 27, 2020End of Document

Study Finds Federal Incentives for Domestic Semiconductor Manufacturing Would Strengthen America's Chip Production, Economy, National Security, Supply Chains; Nineteen new chip manufacturing facilities would be built in the U.S. in next 10 years with $50 billion federal investment, according to study by Boston Consulting Group and SIAPR NewswireSeptember 16, 2020 Wednesday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1070 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16, 2020 BodyPR NewswireThe Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), in partnership with the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), today released a study analyzing the impact of proposed federal incentives for domestic semiconductor manufacturing. The report, titledGovernment Incentives and U.S. Competitiveness in Semiconductor Manufacturing, finds robust federal incentives would reverse the decades-long trajectory of declining chip production in America and create as many as 19 major semiconductor manufacturing facilities (fabs) and 70,000 high-paying jobs in the U.S. over the next 10 years. Congress is considering legislation that calls for substantial investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research. SIA represents 95 percent of the U.S. semiconductor industry by revenue and nearly two-thirds of non-U.S. chip firms."Federal incentives for U.S. semiconductor manufacturing are an investment in America's economic strength, national security, supply chain reliability, and pandemic response," said Keith Jackson, president, CEO, and director of ON Semiconductor and 2020 SIA chair. "With swift, ambitious action, the U.S. government can help turn the tide of decades of decline in the share of global chip manufacturing done in the U.S., which now stands at only 12 percent, and make America one of the most attractive places in the world to produce semiconductors."Key report findings:1. A strong domestic semiconductor manufacturing presence is critical to America's economic competitiveness, national security, and supply chain resilience.Strengthening U.S. chip manufacturing will help ensure America out-innovates the world in the strategic technologies of the future – artificial intelligence, 5G, quantum computing, and more – that will determine global economic and military leadership for decades to come. Producing more semiconductors domestically would also make America's semiconductor supply chains more resilient to future global crises and ensure the U.S. can domestically produce the advanced chips needed for our military and critical infrastructure.2. The share of global semiconductor manufacturing located in the U.S. has plummeted in recent decades, mostly because competing governments offer large incentives and the U.S. does not.While U.S.-headquartered companies account for 48 percent of the world's chip sales, U.S.-based fabs – including those operated by companies headquartered abroad – account for only 12 percent of the world's semiconductor manufacturing capacity, down from 37 percent in 1990. Seventy-five percent of the world's chip manufacturing is now concentrated in East Asia. China is projected to have the world's largest share of chip production by 2030 due to an estimated $100 billion in Chinese government subsidies. Depending on the type, a new fab in the U.S. costs approximately 30 percent more to build and operate over 10 years than one in Taiwan, South Korea, or Singapore, and 37-50 percent more than one in China. As much as 40-70 percent of that cost differential is directly attributed to government incentives.3. Robust federal incentives for semiconductor manufacturing are needed to strengthen national security, attract substantial chip manufacturing to the U.S., and create tens of thousands of American jobs.Federal manufacturing grants and tax relief totaling $20-50 billion would re-position the U.S. from an unattractive investment destination to the most attractive (excluding China) and create as many as 19 fabs in the U.S. over the next 10 years, a 27 percent increase over the current number of U.S. commercial fabs (70). Federal manufacturing incentives would create up to 70,000 high-paying jobs in the U.S., ranging from highly educated engineers to fab technicians and operators to material suppliers. The global semiconductor industry is expected to increase manufacturing capacity by 56 percent in the next decade. With a $50 billion federal investment, the U.S. is projected to capture nearly a quarter of new global capacity that is not yet in development, compared to only 6 percent with no government action.The report also highlights several other areas where government action could help enable a thriving domestic semiconductor manufacturing sector. These include fundamental research in materials and manufacturing sciences, training to ensure the U.S. can have a robust and talented pool of workers, a continued commitment to maintaining U.S. R&D leadership, and ensuring access to global markets."The country that leads in advanced chip research, design, and manufacturing will have a big leg up in the global race to deploy new game-changing technologies, such as 5G, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing," said John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO. "Leaders in Washington should seize this opportunity, level the global playing field to attract chip production, and invest boldly in domestic manufacturing incentives and research initiatives that will strengthen U.S. tech leadership for decades to come."Media ContactDan RossoSemiconductor Industry Association240-305-4738drosso@semiconductors.orgAbout SIAThe Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) is the voice of the semiconductor industry, one of America's top export industries and a key driver of America's economic strength, national security, and global competitiveness.

Illness gives Stevens professor insight into botched COVID-19 responseThe Stute: Stevens Institute of TechnologySeptember 23, 2020 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 2086 wordsByline: John HorganBodySince arriving at Stevens six years ago, Professor Theresa MacPhail has been a go-to source for advice on nasty viruses. She is a medical anthropologist who specializes in global responses to pandemics. She once spent a year embedded with the Centers for Disease Control, and she was in Hong Kong in 2009 when the H1N1 influenza outbreak occurred. She wrote a book about the global response to that pandemic. Early in March, MacPhail became ill, probably because she'd been infected by the new coronavirus, Sars-Cov-2, which causes the disease called COVID-19. She can't be sure, because she couldn't get tested. She has recently been interviewed by Anderson Cooper of CNN, VICE and other media. Here she answers my questions about our current crisis. This Q&A was originally published on my Scientific American blog, "Cross-check." - John Horgan, Director, Stevens Center for Science Writings.Horgan: When did you first hear about COVID-19, and what was your reaction?MacPhail: I saw it on Pro-Med in early January. [The Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) was launched in 1994 as an Internet service to identify unusual health events related to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and toxins affecting humans, animals and plants.] I remember thinking that it was interesting, but the initial data coming out of China didn't worry me. I was confident that the Chinese CDC and the Chinese government would handle it, since they have a strong system for dealing with outbreaks due to their past experiences with SARS (2003) and occasional outbreaks of avian influenza. The initial case information also made this look similar to a very bad influenza strain - obviously much worse than normal, seasonal flu, but nothing as bad as a strain of avian influenza like H5N1 would be. I didn't think much about it, other than keeping an eye on it.Horgan: How has your thinking about the pandemic evolved since then?MacPhail: Well, it's changed quite a bit. Initially, I had confidence that the US CDC would do what they always do - handle the situation and provide local and regional public health departments with guidance and support. Those of us not currently working in public health didn't know what everyone working inside those circles did: we didn't have viable tests. The initial failure of the CDC's test kits - the assays they had sent to labs across the nation - wasn't readily available knowledge at first. I don't think any of us - and by "us" I mean the general public - really understood what was going on behind the scenes during the early weeks of January, after China had released the genetic information of the new Sars-Cov-2 virus. The scramble to get testing up and running wasn't immediately obvious to anyone.Because I had such a good perspective on our national response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, and knew how well we had responded then, I was overconfident that our response to this pandemic would be similar. I felt as though we had "drilled" for this event and that we would be ready. I could not have been more wrong. It's clear to me NOW that we weren't ready and that we didn't have any contingency plans for when the CDC's testing kits failed. The usual protocols that involve the CDC and the FDA giving approval to develop and use tests were not lifted, which seems to have created an odd - and disastrous - delay in getting testing capabilities up and running throughout the country.I should say this, however, in some defense of what happened. In 2009, what we were dealing with was a very different virus. We had what are called "point of care" diagnostic tests available very early on that required no specialized skills or equipment to run. Point of care simply means that the tests are available at the site of care; they don't have to be shipped to a separate laboratory to be performed. Now, with Sars-Cov-2, it's a very different story. We don't have point of care testing available. These tests require special equipment and special skills and need to be performed in a laboratory setting. Or its equivalent. And that complicated things. I still think that we have done a terrible job in relationship to testing, but there were reasons for this.Horgan: You've been ill recently. First, are you feeling better? Second, has your personal experience, and especially your attempt to get tested for COVID-19, shaped your scholarly view of what's happening?MacPhail: Yes, my thinking has changed a great deal because of my own experience. I came down with a viral infection on March 1. It started with a sore throat and fatigue. By the 5th day of the illness, I had a fever of 102.5 and for 5 days, that fever never dipped below 100 degrees, despite taking copious amounts of fever reducer. I ended up in the ER on March 9 with a fever, dry cough, and tightness in the chest. They gave me a flu test - which came back negative - and a strep test - also negative. I had a chest x-ray that looked clear, so I was put on a nebulizer for 30 minutes, given a steroid short-burst to help with my breathing, as well as an inhaler. I was sent home to quarantine. Things progressed and I got more and more congested - both nasal and chest congestion. I went back to urgent care and no tests for Sars-Cov-2 were available. This was on March 15. The doctor on call at urgent care said she would have tested me if she could, but she had zero kits available. Because I am "low-risk", my regular physician, who does have limited testing available, could not waste one of the test kits on me. I still haven't been tested. It's March 26 and I am slowly recovering, but still congested.I started to panic about our response after my ER trip on March 9. At that point, I knew we were botching this response. The most important thing is testing. You can't combat or design effective public health responses for what you can't see. Where are the hotspots? How big is the problem? It was clear to me that we didn't - and couldn't - know. Thank god for modeling and biostatisticians. Without them, we'd have almost nothing to go on. We don't know if the numbers we're seeing are accurate, but they're better than nothing. Still, without testing, we're stuck socially isolating. Only massive testing will make it possible to return to "life as normal." And I don't have hopes of that anytime soon. I truly don't understand it. Other countries have done so much better than us on this front. Here in NYC, I feel like it's too late. We'll have to do massive testing to prevent the second wave.Horgan: Stanford epidemiologist John Ioannidis has suggested that the U.S. might be overreacting to the virus, given how little data we have. Comment?MacPhail: He's not wrong about the lack of data, but he's wrong about overreacting. I think if you look at the data we do have, from several countries now, it's clear that this situation is very bad and will quickly overwhelm our hospital system. To be honest, I was closer to his standpoint in early January. But we didn't have a clear picture. Now we do. No one should be pooh-poohing this virus at this stage of the game.Horgan: What worries you most about the pandemic and our response to it now?MacPhail: I worry about the lack of a coherent national response. I worry that states are doing what they want, and not necessarily doing what they should. Usually, the CDC would be providing guidance and orchestrating a national response. That's not happening.I also worry that we're not prepared - in any way - for an extended response. This is going to be months, not weeks. There will likely be a second wave. A third wave. We need a vaccine, but we need a coherent plan until we get one. We also don't know what a second wave would look like. Again, that's why we need testing on a massive scale. So that we can get in the way of the second wave.Horgan: What heartens you, if anything?MacPhail: Well, I know how dedicated most healthcare workers are. I know that they're out there, doing everything they can. And I know that scientists around the globe are doing their best. They're in their labs, nearly killing themselves to make assays, to do testing, to study this virus and come up with a solution.I also am heartened by the local responses I've seen. A bunch of young New Yorkers volunteering to buy groceries for the elderly and immunocompromised, adhering to best practices to prevent contaminating the deliveries. Just people stepping into the gap, doing what they can.Horgan: If you were the Pandemic Czar, what would you advise President Trump to do right now?MacPhail: No offense to your readers, but I'd tell him to shut up for a minute. Let the CDC lead. Let Anthony Fauci lead. Most of the talking and planning and decision-making should be left up to experts. He should give them free reign and support them. He should be echoing their advice and letting Americans know that our health is of vital importance. After all, if we're not healthy, there is no economy.Going forward, I think the CDC should be insulated from political influence of any kind. I don't think we've done a good enough job of separating out science from state. Places like the NIH and the CDC should largely be autonomous bodies with federal oversight, run by experts in their respective fields who are elected by their peers, not politically appointed. That's just my two cents.Horgan: What would you recommend to protect us against future pandemics?MacPhail: Three words: Fund public health.Fund public health programs the way we fund national defense programs. Because, well, public health is national defense...against deadly pathogens.We know what to do. We just don't do it. We react to things like SARS or HIV and then, once they disappear or become more manageable, we go back to acting like we're invulnerable. In between pandemics, we pretend there's no problem. But people in public health have been warning us something like this was going to happen. They've been warning us for decades.Horgan: Has any non-authoritarian country handled the coronavirus especially well?MacPhail: Germany seems to be doing okay. And, of course, South Korea.During the 2009 pandemic, I often heard people in public health joking - but then also not joking - that they wished they had China's ability to just force citizens to do the right thing. China doesn't have to worry about whether or not people line up to get vaccinated; they can just enforce vaccination. I don't think any of the people who made these jokes actually want to live under an authoritarian regime, but they were envious of China's ability to mobilize and get things done.Pandemics tend to make everyone a little more authoritarian, at least temporarily. It's a necessary evil. People aren't always going to stay home voluntarily, or close their shop willingly. The trick is balancing out those exceptional powers and making sure that they don't become the rule.Horgan: Experts have offered a broad range of estimates about how long we're going to have to practice social distancing to defeat this virus. Care to offer a guess?MacPhail: After being so wrong about my predictions in January and February, I don't even want to hazard a guess. I'd say 2-3 months at a minimum. It all depends, really, on how fast we can get massive-scale testing up and running. That way we can target isolation and quarantining practices.Horgan: We're all saturated with news about the coronavirus now. Is there anything that it's especially important for us to know?MacPhail: That there's still a lot of uncertainty. There's a lot more that we know, but we still don't know a lot about this virus. We're still learning.Horgan: I wrote a column laying out positive possible outcomes of this pandemic. Can you envision any upside?MacPhail: Yes, I can. I think we're all going to have to rethink our relationship to each other. This has made clear that there's a limit to American individualism. We live and survive in interconnected communities. We ran out of toilet paper in one minute. We can't survive alone.Also, I think we'll need to reexamine our work culture. We may get paid sick leave for everyone out of this. And the bravado of working through an illness? That should change. We need to stay home when we're sick and wear masks in public if we can't. Again, it's a shift from thinking about ourselves all the time, to thinking about our communities and neighbors.And, finally, if these events aren't the best damn argument for universal healthcare that I've ever seen, then I don't know what else is.Load-Date: September 23, 2020End of Document

They hacked Trump? A Dutchman says he discovered his Twitter key: "maga2020!"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishOctober 22, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 930 wordsBodyThe White House and Twitter have denied that a hacker has accessed the account of the US president, but Victor Gevers, a Dutch security expert, insists that he managed to do so after testing with several passwords. By 2016 I had already guessed the key to the representative, who by then was "yourefired".Dutch hacker Victor Gevers would have had only five attempts to guess the password for US President Donald Trump's Twitter account."It wasn't hard at all," says Gevers, as Trump had no extra security, nor did he use a complicated key. The password, according to the Dutchman, was "maga2020!" (the initials of his campaign slogan, Make America Great Again).Gevers, a security researcher, could have had access to the president's personal messages and could change his profile and send tweets on behalf of @realDonaldTrump, an active user with 87.3 million followers on this social network, but he says he only took screenshots, undesaned, he said, confidential files of the Republican candidate."The first thing I thought when I started the session was, 'Oh my God!' It was like he didn't want to have been able to access, especially not such an important account," he explained to the Dutch platform NV, which published the screenshots taken by Gevers last Friday, though not entirely for containing private correspondence from the president.The White House and Twitter have denied Gevers' claims by arguing that they have seen no evidence to corroborate a hacking of the US president."We proactively implement account security measures for a designated group of Twitter accounts related to high-profile elections in the United States, including branches of the federal government," the Twitter company said Thursday. Judd Deere, undersecretary of the White House press, noted that the story was completely false.We recommend: Twitter and Facebook block Donald Trump content by misinformationTrump's account under the stalking of hackersThis isn't the first time Gevers has managed to access the U.S. president's account. As early as October 2016, he and several friends came up with Trump's password in a database leaked by hackers. So, Trump had "youarefired" as an access key.In 2013, the Republican tycoon admitted that his Twitter account was hacked after a particular tweet from the president appeared citing the song "Scream &Shout;" by Britney Spears, Lil Wayne and Willi.am.The problem would not only be the passwords used by Trump, but the representative also does not seem to have the dual authentication system activated, where by which the platform sends a second verification code to the phone number or email linked to the account in question, especially when accessed from an unknown computer.Once inside anyone's account, you can tweet, change the key or profile picture, and even download a file with private messages, but hackers like Gevers, dedicated to "responsible disclosure" or "ethics," only warn users and businesses about their account vulnerabilities.Attempts to alert the president, his team at the White House, the campaign team, and even his family members to the security of the Twitter account failed, according to theDutch, who further notes that days later, the US secret services contacted Gevers to thank him for the notice. Trump changed his key and activated double verification.Gevers is a highly respected pirate in the world of hackers, precisely because of his method of ethical work.Among other discoveries, he found a Chinese database with personal information (phone, dates of birth, photos, employer, identity number or nationality) and locations (with GPS coordinates of all places visited) of 2.7 million inhabitants of Xinjang, China's largest province and Uighur home, showing that the Chinese government is monitoring this ethnic minority in the country.Cybersecurity, a matter of national priority in these two weeksU.S. Intelligence Director John Ratcliffe announced Wednesday that Russia and Iran obtained voter registration information in the United States and have acted to influence public opinion before the presidential election on November 3.Iran specifically sent emails to Americans "designed to intimidate voters, incite social turmoil, and harm President [Donald] Trump," ratcliffe says.He added that Iran also distributed a video that makes people believe that it is possible to send fraudulent ballots, even from outside the United States.Ratcliffe said Iran and Russia seek to use the data obtained "to communicate false information to registered voters in hopes of causing confusion, wreaking havoc, and undermining confidence in American democracy.""These actions are desperate efforts by desperate adversaries," Ratcliffe added.This announcement came after registered Democratic voters reported receiving threatening emails on behalf of the Proud Boys armed militia group.The content of the email, which was sent to Florida college students, says, after identifying the recipient with their name and address: "We have all your information. You're registered as a Democrat (...) You'll vote for Trump on Election Day or we'll come after you."And it ends: "We'll know which candidate you voted for. I'd take this seriously if I were you."The emails came from the  info@officialproudboys.com , but Enrique Tarrio, leader of this group in Florida, assured the press that his organization was not behind them.The Washington Post identified similar emails sent to Democrats in Alaska, Pennsylvania, and Arizona.We recommend: USA explains: Why did Twitter block Donald Trump's campaign account for a few hours? Load-Date: October 23, 2020End of Document

Federal Judge Blocks Trump Administration's Attempt To Ban TikTokStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 28, 2020 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: WORLD NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 544 wordsByline: Steven ClarkeBodyAccording to Sputnik news agency, quoting the Wall Street Journal report on Sunday, the ban was supposed to take effect on Sunday night, but Judge Carl Nichols of the US District Court in Washington, D.C., granted a preliminary injunction sought by ByteDance to allow TikTok to remain available for download in the US.Should the deal not go ahead, a more sweeping ban will come into force around a week after the presidential election. The judge did not agree to postpone the later ban.A judge has denied an attempt by content creators on TikTok to stop a ban of the app in the United States on Sunday, rejecting arguments the ban would cause "immediate, irreparable harm" if it is implemented as scheduled.TikTok argued in court yesterday that the ban was "arbitrary and capricious" and that it "would undermine data security" for the existing 100 million US users by blocking security updates.Hall said banning TikTok from US app stores would undermine security by preventing existing users from receiving weekly security updates.ByteDance said on September 20 it had made a preliminary deal for Walmart Inc and Oracle Corp to take stakes in the short video sharing app's USA operations, but the exact terms remain unclear.SEC fines BMW $18 million for inflating US sales figuresBWM cooperated with the investigation, which was taken into consideration in imposing the penalty, the SEC said. Last year, the SEC fined Fiat Chrysler $ 40 million or similarly misreporting its sales numbers.Under a preliminary deal that Mr. Trump approved in concept, Oracle and Walmart would take a combined 20% in TikTok Global, a new US -based company that would run the global service. A separate Trump executive order last month gave ByteDance until November 12 to divest itself of TikTok in the United States. "At the same time, we will also maintain our ongoing dialogue with the government to turn our proposal, which the president gave his preliminary approval to last weekend, into an agreement".A lawyer for TikTok told the judge at Sunday's virtual hearing that the ban was irrational given that ByteDance is in talks to strike a deal the president himself has demanded. "Yes, TikTok is an app, but it is more than that".In WeChat's case, a group of WeChat users filed a lawsuit arguing that a ban would hurt their expression of speech.U.S. Department of Justice lawyer Daniel Schwei countered that any free speech concerns are "completely irrelevant" to the president's national security prerogatives.Mr Trump set the process in motion with executive orders in August that declared TikTok and another Chinese app, WeChat, threats to national security. ByteDance says Trump is exceeding his authority with the ban. A public hearing on the injunction was set for Sunday morning.Government lawyers argued the president has a right to take national security actions, and said the ban was needed because of TikTok's links to the Chinese government through its parent firm ByteDance. In its request for an injunction, the company said it has created "software barriers that help ensure that TikTok stores its U.S. user data separately from the user data of other ByteDance products". So far, US officials have not offered direct proof that China has ever sought TikTok data.Load-Date: September 28, 2020End of Document

'We're facing a tipping point:' Cybersecurity in the age of COVID-19The Brown Daily Herald: Brown UniversityOctober 1, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: SCIENCE-RESEARCH; Pg. 1Length: 1693 wordsByline: Claire LiuBodyIn the rush to transition many aspects of our daily lives online - attending virtual lectures, working a full-time job from home and communicating over social media - one issue has risen to the forefront of local and global concerns: cybersecurity. "We're facing a tipping point in terms of global cybersecurity and privacy, as a result of the pandemic forcing everybody out of the streets and their offices and into their home offices and online," said Timothy Edgar, senior fellow at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs. Edgar formerly worked as the deputy for civil liberties in the Office of the Director for National Intelligence, later advising the National Security Council on cybersecurity policy under former President Barack Obama's administration.The COVID-19 pandemic has definitely "accelerated the vulnerability we all have to cybersecurity problems, ... (forcing) us to hyper-accelerate our movement to the cloud and to digital communication," Edgar said. While trends toward remote work existed previously, the pandemic has rapidly driven those trends forward. It has increased our susceptibility to security and privacy threats, such as by necessitating virtual communication platforms. Cybersecurity for communicationZoom, the primary video communication platform used in much of the world and by the University, was initially unprepared to handle cybersecurity for the onslaught of new users due to the pandemic, Edgar said. The American company has made significant improvements in the past few months, such as giving users greater control of where their Zoom data is stored. But Zoom's technological dependence on China for its hardware infrastructure has "raised a lot of concerns in many Western countries, including the U.S., about cyberspying by the Chinese government," Edgar said.Still, in comparison to alternative platforms, Edgar said that the University cannot be faulted for relying on Zoom for courses and communication. "Brown is in the same position as a lot of universities," he said, needing "a platform that is easy to use and functional." Edgar's main concern with Zoom lies in the recording of lectures and discussions on the platform. Since the University's transition to fully remote learning in March, classes have commonly been recorded in order to accommodate students taking courses in different time zones. While Edgar understands the importance of recording university courses, "we do need to be very careful that we don't simply decide that the recording of everything that we do is now suddenly acceptable for convenience reasons," he said.The University's IT Service Center currently recommends that faculty download and post recorded Zoom calls through the Canvas website, which uses a secure software called Panopto, Director of Information Security Mark Dieterich said. Students taking asynchronous classes are only able to view recorded lectures on Canvas through Panopto, which allows "fine-grain control" - limiting access to those in a specific section of a class, for instance. But Zoom also allows hosts to download recorded meetings to the cloud; if this happens, the video will be automatically deleted after a year, and a Brown log-in is required for access if it is shared before its deletion.  "Brown has been focused on flexibility. We want to do everything we can to make things secure, but we don't want to make it so hard to use that it's no longer attractive; that's one of the fine lines we need to walk in security," Dieterich said.The University does not currently require the use of waiting rooms and passcodes, which would raise the barrier of entry for meeting attendees, and instead leaves the decision up to each faculty member, Dieterich said. The University notified the Brown community Aug. 28 that Zoom would mandate the use of waiting rooms and passcodes. But Zoom has since backed away from this decision, prompting the University to release a follow-up announcement Sept. 24 stating that these safety precautions are encouraged but not required.Zoom-bombing - the intrusion of uninvited guests into a meeting - last occurred at the University in early April. No Zoom-bombings have been reported since, Dieterich said. A staple feature on Zoom is the chat function, which allows meeting attendees to send messages either publicly to everyone in the meeting or privately to a person of their choice. Public chats are accessible by the meeting host and the administration after a meeting ends; messages are not downloaded automatically, but may be downloaded by the host at their discretion. The University administration can also use chat information in the case that they are legally bound by subpoena, but will not use the information in any other situation, according to Dieterich. There is no record of private chats after the meeting ends, he said. As one recently added security measure, Zoom has employed staff to monitor public feeds on Twitter and notify respective meeting hosts about meeting links and passcodes that have been accidentally shared in tweets.University measures to combat online security breaches"Higher education is one of the most attacked industries" because of the profitability of intellectual property located within academic institutions' virtual systems, Dieterich said. The IT Center currently uses multiple firewalls within the University network that detect between 13,000 and 450,000 suspicious network connections each day. Only around two percent of these connections are permitted through the firewall to the next layer of defense, according to Dieterich. The University has implemented various types of security measures to build these barriers. Edgewise, a technology installed this fall, safeguards against attacks across different segments of the network. A different tool called STINGAR based at Duke University purposefully entices attackers to identify and block them, and it caught 5 million such users within its first day of use. The University has also partnered with the Department of Homeland Security to measure how effectively they're scanning for vulnerabilities in their security system.  But, "there's no perfect security, and even very good security can sometimes be undermined (with) enough resources," Edgar said. For example, intelligence services "with the resources of nation-states" can scour digital platforms to uncover information - a topic he expands upon in his book Beyond Snowden: Privacy, Mass Surveillance and the Struggle to Reform the NSA. International privacy concerns and conflictTikTok  - a video-sharing social media platform owned by ByteDance, a company based in China - has also led to concerns about cybersecurity and exemplifies the dynamic surrounding technological dominance.The platform "raises a whole host of questions around global cyber power and what appears to be a shift from the existing situation in which the United States has been absolutely dominant," Edgar said. Previously, big tech companies in the United States have prevented strict regulations concerning technology "on the grounds that we don't want anything to stifle the innovation that has given the U.S. such dominance in the global tech world," Edgar said. But cybersecurity concerns with China's leverage over Zoom and TikTok have revealed the ramifications of an unregulated technology market.  John Savage, professor emeritus of computer science and member of the Rhode Island Secretary of State's Help America Vote Act Task Force, expressed concerns about security from this underlying competition. He is co-authoring the book Security in the Cyberage: Introduction into Policy and Technology with Derek Reveron, professor of national security affairs at the U.S. Naval War College, about encryption, the ethics of artificial intelligence and laws regarding cyberspace."What worries me the most is that domestic politics, both in this country and in China, are causing tensions between the two countries to be elevated," which may make the United States more prone to security threats, Savage said. There is additional concern over Russian interference through cyberhacking for the upcoming presidential election, he said. Fears of cyberattacks may lead countries to localize the storage of their data, leading to a less global Internet and limiting dominance by American technology companies within North America and Chinese companies within Asia, Edgar said. But a more likely scenario involves technology companies retaining their global reach while also accommodating for the interests of individual nations.Proactive steps for individuals to stay cyber safeNew digital and technological developments raise "lots of concerns, but it's like every other technology we've seen before. Somehow we humans found a way to cope with it," Savage said.Given that, the legal system and its understanding of cyber issues are not adequate to address the issues that come with new technology, he added. A single election or law will not resolve cybersecurity issues, but people must "try to work together to formulate some sound and reasonable policies that allow us to take advantage of (the benefits of technology) without giving up the fundamental rights that we all think are very important," Edgar said, echoing his sentiment.To stay protected while using any kind of technology, Dieterich recommends updating devices' operating systems and applications, creating strong, unique passwords and using two-factor authentication (which sends a notification to a user's device to approve or deny a log-in) whenever possible.Email users should also be wary of "phishing," emails trying to obtain private information from the user, which may impersonate legitimate users through similar addresses. Recommended steps for protection are accessible to University students on the CIS Center website. Dieterich stressed to students that the IT Service Center is "ultimately here as a service organization, and if you ever have questions ... we're there to help you." In this new digital age, "you need to be an informed digital citizen that's looking after your privacy and those of others," Edgar said. Load-Date: October 2, 2020End of Document

TikTok Global, the mirage of a victory for US national securityCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 21, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 515 wordsBodyPresident Donald Trump sowed doubts again on Monday after having "initially" over the weekend the agreement of China's ByteDance, Oracle and Walmart to create TikTok Global. A new U.S.-based company that promises the creation of 25,000 jobs. However, its structure leaves multiple loose ends in the air.Oracle will have a 12.5% stake in the new company while Walmart gets 7.5%. ByteDance, the TikTok array, claims to control most of the entity. That said, 40% of the Chinese company is already in the hands of U.S. venture capital firms such as Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic. That is why as a result different US investors will have more than 50% of TikTok Global, but initially without a clear majority of voting rights. In fact, ByteDance argues that even after raising funds before a possible IBRO of the new company, it would have an 80% stake in TikTok Global, an entity it still considers its subsidiary. He also insists that TikTok Global's board members will include ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming to current Chinese company board members and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon. Something that is at the same time as a commitment to a council exclusively made up of U.S. citizens and the official statements released Saturday by the retailer itself and the software giant.  It is important to emphasize that ByteDance does not include in this agreement the sale of its source code, algorithms or any of its technologies, so any benefit to US national security is modest. Nor are we talking about TikTok breaking up completely with China, as Trump augured over the weekend, as its operations will not be sold directly to a U.S. company.At the moment, the benefits seem limited and also expensive, according to the Financial Times. Oracle will have a new customer for its cloud business while it watches over home user data, and Walmart will be able to expand its e-commerce operations. Still, with an estimated capitalization of $60 billion, its alleged holdings of $7.5 billion and $4.5 billion are relatively high priced. Nor should we forget that TikTok Global is facing a $5 billion payment to a "patriotic" Trump education fund. However, Bytedance explained that this $5 billion contribution to U.S. coffers for an education fund is unrelated to the agreement reached with Oracle and Walmart. That amount is based on estimates of the taxes the company will have to pay over the next few years, the statement states.At first glance, the situation makes you think that ByteDance and the Chinese government are running as the most benefited by this plan. After all, TikTok's matrix will continue to benefit from the operations of the popular application in the US and Beijing, noting its steel fist, avoiding any technological handover thanks to the new legislation in force in the Asian giant.As a result, after multiple unanswered questions, the US president changed his mind on Monday and pointed out to Fox and Friends that "if we find that Oracle and Walmart are not fully in control, then we will not approve the agreement."commentsforum0WhatsAppFacebook  Twitter  Linkedin       Load-Date: September 22, 2020End of Document

TikTok/WeChat executive actions fall short of data security and privacy needs, says former FCC security headInside Cyber SecuritySeptember 22, 2020Copyright 2020 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights ReservedLength: 1056 wordsBody September 22, 2020 | Charlie Mitchell The underlying security challenges related to massive data collection by foreign -- as well as U.S. -- tech and social media services are poorly addressed by piecemeal moves targeting Chinese-owned companies, according to former FCC security chief David Simpson.What's needed, retired Rear Adm. Simpson told Inside Cybersecurity, are standards for data privacy and security, and rules of the road for Internet Service Provider-level collection and sale of personal data. The security risks are global in nature, Simpson emphasized, and the U.S. should work with partners internationally "to establish strong privacy and security compliance norms."The Commerce Department on Friday banned transactions "relating to mobile applications WeChat and TikTok," citing national security risks from the Chinese-owned social media services in line with an Aug. 6 executive order. But the Trump administration on Saturday delayed the TikTok ban in light of a deal for Oracle and Walmart to take over the service, while a federal judge temporarily blocked the WeChat ban in the midst of a users group lawsuit."From a policy process standpoint, the administration's actions bypassed the more open process used by the nation's independent regulators to develop rules for the information economy," Simpson observed.He said, "While the E.O. for TikTok and WeChat addresses the potential that China might direct sharing of consumer data and put it to malign use, we have strong indications the Russians are today actually using the same kind of data collected illegally from the open market and are using it to attack democracies around the world."Simpson said, "A cynic might say that the E.O. against TikTok and WeChat, without addressing the larger and more imminent problem, is motivated by pure politics. If it is, this is very hurtful for the country as it erodes confidence in free markets, doubles down on protectionist domestic policies that reduce our positive influence in the rest of world information economy, and provides a veneer of action that does not fundamentally change the trajectory of [artificial intelligence] threats to the nation from aggregated information sources for which we still lack strong privacy and security rules. It might be that an outright ban on WeChat and TikTok would be a good move, but doing this without the transparency and public comment required of the independent regulators has left us with a less powerful security result."When the bans were announced last week, Commerce said WeChat and TikTok collect "vast swaths of data from users, including network activity, location data, and browsing and search histories. Each is an active participant in China's civil-military fusion and is subject to mandatory cooperation with the intelligence services of the CCP. This combination results in the use of WeChat and TikTok creating unacceptable risks to our national security."The Justice Department's John Demers in August said the bans help counter the Chinese government's "appetite for large volumes of personal data" about U.S. citizens and others, which Beijing is leveraging as part of its artificial intelligence program."We should be concerned about efforts by autocratic nations with malign intent towards the United States or U.S. persons to collect massive amounts of personal data," Simpson told Inside Cybersecurity.But "the E.O. and subsequent Department of Commerce actions punt on addressing the root of the problem," he said. "They have not undertaken the really challenging and important work of defining national interests and individual rights for privacy and security in the big data fueled information economy. The action taken appears capricious and arbitrary as it is applied narrowly against one of the many sets of threat actors whose actions have run counter to U.S. interests."He said "we certainly need to be vigilant regarding the tremendous value that the aggregation of large, diverse data sets have to achieving useful and malicious AI results," and that "WeChat and TikTok represent collection opportunities for useful, diverse streams of personal and organizational data."But Simpson pointed out, "This is not altogether different than a myriad of other companies in our emerging, global information economy."Simpson called WeChat "a very invasive application" and said "all should think long and hard before they expose their end points to the risk from WeChat."However, he said, "in moving towards the most protectionist option, the administration has skipped over the opportunity to have even greater risk reduction impact by working to establish strong privacy and security compliance norms for WeChat and other such applications that apply beyond our information marketplace."Further, he said, "The recent announcement of the brokered deal with Oracle not only should be concerning as the Administration once again intervenes in the open market to select winners and losers, but it fully ignores then underlying problem inherent in any massive aggregation of data: commercial data gets stolen all the time."He pointed to a 2016 KrebsOnSecurity report of a "Major breach at Oracle from a Russian organized cybercrime group," as well as a TechCrunch report in June that data collected by BlueKai, a firm acquired in 2014 by Oracle, "was spilling out onto the open internet because a server was left unsecured and without a password, exposing billions of records for anyone to find."Simpson said President Trump "and the Republican Congress in March of 2017 repealed FCC rules passed in the last administration that would have constrained ISP collection and sale of personal internet use at the transport level and required consumer opt-in agreements for ISP sale of this data. Since then, Oracle and others have been able to add ISP-level data to their aggregate collection of personally identified social media, online commerce, chat, web streaming and numerous other pattern of life sources."He said, "So the deal brokered by the President with Oracle, fails to change the ownership of TikTok and now increases the diverse data sets managed by a company that has a track record of breaches and FBI concerns that stolen data is being used by Russia to negatively influence our elections." -- Charlie Mitchell (cmitchell@iwpnews.com)Load-Date: September 23, 2020End of Document

Trump administration to ban TikTok, WeChat starting SundayUPISeptember 18, 2020 Friday 9:52 AM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 549 wordsByline: CLYDE HUGHESDateline: Sept. 18 BodyThe Trump administration said Friday it will start banning U.S. downloads and business activities with Chinese social apps TikTok and WeChat beginning Sunday, to "protect the national security of the United States."For TikTok users in the United States, they will not be able to upgrade, improve or maintain existing versions of the popular video-sharing app. Those restrictions become more severe if no deal is reached with the White House by Nov. 12, when Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the app will "for all practical purposes [be] shut down."Sunday's ban shuts down all transferring of funds and transactions on WeChat and bars companies from hosting, delivering content or permit any Internet transit. No users in the United States will be allowed to download any new TikTok or WeChat app as of Sunday.The Commerce Department announced the ban as the administration is weighing approval for an agreement by TikTok to sell a minority stake to U.S. tech company Oracle.TikTok, a China-based short-form video application, has more than 100 million users in the United States."Today's actions prove once again that President [Donald] Trump will do everything in his power to guarantee our national security and protect Americans from the threats of the Chinese Communist Party," Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement."At the president's direction, we have taken significant action to combat China's malicious collection of American citizens' personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations."Vanessa Pappas, the interim head of TikTok, called on social media companies to oppose the Trump administration."We agree that this type of ban would be bad for the industry," Pappas tweeted. "We invite Facebook and Instagram to publicly join our challenge and support our litigation."This is a moment to put aside our competition and focus on core principles like freedom of expression and due process of law."The American Civil Liberties Union said the administration is violating the U.S. Constitution."This order issued today violates the First Amendment rights of people in the United States by restricting their ability to communicate and conduct important transactions on TikTok and WeChat," the ACLU tweeted."The order also harms the privacy and security of millions of existing TikTok and WeChat users in the United States by blocking software updates, which can fix vulnerabilities and make the apps more secure."For weeks, the administration has scrutinized TikTok and owner ByteDance over concerns that data from U.S. users would be accessible by the Chinese government. ByteDance has said those concerns are unfounded.Trump initially lobbied for Microsoft to buy TikTok, and the U.S. software giant was involved in negotiations to buy the company. But ByteDance decided Monday to partner with Oracle.The Trump administration hasn't approved the deal and Trump has previously voiced dissatisfaction with ByteDance remaining a majority owner.The Commerce Department said Trump has given TikTok until Nov. 12 to address the concerns.The administration also warned similar social media companies against displaying the "illicit behavior" it says is being exhibited by TikTok and WeChat.Load-Date: September 18, 2020End of Document

Insights on the Microgrid Control Systems Global Market to 2025 - Featuring ABB Group, Eaton Corporation & Exelon Among OthersPR NewswireOctober 16, 2020 Friday 4:15 PM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1516 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, Oct. 16, 2020 BodyPR NewswireThe"Microgrid Control Systems - Global Market Trajectory & Analytics"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.The global market for Microgrid Control Systems is projected to reach US$3.9 billion by 2025, driven by the rapid migration towards decentralized energy systems.The focus on sustainable energy against the backdrop of growing urgency to address climate change ranks as the primary factor driving adoption of decentralized energy systems. Other benefits offered include ability to utilize more renewable energy, reduced dependence on fossil fuels, more stable and largely lower energy prices, elimination of challenges involved in energy loss during long distance transmission, and reduced need to invest in electricity grid transmission and distribution capacity upgrades. In addition, centralized power grids are aging and suffer from grid power quality issues, and also lack the flexibility to adjust to changing energy consumption patterns worldwide.Also, with several countries worldwide legislating mandatory renewable energy targets, the move towards distributed energy infrastructure is gaining momentum as production of energy closer to consumption areas supports smaller scale generation of renewable energy. Until now, in most markets across the globe power outage and/or scheduled blackouts was the popular load shedding strategy adopted to meet peak demand. However, with rapid digitalization, electrification and electronification of modern societies such a load shedding strategy is unsustainable and detrimental to the growth of economies.As a result, there is strong focus on integrating higher shares of intermittent sources of renewable energy to meet peak demand. The scenario is leading to the development of hybrid energy systems to ensure reliable and sustainable supply of electricity. With traditional utilities stretched to the breaking point due to rapid population growth, urbanization and demands of the digital age, microgrids are the future of smart and distributed energy generation and distribution.There is increased establishment of microgrids in areas rich in green sources of power such as photovoltaic (PV) and wind power. These local grids are then integrated into the main utility grid. Integrating and balancing renewable energy creates challenges in dynamics, control and automation of electrical power systems. This pushes up the need for sophisticated energy management system (EMS) and distribution management system (DMS) for reliable integration, management and control of multi-tiered energy systems.As the issues related to integration and control of microgrids increase in complexity, the need for energy management and control systems will become greater and poised to benefit are microgrid control systems. Another exciting trend in the market is the increase in private deployment of microgrids. With power interruptions and blackouts becoming increasingly common and frequent as a result of extreme weather conditions compounded by aging energy infrastructure, there is a clear preference and migration away from grid-tied solar panels towards private microgrids fully independent and separate from the main power grid.These microgrids have the advantage of functioning normally even when the main grid is shutdown. This is an important advantage for companies against the backdrop of electrification, digitalization and automation all of which are reliant on power quantity, quality, and availability. Also chronic underfunding of energy infrastructure development by governments worldwide as a result of fiscal deficits and lack of funds, is forcing companies to take their own measures to address energy reliability issues. For instance, in the United States, underinvestment in energy infrastructure has reached over US$180 billion, a scenario that bodes well for the proliferation of private microgrids.The United States, China and Europe represent large markets worldwide with a combined share of 63.7% of the market. China also ranks as the fastest growing market with a CAGR of 15.3% over the analysis period supported by the Chinese government's strong interest in decentralized energy governance structures and the ensuing launch of national pilot programs. The domestic government is using a combination of stringent regulatory measures and financial incentives to encourage energy industry stakeholders to pursue energy transition policies.Competitors identified in this market include, among others:ABB Group Eaton Corporation PLC Exelon Corporation General Electric Company Hitachi Ltd.

Worldwide Encryption Software Industry to 2028 - Featuring Proofpoint, McAfee & Oracle Among OthersGlobeNewswireOctober 19, 2020 Monday 3:23 AM PTCopyright 2020 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTSLength: 1015 wordsBodyDublin, Oct.  19, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Global Encryption Software Market 2019-2028" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. As per this report, the global encryption software market is expected to showcase revenue growth at a CAGR of 13.25% during the forecast period of 2019-2028.The surge in the number of data breaches and force attacks, rise in compliance regulations, growing adoption of virtualization & cloud, and increased mobility are major drivers augmenting the growth of the market. Further, widespread adoption of IoT and cloud services, paired with ongoing technological advancements in the encryption chips, is generating numerous opportunities for the studied market's expansion. However, high capital investments, along with limitations on the use of encrypted devices in some countries, are obstructing the progress of the market. In addition, the increase in costs and complexity of encryption keys, lack of education on encryption, and regulatory restrictions on crypto-software are some of the challenging factors affecting the market's evolution during the estimated period. REGIONAL OUTLOOKThe global encryption software market covers the Asia-Pacific, North America, Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East and Africa regions. The Asia-Pacific encryption market is anticipated to become the fastest-growing market for encryption software during the projected duration 2019-2028. In Japan, the surge in cyberattacks on organizations has prompted the government to authenticate new legislation, strategies, and facilities. Additionally, the government is planning to fast-track its research and development of quantum cryptography technology with a target to position it into practical use in 2025. This next-generation technology will permit higher encryption security for diplomatic and business correspondence, opening up growth prospects for the studied market.Likewise, the increase in cyberattacks has influenced the Chinese government to fully recognize the importance of cybersecurity, resulting in the implementation of new cyber laws to strengthen critical infrastructure protection. A recently implemented cyber law governing cryptographic password management focuses on setting standards for the application of cryptography and management of passwords, thereby reducing China's cyber risks on a large scale. Further, the continual use of encryption technologies to hide sensitive data and supervise the information by private entities is expected to offer growth prospects for the encryption software market in China.

Microsoft's bid for TikTok has been rejectedStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeSeptember 14, 2020 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 359 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyMicrosoft says its bid to buy popular video-sharing app TikTok has been rejected, removing a leading suitor for the Chinese-owned app a week before President Donald Trump promises to follow through with a plan to ban it in the U.S.President Donald Trump announced his intention to ban TikTok, unless a USA company takes it over, was announced during a press conference on August 4.Microsoft said Sunday that ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok, will not sell the USA operations of the social video app to the American tech giant.Microsoft hadn't been asked to make revisions to its initial offer in the face of recent signs of opposition to a deal from Chinese government officials, the person added."The company [ByteDance] will not hand out source code to any United States buyer, but the technology team of TikTok in the United States can develop a new algorithm", the source told the South China Morning Post. They added, "We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok's users, while protecting national security interests".Microsoft noted that it looks forward to see how the service will "evolve" in the listed "important areas".Coronavirus cases on the rise in EnglandThe " rule of six " would prohibit gatherings of more than six people indoors in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. There are already some indications that the number of people being admitted to hospital is starting to rise.Microsoft, which was working with Walmart Inc, had been seen as the more likely victor earlier in the process, but its talks have cooled, a person with knowledge of the matter said earlier today. If President Trump rejects the "no algorithm" condition, making the divestment of TikTok impossible, the app could go dark for its users in America after the September 15 deadline.With the deadline for divestment of TikTok's USA operations looming, ByteDance is keen to get a sale through.Chinese tech company ByteDance owns short-form video app TikTok.TikTok didn't immediately return requests for comment Sunday.Oracle is working with venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, a ByteDance investor, in its pursuit of TikTok.Load-Date: September 14, 2020End of Document

Reports: TikTok agrees to partner with Oracle, not Microsoft, in U.S.UPISeptember 14, 2020 Monday 7:08 AM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 319 wordsByline: DON JACOBSONDateline: Sept. 14 BodyTikTok will partner with Oracle in an agreement reached just ahead of a deadline set by the Trump administration over security concerns about the Chinese video app, according to news reports.The Wall Street Journal, CNN and NBC News reported late Sunday the owner of the Chinese short-form video app, ByteDance, will announce the deal naming Oracle as its "trusted tech partner" in the United States in a deal that likely will not be structured as an outright sale.It wasn't immediately clear which parts of the technology would be transferred to the U.S. company.President Donald Trump last month ordered the app would be banned in the United States on Sept. 15 if TikTok didn't agree to a U.S. sale. The administration said the app is a security threat because user data could be accessed by the Chinese government.ByteDance, however, has denied it's a threat and said it stores user data outside of China -- in the United States and Singapore -- and has erected software barriers ensuring that TikTok stores its U.S. users' data separately.TikTok had challenged the ban in a lawsuit as a violation of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees due process.Analysts say the reported deal with Oracle could set a precedent for how Chinese companies can operate in the United States in an era of increased tensions and heightened security concerns.Microsoft, which had also hoped to acquire TikTok, acknowledged in a blog post Sunday that it will not be buying the company."ByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikTok's US operations to Microsoft," it stated. "We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok's users, while protecting national security interests.To do this, we would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combating disinformation, and we made these principles clear."Load-Date: September 14, 2020End of Document

Delay TikTok ban on Trump administrationCE Noticias Financieras EnglishSeptember 28, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 433 wordsBodyThe measure to delay the advance ban will allow Americans to continue using the app while the court considers the legality of the ban and whether the application poses a risk to national security, as the Trump administration asserts.For weeks since President Donald Trump signed two executive orders in early August, the government has threatened to shut down the viral video-sharing app for fear that its Beijing-based parent company ByteDance might be forced to hand over user data to the Chinese government. TikTok, which has 100 million users in the United States alone, has long rejected the claims.TikTok first filed a lawsuit against the administration on September 18, and on Thursday of this week filed a last-minute court order in an effort to prevent the ban from taking effect on Sunday night. On Friday, the government asked the court to reject the court order in a sealed motion, which the government then re-filed as a public motion with some wordings. A public hearing on the court order was set for Sunday morning.In its Sunday ruling, the court ruled fairly, and formal opinion was delivered privately only to the two opposing parties. Due to sensitive material included in the government motion, the parties have until Monday to request any wording before the final opinion is published.The decision is just the latest episode in the ongoing saga of the expanding struggle for the future of the fastest growing social app in the United States. An agreement between ByteDance and the U.S. government was believed. Last weekend resolved the confrontation between the two sides, but the agreement has been examined by the disputed details between buyer Oracle and ByteDance.The administration first launched an action against TikTok on August 6, and President Trump argued in an executive order that enforcement posed an unreasonable national security risk to U.S. citizens. That order reflected a similar one published on the same day that imposed restrictions on the popular Mandarin messaging app WeChat, which is owned by China-based Tencent.Last weekend, a federal magistrate in San Francisco imposed a court order on the WeChat Department of Commerce's ban, awaiting further judicial deliberations. TikTok, whose arguments reflect those of WeChat's lawsuit, expected a similar outcome in its own legal proceedings.One difference between the two claims is the plaintiffs. In the case of WeChat, a group of WeChat users filed a lawsuit arguing that a ban would damage their speech expression. TikTok represents himself in his own struggle with the government, Techcrunch publishes.Load-Date: September 29, 2020End of Document

ADL Report: Anti-Asian Hostility Spikes on Twitter After President Trump's COVID DiagnosisTargeted News ServiceOctober 10, 2020 Saturday 9:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 757 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK Body(TNSRes) -- The Anti-Defamation League issued the following news release on Oct. 9:ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today issued a new study showing a dramatic spike in anti-Asian sentiment and conspiracy theories about the spread of coronavirus in conversations on Twitter in the days immediately following the president's first tweet about his positive diagnosis on October 2.The new study of Twitter conversations and activity, conducted by ADL's Center for Technology and Society, found that in the 12 hours after the president's initial tweet about his and the first lady's COVID-19 diagnosis, there was an 85 percent increase in anti-Asian language and conspiracy theories tracked on the platform. Similarly, the rate of discussions about various conspiracy theories increased 41 percent, with some of those conversations also taking on antisemitic overtones. From October 2-5, the percentage of anti-Asian language on Twitter remained higher than usual.ADL unveiled the new findings this morning in a virtual press conference hosted by Congresswoman Judy Chu (CA-27), Chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. Also joining were Reps. Grace Meng (NY-06) and Brad Schneider (IL-10), and John Yang, President and Executive Director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice (AAJC)."The level of hatred and vitriol that was aimed at Asian Americans and Chinese people on social media is simply staggering," said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO. "The hate speech and stereotyping are irresponsible and can spillover into real world violence. With the alarming increase in physical attacks and hate crimes against Asian Americans in recent months, it is clear that all leaders, including our president, need to stop blaming others for spreading the virus."The data was gathered with the ADL Online Hate Index (OHI), a new tool that uses state of the art technologies such as machine learning to investigate the prevalence of hate speech on social media platforms. This language was also analyzed with help from tools developed by The Alan Turing Institute.ADL also found that one of the most common beliefs expressed by conspiracy theories was that a "New World Order" or "NWO" would be implemented - supposedly run by secretive actors who either gave President Trump the virus or plan to assassinate him under cover of his illness. Other common online conspiracy theories suggest the virus is a bioweapon created by the Chinese government, that Bill Gates caused the virus, and that the virus was "engineered" by humans.These Twitter discussions also mention elements of the QAnon conspiracy theories, calling on "patriqts" deliberately misspelled to signal fellow believers in Q, to rescue the president. Some tweets made antisemitic claims such as President Trump is a "crypto Jew" or a "Zionist agent," or that he is a pawn caught up in the machinations of Jewish interests."Misinformation and xenophobia are dangerous. That is why the CDC and WHO have both warned not to associate COVID-19 with a specific people or country because of the stigma it causes. And now, thanks to the ADL's report, we are able to see that harmful impact in real time," said Rep. Judy Chu. "As the ADL's report shows, the alarming anti-Asian hate incidents we have witnessed in recent months are not an accident. They are the result of an atmosphere of xenophobia and bigotry that is thriving on Twitter and other online platforms."The findings are based on an analysis of more than 2.7 million tweets between 8 p.m. UTC on Oct. 2 through 9 p.m. UTC on Oct. 5. Some of the tweets analyzed harkened back to remarks made by the president on September 29 in the first presidential debate, when he suggested that the pandemic was "China's fault," and referred to the virus as the "China plague," the latest in a pattern of inflammatory remarks over many months.Global anxiety about the outbreak of the coronavirus has spawned misinformation and scapegoating. Since the spread of the virus in the U.S., there has been a surge of incidents of bias, harassment, and violence against Asian Americans, immigrants, and Orthodox Jewish communities.Building on ADL's century of experience working toward a world without hate, the Center for Technology and Society (CTS) serves as a resource to tech platforms and develops proactive solutions to fight hate both online and offline. CTS works at the intersection of technology and civil rights through education, research and advocacy.[Category: Law/Legal]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7262821 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: October 10, 2020End of Document| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2021 LexisNexis Page 27 of 275Oracle Surges As TikTok Rejects Microsoft Ahead of U.S. Sale Deadline  Page 30 of 275US holds its second high-profile visit to Taiwan in two months as Beijing escalates military pressure  Page 32 of 275US holds its second high-profile visit to Taiwan in two months as Beijing escalates military pressure  Page 34 of 275Tencent, a technological monster invisible to the West  Page 36 of 275Trump administration questions Epic Games and Riot about Tencent relationship  Page 38 of 275US to ban use of TikTok and WeChat for national security  Page 51 of 275Gulf Coast races to restore power to more than 400k;
