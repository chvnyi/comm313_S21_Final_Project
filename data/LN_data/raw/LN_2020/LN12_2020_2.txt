ETF Preview: ETFs, Futures Track European Markets as China's Stimulus Reins in Sell-Off in Chinese StocksMT Newswires Live BriefsFebruary 4, 2020 Tuesday 8:33 AM ESTCopyright 2020 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 1281 wordsBody Active broad-market exchange-traded funds ahead of Tuesday's regular session:iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM): +2.4%SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY): +1%iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX): -3.8%VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX): -0.5%United States Oil Fund LP (USO): +1.5%Broad Market IndicatorsBroad market exchange-traded funds were higher, and the actively traded Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) was up 0.5%.Stock futures were also in positive territory, along with European bourses, as Chinese equities rebounded from Monday's massive sell-off -- sparked by the coronavirus outbreak -- after the Chinese government implemented stimulus measures to help cushion the impact of the pandemic on businesses, consumers, financial markets and investors.The People's Bank of China on Monday cut the rate on its reverse repurchase agreements, the tools used to infuse or cut liquidity in the financial system, with banks by 10 basis points. The central bank also ramped up liquidity in the economy by infusing more than $170 billion.Concerns over the coronavirus, however, continued to linger, as the death toll from the outbreak had risen to more than 400 citizens and infected 20,438 in China. Hong Kong has also reported its first death from the coronavirus, according to media reports -- the second death outside of China after a patient died in the Philippines.In earnings news, Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) logged losses after its Q4 revenue missed expectations, after revenue growth in the US slowed down. Looking ahead, Walt Disney (DIS), Ford Motor (F) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) will be reporting their financial results in the after-hours session.The US Redbook -- a measure of comparable store sales at chain stores, discounters, and department stores for the week -- will be out at 8:55 am ET. The prior week's reading was an increase of 5.5%.At 10 am ET, the December reading for factory orders will be released, with Econoday estimates for 1.3%, compared with the prior level of -0.7%.Power Play: TechnologyTechnology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) up 1.8%; iShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF (IYW) and iShares S&P North American Technology ETF (IGM) were inactive.Among semiconductor ETFs, SPDR S&P Semiconductor (XSD) was quiet and Semiconductor Sector Index Fund (SOXX) was up 2.1%.As reported, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares were down nearly 4% after the company posted fourth-quarter results which topped analysts' expectations for earnings but missed on revenue, with a difficult hardware comparison a year earlier seen by several research firms as a reason for the slowdown in US revenue growth. The parent company of Google generated revenue of $46.08 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $39.28 billion in the corresponding quarter of the prior year, but below the consensus estimate of analysts polled by Capital IQ for $46.87 billion. Earnings per share came in at $15.35, up from $12.77 a year earlier and comfortably ahead of the Street's forecast for $12.54 per share.Winners and LosersFinancialSelect Financial Sector SPDR (XLF) was up 1.4%. Direxion Daily Financial Bull 3X shares (FAS) was up 3.1% and its bearish counterpart Direxion Daily Financial Bear 3X Shares (FAZ) was down 4.3%.Hartford Financial Services Group (HIG) late Monday reported Q4 net income of $1.43 per share, compared with $0.78 per share in the year-ago quarter.

Grace & Co (GRA) reported Q4 adjusted profit of $1.31 per share, up from $1.14 per share in the prior-year period and higher than the $1.27 per share average Street estimate from analysts provided by Capital IQ. Net sales for the quarter were $504.5 million, down from $520 million reported for the same period last year but just higher than the $503.7 million average Street estimate. For full-year 2020, the company expects adjusted profit of $4.73 to $4.91 per share on sales growth of 0% to 3%. The Street estimates call for a profit of $4.83 per share on sales growth of 3.9%. Separately, the company said its board has approved an 11% increase in its quarterly cash dividend to a new rate of $0.30 per share, payable on March 17 to shareholders of record on Feb. 25.EnergyDow Jones US Energy Fund (IYE) was quiet and Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) was up 1.7% in pre-market trading.BP (BP) lifted its fourth-quarter dividend and disclosed plans for another $5 billion of asset disposals on Tuesday as adjusted earnings and revenue came in ahead of the market's expectations. Sales and other operating revenue at the London-based group came in at $71.1 billion during the three months that ended Dec. 31, versus $75.7 billion a year ago, according to an earnings statement. That result, however, beat the $67.44 billion average analyst estimate compiled by Capital IQ. Underlying replacement-cost earnings per American Depositary Shares, BP's preferred measure of profitability, stood at $0.76 compared with $1.04 a year earlier and a $0.65 market consensus. The company said that the decline in adjusted earnings largely reflected "the impact of the weaker environment." BP ADRs rose more than 4%.CommoditiesCrude was up 1.5%; United States Oil Fund (USO) was up 2.5%. Natural gas was up 0.9%, and United States Natural Gas Fund (UNG) was up 1.3%.Gold was down 0.7%, while SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) was down 0.6%.

The parents contend that neurologists and the French drug manufacturer did not provide ample warning on the side effects caused by Depakine, which has been sold in Switzerland for more than five decades. Experts have warned that consumption of the drug's active agent, sodium valproate, leads to psychomotor, cognitive and mental development disorders in 30 to 40% of cases, according to reports. In a press statement, Sanofi said that it will "fully cooperate with the judicial authorities." SNY ADRs rose marginally in pre-market trade.ConsumerConsumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP) was up 1%; iShares Dow Jones US Consumer Goods (IYK) and Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC) were flat.Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) was up 1.3%.

Net sales for the quarter ended Dec. 31 were $1.45 billion, down slightly from $1.47 billion a year earlier but in line with Wall Street's projection. For fiscal 2020, Clorox expects EPS of $6.10 to $6.25 per share and a low single-digit decline to a 1% increase in sales. The Capital IQ consensus calls for a 0.5% decline in sales and per-share earnings of $6.14.Price: 328.05, Change: +3.93, Percent Change: +1.21Load-Date: February 5, 2020End of Document

Treasury futures began inching lower during the Asian session, which saw gains in most equity markets while Japan's Nikkei was closed for a holiday. Treasury futures hit pre-market lows around 4:00 ET, and they currently hover a bit above those levels. Economic data released overnight was limited, though South Korea reported its first yr/yr increase in chip exports since October 2018 in the preliminary reading for January. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% at 97.47. Yield Check: 2-yr: +2 bps to 1.58% 3-yr: +1 bp to 1.59% 5-yr: UNCH at 1.64% 10-yr: +1 bp to 1.84% 30-yr: +2 bps to 2.30%News: Taiwan's incumbent President, Tsai Ing-wen, was reelected by a healthy margin. Ms. Tsai pledged to preserve Taiwan's independence from China. The Chinese government issued a statement, saying that the "one country, two systems" policy will be upheld and that peaceful reunification with Taiwan is being sought. Chinese officials announced that subsidies for electric vehicles will not be reduced significantly this year. South Korea's exports increased 5.3% yr/yr during the first ten days of January with semiconductor exports increasing 11.5%. Ireland will hold a general election as early as February 7 but the official date has yet to be announced. There is growing speculation that Renault and Nissan will end their partnership, which would likely lead both companies to seek new manufacturing partners. Germany's December WPI was unchanged m/m (last -0.1%) but decreased 1.3% yr/yr (last -2.5%). U.K.'s November GDP decreased 0.3% m/m (last 0.1%) but was up 0.6% yr/yr (last 1.0%).

USD/JPY:109.52.. EUR/USD:1.1119Soft Employment Report Boosts TreasuriesU.S. Treasuries ended the week on a higher note with most tenors enjoying their second consecutive day of gains. Treasury futures faced some pressure during the Asian session, which saw gains in most equity indices, but the dip in Treasury futures was reversed during the European session, which was not as upbeat. Longer tenors began the day just above their flat lines, but they surged to fresh highs after the release of the Employment Situation report for December. The report was not bad, but it was underwhelming, as nonfarm payrolls missed expectations (actual 145,000; Briefing.com consensus 160,000), average hourly earnings growth was shy of estimates (actual 0.1%; Briefing.com consensus 0.3%), and average workweek was unchanged from its downwardly revised November level (actual 34.3; Briefing.com consensus 34.4). As a result, average weekly earnings increased by just over a dollar (or 0.1%) to $971.38. On a yr/yr basis, average weekly earnings are up 2.3%. Longer-dated Treasuries overtook their opening highs in mid-morning trade and remained near their highs into the close while shorter tenors settled closer to the midpoint of today's range. The U.S. Dollar Index approached its 50-day moving average (97.60) in early-morning trade but retreated throughout the day. The Index slipped 0.1% to 97.35, narrowing this week's gain to 0.5%. Yield Check: 2-yr: -1 bp to 1.56% 3-yr: -1 bp to 1.58% 5-yr: -2 bps to 1.64% 10-yr: -3 bps to 1.83% 30-yr: -5 bps to 2.28%News: Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, announced new sanctions against Iran, targeting the country's aluminum, copper, iron, and steel manufacturers. Eight senior Iranian officials were also sanctioned. House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said that articles of impeachment will be sent to the Senate next week. Taiwan will hold a presidential election tomorrow. The Chinese government is reportedly making a strong effort to prevent incumbent Tsai Ing-wen from winning another term. Japan's November Leading Index decreased 0.7% m/m (last -0.3%) while November Coincident Indicator dipped 0.2% m/m (last -5.1%). November Household Spending rose 2.0% m/m (expected -9.8%; last -11.5%) but was down 2.0% yr/yr (expected 2.5%; last -5.1%).

Earnings News, Efforts To Contain Virus May Generate Buying InterestRTT News (United States)January 22, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 RTT News All Rights ReservedLength: 1574 wordsByline: editorial@rttnews.com,  (RTT Staff Writer)Body       The major U.S. index futures are pointing to a higher open on Wednesday, with stocks likely to move back to the upside following the modest pullback seen in the previous session. A positive reaction to earnings news from IBM Corp. (IBM) may generate early buying interest, with the tech giant jumping by nearly 4 percent in pre-market trading. The advance by IBM comes after the company reported better than expected fourth quarter results and provided upbeat full-year 2020 guidance. Positive sentiment may also be generated in reaction to news of the Chinese government's efforts to stop the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak.  Chinese health officials told the Wall Street Journal that hospitals are stepping up preventive measures and government officials are recommending that people not enter or leave Wuhan. Following the holiday on Monday, stocks fluctuated over the course of the trading day on Tuesday before ending the session mostly lower. With the drop on the day, the major averages pulled back off the record closing highs set last Friday. The major averages all finished the day in negative territory. The Dow slid 152.06 points or 0.5 percent to 29,196.04, the Nasdaq dipped 18.13 points or 0.2 percent to 9,370.81 and the S&P; 500 fell 8.83 points or 0.3 percent to 3,320.79.  Stocks initially move to the downside amid concerns about the economic impact of a deadly coronavirus outbreak in China. Chinese officials revealed the coronavirus outbreak has resulted in six deaths among nearly 300 confirmed cases, with the virus confirmed to be transmissible among humans. The major averages staged a recovery attempt over the course of the morning before pulling back once again after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first travel-related case of the coronavirus in the United States. The CDC said the first case of coronavirus infection in the U.S. was diagnosed in the state of Washington in a patient who recently returned from Wuhan, China. Adding to the negative sentiment, the International Monetary Fund downwardly revised its forecast for global economic outlook due to bigger than expected slowdowns in emerging markets like India. The IMF said it now expects 3.3 percent global growth in 2020 compared to its previous estimate for 3.4 percent growth. The organization also lowered its 2021 growth forecast to 3.4 percent from 3.6 percent. Selling pressure remained relatively subdued, however, with traders seemingly reluctant to miss out on any further upside. A lack of major U.S. economic data may also have kept some traders on the sidelines following the long, holiday weekend. The economic calendar remains relatively quiet throughout the week, which may lead to increased attention on the latest earnings news. Natural gas stocks moved sharply lower over the course of the session, dragging the NYSE Arca Natural Gas Index down by 3.9 percent to its lowest closing level in over a month. The sell-off by natural gas stocks came amid a steep drop by the price of the commodity, with natural gas for February delivery plummeting $0.108 or 5.4 percent to $1.895 per million BTUs. Substantial weakness also emerged among oil service stocks, as reflected by the 3 percent nosedive by the Philadelphia Oil Service Index.  Steel stocks also saw significant weakness amid concerns about the outlook for demand, with the NYSE Arca Steel Index tumbled by 2.6 percent. Transportation, tobacco and biotechnology stocks also saw notable weakness on the day, while gold and housing stocks showed strong moves to the upside. Commodity, Currency Markets  Crude oil futures are sliding $0.53 to $57.85 a barrel after slipping $0.20 to $58.38 a barrel on Tuesday. Meanwhile, an ounce of gold is trading at $1,556.80, down $1.10 compared to the previous session's close of $1,557.90. On Tuesday, gold dipped $2.40. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 109.97 yen compared to the 109.87 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Tuesday. Against the euro, the dollar is trading at $1.1088 compared to yesterday's $1.1082. Asia Asian stocks ended mostly higher on Wednesday as China's response to a virus outbreak tempered some fears of a global pandemic. The World Health Organization is expected to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in response to the coronavirus outbreak, which appears to have originated in eastern China and spread to more Chinese cities, including Beijing and Shanghai. Chinese shares reversed early losses to end the session higher. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 8.61 points, or 0.3 percent, to 3,060.75, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped 355.71 points, or 1.3 percent, to 28,341.04. Japanese shares also recovered from an early slide to end notably higher as panic about the coronavirus in China abated. The Nikkei 225 Index climbed 166.79 points, or 0.7 percent, to 24,031.35, while the broader Topix closed 0.5 percent higher at 1,744.13. Hygiene-related stocks gained ground, with Azearth, a supplier of protective attire, surging 24 percent. Fibre-maker Omikenshi soared almost 10 percent and air conditioning manufacturing company Daikin Industries rallied 2.3 percent.  On the flip side, Mitsubishi Motors lost 4.2 percent after reports of raids on its German distributors as part of a probe into suspected diesel emissions cheating involving Mitsubishi cars. Australian markets rallied to reach fresh highs, driven by gains in financials. The benchmark S&P;/ASX 200 Index jumped 66.40 points, or 0.9 percent, to 7,132.70, while the broader All Ordinaries Index surged up 68.50 points, or 1 percent, to 7,249. Banks ANZ and Commonwealth rose 0.8 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively. National Australia Bank, which is facing a class action lawsuit, ended on a flat note. Mining giant Rio Tinto advanced 0.9 percent. Smaller rival Fortescue Metals Group surged over 5 percent to extend gains for the fifth session after Credit Suisse upgraded the stock to Neutral.  Oil &gas; producer Santos gained 0.8 percent after posting record annual production. Airline stocks slipped amid growing coronavirus fears, with Qantas Airways losing 2 percent. Australia's consumer confidence declined in January as devastating bushfires weighed on the economic growth outlook, survey data from Westpac showed today. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Index of Consumer Sentiment declined 1.8 percent to 93.4 in January from 95.1 in December. Seoul stocks ended sharply higher after data showed South Korea's government spending surge helped the economy post its fastest quarterly growth in more than two years. The benchmark Kospi rallied 27.56 points, or 1.2 percent, to finish at 2,267.25. GDP climbed a seasonally adjusted 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Bank of Korea said in a preliminary reading. That beat forecasts for an increase of 1.0 percent and accelerated from the 0.4 percent gain in the three months prior. Europe European stocks are mixed in cautious trading on Wednesday as panic about the coronavirus outbreak in China abated and investors looked ahead to the first European Central Bank meeting of 2020 for directional cues.  The Geneva-based World Health Organization said it would hold an emergency meeting today to decide whether to designate the coronavirus outbreak as an international public health emergency. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has fallen by 0.3 percent, the French CAC 40 Index is just above the unchanged line and the German DAX Index is up by 0.1 percent. Daimler has moved to the downside. The German automaker reported that its fiscal 2019 preliminary Group earnings before interest and tax, or EBIT, were 5.6 billion euros, sharply lower than 11.1 billion euros recorded in fiscal 2018. Designer brand Burberry Group has also fallen after its sales in Hong Kong dropped by half over the Christmas quarter. Retailer J Sainsbury has also slumped. The company announced that it appointed Simon Roberts as Chief Executive Officer, effective June 1. On the other hand, technology company Sage Group has jumped after delivering a strong quarter and backing its guidance for the full financial year.  Berkeley Group Holdings has also soared. The company said it would increase its returns to shareholders by about 455 million pounds ($594.00 million) over the next two years Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML Holding N.V. has also moved higher after it launched a three-year share-buyback program of up to 6 billion euros. U.S. Economic Reports The National Association of Realtors is scheduled to release its report on existing home sales in the month of December at 10 am ET. Economists expect existing home sales to jump by 1.2 percent to an annual rate of 5.43 million in December after tumbling by 1.7 percent to a rate of 5.35 million in November. Stocks In Focus Shares of Moderna (MRNA) are moving sharply higher in pre-market trading after the drugmaker told CNBC it is working with U.S. government health agencies to develop a vaccine for the current strain of coronavirus. United Airlines (UAL) may regain ground following yesterday's sell-off after reporting fourth quarter earnings that exceeded analyst estimates. On the other hand, shares of Johnson &Johnson; (JNJ) are likely to see initial weakness after the healthcare giant reported fourth quarter earnings that beat estimates but on slightly weaker than expected revenues.        Load-Date: February 26, 2020End of Document

The cash market appeared on track to deepen its recent pullback after Treasury futures faced some overnight pressure, but futures rebounded during the European session, leading to a flat start. Intraday action was restrained, leaving the 10-yr yield inside a three-basis point range. The long bond outperformed throughout the day, settling just below its high, while shorter tenors underperformed slightly. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.2% to 98.51, logging its fourth consecutive advance.

Today's Data: The BLS reported that nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased 1.4% in the fourth quarter (Briefing.com consensus 1.7%). Unit labor costs were also up 1.4% (Briefing.com consensus 1.2%). The key takeaway from the report is that productivity is still running below the long-term average from 1947 to 2019 (2.1%); however, the 1.7% growth in nonfarm business sector productivity in 2019 was the strongest since 2010 and above the 1.3% average for the period 2007-2019. Initial claims for the week ending February 1 decreased by 15,000 to 202,000 (Briefing.com consensus 218,000), which is a nine-month low.

Once issued, the draft order is expected to detail the FCC's approach to clearing C-band spectrum to enable rapid and nationwide 5G network deployment in the U.S. Intelsat CEO Steve Spengler said, "The issuance of the draft order represents a significant milestone in a process that we began in 2017. We look forward to reviewing the draft order, once issued, to place Chairman Pai's comments in full context. We note with appreciation the hard work of all stakeholders to get to this juncture, and the work to come leading up to the Commission's vote on February 28, 2020." During his remarks, Chairman Pai indicated that satellite operators need to be incentivized to undertake the complex task of clearing their licensed spectrum while protecting the television and radio content distribution ecosystem using C-band today. Specifically. the Chairman indicated a total of $9.7 bln of incentive payments for certain satellite operators to clear the spectrum on an accelerated basis, plus the reimbursement of the costs for clearing. In November 2019, the FCC announced its intention to pursue a public auction of C-Band spectrum, which was a significant departure from the market-based construct advocated by the satellite industry. Despite that departure, Intelsat has never wavered in its attempts to bring this critical spectrum to market. Intelsat has invested $36 bln to build its C-Band business over the last 40 years. Beginning in September 2017, Intelsat advocated for an innovative structure to clear significant additional spectrum for 5G mobile services, while continuing to deliver on commitments to customers who use Intelsat's C-band to reach U.S. households. Since that time, it has become increasingly clear that this initiative has the potential both to significantly improve national security and to enable the accelerated deployment of 5G.Intelsat firmly supports Chairman Pai, the FCC, and the Administration in shared goals of improving U.S. national security, stimulating hundreds of billions of dollars in additional U.S. economic growth, and creating millions of new jobs for U.S. workers. Intelsat will review and analyze the draft order to determine its potential impact on Intelsat's business and stakeholders.In a statement, the C-Band Alliance said, "The imminent issuance of the draft order reflects the tireless efforts of many over the past several years to ensure that this critical spectrum comes to market safely, quickly, and efficiently. Today's comments by Chairman Pai are a significant development in this important proceeding. We look forward to reviewing the draft order, once issued, to place Chairman Pai's comments in full context."Related tickers: IRDM, ORBC, SATS, VSAT, IMASY, SGBAF13:49COMDX Metals Settlement PricesFeb gold settled today's session up $6.80 (0.44%) at $1564.4/oz Mar silver settled today's session $0.21 higher (1.19%) at $17.825/oz Mar copper settled $0.01 higher (0.41%) at $2.5935/lb13:21OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:EXEL Feb 19 calls (volume: 2030, open int: 250, implied vol: ~68%, prev day implied vol: 61%).

In just three sessions, the major indices were up between 3.4% and 4.2%.In a manner of speaking, the market looks to be catching its breath and is consolidating some of its outsized, and relatively easy, gains this week as investor conviction has been reserved for individual stocks, like Twitter (TWTR 38.81, +5.42, +16.3%), Cardinal Health (CAH 58.83, +6.15, +11.7%), Becton Dickinson (BDX 254.00, -31.99, -12.0%), and Kellogg (K 64.52, -4.84, -7.0%), all of which have stirred investor sentiment with their latest earnings reports.From a sector standpoint, there isn't much that is standing out, other than the communication services sector (+1.0%), which is benefiting from a rebound in shares of Alphabet (GOOG 1473.46, +25.23, +1.7%), which had slipped as much as 3.7% following the company's earnings report after the close on Monday.The stock market's tired disposition has also been reflected in the lackluster follow through off the open.

There was a statistically significant reduction in inflammatory lesions versus vehicle as early as Week 4 of treatment, and all subsequently assessed timepoints throughout the entire treatment course of the study. Subjects were no more likely to experience treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) from FMX103 than from vehicle treatment. The majority of TEAEs were mild to moderate. More than 95% of subjects using FMX103 had skin tolerability scores of none or mild at the treatment application site at Week 12. Specifically for erythema as part of skin tolerability assessments, 5.5% and 6.6% of subjects who received FMX103 in Studies 11 and 12 respectively, were assessed as being clear or almost clear at Baseline. At Week 12, 40.9% and 48.3% of subjects who received FMX103 respectively were assessed as clear or almost clear of erythema.08:02BONDX Overnight Treasury Market SummaryInching HigherU.S. Treasuries are on track to begin the day just above yesterday's closing levels.

The first quarter is generally our weakest quarter of the year as we experience lower revenue per tractor and higher costs than the other quarters due to seasonal freight fluctuations and harsher operating conditions. While we see positive trends in certain areas, there continues to be uncertainty in the short-term environment, which will impact the actual sequential margin deterioration in the first quarter. We continue to believe that market conditions will improve in the back half 2020. The timing and magnitude of market changes will have a significant impact on our quarterly results given our substantial operating leverage.06:14PPD PPD prices 60.0 mln share IPO at $27, the high end of the $24-$27 expected price range06:14EQNR Equinor reports Q4 results; increases dividend (18.61 )Q4 adj earnings were USD 3.55 bln, down from USD 4.39 bln in the same period in 2018 (after tax were USD 1.19 billion, down from USD 1.54 billion in the same period last year) Lower prices for both liquids and gas impacted the earnings for the quarter.

In contract drilling, our rig count averaged 123 rigs in the fourth quarter, down from 142 rigs in the third quarter.

The Group has strong capacity to generate cash flow and, in a 60 $/b environment, expects to increase it by approximately 1 B$ per year starting from 2019. The Group will continue to implement its strategy for profitable growth on the integrated gas and low-carbon electricity chains. LNG sales will benefit notably in 2020 from the start-ups of Yamal LNG train 4 as well as Cameron LNG train 3 and be more than 30 Mt/y.Spending discipline is maintained and the Group continues its cost reduction program with an objective of more than 5 B$ in cumulative savings in 2020. Net investments in 2020 should be on the order of 18 B$, and the Group will complete its 5 B$ asset sale program over the years 2019-20 (~3 B$ already announced). Organic production growth should be more than 2% in 2020, thanks to ramp-ups of projects started in 2019 and expected start-ups in 2020, notably Iara 2 in Brazil. Since the start of the fourth quarter, global refining margins are weak as a result of high product inventories and oil prices supported by OPEC. The Downstream will continue to rely on its diversified portfolio, notably its integrated platforms in Refining & Chemicals as well as its non-cyclical businesses. Taking into account the strong visibility on cash flow, the Group will continue to increase the dividend with a guidance of 5-6% per year. It will also continue to buy back shares, with an amount expected for 2020 of 2.0 B$ in a 60 $/b environment.Additionally, Total has divested its 27.5% interest in Fosmax LNG, operator of the Fos Cavaou liquefied natural gas terminal, as a result of a competitive sale process to Elengy, Fosmax LNG's shareholder with a 72.5% stake, that exercised its preemption right.

For restaurants that remain open, same-store sales since the Chinese New Year holiday period were down 40-50% compared to the comparable Chinese New Year holiday period in 2019, due to shortened operating hours, reduced traffic and other factors related to the outbreak. At this time, the co cannot forecast when the closed restaurants will re-open (and at what rate) and the traffic will be restored (and at what level), or the other factors relating to the outbreak that will continue to impact operations. Furthermore, the co may be required or otherwise decide to close additional stores, reduce operating hours, or take other steps, as the situation warrants.

Orders from the microelectronics market were well above a book-to-bill of one. We received new ELA system orders, and service revenues reflected increases in consumer purchases of OLED-equipped handsets. The wafer fab equipment market has accelerated over the past three months after two major chip manufacturers announced higher capex budgets for 2020, which contributed to better than expected bookings during fiscal Q1. The advanced packaging market is also trending up due to 5G investments in China," said John Ambroseo, Coherent's President and Chief Executive Officer. "The materials processing (MP) market took another step forward with a book-to-bill of one in a seasonally-adjusted quarter. Concerns about weak PMIs in the Eurozone are partially offset by strength in North America and a domestic-led recovery in China.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.7%) and Russell 2000 (+1.5%) outperformed the benchmark index. The Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) underperformed in a rare outing, although it still closed at a new high.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors contributed to the advance, especially the energy sector (+3.8%) after weeks of underperformance and a nice rebound in oil prices ($50.85, +1.24, +2.5%). The real estate sector (-0.1%) was the lone holdout today.The bullish price action was driven mostly by optimism, particularly tied to the prevailing view that the economy is fine and any negative impact resulting from the coronavirus will be minimal. Aiding this sentiment were reports that progress is being made in developing a vaccine and economic data depicting a healthy labor market and services sector.Specifically, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January increased to 55.5% (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) from 54.9% in December.

FBI SAYS CHINA 'BIGGEST THREAT' TO US LAW ENFORCEMENT AS ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN 2020States News ServiceFebruary 6, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 572 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has already arrested nearly 80 percent of the total number of arrests it made in China-related cases this year as it did in all of 2019, officials said Thursday, identifying the Asian superpower as the biggest law enforcement threat to the U.S.FBI counterintelligence chief John Brown told a conference at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington that the bureau had already arrested 19 people in cases in which the Chinese government was involved in the first 37 days of 2020, compared to 24 in all of last year and 15 five years earlier."We believe that no country poses a greater threat than Communist China," Brown said."Today investigations related to China make up a greater percentage of our counterintelligence workload than at any other time in the FBI's history."The FBI's director, Christopher Wray, said the bureau currently has around 1,000 open investigations of Chinese technology theft pending in its 56 regional offices, which he said span "just about every industry sector."China takes advantage of academic openness in the U.S. to steal technology using "campus proxies" and through the establishment of "institutes on our campuses," he said, referring to the Confucius Institutes that the U.S. Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations said last year should be shut down if there is no improvement in transparency around their dealings with U.S. universities.Wray called for a coordinated effort by the U.S. government to battle the growing threat of China to U.S. law enforcement.China is targeting defense information, technology used in renewable energy and electric vehicles, and high-end medical technology through hacking and the recruitment of people with access to such research and trade secrets, the officials said.Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center William Evanina, who has estimated that Chinese theft of trade secrets costs the U.S. hundreds of billions of dollars annually, warned at Thursday's event that "the long-term existential threat to the security of our nation is real."China InitiativeIn 2018, the U.S. Justice Department created an effort known as the China Initiative to battle the threat of Beijing-backed espionage.Last year, authorities expelled two Chinese diplomats who have been accused of accessing a military base in Virginia, and also jailed former U.S. intelligence officials on China-related espionage charges.In January, authorities arrested head of Harvard University's chemistry and chemical biology department, Charles Lieber, and charged him with making false statements about his involvement in the Chinese government-backed Thousand Talents Program that offers incentives to mainly Chinese scientists abroad to bring their research back to China.In an emailed statement to Reuters news agency, the Chinese embassy in Washington called the allegations made at Thursday's conference "entirely baseless," and countered that "the people-to-people exchange between China and the U.S. is conducive to stronger understanding between the two peoples and serves the fundamental interests of our two countries."According to a report by the Associated Press last year, the FBI had been reaching out to colleges and universities across the country to warn them of the threat of economic espionage on their campuses.Load-Date: February 7, 2020End of Document

SOME STUDENTS, EX-PATS REMAIN IN WUHAN WITH LITTLE HELPStates News ServiceJanuary 28, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1157 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):Nations around the world are evacuating their students and other citizens from coronavirus-stricken China, while other countries are choosing to leave their citizens in Wuhan, the university city where the virus reportedly started.Around 500 Bangladeshi students are among the stranded in Wuhan. They have called for help on social media, while the Chinese and Bangladesh governments negotiate a strategy.Through the social [media] site WeChat, students got informed of the mystery infectious virus that was spreading fast, Mazharul Islam, a freshman in the School of Electrical Engineering at Wuhan University, told VOA. However, we were told that there is nothing to get worried about and the virus is under control. Later through WeChat we were advised to use masks when stepping out of the dormitory.Islam said there were 30 Bangladeshi students on his campus. Through Chinese social media WeChat, he said, he and others learned there were 500 Bangladeshi students in Wuhan. He said the Bangladesh Embassy in Beijing would notify us if there were any emergency evacuation taking place. He said they have been provided with masks and preventive medicines from the university.Masudur Rahman, the deputy chief of mission at the Bangladesh Embassy in Beijing, said of the 3,000 Bangladeshis in China, most are students and teachers.We, from the Bangladesh Embassy in Beijing, are in contact with the Chinese authorities and are trying to find a possible solution in the present situation, Rahman said. Evacuation would have to take place through a bilateral arrangement.Meanwhile, other countries are arranging flights out of China for their citizens. France where three cases of the coronavirus have been reported -- said it will operate several direct flights under the supervision of medical experts out of China midweek for French citizens who want to leave, AFP reported. The number could "range from a few dozen to a few hundred" of its 800 citizens in China, said Health Minister Agnes Buzyn.Evacuees will "stay in a holding area for 14 days," the duration it takes for the virus to incubate, when they land in France, AFP reported.Morocco ordered the repatriation of 100 Moroccan nationals mostly students from the Wuhan area on Monday, according to Reuters. Other countries arranging to have their citizens and students flow out include Japan, Spain, Britain and Netherlands. Canada, which has about 167 nationals in the Wuhan area, has not planned evacuations but has not ruled them out, Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said Monday. Each consular request would be evaluated on a "case by case basis," he told Reuters.The epidemic, which originated in Wuhan city, has claimed 81 lives in China and infected more than 2,800 people globally, most of them in China.&#55357;&#56524; CORONAVIRUS UPDATEDEATHS&#55356;&#56808;&#55356;&#56819; China 81CONFIRMED CASES&#55356;&#56808;&#55356;&#56819; China 2700&#55356;&#56826;&#55356;&#56824; US 5&#55356;&#56806;&#55356;&#56826;Australia 5&#55356;&#56811;&#55356;&#56823; France 3&#55356;&#56819;&#55356;&#56821;Nepal 1&#55356;&#56815;&#55356;&#56821; Japan 4&#55356;&#56824;&#55356;&#56812; Singapore 4&#55356;&#56816;&#55356;&#56823; South Korea 4&#55356;&#56825;&#55356;&#56828; Taiwan 5&#55356;&#56825;&#55356;&#56813; Thailand 8&#55356;&#56827;&#55356;&#56819; Vietnam 2&#55356;&#56818;&#55356;&#56830;Malaysia 4&#55356;&#56816;&#55356;&#56813; Cambodia 1(Source: VOA/ AFP)The Voice of America (@VOANews) January 27, 2020The Chinese government has locked down Wuhan and neighboring cities to keep the virus from spreading. Tens of millions of people, including foreigners and students, are among them. Many students left the Wuhan area for Lunar New Year's holiday and winter break, but others stayed behind.Students from Wuhan Traveling Globally for HolidaysHundreds of students recently left for countries around the world for winter breakMore than 60 Afghan students are among foreigners stranded in Wuhan. The Afghan government has asked China to keep the students in Wuhan and not send them back to Afghanistan, much to the disappointment of their families in Afghanistan.Universities are locked-down, and students are stranded at their rooms and are not allowed to leave their campuses," said Ahmad Jawed Beheshti, an Afghan student at Sichuan University in China. "Just yesterday, they closed off our university.Javed Ahmad Qaem, Afghan ambassador to China, told VOA the students have not been forgotten."They are nervous, but Chinese authorities are acting responsibly," he said. "They have a focal point for each embassy. If and when relocation is allowed inside China or outside China, we will also be at the forefront. So far relocation is not allowed. They are isolated and we are monitoring the situation closely."The president of the Indonesian Student Association (PPI) of Chinape, Nur Musyafak, in Wuhan said Indonesian citizens -- including students -- want to get out of the city. Foreign Ministry data show there are 428 Indonesian citizens studying in Wuhan. Most of those students returned to Indonesia for winter break.But those remaining in China need a recommendation letter from the Indonesian Republic Embassy if they want to leave."We're gathering all the passport numbers of these 98" Indonesians who remain in Wuhan. "Once we have the data, we will request a letter from the Indonesian Embassy," Nur told VOA.The dorm is 20 kilometers from the Huanan Seafood Market, where the coronavirus is suspected of emanating. Campuses in Wuhan have distributed masks, liquid soap, and free thermometers to students, Nur said. The universities have instructed students not to leave their room too often.Authorities in Myanmar said they had cancelled a planned evacuation of 60 students from Mandalay who were studying in Wuhan. Kyaw Yin Myint, a spokesman for the Mandalay municipal government, told Reuters that a "final decision" had been made to send them back after 14 days, once the virus' incubation period had passed.In Russia, direct flights from Wuhan to Moscow were suspended last week. At least 140 Russians, 75 of them students, are known to be in Wuhan and Hubei, the Russian embassy in China said on Monday, Reuters reported from the TASS news agency.The United States said it would evacuate personnel and citizens in China, several news outlets reported. The U.S. State Department said it will evacuate personnel from its Wuhan consulate to the United States and offer a limited number of seats to private U.S. citizens on a flight. Some private citizens will be able to board the "single flight" leaving Wuhan on Jan. 28 for San Francisco, it said.Sayed Hasib Mawdoodi of VOA's Afghan Service in Kabul, Sanjana Feroz and KabirUddin Sarkar of the Bangla Service in Washington, and Rio Tuasikal of the Indonesian Service in Bandung, Indonesia, contributed to this report.Load-Date: February 6, 2020End of Document

NEPAL BORDER AGREEMENT WITH CHINA SPARKS FEARS AMONG TIBETANSStates News ServiceFebruary 14, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1164 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A treaty signed by China and Nepal in October 2019 that manages border controls between the two countries poses significant threats to Tibetans fleeing their homeland to escape Chinese rule, Tibetan advocacy groups and other sources say.The agreement on a Border Management System, signed during Chinese president Xi Jinping's visit last year to Nepal, commits both countries to hand back, within seven days of being detained, persons found crossing the border illegally, the Washington-based International Campaign for Tibet (ICT) said in a report this week."This could result in Tibetans who try to escape to freedom being sent back to the repressive rule of the Chinese Communist Party," ICT said.Meanwhile, a Treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance on Criminal Matters signed in October may expose Tibetans living in Nepal to danger for exercising their freedoms, already sharply restricted in Nepal, to express their distinct cultural identity or voice political views opposed by China, ICT said."Given China's influence on the less-developed Nepal and the obvious power imbalance between the two countries, there are worries that Nepal may disregard legal protections for Tibetans while responding to Chinese requests under this treaty," the rights group said.Details of the two agreements were recently brought to light when Nepal's foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali offered written clarifications on their provisions to members of the country's parliament, ICT said.Meanwhile, many fear that China and Nepal, which shares a long border with Tibet, may soon sign a treaty on extradition, further endangering Tibetans currently living in Nepal, sources say.'We are very worried'Speaking to RFA's Tibetan Service, Kapil Shresthaa human rights activist and political science professor at Tribhuvan University in Kathmandusaid that Nepal has been "tremendously influenced by Chinese pressure and policies" in recent years."We are very worried," Shrestha said."Nepal's government has enacted very undemocratic and draconian measures in curbing Nepal's media and human rights in general," he said, adding that the possible extradition of "so-called offenders" from Nepal to China would target the Tibetan community in particular."Although the general agreements may not cite an extradition clause, if we look at all of the agreements' provisions in detail, there are reasons for concern," added Nepalese social and political activist Arun Subedi, speaking to RFA.Also speaking to RFA, Gajendra Prasadthe Nepalese journalist who broke the story of the signed treaties in the online news web portal Khaburhubsaid that Nepal's new Border Management System would not likely affect the lives of Tibetan refugees in Nepal right away."But it is sure to limit their activities in the days to come," he said.Many Tibetans living in Nepal already fear monitoring by police, with some approached by RFA's Tibetan Service for comment agreeing to speak only on condition of anonymity.One, a resident of Kathmandu calling herself Tenzin (not her real name), said that she used to believe that Tibetans living in Nepal would be safe as long as they stayed away from political activities.But during Chinese president Xi's visit to Nepal last year, "I felt what it is really like to have no country of your own," she said."The Nepalese police would stop by [Tibetans'] houses and shops and probe into things," she said. "And anyone found in possession of things bearing symbols of Tibet, such as Tibetan flags or clothing, would be arrested.""The Chinese government has constantly insisted that Nepal recognize Tibetans as Chinese citizens, thus pressuring the Nepalese government to refuse to issue legal documents to Tibetans showing them as refugees," added Sangpo, a local Tibetan assembly chairman and resident of Pokhara, Nepal, since 1959.Many have no papersAround 3,000 to 4,000 Tibetans now live in Nepal without legal papers, sources told RFA, speaking on condition they not be named.The number of Tibetans escaping into Nepal from China has meanwhile plunged in the last 30 years, from a high of around 3,000 crossing the border each year from 1985-86 to 2008, to smaller numbers each year after tighter border controls were imposed following widespread protests in Tibet in 2008, sources said.Between 2008 and 2012, around 600 Tibetans successfully escaped into Nepal. Between 2012 and 2018, about 100 crossed the border, and only 19 Tibetans crossed into Nepal last year, sources said.The U.N., European Union, and United States have urged Nepal's government to protect the rights of Tibetans living in Nepal and of refugees fleeing across the mountains from Tibet, with a spokesman from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refguees (UNHCR) in Geneva calling "on all States to adhere to the globally recognized principle of non-refoulement that prohibits countries from expelling or returning people to a territory where their life of freedom would be threatened."The U.S. Congress's Tom Lanto Human Rights Commission meanwhile said in a Nov. 20, 2019 letter to Nepal's ambassador to the United States that extradition, while a legitimate tool of international law enforcement, "should not be used to send people to a country where they would be at risk of serious human rights abuses.""Recognizing the [People's Republic of China's] long standing repression of Tibetans within its borders, we feat that an extradition treaty would be used by that government to persecute Tibetans living in Nepal," the Lantos Commission said."The United States views the safety and human rights of Tibetan refugees in Nepal as an issue of great importance," added the U.S. State Department in response to an RFA request for comment.Mounting pressure from ChinaMeanwhile, "under mounting pressure from China," Nepal has blocked U.S. moves to bring Tibetan refugees to the United States under the terms of the Tibetan Refugee Assistance Act introduced by Congress in 2006, ICT vice-president Bhuchung Tsering said, speaking to RFA."In order for Tibetan refugees living in Nepal to qualify to leave for the USA, they need an authorization letter and exit permit from the Nepalese government, and these have been denied to them," Tsering said.Nepal cites its growing economic ties with Beijing, with promises of millions of dollars of Chinese investment in Nepalese development projects, in cracking down on Tibetan activities in the country, including elections in the refugee community and birthday celebrations for exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.Xi Jinping's Oct. 12-13 visit was the first to Nepal by a Chinese president since 1996, and followed a day-long visit by the Chinese leader to India that saw at least 15 members of a Tibetan exile organization detained for planning protests.Reported by Tenzin Dickyi, Tashi Wangchuk, and Kalden Lodoe for RFA's Tibetan Service.

CHINESE DOCTOR WHO BLEW WHISTLE ON VIRUS DIES AFTER TREATMENT 'DELAY'States News ServiceFebruary 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1037 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A whistleblowing Wuhan doctor hauled in by China's state security police after he and colleagues tried to warn the authorities about the coronavirus has died of the disease, sparking an outcry on the country's usually tightly regulated social media platforms.Li Wenliang, 34, was one of eight medical professionals in the central Chinese city of Wuhan who tried to warn colleagues and others about a newly discovered virus similar to SARS amid silence from health officials.After he reported that seven patients had contracted the virus, he was visited on Jan. 3 by police, who forced him to sign a statement admitting to having spread "rumors."Li then developed a cough on Jan. 10, fever on Jan. 11 and was hospitalized on Jan. 12, after which he began having trouble breathing.His death was confirmed early Friday , prompting a deluge of messages of mourning and outrage at his treatment at the hands of the ruling Chinese Communist Party."Ophthalmologist Li Wenliang of this hospital, who was unfortunately infected during the fight against the pneumonia epidemic caused by the novel coronavirus, died at 2.58 a.m. on Feb. 7, 2020 after efforts to save him were in vain," the Central Hospital of Wuhan said in an announcement on its official Weibo account.The announcement garnered hundreds of thousands of comments, many of which hit out at the lack of transparency around the epidemic on the part of Chinese health officials."Here's hoping that there are no more lies in heaven," @weichudemeng wrote, while @Photographer_an_sir called on the government to "treat his family well.""May your journey be peaceful Dr. Li," wrote @sssoul_liiin, with a crying emoji. "You were totally awesome in this life."@Xia Wanye added: "Thank you for trying your best to protect us," with weeping and candle emojis.Family unable to view bodyUser @Toake78 commented: "It wasn't a rumor, but the world was drunk. Then we woke up alone, with the good doctor already gone."Li's mother told RFA that the family had been unable to say farewell to his remains, which had already been cremated."We weren't allowed to see him, such a shame," she said. "His ashes have been temporarily placed because his wife hasn't arrived yet. They have a five-year-old son."She said Li had appeared to be on the road to recovery, but his condition had deteriorated sharply in the last two days of his life.A total of 31,526 confirmed coronavirus cases was reported on Friday , the majority of which are still within China's borders.Residents of Wuhan left flowers for Li outside the gate of the hospital on Friday .Rights activist Wang Aizhong said the claim that Li had been "rumor-mongering" was nonsense, because Chinese officials had already notified their U.S. counterparts about the disease."The Chinese government knew that this was no rumor, but the Wuhan police and the state media said that Li was spreading rumors," Wang said. "This is totally inconsistent with the facts."Wuhan activist Zhang Renqiang said Li and his colleagues were "true heroes.""He's a hero now, and the whole world knows it," Zhang said.Gag order in mediaA journalist surnamed Chen said there had been a gag order on the media around Li's death on Thursday night similar to that surrounding the death of late Nobel peace laureate Liu Xiaobo.He said the authorities have announced an "investigation" to make it look as if the central government will bring justice to the situation."The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection announced at noon that they will send a team to investigate," Chen said."That way, people will be guided to imagine a kind of Judge Pao scenario," he said, in a reference to a popular figure from imperial China who brought corrupt officials to book."They may fire some of the low-ranking cops [as scapegoats], or it may be that nothing will happen at all," he said.Chen said Li was likely denied testing, diagnosis and treatment after he first got sick, and was left to fend for himself by buying globulins at his own expense."His diagnosis wasn't confirmed until Feb. 1, indicating that he didn't get much attention," he said. "We think now that this was a form of retaliation."" Last night they didn't start administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation until after his vital signs were gone," Chen said. "There was a delay."Li's wife sent an appeal for help after his death, saying that she, her parents and brother are also infected and in isolation, and that there is a five-year-old child left with nobody to care for him.Repeated calls to her cell phone rang unanswered on Friday .Repeated calls to Wu Zhequn, director of the science and technology division of the Wuhan police department, also rang unanswered.Journalist harassed by policeLi received a visit from the police after sending out a message to former classmates on Dec. 30 that read: "Seven cases of SARS have been diagnosed in the Huanan Seafood Market, and have been isolated in the emergency department of our hospital."He was repeatedly called in for questioning by his bosses and police, and warned off saying any more.He was repeatedly questioned even after being hospitalized.Citizen journalist Fang Bin said he has also been repeatedly questioned and harassed by local police after he posted video of the situation on the ground at an Wuhan hospital.He has refused to comply and has repeatedly called on the ruling Chinese Communist Party to admit that he is in the right."I told them that everything they do is rude, simplistic and dumb," Fang told RFA. "The whole world gets what I, Fang Bin, have been doing.""You should go back and tell them that the Chinese government has to admit that Fang Bin was right," he said.Rights activist Huang Yongxiang said the authorities aren't quite sure how to handle people like Fang."If the whole truth about the epidemic is made public, it's definitely going to cause panic, but if it isn't made public, it will harm their efforts at prevention and control," Huang said."So the authorities are in a dilemma."Reported by Jia Ao and Hsia Hsiao-hwa for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Wong Siu-san and Sing Man for the Cantonese Service.

US says Chinese military stole masses of Americans' dataAssociated Press Financial WireFebruary 11, 2020 Tuesday 4:24 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICAL NEWSLength: 1091 wordsByline: By ERIC TUCKER and MICHAEL BALSAMO, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - Four members of the Chinese military have been charged with breaking into the computer networks of the Equifax credit reporting agency and stealing the personal information of tens of millions of Americans, the Justice Department said Monday, blaming Beijing for one of the largest hacks in history to target consumer data.The hackers in the 2017 breach stole the personal information of roughly 145 million Americans, collecting names, addresses, Social Security and driver's license numbers and other data stored in the company's databases. The intrusion damaged the company's reputation and underscored China's increasingly aggressive and sophisticated intelligence-gathering methods."The scale of the theft was staggering," Attorney General William Barr said Monday in announcing the indictment. "This theft not only caused significant financial damage to Equifax, but invaded the privacy of many millions of Americans, and imposed substantial costs and burdens on them as they have had to take measures to protect against identity theft."The case is the latest U.S. accusation against Chinese hackers suspected of breaching networks of American corporations, including steel manufacturers, a hotel chain and a health insurer. It comes as the Trump administration has warned against what it sees as the growing political and economic influence of China, and efforts by Beijing to collect data for financial and intelligence purposes and to steal research and innovation.The indictment arrives at a delicate time in relations between Washington and Beijing. Even as President Donald Trump points to a preliminary trade pact with China as evidence of his ability to work with the Communist government, other members of his administration have been warning against cybersecurity and surveillance risks posed by China, especially as the tech giant Huawei seeks to become part of new, high-speed 5G wireless networks across the globe.Experts and U.S. officials say the Equifax theft is consistent with the Chinese government's interest in accumulating as much information about Americans as possible.The data can be used by China to target U.S. government officials and ordinary citizens, including possible spies, and to find weaknesses and vulnerabilities that can be exploited - such as for purposes of blackmail. The FBI has not seen that happen yet in this case, said Deputy Director David Bowdich, though he said it "doesn't mean it will or will not happen in the future.""We have to be able to recognize that as a counterintelligence issue, not a cyber issue," Bill Evanina, the U.S. government's top counterintelligence official, said of the Equifax case.The four accused hackers are suspected members of the People's Liberation Army, an arm of the Chinese military that was blamed in 2014 for a series of intrusions into American corporations.Prosecutors say they exploited a software vulnerability to gain access to Equifax's computers, obtaining log-in credentials that they used to navigate databases and review records. They also took steps to cover their tracks, the indictment says, wiping log files on a daily basis and routing traffic through about three dozen servers in nearly 20 countries.Besides stealing personal information, the hackers also made off with some of the company's sensitive trade secrets, including database designs, law enforcement officials said.Equifax, headquartered in Atlanta, maintains a massive repository of consumer information that it sells to businesses looking to verify identities or assess creditworthiness. All told, the indictment says, the company holds information on hundreds of millions of people in America and abroad.None of the accused hackers is in U.S. custody. But officials nonetheless hope criminal charges can be a deterrent to foreign hackers and a warning to other countries that American law enforcement has the capability to pinpoint individual culprits. Even so, while China and the U.S. committed in 2015 to halt acts of cyber espionage against each other, the Equifax intrusion and others like it make clear that Beijing has continued its operations.A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not return an email seeking comment Monday.The case resembles a 2014 indictment that accused five members of the PLA of hacking into American corporations to steal trade secrets. U.S. authorities also suspect China in the 2015 breach of the federal Office of Personnel Management and of intrusions into the Marriott hotel chain and health insurer Anthem.Such hacks "seem to deliberately cast a wide net" so that Chinese intelligence analysts can get deep insight into the lives of Americans, said Ben Buchanan, a Georgetown University scholar and author of the upcoming book "The Hacker and the State.""This could be especially useful for counterintelligence purposes, like tracking American spies posted to Beijing," Buchanan said.Barr, who at an event last week warned of Beijing's aspirations of economic dominance, said Monday the U.S. has long "witnessed China's voracious appetite for the personal data of Americans.""This kind of attack on American industry is of a piece with other Chinese illegal acquisitions of sensitive personal data," Barr said.The criminal charges, which include conspiracy to commit computer fraud and conspiracy to commit economic espionage, were filed in federal court in Atlanta.Equifax last year reached a $700 million settlement over the data breach, with the bulk of the funds intended for consumers affected by it.Equifax officials told the Government Accountability Office the company made many mistakes, including having an outdated list of computer systems administrators. The company didn't notice the intruders targeting its databases for more than six weeks. Hackers exploited a known security vulnerability that Equifax hadn't fixed.While company stock has recovered, Equifax's reputation has not fully. The company was dragged in front of Congress no less than four times to explain what happened.The company is about to start paying out claims on its $700 million settlement, of which more claimants have opted in to getting a cash settlement than accept credit counseling. So many claims have been made for the cash that the lawyers suing Equifax and the Federal Trade Commission have warned claimants that the chance of getting the full cash value of the settlement was unlikely.______Associated Press writers Nick Jesdanun and Ken Sweet in New York and Frank Bajak in Boston contributed to this report.Load-Date: February 11, 2020End of Document

The Group has strong capacity to generate cash flow and, in a 60 $/b environment, expects to increase it by approximately 1 B$ per year starting from 2019. The Group will continue to implement its strategy for profitable growth on the integrated gas and low-carbon electricity chains. LNG sales will benefit notably in 2020 from the start-ups of Yamal LNG train 4 as well as Cameron LNG train 3 and be more than 30 Mt/y.Spending discipline is maintained and the Group continues its cost reduction program with an objective of more than 5 B$ in cumulative savings in 2020. Net investments in 2020 should be on the order of 18 B$, and the Group will complete its 5 B$ asset sale program over the years 2019-20 (~3 B$ already announced). Organic production growth should be more than 2% in 2020, thanks to ramp-ups of projects started in 2019 and expected start-ups in 2020, notably Iara 2 in Brazil. Since the start of the fourth quarter, global refining margins are weak as a result of high product inventories and oil prices supported by OPEC. The Downstream will continue to rely on its diversified portfolio, notably its integrated platforms in Refining & Chemicals as well as its non-cyclical businesses. Taking into account the strong visibility on cash flow, the Group will continue to increase the dividend with a guidance of 5-6% per year. It will also continue to buy back shares, with an amount expected for 2020 of 2.0 B$ in a 60 $/b environment.Additionally, Total has divested its 27.5% interest in Fosmax LNG, operator of the Fos Cavaou liquefied natural gas terminal, as a result of a competitive sale process to Elengy, Fosmax LNG's shareholder with a 72.5% stake, that exercised its preemption right.

This sale of non-strategic midstream infrastructure asset will contribute to Total's objective of divesting five billion dollars in 2019-2020.05:26WIRES On The WiresCGG (CGG) and Fairfield Geotechnologies have signed a second cooperation agreement to acquire a series of large-scale, high-density, multi-client surveys in the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin located in West Texas.

Orders from the microelectronics market were well above a book-to-bill of one. We received new ELA system orders, and service revenues reflected increases in consumer purchases of OLED-equipped handsets. The wafer fab equipment market has accelerated over the past three months after two major chip manufacturers announced higher capex budgets for 2020, which contributed to better than expected bookings during fiscal Q1. The advanced packaging market is also trending up due to 5G investments in China," said John Ambroseo, Coherent's President and Chief Executive Officer. "The materials processing (MP) market took another step forward with a book-to-bill of one in a seasonally-adjusted quarter. Concerns about weak PMIs in the Eurozone are partially offset by strength in North America and a domestic-led recovery in China. Competition remains tough in the MP market, especially in China where domestic suppliers are gaining share through a combination of improved performance and reliability coupled with aggressive pricing," he added.16:20RYN Rayonier beats by $0.02, misses on revs (30.56 +0.70)Reports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.12 per share, $0.02 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.10; revenues rose 7.6% year/year to $178.8 mln vs the $193.18 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

In our Pacific Northwest Timber segment, we expect to achieve harvest volumes of 1.4 to 1.5 million tons, while we expect relatively stable pricing as markets have adjusted to lower log export volumes resulting from China tariffs and competition from European salvage volume. We remain cautiously optimistic that export market conditions in both Southern Timber and Pacific Northwest Timber will gradually improve as the U.S.-China Phase 1 trade agreement is implemented and as additional details of the agreement become clear, although we expect near-term headwinds associated with the coronavirus outbreak in China."16:19QNST QuinStreet reports EPS in-line, beats on revs (12.59 )Reports Q2 (Dec) earnings of $0.12 per share, excluding non-recurring items, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.12; revenues rose 13.4% year/year to $118.1 mln vs the $114.31 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus."We delivered record fiscal second quarter revenue.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.7%) and Russell 2000 (+1.5%) outperformed the benchmark index. The Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) underperformed in a rare outing, although it still closed at a new high.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors contributed to the advance, especially the energy sector (+3.8%) after weeks of underperformance and a nice rebound in oil prices ($50.85, +1.24, +2.5%). The real estate sector (-0.1%) was the lone holdout today.The bullish price action was driven mostly by optimism, particularly tied to the prevailing view that the economy is fine and any negative impact resulting from the coronavirus will be minimal. Aiding this sentiment were reports that progress is being made in developing a vaccine and economic data depicting a healthy labor market and services sector.Specifically, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January increased to 55.5% (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) from 54.9% in December. The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000).That's not to say that the coronavirus is behind the market, though. For instance, Walt Disney (DIS 141.37, -3.36, -2.3%), Nike (NKE 100.54, -0.84, -0.8%), and Capri Holdings (CPRI 33.31, +2.55, +8.3%) formally stated that the coronavirus will have a negative impact on financial results. The market is simply viewing the situation through a positive lens.In earnings news, Merck (MRK 85.83, -2.53, -2.9%) fell despite beating profit estimates. Ford Motor (F 8.31, -0.87, -9.5%) and General Motors (GM 35.03, +0.66, +1.9%) trended in opposite directions following their resultsOther story stocks included Tesla (TSLA 734.70, -152.36, -17.2%), which pulled back from its parabolic rise, and Biogen (BIIB 332.87, +49.58, +17.5%), which was awarded a favorable patent decision for a multiple sclerosis drug.U.S. Treasuries succumbed to selling interest for the second straight session. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.45%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.65%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.28.Reviewing Wednesday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January registered a 55.5% reading (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) versus a downwardly revised 54.9% (from 55.0%) in December. The January reading eclipsed the December reading as the fastest pace of expansion since August 2019.The key takeaway from the report is that it marked the second straight month of accelerating activity in the services sector, which is an encouraging sign that the U.S. economic expansion is poised to continue.The Trade Balance report for December showed a widening in the deficit to $48.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$48.2 billion) from a downwardly revised -$43.7 billion (from -$43.1 billion). Exports were $1.6 billion more than November exports while imports were $6.8 billion more than November imports.The key takeaway from the report is that the goods deficit with China decreased by $73.9 billion in 2019 to $345.6 billion, as tariff measures contributed to a $13.5 billion decrease in exports and an $87.4 billion decrease in imports.The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), with healthy gains across small, midsized, and large employers. In turn, there was a nice pickup in jobs added on the goods-producing side of the economy (+54,000).The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index rose 5.0% following a 7.2% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report and preliminary Q4 readings for Productivity and Unit Labor Costs on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +6.0% YTDS&P 500 +3.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +2.6% YTDRussell 2000 +0.8% YTD16:16GRUB GrubHub misses by $0.02, beats on revs; guides Q1 revs in-line, but Q1 EBITDA guidance is light; guides FY20 revs in-line (55.46 -0.53)Reports Q4 (Dec) loss of $(0.05) per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.03); revenues rose 18.6% year/year to $341.27 mln vs the $324.68 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Q4 adjusted EBITDA fell 37% yr/yr to $26.7 mln vs prior guidance of $15-25 mln and consensus of $20.8 mln.Co issues in-line guidance for Q1, sees Q1 revs of $350-370 mln vs. $365.85 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

In just three sessions, the major indices were up between 3.4% and 4.2%.In a manner of speaking, the market looks to be catching its breath and is consolidating some of its outsized, and relatively easy, gains this week as investor conviction has been reserved for individual stocks, like Twitter (TWTR 38.81, +5.42, +16.3%), Cardinal Health (CAH 58.83, +6.15, +11.7%), Becton Dickinson (BDX 254.00, -31.99, -12.0%), and Kellogg (K 64.52, -4.84, -7.0%), all of which have stirred investor sentiment with their latest earnings reports.From a sector standpoint, there isn't much that is standing out, other than the communication services sector (+1.0%), which is benefiting from a rebound in shares of Alphabet (GOOG 1473.46, +25.23, +1.7%), which had slipped as much as 3.7% following the company's earnings report after the close on Monday.The stock market's tired disposition has also been reflected in the lackluster follow through off the open. The S&P 500 had been up 0.4%, supported by the sight of large gains in Asian markets, an encouraging weekly initial claims report, and the announcement from China that it is cutting the tariff rate on about $75 billion worth of imported U.S. goods by 50%, effective February 14.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.4%; the S&P 500 is up 0.2%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%; and the Russell 2000 is down 0.2%.10:30COMDX Natural gas inventory showed a draw of 137 bcf vs a 201 bcf draw last weekWorking gas in storage was 2,609 Bcf as of Friday, January 31, 2020, according to EIA estimates. This represents a net decrease of 137 Bcf from the previous week. Stocks were 615 Bcf higher than last year at this time and 199 Bcf above the five-year average of 2,410 Bcf. At 2,609 Bcf, total working gas is within the five-year historical range.10:12SMH Industry Briefing: Chipmakers (146.25 -0.57)The PHLX Semiconductor Index (-0.5%) underperforms in the early going of today's session, narrowing this week's gain to 6.2% and its quarter-to-date advance to 2.8%. For comparison, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (+0.4%) is up 4.3% for the week and up 6.4% since the end of 2019.Today's underperformance is largely due to relative weakness in the shares of Qualcomm (QCOM 87.70, -3.21, -3.5%) even though the company reported better than expected Q1 results and issued in-line guidance. The stock is the weakest performer in the group while only three other components show losses of 1.0% or more.Notable movers:Qualcomm (QCOM 87.70, -3.21, -3.5%): weakest performer in the group, falling below its 50-day moving average (87.90) despite beating quarterly expectations. Cowen raised its price target for the stock to $105 from $100. Silicon Labs (SLAB 106.21, -1.34, -1.3%): returning below its 200-day moving average (107.32).

Monolithic Power (MPWR 186.78, -0.21, -0.1%): little changed after reporting slightly better than expected Q4 results, issuing better than expected guidance, and boosting its dividend. Cowen raised its price target for the stock to $215 from $200. Cabot Micro (CCMP 165.20, +8.49, +5.4%): leading performer, trading at a fresh record after beating Q1 expectations and issuing better than expected Q2 revenue guidance.10:05OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:MRO Feb 12 calls are seeing interest with 1950 contracts trading vs. open int of 220, pushing implied vol up around 13 points to ~58%.

Beijing said the decision will help fulfill its pledges in the Phase One trade deal, and it's helping bolster the market's faith that the future will be all right despite the coronavirus.In the U.S., Twitter (TWTR 36.25, +2.86, +8.6%) shareholders have been pleased, or relieved, to see the company reporting solid revenue results and monetizable daily active users.

The Group has strong capacity to generate cash flow and, in a 60 $/b environment, expects to increase it by approximately 1 B$ per year starting from 2019. The Group will continue to implement its strategy for profitable growth on the integrated gas and low-carbon electricity chains. LNG sales will benefit notably in 2020 from the start-ups of Yamal LNG train 4 as well as Cameron LNG train 3 and be more than 30 Mt/y.Spending discipline is maintained and the Group continues its cost reduction program with an objective of more than 5 B$ in cumulative savings in 2020. Net investments in 2020 should be on the order of 18 B$, and the Group will complete its 5 B$ asset sale program over the years 2019-20 (~3 B$ already announced). Organic production growth should be more than 2% in 2020, thanks to ramp-ups of projects started in 2019 and expected start-ups in 2020, notably Iara 2 in Brazil. Since the start of the fourth quarter, global refining margins are weak as a result of high product inventories and oil prices supported by OPEC. The Downstream will continue to rely on its diversified portfolio, notably its integrated platforms in Refining & Chemicals as well as its non-cyclical businesses. Taking into account the strong visibility on cash flow, the Group will continue to increase the dividend with a guidance of 5-6% per year. It will also continue to buy back shares, with an amount expected for 2020 of 2.0 B$ in a 60 $/b environment.Additionally, Total has divested its 27.5% interest in Fosmax LNG, operator of the Fos Cavaou liquefied natural gas terminal, as a result of a competitive sale process to Elengy, Fosmax LNG's shareholder with a 72.5% stake, that exercised its preemption right.

This sale of non-strategic midstream infrastructure asset will contribute to Total's objective of divesting five billion dollars in 2019-2020.05:26WIRES On The WiresCGG (CGG) and Fairfield Geotechnologies have signed a second cooperation agreement to acquire a series of large-scale, high-density, multi-client surveys in the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin located in West Texas.

Orders from the microelectronics market were well above a book-to-bill of one. We received new ELA system orders, and service revenues reflected increases in consumer purchases of OLED-equipped handsets. The wafer fab equipment market has accelerated over the past three months after two major chip manufacturers announced higher capex budgets for 2020, which contributed to better than expected bookings during fiscal Q1. The advanced packaging market is also trending up due to 5G investments in China," said John Ambroseo, Coherent's President and Chief Executive Officer. "The materials processing (MP) market took another step forward with a book-to-bill of one in a seasonally-adjusted quarter. Concerns about weak PMIs in the Eurozone are partially offset by strength in North America and a domestic-led recovery in China. Competition remains tough in the MP market, especially in China where domestic suppliers are gaining share through a combination of improved performance and reliability coupled with aggressive pricing," he added.16:20RYN Rayonier beats by $0.02, misses on revs (30.56 +0.70)Reports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.12 per share, $0.02 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.10; revenues rose 7.6% year/year to $178.8 mln vs the $193.18 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

In our Pacific Northwest Timber segment, we expect to achieve harvest volumes of 1.4 to 1.5 million tons, while we expect relatively stable pricing as markets have adjusted to lower log export volumes resulting from China tariffs and competition from European salvage volume. We remain cautiously optimistic that export market conditions in both Southern Timber and Pacific Northwest Timber will gradually improve as the U.S.-China Phase 1 trade agreement is implemented and as additional details of the agreement become clear, although we expect near-term headwinds associated with the coronavirus outbreak in China."16:19QNST QuinStreet reports EPS in-line, beats on revs (12.59 )Reports Q2 (Dec) earnings of $0.12 per share, excluding non-recurring items, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.12; revenues rose 13.4% year/year to $118.1 mln vs the $114.31 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus."We delivered record fiscal second quarter revenue.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.7%) and Russell 2000 (+1.5%) outperformed the benchmark index. The Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) underperformed in a rare outing, although it still closed at a new high.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors contributed to the advance, especially the energy sector (+3.8%) after weeks of underperformance and a nice rebound in oil prices ($50.85, +1.24, +2.5%). The real estate sector (-0.1%) was the lone holdout today.The bullish price action was driven mostly by optimism, particularly tied to the prevailing view that the economy is fine and any negative impact resulting from the coronavirus will be minimal. Aiding this sentiment were reports that progress is being made in developing a vaccine and economic data depicting a healthy labor market and services sector.Specifically, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January increased to 55.5% (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) from 54.9% in December. The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000).That's not to say that the coronavirus is behind the market, though. For instance, Walt Disney (DIS 141.37, -3.36, -2.3%), Nike (NKE 100.54, -0.84, -0.8%), and Capri Holdings (CPRI 33.31, +2.55, +8.3%) formally stated that the coronavirus will have a negative impact on financial results. The market is simply viewing the situation through a positive lens.In earnings news, Merck (MRK 85.83, -2.53, -2.9%) fell despite beating profit estimates. Ford Motor (F 8.31, -0.87, -9.5%) and General Motors (GM 35.03, +0.66, +1.9%) trended in opposite directions following their resultsOther story stocks included Tesla (TSLA 734.70, -152.36, -17.2%), which pulled back from its parabolic rise, and Biogen (BIIB 332.87, +49.58, +17.5%), which was awarded a favorable patent decision for a multiple sclerosis drug.U.S. Treasuries succumbed to selling interest for the second straight session. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.45%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.65%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.28.Reviewing Wednesday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January registered a 55.5% reading (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) versus a downwardly revised 54.9% (from 55.0%) in December. The January reading eclipsed the December reading as the fastest pace of expansion since August 2019.The key takeaway from the report is that it marked the second straight month of accelerating activity in the services sector, which is an encouraging sign that the U.S. economic expansion is poised to continue.The Trade Balance report for December showed a widening in the deficit to $48.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$48.2 billion) from a downwardly revised -$43.7 billion (from -$43.1 billion). Exports were $1.6 billion more than November exports while imports were $6.8 billion more than November imports.The key takeaway from the report is that the goods deficit with China decreased by $73.9 billion in 2019 to $345.6 billion, as tariff measures contributed to a $13.5 billion decrease in exports and an $87.4 billion decrease in imports.The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), with healthy gains across small, midsized, and large employers. In turn, there was a nice pickup in jobs added on the goods-producing side of the economy (+54,000).The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index rose 5.0% following a 7.2% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report and preliminary Q4 readings for Productivity and Unit Labor Costs on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +6.0% YTDS&P 500 +3.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +2.6% YTDRussell 2000 +0.8% YTD16:16GRUB GrubHub misses by $0.02, beats on revs; guides Q1 revs in-line, but Q1 EBITDA guidance is light; guides FY20 revs in-line (55.46 -0.53)Reports Q4 (Dec) loss of $(0.05) per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.03); revenues rose 18.6% year/year to $341.27 mln vs the $324.68 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Q4 adjusted EBITDA fell 37% yr/yr to $26.7 mln vs prior guidance of $15-25 mln and consensus of $20.8 mln.Co issues in-line guidance for Q1, sees Q1 revs of $350-370 mln vs. $365.85 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

In just three sessions, the major indices were up between 3.4% and 4.2%.In a manner of speaking, the market looks to be catching its breath and is consolidating some of its outsized, and relatively easy, gains this week as investor conviction has been reserved for individual stocks, like Twitter (TWTR 38.81, +5.42, +16.3%), Cardinal Health (CAH 58.83, +6.15, +11.7%), Becton Dickinson (BDX 254.00, -31.99, -12.0%), and Kellogg (K 64.52, -4.84, -7.0%), all of which have stirred investor sentiment with their latest earnings reports.From a sector standpoint, there isn't much that is standing out, other than the communication services sector (+1.0%), which is benefiting from a rebound in shares of Alphabet (GOOG 1473.46, +25.23, +1.7%), which had slipped as much as 3.7% following the company's earnings report after the close on Monday.The stock market's tired disposition has also been reflected in the lackluster follow through off the open. The S&P 500 had been up 0.4%, supported by the sight of large gains in Asian markets, an encouraging weekly initial claims report, and the announcement from China that it is cutting the tariff rate on about $75 billion worth of imported U.S. goods by 50%, effective February 14.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.4%; the S&P 500 is up 0.2%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%; and the Russell 2000 is down 0.2%.10:30COMDX Natural gas inventory showed a draw of 137 bcf vs a 201 bcf draw last weekWorking gas in storage was 2,609 Bcf as of Friday, January 31, 2020, according to EIA estimates.

For comparison, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (+0.4%) is up 4.3% for the week and up 6.4% since the end of 2019.Today's underperformance is largely due to relative weakness in the shares of Qualcomm (QCOM 87.70, -3.21, -3.5%) even though the company reported better than expected Q1 results and issued in-line guidance. The stock is the weakest performer in the group while only three other components show losses of 1.0% or more.Notable movers:Qualcomm (QCOM 87.70, -3.21, -3.5%): weakest performer in the group, falling below its 50-day moving average (87.90) despite beating quarterly expectations.

Monolithic Power (MPWR 186.78, -0.21, -0.1%): little changed after reporting slightly better than expected Q4 results, issuing better than expected guidance, and boosting its dividend.

Cabot Micro (CCMP 165.20, +8.49, +5.4%): leading performer, trading at a fresh record after beating Q1 expectations and issuing better than expected Q2 revenue guidance.10:05OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:MRO Feb 12 calls are seeing interest with 1950 contracts trading vs. open int of 220, pushing implied vol up around 13 points to ~58%.

The first quarter is generally our weakest quarter of the year as we experience lower revenue per tractor and higher costs than the other quarters due to seasonal freight fluctuations and harsher operating conditions. While we see positive trends in certain areas, there continues to be uncertainty in the short-term environment, which will impact the actual sequential margin deterioration in the first quarter. We continue to believe that market conditions will improve in the back half 2020.

In contract drilling, our rig count averaged 123 rigs in the fourth quarter, down from 142 rigs in the third quarter.

The Group has strong capacity to generate cash flow and, in a 60 $/b environment, expects to increase it by approximately 1 B$ per year starting from 2019. The Group will continue to implement its strategy for profitable growth on the integrated gas and low-carbon electricity chains. LNG sales will benefit notably in 2020 from the start-ups of Yamal LNG train 4 as well as Cameron LNG train 3 and be more than 30 Mt/y.Spending discipline is maintained and the Group continues its cost reduction program with an objective of more than 5 B$ in cumulative savings in 2020. Net investments in 2020 should be on the order of 18 B$, and the Group will complete its 5 B$ asset sale program over the years 2019-20 (~3 B$ already announced). Organic production growth should be more than 2% in 2020, thanks to ramp-ups of projects started in 2019 and expected start-ups in 2020, notably Iara 2 in Brazil. Since the start of the fourth quarter, global refining margins are weak as a result of high product inventories and oil prices supported by OPEC. The Downstream will continue to rely on its diversified portfolio, notably its integrated platforms in Refining & Chemicals as well as its non-cyclical businesses. Taking into account the strong visibility on cash flow, the Group will continue to increase the dividend with a guidance of 5-6% per year. It will also continue to buy back shares, with an amount expected for 2020 of 2.0 B$ in a 60 $/b environment.Additionally, Total has divested its 27.5% interest in Fosmax LNG, operator of the Fos Cavaou liquefied natural gas terminal, as a result of a competitive sale process to Elengy, Fosmax LNG's shareholder with a 72.5% stake, that exercised its preemption right.

The advanced packaging market is also trending up due to 5G investments in China," said John Ambroseo, Coherent's President and Chief Executive Officer. "The materials processing (MP) market took another step forward with a book-to-bill of one in a seasonally-adjusted quarter. Concerns about weak PMIs in the Eurozone are partially offset by strength in North America and a domestic-led recovery in China. Competition remains tough in the MP market, especially in China where domestic suppliers are gaining share through a combination of improved performance and reliability coupled with aggressive pricing," he added.16:20RYN Rayonier beats by $0.02, misses on revs (30.56 +0.70)Reports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.12 per share, $0.02 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.10; revenues rose 7.6% year/year to $178.8 mln vs the $193.18 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

"In our Southern Timber segment, we expect to achieve full-year harvest volumes of 6.3 to 6.5 million tons, while we expect overall pricing to be slightly below 2019 average pricing due to geographic mix. In our Pacific Northwest Timber segment, we expect to achieve harvest volumes of 1.4 to 1.5 million tons, while we expect relatively stable pricing as markets have adjusted to lower log export volumes resulting from China tariffs and competition from European salvage volume. We remain cautiously optimistic that export market conditions in both Southern Timber and Pacific Northwest Timber will gradually improve as the U.S.-China Phase 1 trade agreement is implemented and as additional details of the agreement become clear, although we expect near-term headwinds associated with the coronavirus outbreak in China."16:19QNST QuinStreet reports EPS in-line, beats on revs (12.59 )Reports Q2 (Dec) earnings of $0.12 per share, excluding non-recurring items, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.12; revenues rose 13.4% year/year to $118.1 mln vs the $114.31 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus."We delivered record fiscal second quarter revenue.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.7%) and Russell 2000 (+1.5%) outperformed the benchmark index. The Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) underperformed in a rare outing, although it still closed at a new high.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors contributed to the advance, especially the energy sector (+3.8%) after weeks of underperformance and a nice rebound in oil prices ($50.85, +1.24, +2.5%). The real estate sector (-0.1%) was the lone holdout today.The bullish price action was driven mostly by optimism, particularly tied to the prevailing view that the economy is fine and any negative impact resulting from the coronavirus will be minimal. Aiding this sentiment were reports that progress is being made in developing a vaccine and economic data depicting a healthy labor market and services sector.Specifically, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January increased to 55.5% (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) from 54.9% in December. The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000).That's not to say that the coronavirus is behind the market, though. For instance, Walt Disney (DIS 141.37, -3.36, -2.3%), Nike (NKE 100.54, -0.84, -0.8%), and Capri Holdings (CPRI 33.31, +2.55, +8.3%) formally stated that the coronavirus will have a negative impact on financial results. The market is simply viewing the situation through a positive lens.In earnings news, Merck (MRK 85.83, -2.53, -2.9%) fell despite beating profit estimates. Ford Motor (F 8.31, -0.87, -9.5%) and General Motors (GM 35.03, +0.66, +1.9%) trended in opposite directions following their resultsOther story stocks included Tesla (TSLA 734.70, -152.36, -17.2%), which pulled back from its parabolic rise, and Biogen (BIIB 332.87, +49.58, +17.5%), which was awarded a favorable patent decision for a multiple sclerosis drug.U.S. Treasuries succumbed to selling interest for the second straight session. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.45%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.65%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.28.Reviewing Wednesday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January registered a 55.5% reading (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) versus a downwardly revised 54.9% (from 55.0%) in December. The January reading eclipsed the December reading as the fastest pace of expansion since August 2019.The key takeaway from the report is that it marked the second straight month of accelerating activity in the services sector, which is an encouraging sign that the U.S. economic expansion is poised to continue.The Trade Balance report for December showed a widening in the deficit to $48.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$48.2 billion) from a downwardly revised -$43.7 billion (from -$43.1 billion). Exports were $1.6 billion more than November exports while imports were $6.8 billion more than November imports.The key takeaway from the report is that the goods deficit with China decreased by $73.9 billion in 2019 to $345.6 billion, as tariff measures contributed to a $13.5 billion decrease in exports and an $87.4 billion decrease in imports.The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), with healthy gains across small, midsized, and large employers. In turn, there was a nice pickup in jobs added on the goods-producing side of the economy (+54,000).The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index rose 5.0% following a 7.2% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report and preliminary Q4 readings for Productivity and Unit Labor Costs on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +6.0% YTDS&P 500 +3.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +2.6% YTDRussell 2000 +0.8% YTD16:16GRUB GrubHub misses by $0.02, beats on revs; guides Q1 revs in-line, but Q1 EBITDA guidance is light; guides FY20 revs in-line (55.46 -0.53)Reports Q4 (Dec) loss of $(0.05) per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.03); revenues rose 18.6% year/year to $341.27 mln vs the $324.68 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Q4 adjusted EBITDA fell 37% yr/yr to $26.7 mln vs prior guidance of $15-25 mln and consensus of $20.8 mln.Co issues in-line guidance for Q1, sees Q1 revs of $350-370 mln vs. $365.85 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Once issued, the draft order is expected to detail the FCC's approach to clearing C-band spectrum to enable rapid and nationwide 5G network deployment in the U.S. Intelsat CEO Steve Spengler said, "The issuance of the draft order represents a significant milestone in a process that we began in 2017. We look forward to reviewing the draft order, once issued, to place Chairman Pai's comments in full context. We note with appreciation the hard work of all stakeholders to get to this juncture, and the work to come leading up to the Commission's vote on February 28, 2020." During his remarks, Chairman Pai indicated that satellite operators need to be incentivized to undertake the complex task of clearing their licensed spectrum while protecting the television and radio content distribution ecosystem using C-band today. Specifically. the Chairman indicated a total of $9.7 bln of incentive payments for certain satellite operators to clear the spectrum on an accelerated basis, plus the reimbursement of the costs for clearing. In November 2019, the FCC announced its intention to pursue a public auction of C-Band spectrum, which was a significant departure from the market-based construct advocated by the satellite industry. Despite that departure, Intelsat has never wavered in its attempts to bring this critical spectrum to market. Intelsat has invested $36 bln to build its C-Band business over the last 40 years. Beginning in September 2017, Intelsat advocated for an innovative structure to clear significant additional spectrum for 5G mobile services, while continuing to deliver on commitments to customers who use Intelsat's C-band to reach U.S. households. Since that time, it has become increasingly clear that this initiative has the potential both to significantly improve national security and to enable the accelerated deployment of 5G.Intelsat firmly supports Chairman Pai, the FCC, and the Administration in shared goals of improving U.S. national security, stimulating hundreds of billions of dollars in additional U.S. economic growth, and creating millions of new jobs for U.S. workers. Intelsat will review and analyze the draft order to determine its potential impact on Intelsat's business and stakeholders.In a statement, the C-Band Alliance said, "The imminent issuance of the draft order reflects the tireless efforts of many over the past several years to ensure that this critical spectrum comes to market safely, quickly, and efficiently. Today's comments by Chairman Pai are a significant development in this important proceeding. We look forward to reviewing the draft order, once issued, to place Chairman Pai's comments in full context."Related tickers: IRDM, ORBC, SATS, VSAT, IMASY, SGBAF13:49COMDX Metals Settlement PricesFeb gold settled today's session up $6.80 (0.44%) at $1564.4/oz Mar silver settled today's session $0.21 higher (1.19%) at $17.825/oz Mar copper settled $0.01 higher (0.41%) at $2.5935/lb13:21OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:EXEL Feb 19 calls (volume: 2030, open int: 250, implied vol: ~68%, prev day implied vol: 61%).

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite outperforms with a 0.7% gain.Positive sentiment has been aided by 1) China saying it will cut tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. imports by half on Feb. 14 and 2) weekly jobless claims dropping to a nine-month low to 202,000 (Briefing.com consensus 218,000).

In just three sessions, the major indices were up between 3.4% and 4.2%.In a manner of speaking, the market looks to be catching its breath and is consolidating some of its outsized, and relatively easy, gains this week as investor conviction has been reserved for individual stocks, like Twitter (TWTR 38.81, +5.42, +16.3%), Cardinal Health (CAH 58.83, +6.15, +11.7%), Becton Dickinson (BDX 254.00, -31.99, -12.0%), and Kellogg (K 64.52, -4.84, -7.0%), all of which have stirred investor sentiment with their latest earnings reports.From a sector standpoint, there isn't much that is standing out, other than the communication services sector (+1.0%), which is benefiting from a rebound in shares of Alphabet (GOOG 1473.46, +25.23, +1.7%), which had slipped as much as 3.7% following the company's earnings report after the close on Monday.The stock market's tired disposition has also been reflected in the lackluster follow through off the open.

There was a statistically significant reduction in inflammatory lesions versus vehicle as early as Week 4 of treatment, and all subsequently assessed timepoints throughout the entire treatment course of the study. Subjects were no more likely to experience treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) from FMX103 than from vehicle treatment. The majority of TEAEs were mild to moderate. More than 95% of subjects using FMX103 had skin tolerability scores of none or mild at the treatment application site at Week 12. Specifically for erythema as part of skin tolerability assessments, 5.5% and 6.6% of subjects who received FMX103 in Studies 11 and 12 respectively, were assessed as being clear or almost clear at Baseline. At Week 12, 40.9% and 48.3% of subjects who received FMX103 respectively were assessed as clear or almost clear of erythema.08:02BONDX Overnight Treasury Market SummaryInching HigherU.S. Treasuries are on track to begin the day just above yesterday's closing levels.

The first quarter is generally our weakest quarter of the year as we experience lower revenue per tractor and higher costs than the other quarters due to seasonal freight fluctuations and harsher operating conditions. While we see positive trends in certain areas, there continues to be uncertainty in the short-term environment, which will impact the actual sequential margin deterioration in the first quarter. We continue to believe that market conditions will improve in the back half 2020. The timing and magnitude of market changes will have a significant impact on our quarterly results given our substantial operating leverage.06:14PPD PPD prices 60.0 mln share IPO at $27, the high end of the $24-$27 expected price range06:14EQNR Equinor reports Q4 results; increases dividend (18.61 )Q4 adj earnings were USD 3.55 bln, down from USD 4.39 bln in the same period in 2018 (after tax were USD 1.19 billion, down from USD 1.54 billion in the same period last year) Lower prices for both liquids and gas impacted the earnings for the quarter.

In contract drilling, our rig count averaged 123 rigs in the fourth quarter, down from 142 rigs in the third quarter.

The Group has strong capacity to generate cash flow and, in a 60 $/b environment, expects to increase it by approximately 1 B$ per year starting from 2019. The Group will continue to implement its strategy for profitable growth on the integrated gas and low-carbon electricity chains. LNG sales will benefit notably in 2020 from the start-ups of Yamal LNG train 4 as well as Cameron LNG train 3 and be more than 30 Mt/y.Spending discipline is maintained and the Group continues its cost reduction program with an objective of more than 5 B$ in cumulative savings in 2020. Net investments in 2020 should be on the order of 18 B$, and the Group will complete its 5 B$ asset sale program over the years 2019-20 (~3 B$ already announced). Organic production growth should be more than 2% in 2020, thanks to ramp-ups of projects started in 2019 and expected start-ups in 2020, notably Iara 2 in Brazil. Since the start of the fourth quarter, global refining margins are weak as a result of high product inventories and oil prices supported by OPEC. The Downstream will continue to rely on its diversified portfolio, notably its integrated platforms in Refining & Chemicals as well as its non-cyclical businesses. Taking into account the strong visibility on cash flow, the Group will continue to increase the dividend with a guidance of 5-6% per year. It will also continue to buy back shares, with an amount expected for 2020 of 2.0 B$ in a 60 $/b environment.Additionally, Total has divested its 27.5% interest in Fosmax LNG, operator of the Fos Cavaou liquefied natural gas terminal, as a result of a competitive sale process to Elengy, Fosmax LNG's shareholder with a 72.5% stake, that exercised its preemption right.

For restaurants that remain open, same-store sales since the Chinese New Year holiday period were down 40-50% compared to the comparable Chinese New Year holiday period in 2019, due to shortened operating hours, reduced traffic and other factors related to the outbreak. At this time, the co cannot forecast when the closed restaurants will re-open (and at what rate) and the traffic will be restored (and at what level), or the other factors relating to the outbreak that will continue to impact operations. Furthermore, the co may be required or otherwise decide to close additional stores, reduce operating hours, or take other steps, as the situation warrants.

Orders from the microelectronics market were well above a book-to-bill of one. We received new ELA system orders, and service revenues reflected increases in consumer purchases of OLED-equipped handsets. The wafer fab equipment market has accelerated over the past three months after two major chip manufacturers announced higher capex budgets for 2020, which contributed to better than expected bookings during fiscal Q1. The advanced packaging market is also trending up due to 5G investments in China," said John Ambroseo, Coherent's President and Chief Executive Officer. "The materials processing (MP) market took another step forward with a book-to-bill of one in a seasonally-adjusted quarter. Concerns about weak PMIs in the Eurozone are partially offset by strength in North America and a domestic-led recovery in China.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.7%) and Russell 2000 (+1.5%) outperformed the benchmark index. The Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) underperformed in a rare outing, although it still closed at a new high.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors contributed to the advance, especially the energy sector (+3.8%) after weeks of underperformance and a nice rebound in oil prices ($50.85, +1.24, +2.5%). The real estate sector (-0.1%) was the lone holdout today.The bullish price action was driven mostly by optimism, particularly tied to the prevailing view that the economy is fine and any negative impact resulting from the coronavirus will be minimal. Aiding this sentiment were reports that progress is being made in developing a vaccine and economic data depicting a healthy labor market and services sector.Specifically, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January increased to 55.5% (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) from 54.9% in December. The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000).That's not to say that the coronavirus is behind the market, though. For instance, Walt Disney (DIS 141.37, -3.36, -2.3%), Nike (NKE 100.54, -0.84, -0.8%), and Capri Holdings (CPRI 33.31, +2.55, +8.3%) formally stated that the coronavirus will have a negative impact on financial results. The market is simply viewing the situation through a positive lens.In earnings news, Merck (MRK 85.83, -2.53, -2.9%) fell despite beating profit estimates. Ford Motor (F 8.31, -0.87, -9.5%) and General Motors (GM 35.03, +0.66, +1.9%) trended in opposite directions following their resultsOther story stocks included Tesla (TSLA 734.70, -152.36, -17.2%), which pulled back from its parabolic rise, and Biogen (BIIB 332.87, +49.58, +17.5%), which was awarded a favorable patent decision for a multiple sclerosis drug.U.S. Treasuries succumbed to selling interest for the second straight session.

The January reading eclipsed the December reading as the fastest pace of expansion since August 2019.The key takeaway from the report is that it marked the second straight month of accelerating activity in the services sector, which is an encouraging sign that the U.S. economic expansion is poised to continue.The Trade Balance report for December showed a widening in the deficit to $48.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$48.2 billion) from a downwardly revised -$43.7 billion (from -$43.1 billion). Exports were $1.6 billion more than November exports while imports were $6.8 billion more than November imports.The key takeaway from the report is that the goods deficit with China decreased by $73.9 billion in 2019 to $345.6 billion, as tariff measures contributed to a $13.5 billion decrease in exports and an $87.4 billion decrease in imports.The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), with healthy gains across small, midsized, and large employers.

PEN America: China's Detention of Muslim Poet is Attempt to Silence OppositionTargeted News ServiceFebruary 6, 2020 Thursday 8:18 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 584 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyPEN America issued the following news release on Feb. 5:* * *- PEN America decries arrest of An Ran, detained for his outspoken defense of minority rights* * *The detention of Muslim poet Cui Haoxin, also known by his pen name An Ran, is clear retaliation for his outspoken defense of Chinese Muslims, PEN America said. On January 24, Chinese authorities detained poet and author An Ran in the city of Jinan, the capital of Shandong province, under accusations of "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble." Such a charge is often employed by Chinese police as a catch-all provision against critics of government policy.Days prior to his detention, An Ran tweeted his reaction to a story of a Hui Muslim woman who was detained by authorities in China and sent to an internment camp. An Ran retweeted the story and discussed personal experiences with Chinese authorities, mentioning his past detentions and the experience of others who have been surveilled and detained. The poet is a vocal supporter of minority rights. He has used his social media presence and his writing to raise awareness on stories of human rights abuses, including the dire human rights situation for Muslims in the Xinjiang region."While we don't know what precisely triggered An Ran's detention this time, it is patently obvious that he is being targeted yet again for his courage in acting as a voice of conscience against the government's treatment of Muslim minorities, particularly the forced internment of millions of Uyghurs, Hui, and other ethnic groups," said James Tager, deputy director of Free Expression Research and Policy at PEN America. "The Chinese government must truly fear the power of free speech to engage in such repeated targeting of An Ran for his writing and his social media commentary. We call on Chinese authorities to immediately release An Ran and drop all charges leveled against him."Chinese authorities have repeatedly arrested and harassed An Ran in the last two years. In April 2018, while en route to a weeklong "re-education" course, An Ran was singled out for a search and questioned, detained, and then released. Four months later, police intimidated An Ran by conducting an illegal raid on his home, and attempted to censor his use of social media. In November 2018, authorities yet again questioned and detained An Ran for writing about religious repression in China on social media.The Chinese government continues to deepen their crackdown against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities, including Hui people. While authorities claim they are acting to combat Muslim extremism, numerous observers--including PEN America--have reported that the government's policies are instead aimed at suppressing the cultural identity of Uyghurs and other minorities. PEN America has analyzed the digital rights situation in Xinjiang in its March 2018 report Forbidden Feeds, and has called the current situation in Xinjiang "one of the greatest human rights catastrophes occurring today, with massive implications for the right to free expression."* * *PEN America stands at the intersection of literature and human rights to protect open expression in the United States and worldwide.

Rights group says China is trying to silence critics abroadDaily Collegian: Pennsylvania State UniversityJanuary 14, 2020 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1049 wordsByline: EDITHBodyThe head of Human Rights Watch said Tuesday the Chinese government has not only constructed "an Orwellian high-tech surveillance state" at home but is using its growing economic clout to silence critics abroad.Kenneth Roth accused China of carrying out "the most intense attack on the global system for enforcing human rights since that system began to emerge in the mid-20th century."He warned that if human rights aren't defended, the world could face "a dystopian future in which no one is beyond the reach of Chinese censors" and a global rights system so weakened that it can no longer serve "as a check on government repression."Roth held a news conference at the United Nations Correspondents Association in New York after being denied entry to Hong Kong, where he had been scheduled to release the rights group's annual report. It begins with his keynote essay entitled, "China's Global Threat to Human Rights."Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Monday: "It is China's sovereignty to allow one's entry or not."He indicated that Human Rights Watch is among organizations that support and instigate "anti-China activists ... to engage in radical violent crimes, and incite separatist activities hyping Hong Kong independence." He added: "These organizations deserve sanctions and must pay a price."U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric, asked Tuesday about Roth's denial of entry to Hong Kong, said: "In principle, we support the rights and work of human rights defenders around the world."China's U.N. Mission did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report.In the essay, Roth said the Chinese Communist Party is "worried that permitting political freedom would jeopardize its grasp on power" and "is running scared of its own people.""The consequence under President Xi Jinping is China's most pervasive and brutal oppression in decades," he said.Roth pointed to the closure of the "modest opening" that existed briefly in recent years for Chinese people to express themselves, civic groups shut down, independent journalism gone, online conversations curtailed, ethnic and religious minorities facing severe persecution, and severe challenges to Hong Kong's limited freedoms under "one country, two systems."To avoid a global backlash against its surveillance, internet censorship and oppression at home, Roth said the government is trying to undermine international institutions designed to protect human rights.It is increasingly targeting critics of rights violations, "whether they represent a foreign government, are part of an overseas company or university, or join real or virtual avenues of public protest."Using its economic clout and influence and sometimes its veto in the U.N. Security Council, Roth said, China has sought to block United Nations measures "to protect some of the world's most persecuted people."He cited China's failure to support Syrian civilians facing indiscriminate airstrikes by Russian and Syrian planes, Myanmar's Rohingya Muslims who faced murder, rape and arson at the hands of Myanmar's army, Yemen's civilians facing bombardment by a Saudi-led coalition, or Venezuelans suffering "economic devastation due to the corrupt mismanagement of Nicolas Maduro."Human rights organizations say up to 1 million ethnic Uighur Muslims in China's western Xinjiang region have been detained in camps where they are subjected to political indoctrination and pressured to give up their religion. The Associated Press reported last year that some are forced to work in factories, and tracked clothing made in one camp to an American sportswear company.Roth stressed that "no other government is simultaneously detaining a million members of an ethnic minority for forced indoctrination and attacking anyone who dares to challenge its repression.""And while other governments commit serious human rights violations, no other government flexes its political muscles with such vigor and determination to undermine the international human rights standards and institutions that could hold it to account," he said.Roth said the report shows that China isn't the only threat to human rights, pointing to serious violations by the warring parties in Syria and Yemen..He also cited "autocratic populists" who come to power by demonizing minorities and retain it by attacking independent journalists, judges and activists who try to provide checks and balances on their rule."Some leaders, such as U.S. President Donald Trump, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, bridle at the same body of international human rights law that China undermines, galvanizing their publics by shadow boxing with the `globalists' who dare suggest that governments everywhere should be bound by the same standards," Roth said.He lamented that some governments that once could be counted on to sometimes defend human rights "have largely abandoned the cause."But even against this backdrop, Roth said, China stands out."The result for the human rights cause is a `perfect storm' - a powerful centralized state, a coterie of like-minded rulers, a void of leadership among countries that might have stood for human rights, and a disappointing collection of democracies willing to sell the rope that is strangling the system of rights that they purport to uphold," he said.Nonetheless, Roth said "much can still be done to defend human rights worldwide from Beijing's frontal attack."He urged governments, companies, universities, international institutions and others to stand with people in China and from China who are struggling to secure their rights.Roth said governments and international financial institutions should offer human rights-respecting alternatives to China's "no strings" loans and development aid. He said government should "deliberately counter China's divide-and-conquer strategy for securing silence about its oppression." And he said universities and companies should promote "codes of conduct" with strong standards for dealing with ChinaSubmit a Letter to the EditorIf you're interested in submitting a Letter to the Editor, click here.Submit• Send Letter to the EditorCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Wright State Alumna Diane He Gets Up-Close Look At China as Part of Prestigious FellowshipTargeted News ServiceJanuary 22, 2020 Wednesday 8:24 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 643 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: KENT, Ohio BodyWright State University issued the following news:Diane He, who graduated from Wright State with a bachelor's degree in organizational leadership, visited China after receiving a Zhi-Xing scholarship and fellowship. (Photos by Erin Pence)It was a rare behind-the-curtain look at modern-day China.Wright State University alumna Diane He spent three weeks last summer in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Hangzhou after being awarded a prestigious 2019 Zhi-Xing scholarship/fellowship.She and other American college students from around the nation visited technology companies, the Chinese ministries of agriculture, housing and foreign affairs, and heard from Chinese government officials and university professors."You don't get to visit all of these major political, business and higher ed institutions of your own accord. You can't just walk in," said He. "It was incredibly eye-opening to see firsthand and witness how all of these places in current modern-day China operate."Launched in 2017, the Zhi-Xing scholarship/fellowship is championed by the U.S. State Department and its Chinese counterpart. Sixty American and Chinese college student leaders are selected for the program each year. (Diane applied for the fellowship online, writing seven essays while on a flight with a temperamental Wi-Fi.)The fellowship combines seminars, lectures and field visits. In addition, to visiting businesses, universities and government offices, the students go to parks, museums and galleries."We went to so many places," she said. "The fellowship brought us to major political centers, major business hubs, major universities to visit and do research."For example, the students visited Ali Baba Group, a multinational conglomerate holding company specializing in e-commerce, retail, internet and technology.During the fellowship in China, Diane He researched and presented on social reform.Diane learned that about 85% of Chinese people under the age of 35 don't use cash, exclusively making purchases via electronic transfers online."We went to the Ali Baba headquarters to learn how they do encryption for monetary transfers," she said.Some students visited the Winter Olympics 2022 Committee to see how China plans to use the Olympics facilities after the games are over.The students explored and researched three topics -- China's tech creation, sustainable development and social reform, which He focused on. They presented the findings of their research at the end of the fellowship, which lasted from late July to mid-August.Diane said she was struck by China's "exponential" growth since she was there six years ago.Diane grew up in the Queens borough of New York City, moving to the Dayton area when she was 8. Her mother was a STEM substitute teacher who went on to teach Mandarin Chinese the final 10 years of her career.After graduating from Miamisburg High School in 2010, Diane enrolled at Wright State briefly but left to spend seven months intensively learning and training in Shaolin Kung Fu, which combines Buddhist philosophy and martial arts.She then returned to Wright State for a year but left again to study under the Confucius Institute Scholarship in Beijing from 2013 through 2014. The scholarship, sponsored by the Chinese government, is designed to educate foreign students on Chinese language, culture and history."I thought it was a good opportunity to get back in touch with my roots and learn what it means to be a part of a culture that my parents were originally from," she said.After returning to the United States, Diane worked for Fuyao Glass America in Dayton as an interpreter and public relations coordinator.In 2018, she re-enrolled at Wright State and last May earned her bachelor's degree in organizational leadership with a minor in international business and commerce.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6991449 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: January 22, 2020End of Document

Coronavirus also pollutes markets in China and drops bagsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 3, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 638 wordsBodyAfter ten days closed, Chinese stock exchanges sunk on Monday by about 8%, their biggest fall in five years, fearing the economic impact of the viral pneumonia epidemic and despite central bank measures.The fall was predictable. The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges were closed for the Chinese New Year holiday from January 24, a day after the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, was isolated.During this period, world markets also fell, worried about the consequences of the growth epidemic in China, the world's second largest economy, where activity remains paralyzed by the outbreak.In this context, the Shanghai Stock Exchange closed on Monday with a 7.72% drop to 2,746.61 points, while Shenzhen,20, the second largest in mainland China, ended up losing 8.41%, to 1,609.00 points.This is the strongest drop since the 2015 stock market crash."Investor panic spread to all stocks, dominate the market in the short term," says Yang Delong, an economist at first Seafront's investment fund.Nearly 3,500 stock sapeople fell by 10%, the threshold from which exchanges are automatically suspended, according to Bloomberg data.The epidemic, which has already left more dead (362 confirmed deaths) than SARS virus in 2002-2003, also affects Chinese foreign exchange and commodity markets, which also reopened on Monday.The Chinese currency fell by 1.5% and passed under the symbolic threshold of seven yuan per dollar while iron ore, copper or oil prices were suspended because they fell more than the authorized maximum.- Central bank measures -Chinese markets had to reopen friday but the Chinese government extended the New Year's holiday by three days to try to avoid the travel of millions of people and contain the virus.To stem the panic, China's central bank (PBOC) on Sunday announced an injection of 1.2 trillion yuan ($175 billion) into the financial system.On Monday, the institution also downgraded the preferential rate it applies to commercial banks for short-term loans by 2.4% (compared to 2.5% so far).An average that could "relieve pressure on banks" by reducing their financing costs, according to Julian Evans-Pritchard, of the consultancy Capital Economics.However, "this fall is too marginal to substantially curb damage to economic activity," the analyst adds.Meanwhile, measures to limit the spread of the virus – confinement, suspension of rail connections, closure of companies and factories until 9 February – continue to cripple entire sectors of the Chinese economy and threaten chains of production all over the planet.- Threat to growth -On the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the shares of Foxconn Industrial Internet, part of Taiwan's electronics giant Foxconn, sank by 10% on Monday.Foxconn, a key supplier to Apple, announced that it would not be relaunching its plants in China until mid-February.For his part Kweichow Moutai, the producer of the white alcohol "baijiu" that is usually given in China during the New Year, ended up losing 4.64%.Consumption is also being affected by the numerous shopping malls and closed restaurants across the country.Shares of travel agency CITS as well as those of airlines China Southern and China Eastern fell 10%.The Chinese government banned group travel and many connections between China and the rest of the world remain suspended.The stock market panic affected all sectorsless than that of medical equipment manufacturers, such as protective masks, some of which soared more than 10%.Several analysts on Monday augured a brake on China's economy this quarter with growth below 5%, ensuring that Beijing's measures may be insufficient.The Hong Kong stock exchange, which already sank last week, ended on stable Monday (+0.17%, up to 26,356.98 point). The Tokyo stock exchange lost 1.01%, up to 22,971.94 points.dma-jug/juf/myl/pc/enLoad-Date: February 4, 2020End of Document

Sens. Gardner, Cotton, Menendez, and Markey Introduce Resolution Honoring Dr. Li WenliangTargeted News ServiceFebruary 12, 2020 Wednesday 7:41 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1355 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Cory Gardner, R-Colorado, issued the following news release:* * *- Recognizes the Chinese doctor who first identified the severity of the coronavirus outbreak and sought to warn the government about the potential devastating impact* * *Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy, and Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR) Bob Menendez (D-NJ), and Ed Markey (D-MA) today introduced a resolution honoring the life of Dr. Li Wenliang, the Chinese doctor who first identified the severity of the coronavirus outbreak in China late last year and sought to warn the government about the potential devastating impact. Dr. Li succumbed to the coronavirus on February 7, 2020. The resolution also calls for transparency and cooperation from the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Communist Party of China."Dr. Li Wenliang tried to warn the world about the Wuhan coronavirus, but the Chinese Communist Party stood in the way. Now the Wuhan coronavirus has taken Dr. Li's life and killed more people than the SARS outbreak in 2003," said Senator Gardner. "We must ensure that this communicable and deadly virus is contained, and that means that the Chinese Communist Party must not be allowed to hide details of the Wuhan coronavirus from its people and the world.""Dr. Li heroically tried to protect his country and the world from the deadly coronavirus, but was silenced by the Chinese Communist Party. Now they have his blood on their hands. But Dr. Li's death doesn't have to be in vain. We should honor his memory by pushing the CCP to be fully transparent about the coronavirus and their efforts to stop the spread of this deadly disease," said Senator Cotton."Dr. Li's action in seeking to bring attention to and treat the Coronavirus outbreak was nothing short of heroic. He - and all the Chinese medical professionals seeking to address this pandemic--have my support, as do the Chinese people. The Chinese government and Communist Party must be open and transparent with their own people and with the international community as we seek to work together to address this virus and develop effective treatment. Censorship, repression and partnership on international health issues are far from 'perfect together'," said Senator Menendez."The authorities silenced Dr. Li the medical professional, but Dr. Li the citizen made a call for greater openness and transparency that will reverberate long after his passing. I stand with those in China now demanding freedom of speech, and I thank the Chinese doctors, nurses, medical professions, and all who are providing assistance on the front lines during this critical time. The Chinese government must cease its censorship, allow Taiwan the safety and security benefits of membership in international organizations, and cooperate internationally to mitigate this health crisis," said Senator Markey.The full text of the resolution can be found below or by clicking here.Commemorating the life of Dr. Li Wenliang and calling for transparency and cooperation from the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Communist Party of China.Whereas Dr. Li Wenliang was a 34-year-old ophthalmologist working in Wuhan, China;Whereas research indicates that the first patient infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) exhibited symptoms on December 1, 2019;Whereas, in December 2019, Dr. Li notified his associates in the medical community in China about the outbreak of 2019-nCoV;Whereas, after raising concerns about the spread of 2019-nCoV, Dr. Li was summoned by Chinese officials and forced to sign a statement retracting his warnings about the virus and confessing that he had spread illegal rumors;Whereas Chinese government authorities played down dangers to the public for weeks as 2019-nCoV continued to spread, with more than 42,000 confirmed cases in China alone and at least 1,000 deaths reported as of February 11, 2020;Whereas Dr. Li continued to work as an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital despite his knowledge of the outbreak, and appears to have been infected himself with 2019-nCoV after coming in contact with a patient he was treating for glaucoma;Whereas, on the morning of February 7, 2020, in the hospital where he worked, Dr. Li Wenliang died after contracting 2019-nCoV;Whereas, before he passed away, Dr. Li stated, "If the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier, I think it would have been a lot better.

Treasuries started the cash session in the red thanks to an uptick in global risk tolerance after a weekend that did not see a further escalation in tension between the U.S. and Iran. Treasuries widened their starting losses during the first two hours of action, finding support near their opening levels from Friday. The remainder of the session saw longer tenors inch back toward their starting levels while shorter tenors slipped to fresh lows in the afternoon. Today's retreat lifted yields on the 10-yr note and the 30-yr bond back above their respective 50-day moving averages while the 5-yr yield finished the day one basis point below the 50-day moving average of its own. The U.S. Dollar Index ended little changed at 97.34.• Yield Check: 2-yr: +2 bps to 1.58% 3-yr: +2 bps to 1.60% 5-yr: +2 bps to 1.65% 10-yr: +2 bps to 1.85% 30-yr: +2 bps to 2.31%• News: The U.S. will stop classifying China as a currency manipulator in order to sign the Phase One trade deal. China's Vice Premier, Liu He, arrived in Washington for the signing of the Phase One trade deal. Taiwan's incumbent President, Tsai Ing-wen, was reelected by a wide margin.

Treasury futures saw some light selling during evening trade, but the retreat was halted near yesterday's intraday lows. Treasury futures rebounded as attention turned to Europe, and they now trade just above levels from yesterday afternoon.

Total CPI was up 0.2% m/m, as expected, while core CPI, which excludes food and energy, was up a softer-than-expected 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%).• With the monthly changes, total CPI was up 2.3% yr/yr, versus 2.1% in November. Core CPI was up 2.3% yr/yr, unchanged from November.• The key takeaway from the report is that it won't cause any immediate re-think of the Fed's policy position. Core CPI has been up 2.3% yr/yr for three straight months, so the inflation rate isn't running away from the Fed, which seems to have adopted a willingness to let inflation run above its longer-run goal for a bit before moving on rates; moreover, the CPI data takes a backseat to the PCE price data as the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, and the latest report showed core-PCE inflation up just 1.6% yr/yr. The food index was up 0.2% m/m in December. The energy index was up 1.4% m/m in December. The shelter index rose 0.2% m/m and was a key driver of the modest uptick in core CPI.• Yield Check:2-yr: UNCH at 1.58%3-yr: -1 bp to 1.59%5-yr: -1 bp to 1.64%10-yr: -1 bp to 1.84%30-yr: -1 bp to 2.30%EUR/USD 1.1120USD/JPY 109.9910-Year - 1.821 - +7/32Early Gains Padded• U.S. Treasuries sit on their highs after extending their opening gains.

The advance has lifted most tenors to their highs from Friday, which is where they remain at this juncture. Equities trade modestly lower with the S&P 500 shedding 0.2%.

Chinese fans in mourning: Kobe Bryant's death draws an outpouring of shock and griefCNN.comJanuary 27, 2020 Monday 9:36 PM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 1184 wordsByline: By Nectar Gan and Emiko Jozuka, CNNBodyThe death of basketball great Kobe Bryant was felt as far away as China, where fans mourned his passing along with millions of others across Asia.The 41-year-old NBA superstar was among nine people killed Sunday when a helicopter crashed into a hillside in Calabasas, California. His daughter Gianna Maria Onore Bryant, 13, also died in the crash.Within hours of his death, Bryant's death became one of the most-searched topics on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform, where he had nine million followers, compared with 15 million worldwide on Twitter.The pinned post on his Weibo account was a short video uploaded on Friday of Bryant wishing his "dear friends in China" a happy Lunar New Year and thanking them for their support for the past year. Underneath that post, tens of thousands of fans have left tributes and messages of mourning."Please, don't you pass away," read the most liked comment, posted at 3:38 a.m. Beijing time, shortly after news of Bryant's death first broke.The former Los Angeles Lakers star remained the most popular NBA star in China, even three years after his retirement in 2016, according to a 2019 report by the Mailman Group, a digital sports marketing company.Bryant said recently that China was like his "second home.""Our faith, our youth"A whole generation of Chinese basketball fans grew up watching Bryant, as he made his way through the league and into the annals of sporting greats. Along with Michael Jordan, he was one of the first real NBA superstars to win a following in China, which embraced the American sport as the country opened up to the world.He enjoyed unparallelled popularity as an icon of their youth, when basketball surged in popularity in China."You're our faith, you're our youth. You're no one else, you're yourself," wrote one user on Weibo, referring to a popular quote from Bryant -- "I don't want to be the next Michael Jordan, I only want to be Kobe Bryant."Even China's state media posted tributes online, praising his fearless fighting spirit and the role he played in introducing basketball to a generation of Chinese people."From primary school to university, he accompanied the youth of countless people, and evoked the love for basketball among many young Chinese people," read a Weibo post by People's Daily, the mouthpiece of China's ruling Communist Party.Bryant's popularity surged in China in the late 1990s -- way before his five NBA championships and two Finals MVPs -- with the basketball summer camps he hosted around the country.By the time Chinese basketball star Yao Ming made his debut in the NBA for Houston Rockets in 2002, Bryant had already led the Lakers to win three consecutive NBA championships.In the 2000s, with Yao becoming a national hero, the NBA's popularity quickly grew in China, further cementing the wild veneration for Bryant among Chinese fans.When Bryant led the US team to win the gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, he was among the biggest stars in the Olympic village.He attracted huge crowds wherever he visited China. In 2013, a Chinese fan famously burst uncontrollably into tears when interviewed on television after seeing Bryant in person. A few months later, Chinese fans waited for Bryant at his hotel and chased after his coach in a video that went viral online."It's always about the passion of basketball," he told state-run China Daily in 2017 on a trip to southern Hainan province. "It just grew and grew to the point which China has become like a second home to me."Many in China admired Bryant for being hardworking and devoted to win -- his 4 a.m. workouts are not only widely known among fans, but also used by some school teachers as an example to encourage their students to study hard. "Los Angeles at 4 a.m." was among the most trending phrases on Weibo.Bryant is also remembered in the country for philanthropy. In 2009, he launched the Kobe Bryant China Fund, a charity set up to raise money for education, sports and cultural programs for youth in China.However, Bryant's death comes at an awkward time between China and the NBA -- just months after their spat over Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey's tweet supporting Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests. The league's Chinese partners suspended ties, state broadcaster CCTV halted all broadcasts of preseason matches, and the Chinese government said the NBA needed to show "mutual respect."But unlike other NBA stars such as LeBron James and Shaquille O'Neal, Bryant did not wade into the controversy, and the spat did not appear to have dampened Chinese fans' support for him at all. In October, fans watching the Lakers' games in China still wore his jerseys and held his image even though he had retired from the league."Named after my city"Bryant's legacy and impact is also felt in Japan. In 2011, Bryant fronted an American Red Cross campaign to raise support for survivors of the tsunami and earthquake disaster that rocked Japan's northern region of Tohoku. That tragedy left more than 22,000 people dead and missing, and tens of others homeless."The NBA family starts with the people of Japan, the survivors of the earthquake and the Pacific tsunami," said Bryant, in the Red Cross campaign video -- now being shared widely again on Twitter.Bryant's parents reportedly named him after the famous beef that is produced in Kobe city in Japan. NBA fans from Kobe were among thousands who expressed their gratitude and grief on Twitter."I've been always proud that I'm from Kobe because Kobe Bryant was named after my city. I'm totally heartbroken. RIP to a legend from Japan," said Twitter user Fugu.Kizo Hisamoto, mayor of Kobe city, said in a statement Monday that Bryant held "a special place for the people of Kobe city.""Our city had the good fortune of crossing paths with Kobe Bryant as his father named him after the city, given his love of Kobe beef," the statement said."We would once again like to express our gratitude for the support Kobe Bryant gave to this city and offer our heartfelt condolences," it added.In 1998, Bryant visited Kobe city and handed a donation of 480,000 yen ($4,400) raised through an Adidas charity event in Tokyo to help support social welfare in the city. Bryant was also an ambassador of Kobe city between 2001 and 2011.Tributes and condolences from elsewhere in Asia have also poured in. In Taiwan, President Tsai Ing-wen wrote on Twitter that her "thoughts go out to the Bryant family and the families of all those who lost loved ones today.""Kobe inspired a generation of young Taiwanese basketball players, (and) his legacy will live on through those who loved him," she wrote.In the Philippines, the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) said it had "lost a dear friend in Kobe Bryant who leaves behind fond memories of seven unforgettable visits.""His life was an inspiration and a lesson to everyone that with hard work, dedication and self-sacrifice, nothing is impossible. At 41, Kobe is gone too soon but his legacy will last forever."The PBA mourns the passage of a man who has touched the lives of millions," it said in a statement on Twitter.Load-Date: January 28, 2020End of Document

Extradited from Switzerland, Chinese scientist to stand trial in Philly for plot to steal GlaxoSmithKline trade secretsPhilly.comJanuary 6, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Distributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSLength: 1115 wordsByline: Jeremy Roebuck, The Philadelphia InquirerBodyJan. 06--A Chinese scientist accused of aiding a conspiracy to steal trade secrets potentially worth more than $1 billion from GlaxoSmithKline has been extradited from Switzerland to stand trial in Philadelphia.Federal prosecutors say Gongda Xue, a 50-year-old biochemist, received valuable proprietary cancer research that his sister stole while she worked for the pharmaceutical giant’s research facility in Upper Merion from 2006 to 2016.He is also accused of -- but has not been charged with -- pilfering confidential documents from one of his own former employers, a Swiss research institute backed by the global health care conglomerate Novartis.Xue’s handover to American authorities comes after an 18-month court battle in Switzerland during which he fought his extradition and amid a backdrop of deteriorating U.S.-China trade relations.For years, American officials have accused the Chinese government of encouraging scientists working for U.S. corporations to steal trade secrets to help jump-start their native country’s economy. And despite denials from Beijing, dozens of Chinese and Chinese-American researchers in fields ranging from superconductivity to agricultural science have been indicted in U.S. courts.Philly’s U.S. attorney pursuing corporate espionageBut for all the attention on the economic tensions between the two nations, Xue’s arrival in the U.S. -- just days before Christmas -- was met with little fanfare.The Justice Department has said little about the charges against Xue since a federal grand jury indicted him on 12 counts including conspiracy, theft of trade secrets and wire fraud last year. And as he made one of his first appearances in federal court in Philadelphia on Monday, Xue said nothing, leaving it to his attorney to argue on his behalf.In court filings, defense lawyers Marc Eisenstein and Barry Coburn have denied the government’s accusations, questioned the value of the stolen research and characterized Xue’s sister as the driving force behind the alleged crimes.“Dr. Xue has spent more than 20 years building his career and making significant contributions to the fields of cancer and HIV research,” Eisenstein wrote in a filing last week. “He has a complete lack of prior contact with the criminal justice systems in China, Switzerland and the United States. He is dedicated to his career and his family.”Xue’s sister -- Yu Xue, one of the world’s leading biochemists and a naturalized U.S. citizen living in Wayne -- awaits sentencing after pleading guilty in 2018 to stealing research on promising cancer therapies, many of which she developed herself during her time at GSK.Prosecutors say she and four codefendants -- including her twin sister and another colleague former GSK colleague -- aimed to use confidential documents to launch their own company, which they hoped would put Chinese industry at the forefront of lucrative pharmaceutical cancer research.Their firm, Renopharma, received more than $2 million in grants and a 4,000 square feet of free lab space from the Chinese government. According to U.S. court filings, Yu Xue and her colleagues estimated the company could be worth as much as $10 billion within a matter of years.In marketing materials, the business boasted of its access to GSK and Yu Xue, who it described as the British pharmaceutical maker’s “chief scientist.”Gongda Xue had no formal role in Renopharma. Since moving to Switzerland in 1999, he has worked at a string of universities and attained status as a lawful permanent resident. Before his arrest, he lived in Basel, Switzerland, with his wife and son.Still, U.S. prosecutors say he reviewed several of the documents his sister stole and shared equally privileged information from the Friedrich Miescher Institute, a biomedical research institute funded by Novartis that employed Gongda Xue from 2008 to 2014.He launched his own firm in Switzerland four months before his sister’s arrest in 2015. Authorities allege that he also intended to profit from stolen information.“Both Gongda Xue and Yu Xue knew that a successful anticancer product could reap billions of dollars per year in revenue,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert J. Livermore wrote in recent court filings. “While working for their respective entities, [both] secretly formed their own companies in hopes of profiting from their research.”But also like his sister, Gongda Xue’s fate could swing less on the question of whether he possessed stolen proprietary documents than on a debate over how much the information contained within them was worth.Federal prosecutors have said the information could be worth from $550 million to more than $1 billion. But, despite her guilty plea, Yu Xue maintains that the material had virtually no value to GSK.Her lawyers have argued that much of it was already available in the public domain and the pharmaceutical giant already had patents on several of the therapies discussed within them, meaning that Renopharma could not profit by simply copying them.Her defense has pointed to GSK’s own press releases in the wake of her 2015 arrest, which stated that the breach had no “material impact on the company’s business or R&D activity.”“To the extent that any information in the GSK documents were trade secrets they were fragmented and akin to having a single puzzle piece in a 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle,” attorneys Peter R. Zeidenberg and John N. Joseph wrote in a filing last year. “The information was useless to a person trying to replicate GSK’s work product.”A federal judge has yet to issue a ruling on that debate, which could play a determinative factor in the sentence Yu Xue ultimately receives.But as she sat in the gallery of a federal courtroom Monday in support of her brother, a different -- but equally complex -- question faced the court.Gongda Xue’s lawyers have sought his release on house arrest while he awaits trial. His brother-in-law has obtained an apartment for him in Wilmington, Del., and family members are willing to stake property should he fail to show up to court.But U.S. authorities have filed an immigration detainer against him. That means that even if a judge were to grant his bail request, Gongda Xue would not be released but instead transferred to an immigration detention facility -- an unusual circumstance for a man who had no desire to come to the U.S. and who was brought here against his will after fighting for more than a year to remain in Switzerland.U.S. Magistrate Judge David R. Strawbridge scheduled a March 16 hearing to further consider the issue.___ (c)2020 The Philadelphia Inquirer Visit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.inquirer.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.Load-Date: January 7, 2020End of Document

Addressing China Threats Requires Unity of U.S., World Effort, Esper SaysTargeted News ServiceJanuary 25, 2020 Saturday 8:07 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 710 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe U.S. Department of Defense issued the following news story:The National Defense Strategy identifies China and Russia as competitors of the United States in the so-called great power competition."Unfortunately, the Chinese government has used its diplomatic, military and economic power to expand its bad behavior, rather than abiding by international rules and norms."- Defense Secretary Dr. Mark T. EsperDefense Secretary Dr. Mark T. Esper focused attention on the threats posed by China and efforts by the Defense Department to counter those threats in a speech today at the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Global Security Forum in Washington."Unfortunately, the Chinese government has used its diplomatic, military and economic power to expand its bad behavior, rather than abiding by international rules and norms," he said.China continues to weaponize space, as demonstrated by its development of directed-energy weapons and satellite jammers, he said.To counter that effort, DOD has created its newest service, the Space Force, he said. "Much like NASA was a breeding ground for a wide array of high-tech breakthroughs, we believe the Space Force will be an incubator for a whole new generation of technologies," Esper said.The department is also developing hypersonic weapons and defense against those weapons, he said. In partnership with industry, DOD is also working on artificial intelligence, long-range precision fires and a 5G network.The secretary then touched on China's human rights violations against their own people."As we speak, the Communist Party of China is using artificial intelligence to repress Muslim minority communities and pro-democracy protestors," he said. "The party has constructed a 21st century surveillance state with unprecedented abilities to censor speech and infringe upon basic human rights. Now, it is exporting its facial recognition software and systems abroad."The secretary also spoke about China's economic piracy.Beijing is combining direct state investment, forced technology transfer, and intellectual property theft to narrow the gap between U.S. and Chinese equipment, systems and capabilities, he said.Esper said the manner in which China has acquired much of this technology is also troubling. "Beijing is determined to exploit American intellectual property and know-how at any cost," he said.Since 2018, the Justice Department has filed charges against Chinese nationals and entities in at least seven separate economic espionage cases, including a conspiracy to steal trade secrets from a major U.S. semiconductor maker. Over the same time period, the department has secured convictions and guilty pleas in at least six China-related espionage cases, Esper said.These examples just scratch the surface, he noted. In recent years, Chinese hackers have besieged the department and its industry partners. American universities and colleges have also become prime targets for Chinese exploitation.Despite widespread world outrage, Beijing shows few signs of changing its ways, Esper said. The government recently passed new legislation that tightens its grip over any data that flows across its networks, including access to the confidential information of U.S. corporations. President Xi Jinping's elevation of the "Military-Civil Fusion Strategy" to a national level puts our exports for peaceful, civilian use at risk of transfer to the People's Liberation Army, he said."Addressing these threats requires us to unite the nation around our competition with China," Esper said. "Our success is contingent upon a cohesive approach across public and private sectors. For the department, this means overhauling our policies and reshaping the culture within the department; between the department and industry; and among our allies and partners around the world."The secretary then made the case that the department is taking aggressive reform steps to free up time, money and manpower. That reform includes developing stronger relationships with industry to expand the department's competitive edge. It also includes the elimination of a risk-averse culture within the department that's not conducive to experimentation and new ideas.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6996020 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: January 27, 2020End of Document

China's 'War on Terror' uproots families, leaked data showsAssociated Press InternationalFebruary 18, 2020 Tuesday 2:30 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICAL NEWSLength: 1694 wordsByline: By DAKE KANG, Associated PressDateline: Beijing BodyBeijing (AP) - For decades, the Uighur imam was a bedrock of his farming community in China's far west. On Fridays, he preached Islam as a religion of peace. On Sundays, he treated the sick with free herbal medicine. In the winter, he bought coal for the poor.But as a Chinese government mass detention campaign engulfed Memtimin Emer's native Xinjiang region three years ago, the elderly imam was swept up and locked away, along with all three of his sons living in China.Now, a newly revealed database exposes in extraordinary detail the main reasons for the detentions of Emer, his three sons, and hundreds of others in Karakax County: their religion and their family ties.The database obtained by The Associated Press profiles the internment of 311 individuals with relatives abroad and lists information on more than 2,000 of their relatives, neighbors and friends. Each entry includes the detainee's name, address, national identity number, detention date and location, along with a detailed dossier on their family, religious and neighborhood background, the reason for detention, and a decision on whether or not to release them. Issued within the past year, the documents do not indicate which government department compiled them or for whom.Taken as a whole, the information offers the fullest and most personal view yet into how Chinese officials decided who to put into and let out of detention camps, as part of a massive crackdown that has locked away more than a million ethnic minorities, most of them Muslims.The database emphasizes that the Chinese government focused on religion as a reason for detention - not just political extremism, as authorities claim, but ordinary activities such as praying, attending a mosque, or even growing a long beard. It also shows the role of family: People with detained relatives are far more likely to end up in a camp themselves, uprooting and criminalizing entire families like Emer's in the process.Similarly, family background and attitude is a bigger factor than detainee behavior in whether they are released."It's very clear that religious practice is being targeted," said Darren Byler, a University of Colorado researcher studying the use of surveillance technology in Xinjiang. "They want to fragment society, to pull the families apart and make them much more vulnerable to retraining and reeducation."The Xinjiang regional government did not respond to faxes requesting comment. Asked whether Xinjiang is targeting religious people and their families, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said "this kind of nonsense is not worth commenting on."Beijing has said before that the detention centers are for voluntary job training, and that it does not discriminate based on religion.China has struggled for decades to control Xinjiang, where the native Uighurs have long resented Beijing's heavy-handed rule. With the 9/11 attacks in the United States, officials began using the specter of terrorism to justify harsher religious restrictions, saying young Uighurs were susceptible to Islamic extremism.After militants set off bombs at a train station in Xinjiang's capital in 2014, President Xi Jinping launched a so-called "People's War on Terror", transforming Xinjiang into a digital police state.The leak of the database from sources in the Uighur exile community follows the release in November of a classified blueprint on how the mass detention system really works. The blueprint obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which includes the AP, showed that the centers are in fact forced ideological and behavioral re-education camps run in secret. Another set of documents leaked to the New York Times revealed the historical lead-up to the mass detention.The latest set of documents came from sources in the Uighur exile community, and the most recent date in them is March 2019. The detainees listed come from Karakax County, a traditional settlement of about 650,000 on the edge of Xinjiang's Taklamakan desert where more than 97 percent of residents are Uighur. The list was corroborated through interviews with former Karakax residents, Chinese identity verification tools, and other lists and documents seen by the AP.Detainees and their families are tracked and classified by rigid, well-defined categories. Households are designated as "trustworthy" or "not trustworthy," and their attitudes are graded as "ordinary" or "good." Families have "light" or "heavy" religious atmospheres, and the database keeps count of how many relatives of each detainee are locked in prison or sent to a "training center."Officials used these categories to determine how suspicious a person was - even if they hadn't committed any crimes."It underscores the witch-hunt mindset of the government, and how the government criminalizes everything," said Adrian Zenz, an expert on the detention centers and senior fellow at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington, D.C.Reasons listed for internment include "minor religious infection," "disturbs other persons by visiting them without reasons," "relatives abroad," "thinking is hard to grasp" and "untrustworthy person born in a certain decade." The last seems to refer to younger men; about 31 percent of people considered "untrustworthy" were in the age bracket of 25 to 29 years, according to an analysis of the data by Zenz.When former student Abdullah Muhammad spotted Emer's name on the list of the detained, he was distraught."He didn't deserve this," Muhammad said. "Everyone liked and respected him. He was the kind of person who couldn't stay silent against injustice."Even in Karakax county, famed for its intellectuals and scholars, Emer stood out as one of the most renowned teachers in the region. Muhammad studied the Quran under Emer for six years as a kid, following him from house to house in an effort to dodge the authorities. Muhammad said Emer was so respected that the police would phone him with warnings ahead of time before raiding classes at his modest, single-story home of brick and mud.Though Emer gave Party-approved sermons, he refused to preach Communist propaganda, Muhammad said, eventually running into trouble with the authorities. He was stripped of his position as an imam and barred from teaching in 1997, amid unrest roiling the region.When Muhammad left China for Saudi Arabia and Turkey in 2009, Emer was making his living as a doctor of traditional medicine. Emer was growing old, and under heavy surveillance, he had stopped attending religious gatherings.That didn't stop authorities from detaining the imam, who is in his eighties, and sentencing him on various charges for up to 12 years in prison over 2017 and 2018. The database cites four charges in various entries: "stirring up terrorism," acting as an unauthorized "wild" imam, following the strict Saudi Wahhabi sect and conducting illegal religious teachings.Muhammad called the charges false. Emer had stopped his preaching, practiced a moderate Central Asian sect of Islam rather than Wahhabism and never dreamed of hurting others, let alone stirring up "terrorism," Muhammad said."He used to always preach against violence," Muhammad said. "Anyone who knew him can testify that he wasn't a religious extremist."None of Emer's three sons had been convicted of a crime. But the database shows that over the course of 2017, all were thrown into the detention camps for having too many children, trying to travel abroad, being "untrustworthy" or "infected with religious extremism,"or going on the Hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca. It also shows that their relation to Emer and their religious background was enough to convince officials they were too dangerous to let out from the detention camps."His father taught him how to pray," notes one entry for his eldest, Ablikim Memtimin."His family's religious atmosphere is thick. We recommend he (Emer) continue training," says another entry for his youngest son, Emer Memtimin.Even a neighbor was tainted by living near him, with Emer's alleged crimes and prison sentence recorded in the neighbor's dossier.The database indicates much of this information is collected by teams of cadres stationed at mosques, sent to visit homes and posted in communities. This information is then compiled in a dossier called the "three circles", encompassing their relatives, community, and religious background.It wasn't just the religious who were detained. The database shows that Karakax officials also explicitly targeted people for activities that included going abroad, getting a passport or installing foreign software.Pharmacist Tohti Himit was detained in a camp for having gone multiple times to one of 26 "key" countries, mostly Muslim, according to the database. Former employee Habibullah, who is now in Turkey, recalled Himit as a secular, kind and wealthy man who kept his face free of a beard."He wasn't very pious, he didn't go to the mosque," said Habibullah, who declined to give his first name out of fear of retribution against family still in China. "I was shocked by how absurd the reasons for detention were."The database says cadres found Himit had attended his grandfather's funeral at a local mosque on March 10, 2008. Later that year, the cadres found, he had gone to the same mosque again, once to worship and once to celebrate a festival. In 2014 he had gone to Anhui province, in inner China, to get a passport and go abroad.That, the government concluded, was enough to show that Himit was "certainly dangerous." They ordered Himit to stay in the center and "continue training."Emer is now under house arrest due to health issues, his former student, Muhammad, has heard. It's unclear where Emer's sons are.It was the imam's courage and stubbornness that did him in, Muhammad said. Though deprived of his mosque and his right to teach, Emer quietly defied the authorities for two decades by staying true to his faith."Unlike some other scholars, he never cared about money or anything else the Communist Party could give him," Muhammad said. "He never bowed down to them - and that's why they wanted to eliminate him."Load-Date: February 18, 2020End of Document

McCarthy in white robeCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 31, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 540 wordsBodyIn late 2018, then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced an offensive against "the premeditated, systematic and calculated threats of the Chinese communist regime." Scientists have been a significant target on that strategic agenda. Last Tuesday, on the occasion of the outrageous arrest of head of Harvard University's chemistry department, Charles Lieber, a world leader in his field, as you can read in Matter, the FBI special agent in charge of the operation worked hard to make it clear that the action was part of a broader campaign against researchers working with the Chinese government. "The goal of China's communist government is simply to replace the United States as a global superpower," Agent Joseph Bonavolonta said, "and they are breaking the law to achieve this." Lieber was handcuffed from college.The big question is whether China has an industrial espionage program or is part of the widespread paranoia that the Trump AdministrationLieber is the most prominent case so far, but by no means the only one. There are some 200 investigations opened by the FBI and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the country's great biomedical research machinery, to remove from the system scientists who, according to the authorities, are stealing results from the U.S. laboratories to give to China and other countries. Almost all scientists under the spotlight are of Chinese origin, or not nationalized in the Us Lieber is also an exception in this.The big question is whether China is actually taking advantage of the U.S. science system in a kind of large-scale industrial espionage program or whether the prosecution and FBI operation is part of the widespread paranoia that the Trump Administration has promoted against the Asian giant, in the context of a trade war that at the moment seems calm. Some scientists fear the latter and have begun talking about a new episode of macarthism, in reference to the "witch hunt" fired in the 1940s by Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy against alleged Soviet agents infiltrating the government and other supporters of communism, including half Hollywood.The Lieber case may shed some light on that dilemma. The scientist has not been arrested for spying or stealing data for passing on to the Chinese government. In that sense, there doesn't seem to be anything concrete against him. But there is no denying that his relations with China are well-founded. According to the prosecution documents, Lieber signed an agreement in 2011 as a "strategic scientist" for Wuhan University of Technology (a Chinese city that now sees headlines for a very different issue, as the focus of the coronavirus epidemic). It's not very clear what it means to become a strategic scientist, but how much it costs. Lieber charges $50,000 per month, $150,000 a year, and a $1.5 million grant to open a lab in Wuhan, which opened in 2013. The scientist and his lawyers are silent for the time being.The science of the week is a space in which Javier Sampedro analyzes the scientific topicality.

Chinese Pandemic May Be Slowed: TransparentBusiness Donates One Million Dollars to China, Offers Ways to Minimize Economic Impact and Save LivesPR NewswireJanuary 31, 2020 Friday 2:55 PM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 645 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, Jan. 31, 2020 BodyPR Newswire On the day when Coronavirus was declared a global health emergency as threat rises outside China, TransparentBusiness communicated to the Chinese Ambassador to the United States and his staff its offer of a free grant of one million dollars in TransparentBusiness licenses.Remote work, which TransparentBusiness facilitates, used to be a matter of convenience and financial savings; in China, it has become a matter of containing a pandemic; a matter of life and death.Tens of millions of Chinese residents who can work from home using TransparentBusiness are instead required to commute to offices and congregate there for a large part of the day, which unnecessarily increases the speed of the virus spreading in commuter trains and buses and in offices. Conversely, reducing the number of commuters and office workers slows down the rate of the spread of the virus, which matters greatly given the exponential nature of virus propagation. For example, 2^10 = 1024, whereas 3^10 = 59,049, 57 times more.TransparentBusiness is even more needed in the cities where all transportation is banned. Shutting down productive work in the city for an indefinite period of time is devastating to the national economy, businesses, and individuals.  For businesses in such cities, TransparentBusiness would be the way to coordinate the efficient work of home-based professionals.  China has imposed a transport ban around the epicenter of a deadly virus, restricting the movement of some 41 million people in 13 cities as authorities scramble to control the disease.The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on January 30th, as the first person-to-person transmission of the virus was reported in the U.S. The virus has sickened more than 9,500 people and killed 213, mostly in China's Hubei province, which surrounds Wuhan."We are also reaching to the government Chinese decision-makers on the national, provincial and municipal level, offering free use of our platform," said Alex Konanykhin, the CEO of TransparentBusiness. "While we incur costs related to this assistance, we see it as our responsibility to provide our solution for positive social impact." Previously,the White House announced TransparentBusiness' one million dollar donationto the refugee support program presented by President Obama to the Heads of States during the U.N. General Assembly of 2016.TransparentBusiness' SaaS platform is designed to empower corporations and government agencies to increase their vendors' productivity, protect them from overbilling, allow coordination and monitoring of remote workforce, and provide real-time information on the status of budget spend and projects.About TransparentBusiness:Designated by Citigroup as the "Top People Management Solution," the TransparentBusiness.com platform greatly increases the productivity of remote work, protects from overbilling, allows for easy monitoring and coordination of geographically distributed workforce and provides real-time information on the cost and status of all tasks and projects - see kmgi.us/tb.

PEN America: China's Sentencing of University of Minnesota Student Violates Free Speech GuaranteesTargeted News ServiceJanuary 24, 2020 Friday 7:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 552 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyPEN America issued the following news release:* * *- PEN America says sentencing shows that China intends for its censorship to be inescapable* * *The six-month jail sentence for a Chinese college student who tweeted "denigrating" photos while living in the U.S. is an obvious violation of free expression guarantees, and a clear message that the Chinese government intends for its censorship to be inescapable, PEN America said. Luo Daiqing, a student at the University of Minnesota, was charged with "provocation" and jailed last summer for several tweets he published in fall 2018 that purportedly criticized China's President Xi Jinping."This decision is flatly inconsistent with international--and domestic Chinese--guarantees of freedom of expression," said James Tager, deputy director of Free Expression Research and Policy at PEN America. "Luo's case is an obvious example of how China's criminal code criminalizes vast categories of speech, so that any expression of dissent or even criticism transforms everyday people into criminals in the eyes of the Chinese state."Under President Xi Jinping, China has seen a massive increase in censorship and state control over the media, literature, the arts, and everyday expression. Chinese efforts to enlarge its censorship outside its national borders include its kidnapping of the Causeway Bay Booksellers in 2015, its publicized attempts to intimidate the foreign family members of persecuted Uyghurs, and its forced censorship of popular social media platform WeChat--even for WeChat users outside of the country. Chinese state-controlled media have also helped lead public backlash against foreign brands that do not tow the Chinese official line on policy matters, from Mercedes-Benz to US-based airlines, to luxury brands like Versace and Coach."It is obvious that China is attempting to send a signal with Luo Daiqing's conviction--they are telling overseas Chinese citizens that there is no place where they are free from state censorship and surveillance," said PEN America's Tager. "That what you say in America or elsewhere will have consequences for you within China. That the reach of their censorship is inescapable. Luo's case has implications for every Chinese student studying abroad, and for every academic institution that seeks to safeguard its students' freedom of speech."In March 2018, PEN America launched the report Forbidden Feeds: Government Controls on Social Media in China, examining China's system of social media censorship as well as its efforts to force Western social media companies to comply with its censorship regime as a pre-requisite to market entry. PEN America also worked to push Google to drop "Project Dragonfly," its project to create a censored search engine for Chinese users.* * *PEN America stands at the intersection of literature and human rights to protect open expression in the United States and worldwide. We champion the freedom to write, recognizing the power of the word to transform the world. Our mission is to unite writers and their allies to celebrate creative expression and defend the liberties that make it possible.[Category: Government/Public Administration]Contact: Stephen Fee, director of communications, 202/309-8892, sfee@pen.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-6993743 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: January 24, 2020End of Document

Ferkat Jawdat talks to students about prosecution of Turkic Muslims in ChinaThe Eagle: American UniversityFebruary 13, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 371 wordsBodyFerkat Jawdat, an Uighur American activist whose family was targeted for his continued advocacy against the prosecution of Turkic Muslims in China, spoke at AU on Jan. 28. Jawdat had not seen his mother in 14 years and said she spent time in one of China's internment camps for Muslims in Xinjiang.Jawdat began speaking out about the issue in 2018. Since then, he has been covered in the press, spoken at many events and met with U.S. government officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.The Kennedy Political Union-sponsored event, moderated by Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin, occurred on international Holocaust Remembrance Day. Before the discussion, Rogin took a moment to acknowledge the many human rights atrocities that have taken place since the Holocaust, including what is currently taking place in China.Jawdat's family has faced repercussions as a result of him speaking out. His mother described being monitored, mistreated and pressured by the Chinese government. This story was documented by the New York Times podcast "The Daily." Jawdat said that even when speaking at colleges like AU, the Chinese government will pressure his mother to tell him to stop speaking out.He said that despite the personal risk to his family, his activism is essential."Every time Western people hear about or read about 3 million people locked up in concentration camps, it just becomes a statistic to them," Jawdat said. "I realized that I can use my story to put a face on the number."Jawdat also pointed to the parallels of the rise of xenophobia in the U.S. and in China."China just borrowed the war against terror from the U.S. government and used it as a reason to suppress the Uighurs," he said.Jawdat said that college students can involve themselves in the issue by reaching out to their representatives and protesting goods made in China.KPU Director Kevin Norton said that he wanted to give the Chinese government a chance to also share their perspective. He wrote to the Chinese ambassador prior to the event, inviting them to join the discussion, but did not receive a response."I told my team that if you want to travel to China, I suggest not working this event," said Norton.aveitch@theeagleonline.comLoad-Date: February 13, 2020End of Document

DID THE US-CHINA PHASE ONE DEAL DELIVER A WIN FOR US FINANCIAL SERVICES?States News ServiceJanuary 27, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1609 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Peterson Institute for International Economics:An inconspicuous but important element in the "phase one" trade agreement between the United States and China promises greater access to Chinese consumers and businesses for Visa, Mastercard, JPMorgan Chase, and other US financial and insurance companies. The United States has tried and failed for years to get China to open up in this area, while the United States has itself erected barriers to Chinese financial firms operating here. But will the deal, signed on January 15, 2020, fulfill its promises on financial services? The deal does embody some gains, but it is too soon to tell whether they will deliver the goods.China did promise greater access as part of the "phase one" accord. But Beijing had announced or implemented almost all of its concessions already, in part because Chinese officials increasingly understood that foreign competition in these areas was in China's own interest.But unfortunately, entry of US credit card firms into China may have come too late for some. China's financial firms are far more competitive than they were when its financial markets were supposed to open in 2006, and mobile payments from Alipay and WeChat have led Chinese consumers to mostly skip credit cards offered by Visa and Mastercard altogether. China may have agreed to the latest deal simply because it judged that its players no longer had much to fear from foreign competition. In addition, some of the most important barriers to financial integration with the rest of the world come from China's capital controls, along with restrictive rules on data flows and data localization, none of which show signs of easing up. A wait-and-see approach to these steps forward remains appropriate.China's agreement to loosen restrictions on foreign financial services companies nonetheless must be seen as one of the only bright spots in a process of "reform and opening up" that has generally stalled or been reversed since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012. In 2017, the Chinese government laid out its roadmap for large-scale financial market opening. Trump administration pressure appears to have broken bureaucratic logjams that delayed the opening that China originally agreed to do by 2006. Opening up finance appears to have been less costly politically for China than making concessions such as ending subsidies to state firms, which would have required it to make more fundamental changes to its growth model.Advocates of financial reform in China argue that such opening brings in both capital and expertise that benefit Chinathus not being a pure concession to the United States. Vice Premier Liu He said that "other countries should receive the same standard of treatment" as that agreed in the phase one deal, further reinforcing that point.Mixed history in financial servicesWhen it joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, China promised that "foreign financial institutions will be permitted to provide services to all Chinese clients" by December 2006. It followed through in many areas, but payment services were not one of them. Every year since, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) complained that negotiations concluded "without making progress" in electronic payments. The United States finally sued China at the WTO in 2010. Though the United States largely won the case, applications from firms like Visa and Mastercard were kept like Schrodinger's cat in a regulatory black box process for years, neither alive nor dead. In other financial services sectors, China enforced joint venture requirements with foreign ownership limits of 49 percent, below the threshold for control. Any Chinese reformers hoping to open the market to foreign competition appear to have been overruled.These and other restrictions kept foreign banks on the margins of Chinese finance. As of June 2018, foreign-funded banks held a paltry 1.7 percent of bank assets there, just over half the average in the region and far below both other emerging markets and the United States (see figure).[1]Opening jumpstarted in 2017In retrospect the real turning point is not the phase one trade deal but the last day of President Trump's visit to China in August 2017. Then Vice Minister of Finance Zhu Guangyao announced that China would phase out the 49 percent foreign ownership caps in securities firms, futures, and funds. Zhu laid out an explicit timetable: China would start drafting rules that raised the caps to 51 percent, while all ownership limits in those three sectors would be gone in three years. Ownership limits in insurance would end in five years. Since the announcement, both Mastercard and American Express have received permission to set up Chinese joint ventures.It is impossible to know how much the Trump administration's hardball approach contributed to the opening that China started without waiting for a deal. Rules for foreign investment permitted the new 51 percent stakes in June 2018. In July 2019 Premier Li Keqiang even accelerated the timetable, promising to eliminate ownership caps by 2020 in insurance, futures, and securities.Much of opening this time was real, not just a theoretical possibility. Some foreign financial firms received timely approvals to take majority stakes in joint ventures or set up wholly foreign-owned operations.Limited new openingAfter the phase one deal was signed, China's central bank put out a statement that it, "reflects the orderly, broad progress in opening up financial services on our own initiative and will strengthen our financial system's competitiveness and resilience." The deal mostly reaffirms and codifies what was under way, as can be seen in the table. The specific deadlines for China to allow full foreign ownership have apparently been moved up only for securities firms.There's less to the phase one deal than meets the eyeSectorTiming in phase one deal Previous timing Foreigners allowed in already ?Securities fund custodian services5 months (June 2020)Already openStandard Chartered (received license in October 2018)Type-A lead underwriting3 months (April 2020)Already openBNP and Deutsche Bank (received license in September 2019)Credit rating3 months (April 2020)Already openStandard and Poor's received license, already issued ratingsSecuritiesApril 2020December 2020JPMorgan approved for majority ownership, not full foreign ownershipFund managementApril 2020April 2020JPMorgan awaiting approval for 51% stake in China venture, seeking 100% in anotherFuturesApril 2020January 2020UBS has fully owned futures business since 2016InsuranceApril 2020January 2020Allianz approved for wholly foreign-owned unit in November 2019Payments/bank card clearingMaximum delay between most approval stepsn.a.PayPal approved for 70% stake; Mastercard and American Express approved to set up joint venturesn.a. = not applicableSources: Caixin, CNBC, Reuters, US Trade Representative, Financial Times, Allianz, and Bloomberg.Beyond a headline opening of a sector are the multitude of rules that can keep foreign firms from entering or expanding. The agreement's approach to eliminating these barriers is strangely uneven. In insurance, China's promises are broad: "remove any business scope limitations, discriminatory regulatory processes and requirements...", but that language is missing in the other sectors, where only specifically identified barriers are slated for removal. Chinese officials could easily add new discriminatory rules in the other sectors to replace those they promised to eliminate, without violating the deal's provisions.The section on electronic payment services, attempting to right one of China's most frustrating WTO violations, also left loopholes. China's promises apply only to card payments, not fintech payment providers that dispense with cardsthough importantly US-based PayPal was unexpectedly granted a license, before the deal was signed, by acquiring a 70 percent stake in a Chinese payment company. The deal states, "China shall accept the license application of...Mastercard, Visa, or American Express," and sets time limits on the acceptable delay between the early steps of the approval process. A time limit for the final approval, however, is missing, leaving China room to stretch it out indefinitely. Even if there were a time limit, China's central bank could always find a pretext to deny a license. Yet another apparent breakthrough is a partial victory: Foreign firms will also be able to buy nonperforming loans directly, at least with provincial licenses, but many are already operating in the sector.All these openings are long overdue, but China's financial system will need deeper reformsespecially in its capital accountto benefit fully from foreign firms' expertise. The openings constitute a big step forward for reform in China, overcoming resistance from domestic financial firms whose preference for less competition kept foreigners largely at bay for over a decade. Most of China's promises in the deal reiterate what it has already done, but that is a sign of real progress, not a dud result for the negotiations. Progress in the next phase in US-China commercial relations will have to be monitored vigorously.Note1. According to data from the People's Bank of China, accessed through Wind Information Services, foreign-funded banks in China had RMB4.2 trillion in assets as of June 2018 versus RMB256 trillion in assets for all banks in China. Banking asset data for other countries shown in the figure are for 2013, the most recent cross-country data I could find (Claessens and van Horen 2014).Load-Date: January 28, 2020End of Document

Chinese coronavirus whistle-blower dies of coronavirusUPIFebruary 6, 2020 Thursday 11:21 AM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 699 wordsByline: BRIAN P. DUNLEAVYDateline: Dec. 31 BodyThe Chinese doctor who first sounded the alarm about the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan died in the early hours Friday local time.Li Wenliang, 34, was declared dead at 2:58 am after "emergency treatment" at Wuhan Central Hospital.The hospital had denied reports earlier Thursday from Chinese state media and the World Health Organization that a doctor accused of "spreading rumors" about the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak had died of the virus.Hospital officials told the South China Morning Post early Friday local time that Li, was still alive at the time and remained in critical condition after receiving life-saving treatment.WHO officials responded to the earlier reports about Li, an ophthalmologist, during a press briefing Thursday morning, calling him a "front-line worker who is committed to care for patients," and that "we should celebrate his life and mourn his death with his colleagues."Li, who worked at Wuhan Central when the coronavirus outbreak started in December, was accused by law enforcement officials in the city of spreading rumors about it after he warned friends about the disease on social media. His hospital, he told them, was seeing patients coming in with an "unusual" pneumonia that he compared to SARS.Li was summoned by police on Jan. 3 and reprimanded for "spreading rumors online" and "severely disrupting social order."Li had to sign a statement admitting his "misdemeanor" and promising not to commit further "unlawful acts."It was confirmed earlier this week that he had been diagnosed with the virus after helping treat hospital patients.Compiling dataLi's illness comes as the WHO accuses countries affected by the 2019-nCoV outbreak of withholding information on cases and virus samples. The WHO has refused to cite countries by name, but has pointedly -- and consistently -- refused to criticize the Chinese government's handling of information on the outbreak."We are still awaiting data from a number of countries," said Dr. , executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Program. However, "from our observation of the situation, China has reported data in an extremely timely fashion."He noted that the Chinese government had surveillance systems in place to identify "unusual pneumonia," and that this system quickly identified 2019 nCoV and led to a rapid mobilization of health response teams to the city.Officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have also credited the Chinese with sharing the viral genome quickly, which has enabled the development of an accurate diagnostic test and served as the starting point for research into possible vaccines and drug treatments.Test kitsWHO officials said Thursday that 250,000 testing kits for 2019-nCoV have been distributed to member states.The CDC also started shipping its laboratory test kit to detect 2019-nCoV on Wednesday to select qualified U.S. and international laboratories. Distribution of the tests will help improve the global capacity to detect and respond to the virus, the agency said.The tests are being shipped through the International Reagent Resource, a CDC-established mechanism that distributes laboratory reagents.The test kit, called the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Diagnostic Panel, is designed for use with the RT-PCR testing instrument used to test for seasonal flu. It is intended for use with upper and lower respiratory specimens collected from people who meet CDC criteria for 2019-nCoV testing and can provide results in four hours."Our goal is early detection of new cases and to prevent further spread of the coronavirus," CDC Director Robert R. Redfield said in a statement. "Distribution of these diagnostic tests to state laboratories, U.S. government partners and more broadly to the global public health community will accelerate efforts to confront this evolving global public health challenge."The test kit has not been cleared or approved by the , but the FDA on Tuesday issued an Emergency Use Authorization.Initially, about 200 test kits will be distributed to U.S. laboratories and a similar number will be distributed to select international labs. Each test kit can process 700 to 800 patient specimens.Load-Date: February 6, 2020End of Document

Enforcing immigration law on campus- a necessityThe Suffolk Journal: Suffolk UniversityJanuary 29, 2020 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 1046 wordsByline: Nick SammarcoBodyWhen Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced the House would begin formal impeachment proceedings against President Trump, Democrats rallied behind the mantra "Nobody is above the law." The subsequent investigation into the alleged quid pro quo revealed to all Americans (or at least to those willing to look) the actions the President took to leverage American foreign policy for his own personal and political gain. Democrats correctly argued that the President had abused his power, violated his oath of office to support, protect, and defend the Constitution and needed to be impeached. The results of the House of Representative's impeachment vote on Dec. 18, 2019, gave credibility to the claim that Democrats cared about the rule of law. It was therefore saddening, but not surprising when the Suffolk University College Democrats endorsed a policy plan that would aid and abet criminal activity on campus.   The plan/petition, originally proposed by the Suffolk University Marxist Student Association on Jan. 13, demands that administration and President Marisa Kelly create "safe zones" where SUPD and other authorities cannot ask to verify a student's immigration status. The Marxists and Democrats also request that federal immigration officials are to be restricted from entering campus grounds and that campus security and police be prohibited from collaborating with federal immigration authorities for the purposes of enforcement or information.According to the petition, now nearing 400 online signatures, the motivation for the proposed changes stems from the fact that, "Recently MIT has warned international students that federal immigration officials may visit their worksites to verify that their employment is directly related to their studies. Students have been detained and imprisoned for allegedly "stealing information to bring back to their home countries" on school break." In their appeal to administration, the Marxists then state "We, the Marxist Student Association, hope to work with Suffolk Administration, Student Affairs and President Marisa Kelly to ensure ALL students at Suffolk remain safe and within a welcoming environment on and around the Suffolk campus."The logic behind the Suffolk University Democrats' decision to endorse these demands is ill-founded. In this case, enforcing immigration law is a good thing. Let's explore why.As the petition correctly notes, the increased monitoring and enforcement efforts from ICE and other immigration officials are a result of recent criminal activity among a few members of the brilliant international student population in Boston. Most notably, on Dec. 31, a graduate student at Harvard University was arrested at Logan Airport for attempting to smuggle vials of proprietary serum used in cancer treatment from Brigham and Women's Hospital back to his home country of China. This is part of a disturbing trend of espionage and intellectual property theft emanating from the Chinese government.According to The Economist "In 2018 and 2019 agents from the FBI's 56 national field offices contacted hundreds, perhaps thousands, of students, researchers and professors with ties to China-many of them from China or ethnically Chinese, including Chinese-Americans-to determine whether they might be working on behalf of the Communist Party." Additionally, The Economist states that, "The [National Institute for Health] says that it has identified 180 researchers to whom it has provided grants who may not have disclosed payments from, or other affiliations with, Chinese institutions-including some who appear to have established "shadow labs" in China mirroring their NIH-funded ones in America."In a statement made to A House Divided, a political podcast and radio show a friend and I host, the Suffolk University Democrats argued, "Suffolk Democrats believe these actions by ICE are unconstitutional. If they were only checking on students who they had probable cause to check on that's one thing. However, what we're seeing is them checking every foreign student which is racial profiling, not probable cause. We understand the government's attempt to try and protect intellectual property but in 2019 more U.S. citizens were charged for this type of theft than foreigners."This analysis simply does not hold up to scrutiny. For starters, the Suffolk Democrats did not present a shred of evidence confirming that ICE is "racially profiling" students when conducting investigations into visa violations and other criminal activity. The Dems are just plain wrong when they suggest ICE doesn't have probable cause for checking foreign students' immigration status. According to the ACLU, an organization that can only be described as vehemently pro-immigrant, "If you are not a U.S. citizen and an immigration agent requests your immigration papers, you must show them if you have them with you." Simply being a foreign national in America is probable cause enough to be asked to prove your immigration status. Finally, the idea that since more Americans commit intellectual property theft crimes, therefore we shouldn't worry about intellectual property theft from abroad is laughable.According to CNN, it is estimated that losses from Chinese intellectual property theft alone total between $225 billion and $600 billion annually. To resolve these issues, strict enforcement of immigration law must be utilized. We should not be creating spaces on campus for immigration law to be broken.Unless they're simply obfuscating their preference for open borders, it seems to me that the Suffolk University Democrats got duped. Swept up in the quest to stamp out the wave of xenophobic sentiment sweeping the country in recent years, the SU Democrats endorsed a policy that would empower regimes seeking to undermine our nation and neuter the power of immigration officials to protect Americans from communist governments and criminal activity. The SU Democrats should abide by the words of Nancy Pelosi when she said "Nobody is above the law."  Hopefully, this column will help the SU Dems realize the real threat we face and convince them how foolish of an idea it would be to take their immigration policy cues from an organization best known for telling white students to go back to Europe.Load-Date: January 30, 2020End of Document

US accuses Harvard's head of chemistry of working for ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 29, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 363 wordsBodyU.S. prosecutors accused a senior Harvard University academic of hiding his alleged role in a Chinese government program that security officials say steals trade secrets.The arrest on Tuesday of American Charles Lieber, the director of Harvard's department of chemistry and chemical biology, specializing in nanoscience, is the latest development in a long saga for alleged theft of intellectual property.U.S. justice investigates hundreds of cases of alleged theft by Chinese scientists working in the United States or visiting the country.Two other scientists, both Chinese, were also framed tuesday, the Justice Department said in a statement.One is a boston University science student who prosecutors said did not inform U.S. immigration authorities that he was also a member of the Chinese armed forces, the People's Liberation Army.The other is a cancer researcher accused of trying to get out of the United States in its 21 vials containing biological research. He was arrested at Boston airport on December 30.Lieber's 60-year-old arrest is unusual because she is not of Chinese origin and is a prominent figure at one of the most respected universities in the world.Prosecutors claim that China employed Lieber as a "strategist scientist" and paid him a salary of $50,000 per month, as well as up to $158,000 per year in expenses. They also say he received more than $1.5 million to set up a lab at Wuhan University of Technology.They claim that Lieber lied twice about his affiliation with Wuhan University and said he was not involved in the Chinese government's Thousand Talent Plan. As a recipient of more than $15 million in government research funds, Lieber was to report any foreign financial interest conflicts, including financial support from foreign governments or entities.The Mil Talentos programme seeks to recruit international experts in scientific research, innovation and entrepreneurship.But the U.S. government has described it as a threat to national security."This is a small sample of China's ongoing campaign to absorb American knowledge and technology for its own benefit," Massachusetts state prosecutor Andrew Lelling told reporters.pdh-lbc/ldaLoad-Date: February 26, 2020End of Document

CHINESE MILITARY PERSONNEL CHARGED WITH COMPUTER FRAUD, ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE AND WIRE FRAUD FOR HACKING INTO CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY EQUIFAXUS Fed NewsFebruary 10, 2020 Monday 8:00 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 1074 wordsBodyATLANTA, Feb. 10 -- The U.S. Department of Justice's U.S. Attorney's office for Northern District of Georgia issued the following press release:A federal grand jury has returned an indictment charging four members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) with hacking into the computer systems of the credit reporting agency Equifax and stealing Americans' personal data and Equifax's valuable trade secrets.The nine-count indictment alleges that Wu Zhiyong , Wang Qian , Xu Ke and Liu Lei were members of the PLA's 54th Research Institute, a component of the Chinese military. They allegedly conspired with each other to hack into Equifax's computer networks, maintain unauthorized access to those computers, and steal sensitive, personally identifiable information of approximately 145 million American victims."This was a deliberate and sweeping intrusion into the private information of the American people," said Attorney General William Barr, who made the announcement. "Today, we hold PLA hackers accountable for their criminal actions, and we remind the Chinese government that we have the capability to remove the Internet's cloak of anonymity and find the hackers that nation repeatedly deploys against us. Unfortunately, the Equifax hack fits a disturbing and unacceptable pattern of state-sponsored computer intrusions and thefts by China and its citizens that have targeted personally identifiable information, trade secrets, and other confidential information.""The indictment exposes the Chinese military's effort to collect sensitive information of Americans on an unprecedented scale and steal proprietary information for the benefit of the Chinese government. With this announcement, we underscore our resolve to protect our citizens from state-sponsored cyber threats and to unmask those who perpetrate unlawful attacks," said U.S. Attorney Byung "BJay" Pak of the Northern District of Georgia. "These charges were made possible because Equifax worked closely, and early, with our dedicated law enforcement team to hold the perpetrators accountable. As corporations like Equifax continue to be targeted by cyber attacks, this investigation illustrates the critical importance of public-private collaboration to combat the most sophisticated cyber threats.""The FBI is dedicated to working with our federal partners to seek justice for anyone who would threaten the safety, security and confidence of our American citizens," said Chris Hacker, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. "These criminal hackers, sponsored by their government, were not able to hide behind the internet curtain thanks to the determination of FBI Atlanta's cyber squad, FBI Headquarters Cyber Division, the U.S. Attorney's Office Northern District of Georgia and the Justice Department. This does not end our investigation into one of the biggest threats to our national security today."According to U.S. Attorney Pak, the charges and other information presented in court: The defendants exploited a vulnerability in the Apache Struts Web Framework software used by Equifax's online dispute portal. They used this access to conduct reconnaissance of Equifax's online dispute portal and to obtain login credentials that could be used to further navigate Equifax's network. The defendants spent several weeks running queries to identify Equifax's database structure and searching for sensitive, personally identifiable information within Equifax's system.Once they accessed files of interest, the conspirators then stored the stolen information in temporary output files, compressed and divided the files, and ultimately were able to download and exfiltrate the data from Equifax's network to computers outside the United States. In total, the attackers ran approximately 9,000 queries on Equifax's system, obtaining names, birth dates and social security numbers for nearly half of all American citizens.The indictment also charges the defendants with stealing trade secret information, namely Equifax's data compilations and database designs. "In short, this was an organized and remarkably brazen criminal heist of sensitive information of nearly half of all Americans, as well as the hard work and intellectual property of an American company, by a unit of the Chinese military," said Barr.The defendants took steps to evade detection throughout the intrusion, as alleged in the indictment. They routed traffic through approximately 34 servers located in nearly 20 countries to obfuscate their true location, used encrypted communication channels within Equifax's network to blend in with normal network activity, and deleted compressed files and wiped log files on a daily basis in an effort to eliminate records of their activity.The defendants are charged with three counts of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, conspiracy to commit economic espionage, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The defendants are also charged with two counts of unauthorized access and intentional damage to a protected computer, one count of economic espionage, and three counts of wire fraud. The details contained in the charging document are allegations. The defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia, the Criminal and National Security Divisions of the Department of Justice, and the FBI's Atlanta Field Office are investigating the case. The FBI's Cyber Division also provided support. Equifax cooperated fully and provided valuable assistance in the investigation.Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nathan Kitchens, Samir Kaushal, and Thomas Krepp of the Northern District of Georgia; Senior Counsel Benjamin Fitzpatrick of the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section; and Trial Attorney Scott McCulloch of the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting this case. Attorneys with the Office of International Affairs provided critical assistance in obtaining evidence from overseas.For further information please contact the U.S. Attorney's Public Affairs Office at USAGAN.PressEmails@usdoj.gov or (404) 581-6016.

China is disinfecting and destroying cash to contain the coronavirusCNN.comFebruary 16, 2020 Sunday 3:07 AM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 768 wordsByline: By Jessie Yeung, CNNDateline: Hong Kong BodyAs the novel coronavirus outbreak continues to batter China, the country's central bank has implemented a new strategy to contain the virus -- deep cleaning and destroying potentially infected cash.The new measures, announced by the People's Bank of China on Saturday, aim to contain the spread of the virus, officially known as Covid-19. There is still a lot unknown about the virus, which has infected more than 71,000 people globally and killed 1,775, the majority in China -- but it appears to survive for at least several hours on surfaces, according to the World Health Organization.This is why buildings in affected areas are regularly disinfecting elevator buttons, door handles, and other commonly-touched surfaces -- and why people are worried about cash, which changes hands multiple times a day.All Chinese banks must now literally launder their cash, disinfecting it with ultraviolet light and high temperatures, then storing it for seven to 14 days before releasing it to customers, said the central Chinese government in a press release Saturday.Cash that comes from high-risk infection areas, like hospitals and wet markets, will be "specially treated" and sent back to the central bank instead of being recirculated.And in the central bank's Guangzhou branch, these high-risk banknotes may be destroyed instead of merely disinfected, according to state-run tabloid Global Times.To make up for the supply, the bank will issue large amounts of new, uninfected cash; in January, the bank allocated 4 billion yuan (about $573.5 million) in new banknotes to Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak began, said the government press release.Other measures includes suspending physical cash transfers between hard-hit provinces, to limit the possibility of virus transmission during the cash's transit.It's unclear how "infected" cash in China may actually be -- the virus likely dies after a few hours on surfaces, especially if it's been killed with disinfectant. And most people in urban centers don't use cash anyway -- mobile payment apps are near-ubiquitous.But as previous studies have found, money can be incredibly dirty. Each dollar, passed person to person, samples a bit of the environment it comes from, and passes those bits to the next person.The list of things found on US dollar bills includes DNA from our pets, traces of drugs, and bacteria and viruses, according to a 2017 study in New York.That doesn't mean cash is actually dangerous for our health; disease transmission linked to money is rare, and no major disease outbreaks have started from our ATMs. But with new cases being reported every day in China, the country's officials are taking no chances.The new measures indicate "the financial system's full support in fighting the virus and resuming production," the government press release said.China struggles to contain coronavirusSince the outbreak began in Wuhan in December, it has spread to 28 countries and territories, sparking travel restrictions and emergency measures worldwide.But mainland China remains the hardest hit. Of the 1,775 coronavirus deaths worldwide, only five occurred outside of mainland China. And of the 71,319 cases worldwide, 70,548 are in mainland China.To limit the spread of the virus, Chinese authorities have implemented a number of other drastic measures including placing 60 million people under full or partial lockdown. People aren't just afraid to touch money -- just going outside risks infection, so many have stayed at home for the past few weeks, only venturing out to buy groceries.Even when they do go out, they wrap themselves in protective plastic; travelers at a Beijing train station this week were seen wearing disposable plastic gloves, shower caps, full-face plastic visors, and even full-body plastic ponchos.The lockdowns and halt in business have also taken a toll on the Chinese economy, with some warning that the outbreak could cost China $62 billion in lost growth. Experts warn that if businesses shut down entirely, unable to survive the prolonged suspensions, it could result in mass layoffs, unemployment, and housing foreclosures.And so, millions of people are beginning to resume work -- in the safety of their apartments, in what may be the world's biggest work-from-home experiment.Meanwhile, Chinese and international experts continue working together to learn more about the virus and contain its spread. On Sunday, a team of WHO and international experts arrived in Beijing for a joint mission with their Chinese counterparts, to analyze data and determine next steps for both China and the world.Load-Date: February 17, 2020End of Document

App Association Issues Public Comment on Office of Trade Representative NoticeTargeted News ServiceFebruary 26, 2020 Wednesday 6:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4374 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, Feb. 26 -- Brian Scarpelli, senior global policy counsel, and Alexandra McLeod, policy counsel, at the App Association, have issued a public comment on the Office of U.S. Trade Representative's notice rule entitled "Hearings: 2020 Special 301 Review". The comment was written on Feb. 20, 2020, and posted on Feb. 21, 2020:* * *ACT | The App Association (App Association) writes in response to the Office of the United States Trade Representative's (USTR) request to identify countries that deny adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) or deny fair and equitable market access to U.S. persons who rely on IPR protections, to inform USTR's 2019 Special 301 Report./1The App Association represents thousands of small business software application development companies and technology firms located across the United States./2Alongside the rapid adoption of mobile technologies, our members develop innovative applications and products that improve workplace productivity, accelerate academic achievement, monitor health, and support the global digital economy. Today, the app ecosystem is worth more than $1.7 trillion, is responsible for 5.9 million American jobs, and serves as a key driver of the $8 trillion internet of things (IoT) revolution.I. General CommentsThe global digital economy holds great promise for small app development companies, but our members face a diverse array of trade barriers when entering new markets. These barriers may take the form of laws, regulations, policies, or practices that protect domestic goods and services from foreign competition, artificially stimulate exports of domestic goods and services, or fail to provide adequate and effective protection of IPR. While these barriers have different forms, they all have the same net effect: impeding U.S. exports and investment at the expense of American workers. Such trade barriers include:* Intellectual Property Violations: The infringement and theft of IPR (copyrights, trademarks, patents, and trade secrets) presents a major threat to our members and the billions of consumers who rely on their digital products and services. Strong but fair protection of intellectual property for copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets is essential to their businesses.* Limiting Cross-Border Data Flows: Limiting cross-border data flows hurts all players in the digital economy. The seamless flow of data across economies and political borders is essential to the global economy. In particular, innovative small app development companies rely on unfettered data flows to access new markets and customers.* Data Localization Policies: Companies expanding into new overseas markets often face regulations that force them to build and/or use local data infrastructure. These data localization requirements seriously hinder imports and exports, as well as jeopardize an economy's international competitiveness and undermine domestic economic diversification. Small app developers often do not have the resources to build or maintain infrastructure in every country in which they do business, which effectively excludes them from global commerce.* Customs Duties on Digital Content: American app developers and technology companies take advantage of the internet's global nature to reach the 95 percent of customers that are outside the United States. However, the "tolling" of data across political borders with the intent of collecting customs duties directly contributes to the balkanization of the internet and prevents small business digital economy innovators from entering new markets.* Requirements to Provide Source Code for Market Entry: Some governments have proposed or implemented policies that make legal market entry contingent upon the transfer of proprietary source code. For app developers and tech companies, intellectual property is the lifeblood of their business, and the transfer of source code presents an untenable risk of theft and piracy. These requirements present serious disincentives for international trade and are non-starters for the App Association's members.* Requirements for "Backdoors" in Encryption Techniques: Global digital trade depends on technical data protection methods and strong encryption techniques to keep users safe from harms like identity theft. However, some governments and companies insist that "backdoors" be built into encryption for the purposes of government access. These policies would degrade the safety and security of data, as well as the trust of end users, by creating known vulnerabilities that unauthorized parties can exploit. From a security and privacy standpoint, the viability of app developers' products depends on the trust of end users.The infringement and theft of IP jeopardizes the success of App Association members and hurt the billions of consumers who rely on their app-based products and services. Each kind of IPR (copyrights, trademarks, patents, and trade secrets) represents distinct utilities upon which App Association members depend. App developers and publishers lost an estimated $17.5 billion to pirated apps between 2013 and 2018./3IPR violations lead to customer data loss, interruption of service, revenue loss, and reputational damage - each alone is a potential "end-of-life" occurrence for a small app development company. Common IPR violation scenarios include:* Copying of an App: Disregarding copyrights, a pirate will completely replicate an app but remove the digital rights management (DRM) component, enabling them to publish a copy of an app on illegitimate websites or legitimate app stores.* Extracting and Illegally Reusing App Content: Disregarding copyrights, a pirate will steal content from an app--sounds, animations, characters, video, and the like--and repurpose it elsewhere or within their own app.* Disabling an App's Locks or Advertising Keys: Disregarding copyrights, a pirate will change advertising keys to redirect ad revenue from a legitimate business to theirs. In other instances, they will remove locked functions like in-app purchases.* "Brand-Jacking" of an App: Disregarding copyrights, a pirate will inject malicious code into an app that collects users' private information and republishes a copy of the app. The republished app looks and functions like the original--often using the same name, logo, or graphics-ultimately luring customers who trust the brand into downloading the counterfeit app and putting their sensitive information at risk.* Misappropriation of a Trademark to Intentionally Confuse Users: Disregarding trademark rights, a pirate will seek to use an app's name or trademarked brand to trick users into providing their information to the pirate for exploitation.* Illegal Use of Patented Technology: A pirate will utilize patented technology in violation of the patent owner's rights. Our members commonly experience such infringement in both utility patents and design patents (e.g., graphical user interfaces).* Government Mandated Transfer of IPR to Gain Market Entry: A market regulator will impose joint venture requirements, foreign equity limitations, ambiguous regulations and/or regulatory approval processes, and other creative means (such as source code "escrowing") that force U.S. companies to transfer IPR to others in order to access their market.* Government Failure to Protect Trade Secrets: A pirate will intentionally steal a trade secret, and subsequently benefit from particular countries' lack of legal protections and/or rule of law. The victim of the theft will be unable to protect their rights through the legal system.Section 182 of the Trade Act requires USTR to identify countries that deny adequate and effective IPR protections./4The Trade Act also requires USTR to identify which countries, if any, are Priority Foreign Countries that demonstrate subpar IPR protections for U.S. companies and citizens./5Pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Trade Act,/6 the App Association is pleased to provide its recommendations to this year's Priority Watch List and Watch List. We support efforts by the U.S. government to protect American small businesses that rely on IPR to innovate and need certainty in the protection of their IPR abroad. We commit to partnership efforts with USTR to create responsible IPR protections across the globe to help our members enter new markets and create more U.S. jobs.II. Countries that Should Be on, or Remain on, USTR's Priority Watch ListA. ChinaTheft and infringement, which increasingly originates in China, puts our members' businesses and the jobs they create at serious risk. In many cases, a single IPR violation can represent an "end-of-life" scenario for small businesses and innovators. Numerous Chinese government laws and policies have a negative impact on our members, who have experienced IPR infringement in the Chinese market in each of the common scenarios described above. Overall, our members view the business environment in China as a continued challenge, largely driven by a lack of confidence in IPR protections.Notable examples include the Chinese government's application of the controversial "essential facilities" doctrine to IPR in the State Administration for Industry and Commerce's (SAIC)/7 Rules on Prohibition of Abusing Intellectual Property Rights to Eliminate or Restrict Competition (IP Abuse Rules), which took effect on August 1, 2015. Article 7 of SAIC's IP Abuse Rules states:Undertakings with dominant market position shall not, without justification, refuse other undertakings to license under reasonable terms their IPR, which constitutes an essential facility for business operation, to eliminate or restrict competition. Determination of the aforesaid conduct shall take into account the following factors:(i) whether the concerned IPR can't be reasonably substituted in the relevant market, which is necessary for other undertakings to compete in the relevant market;(ii) whether a refusal to license the IPR will adversely affect the competition or innovation of the relevant market, to the detriment of consumers' interest or public interests;(iii) whether the licensing of the IPR will not cause unreasonable damage to the licensing undertaking.The App Association does not support the notion that competitors should have access to "essential" patents (outside of the standardization context, as discussed below) because they allegedly cannot compete without such access, even in the rare cases where there is little damage to the IP holder, or consumer interests are allegedly harmed by lack of competition. This provision seriously undermines the fundamental right to exclude others from using one's intellectual property, and thus, affect incentives to innovate in the long term. Under this provision, U.S. innovators, particularly those with operations in China, are left vulnerable because SAIC uses significant discretion to balance the necessary factors to determine the issuance of a compulsory license.The App Association notes the critical differences between regular patents and standard-essential patents (SEPs), which must be considered separately. Generally, seamless interconnectivity is made possible by technological standards, such as Wi-Fi, LTE, and Bluetooth. Companies often collaborate to develop these standards by contributing their patented technologies. These technological standards, which are built through an open and consensus-based process, bring immense value to consumers by promoting interoperability while enabling healthy competition between innovators.When a patent holder lends its patented technology to a standard, it can result in a clear path to royalties in a market that likely would not have existed without the wide adoption of the standard. To balance this growth potential with the need to access the patents that support the standard, many standard development organizations (SDOs) require patent holders of standardized technologies to license their patents on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. FRAND commitments prevent the owners of SEPs, the patents needed to implement a standard, from exploiting the market power that results from the broad adoption of a standard. Once patented technologies are incorporated into a standard, manufacturers are compelled to use them to maintain product compatibility. In exchange for making a voluntary FRAND commitment with an SDO, SEP holders can obtain reasonable royalties from manufacturers that produce products compliant with the standard, who may not have existed absent the standard. Without a FRAND commitment, SEP holders would have the same power as a monopolist that faces no competition. In line with our members' core interests in this area, the App Association has established an initiative known as "All Things FRAND"/8 to assist policymakers, including USTR, in understanding SEP FRAND issues and developments; the App Association has further adopted and advocates for several key consensus principles to prevent patent "hold up" and anti-competitive conduct which are available on the All Things FRAND website./9Specific to China and SEPs, the App Association acknowledges that certain entities like the Standardization Administration of China have attempted to publish policies that would have instructed Chinese-backed standardization bodies to lower or undermine royalty payments for patents, without differentiating between FRAND-encumbered SEPs and other patents. With assistance from the international community, such efforts have been thwarted. Today, SAIC's IPR Rules appropriately recognize that it may be an abuse of dominance for SEP holders to eliminate or restrict competition, "such as by refusing to license, tying or imposing other unreasonable trading terms, in violation of fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory principle." In contrast to its policies on patents generally, SAIC's treatment of FRAND-encumbered SEPs is consistent with an emerging consensus on how to deal with serious breaches of FRAND commitments. We strongly urge USTR to ensure that it does not conflate general patent licensing issues with the unique set of issues and global competition law consensus specific to SEPs./10In addition, small app businesses depend on customer trust to grow and create more jobs, an endeavor that can only be maintained through the use of the strongest technical protection mechanisms (TPM) available, including encryption. In cross-sector and sector-specific contexts, the Chinese government continues to threaten the ability to utilize TPMs, primarily encryption. Not only do these requirements jeopardize our members' ability to protect their IPR, but they threaten the integrity and security of the digital economy.More broadly, numerous policies in place today or proposed in China create significant market access issues for App Association members who all rely on IPR. Such measures include restrictions on cross-border data flows and data localization requirements effected through China's Cybersecurity Law (CSL); vague restrictions and requirements placed on "network providers" with further issues created through standards and measures developed by the Cybersecurity Administration of China pursuant to the CSL; source code disclosure mandates; and foreign direct investment restrictions.The App Association acknowledges that the Chinese judicial system has made some positive steps that lend to increased certainty in IPR protection (e.g., the establishment of specialized IPR courts in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shanghai; and the standing up of various IP tribunals). Further, the National People's Congress (NPC) is considering changes to the China Patent Law,/11 on which the App Association has provided detailed comments directly to the NPC. Even further, recent agreements between the United States and Chinese government includes commitments to improve IPR enforcement in China./12However, across patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secrets, enforcement is often poor and usually unreliable. Due to the continued high amount of infringement originating from China, as well as numerous policies and laws that enable IPR infringement or are selectively enforced, we strongly recommend China remain on the Priority Watch List.B. IndiaIndia represents an immense opportunity for American small business tech and software development companies. However, App Association members continue to experience a wide range of IPR infringement and lack of legal redress, despite ongoing (incomplete) efforts across Indian ministries and courts that appear to lend themselves to a more consistent and reliable IPR regime in the country. Ongoing problems in this key market include but are not limited to:* A marked lack of copyright protections and enforcement;* A failure to provide consistent protection for trade secrets across India; and* Data storage and processing localization requirements imposed on small businesses that can require unfettered access to data (including IP).), a non-starter for App Association members.Certain steps indicate the Indian government's willingness to adequately protect IPR. For example, the Indian government undertook efforts to further its commitment to formally establish a copyright royalty board and appoint a functional IP Appellate Property Board. Under the Finance Act of 2017, the informal Copyright Board merged with the Intellectual Property Appellate Board. As a result, applications for copyrights increased by 78 percent from 2016-2017, compared to 2015-2016./13As of May 20, 2016, the Indian government established additional commercial courts, advancing the 2015 Commercial Courts Act,/14 which the App Association perceives as further evidence of India's commitment to enhance its IPR procedures. Further, India acceded to the WIPO Internet Treaties in July 2018 (namely the WIPO Copyright Treaty and WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty). The Indian government also appears committed to the IPR Task Force announced by the Maharashatra Government. As of January 24, 2018, Cell for IPR Promotion and Management (CIPAM) and Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) have made an IPR Enforcement Toolkit for Police, and there have been 26 programs dedicated to training police officers on IP enforcement. Despite this positive movement, App Association members experience weak and ineffective enforcement in India.Further, numerous hurdles to market access, either in place today or proposed, restrict market access for App Association members that reply on IPR, including but not limited to data localization requirements and in-country cybersecurity testing mandates.The App Association believes it is necessary that India remain on the Priority Watch list because the country still needs to create an adequate IPR system including increased participation in international IP treaties and implementing strong enforcement to provide needed certainty to our members seeking to enter the Indian market.C. IndonesiaWhile the Indonesian government has taken steps improve IPR enforcement, Indonesia continues to present challenges with respect to IPR protections and enforcement mechanisms that translate into a barrier to entry for U.S. small business innovators in the Indonesian market. For example, its revision of Indonesian trademark law in November 2016 demonstrates a positive step forward to advance the rights of trademark holders through shorter examination times and better criteria for protected marks. Further, Indonesia joined the Madrid Protocol in January 2018.However, there are still ongoing concerns with whether the recent provisions will be adequately enforced and there has been minimal progress in integrating USTR's suggested reforms in its 2018 review. For example, Indonesia has apparently not yet created a specialized IPR unit within its National Police to enforce against Indonesian criminal syndicates that create counterfeit and pirated marks and works. Indonesia's 2016 revisions to its Patent Law continue to raise concern. Indonesia's revised Patent Law included localization rules that require foreign patentees to transfer proprietary technologies to local companies, which, in effect, force American companies to products in Indonesia to protect their rights. Certainty in enforcement is lacking, and continues to present challenges.Further, numerous hurdles to market access, either in place today or proposed, restrict market access for App Association members that rely on IPR, including but not limited to various local presence requirements; data localization requirements for public sector data; and - of highest concern to the App Association - amendments to Indonesia's Harmonized Tariff Schedule to categorize "software and other digital products transmitted electronically," setting the stage for subjecting e-commerce to customs duties. We also continue to seek information on a new E-Commerce Regulation, issued in November 2019, that may impose restrictions on the flow of data across Indonesian borders and local presence requirements.Based on the above, the App Association recommends Indonesia remain on USTR's Priority Watch List.D. RussiaThe Russian market continues to present a massive challenge to App Association members. Unfortunately, Russia has continued to foster an environment that permits extensive software piracy. The Russian government does not appear to be committed to making any systemic changes to protect IPR.Further, numerous hurdles to market access, either in place today or proposed, restrict market access for App Association members that rely on IPR. Russia has imposed data localization requirements through Federal Law No. 242-FZ; banned the use of virtual private networks (VPNs); and undermined encryption through mandates for the installation of sweeping and unfettered surveillance capabilities in internet service providers' networks. Even more recently, Russia has moved to adopt requirements for the pre-installation of Russian-developed software apps on consumer devices, presenting even greater concern for App Association members.The App Association therefore urges USTR to keep Russia on the Priority Watch List.E. ThailandThailand continues to facilitate an environment where counterfeit and pirated software markets thrive because of limited legal enforcement mechanisms and a lack of rule of law. The App Association is encouraged by reports of the Thai government's attempts to employ strong commitment to address this growing concern (e.g., the establishment of specialized IP courts), but our members continue to face challenges.The Thai government should also remain committed to address its extraordinary backlog of patent applications. In November 2017, the Thai government announced that it intended to provide more resources to combat this concern,/15 and we continue to seek evidence of a meaningful impact.The App Association therefore encourages USTR to keep Thailand on its Watch List.A. VietnamVietnam continues to present challenges to App Association members with respect to IPR policies and enforcement, where inadequate frameworks and inconsistent enforcement undermine confidence. With respect to market access, Vietnam has enacted rules that impose data localization requirements and restrictions on encryption. Even more recently, Vietnam's new Cybersecurity Law, containing many of the same requirements as China's Cybersecurity Law discussed above, went into effect, further disincentivizing market entry.The App Association therefore encourages USTR to keep Vietnam on its Priority Watch List.III. ConclusionThe App Association appreciates the opportunity to submit these comments to USTR, and we commit to work with all stakeholders to address the above concerns to create a prosperous U.S. economy.Sincerely,Brian ScarpelliSenior Global Policy CounselAlexandra McLeodPolicy CounselACT | The App Association, 1401 K St NW (Ste 501)Washington, DC 20005* * *Footnotes:1/ 84 Fed.

Coronavirus could impede U.S. trade with China, experts sayUPIFebruary 3, 2020 Monday 3:00 AM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 690 wordsByline: JESSIE HIGGINSDateline: Feb. 3 BodyThe spread of the coronavirus through China is raising concern among American shipping ports and industries that rely on trade with the world's most populous nation.The Chinese government has forced factories and businesses to close to slow the spread of the disease. There is no telling how much the virus will impact China's consumer demand, even after the forced holiday ends."One of the things we're hearing is that it's possible some of their factories may remain closed until the virus is contained," said Noel Hacegaba, the deputy executive director for the Port of Long Beach in California. "That means marine cargo won't be moving. It won't be leaving China. It won't flow into the United States."That also means China will not receive American goods, Hacegaba added.Typically, agricultural products -- like soybeans -- are the most frequent items shipped through the Port of Long Beach, Hacegaba said. Other leading exports to China include aircraft, machinery, electrical machinery, medical instruments and vehicles, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative.The disruption comes at a time when industries were expecting trade with China to pick up. President  and Chinese government leaders on Jan. 15 signed a phase one trade deal -- the first step toward ending an 18-month trade war between the two countries.As part of the deal, China promised to purchase $200 billion of American goods, including $40 billion in agricultural products. Such purchases would offer relief to U.S. businesses, like soybean growers and other agricultural interests, that have seen demand fall and prices plummet during the trade war."Anything that can impact China's ability to make these commitments is something we should pay attention to," said John Newton, chief economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation.Newton said it was too soon to speculate on how much the coronavirus will impact agricultural trade in the coming months. At the federal level, for example, agencies still are assessing the situation.As U.S. Commerce Secretary  "made clear, the first step is to bring the virus under control and help the victims of this disease," a Department of Commerce representative said in an email."It is also important to consider the ramifications of doing business with a country that has a long history of covering up real risks to its own people and the rest of the world. Fortunately, the Department of Commerce is equipped to support the American people and our businesses to do both."The Chinese government mandated that all factories remain closed until at least the beginning of this week. Other provincial governments have extended the forced holiday until Feb. 10, said Rajiv Biswas, the  chief economist at IHS Markit, a global analytics and information company based in London.Factories already were closed last week for the Lunar New Year celebration, Biswas said."There will be a big impact on trade because of the long period of forced holiday," Biswas said. "The next question is, how will this impact demand in China?"In the immediate future, the factory closures will reduce China's demand for imported materials because plants that aren't operating won't need supplies, Biswas said.The longer term impact is less clear. So far, the rapid spread of the disease has dramatically slowed commerce in China, he said."It's escalating so rapidly," said Biswas, who is based in Singapore. "There is a great deal of fear because there is not a good understanding of how to contain it. Now, because people are in this state of fear, they don't want to go out. They're staying home. They won't be buying as many things."It is too soon to tell what markets will be most affected, Biswas said. A lot depends on how quickly the virus spread can be contained. Work is underway on a vaccine, but how soon one could be developed is not known."Even if they have a vaccine, it would take months to actually produce enough vaccines for the whole country," Biswas said. "China has 1.3 billion people. The logistics of creating a vaccine to that kind of scale is immense. I don't think this can be stopped anytime soon."Load-Date: February 3, 2020End of Document

Coronavirus crisis puts China's weakened economy under pressureCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 28, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 592 wordsBodyThe Chinese government's extraordinary efforts to contain the coronavirus, which has led to confine the population of an entire province and is leaving empty cinemas and passengerless trains, put the weakened Chinese economy under pressure.The world's second largest economy is increasingly dependent on its consumers and the virus came at its worst, in the midst of the New Year holiday, when hundreds of millions of people are displacing across the country.Last year, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at its slower pace in three decades, affected by weak demand and the trade war with the United States.And even though the last three months point to a recovery, thanks also to the commercial truce with Washington, the coronavirus will "undoubtedly" have an impact, according to Julian Evans-Pritchard, of Capital Economics, particularly on transport and consumption.The holidays were extended by three days, which means that the country will only return to full activity from next Monday.Some companies asked their employees to work from home, such as technology giant Tencent, whose employees will work until February 10.Popular restaurant chain Haidilao will close all its restaurants in China until the end of January.The government also banned domestic and international group travel, a decision that could have a strong impact on tourism, an industry that accounts for 11% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).On Tuesday, the authorities called on all Chinese governments to suspend organized travel abroad "to protect the health and safety of Chinese and foreign people."Air and rail traffic on the first day of the New Year fell more than 40% compared to last year, the deputy transport minister said.In addition, more than 2,000 high-speed trains were suspended for days or weeks.On the other hand, the number of viewers in cinemas is only one-tenth in this period of what it was last year and the premieres of seven major productions planned during the holidays were postponed.According to S&P;, consumption contributed to 3.5% of growth in China in 2019, down from 10% to a 1.2 percentage point drop in GDP.The province most affected is Hubei, epicenter of the coronavius, where train stations and shops are closed in many places.In addition to consumption and transportation, closure could have a long-term impact on the industry.Hubei's capital, Wuhan is a major manufacturing hub for 11 million people producing steel and cars and since last Thursday it has been in indefinite quarantine."Wuhan is an important manufacturing hub in central China. If the confinement continues after the New Year's holiday, it will affect industrial production, one of the main engines of growth," said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for China at ANZ Research.Wuhan accounts for 1.6% of China's GDP, according to S&P;.In addition, some 160 Japanese companies have offices in the city, according to the Japanese Chamber of Commerce of Wuhan.Several vehicle manufacturers, including General Motors and Renault, produce vehicles in the city through co-enterprises with Chinese companies.According to Changliang Daily, the value of Wuhan's automotive production is about 400 billion yuan ($57 billion), with an estimated production in 2018 of 1.7 million vehicles.The coronavirus crisis lends itself to comparisons with SARS respiratory syndrome in 2003, which killed 650 people in China and Hong Kong.According to Evans-Pritchard, the new virus spreadsSARS, in a context where the number of passengers traveling abroad has tripled for 17 years.jug-rox/lth/dan/pc/zmLoad-Date: January 29, 2020End of Document

MALAYSIA STANDS BY CLAIM TO INCREASE SOUTH CHINA SEA TERRITORYStates News ServiceJanuary 3, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 717 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Malaysia stands by its request to extend its boundary farther into the South China Sea, Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah told reporters Friday, acknowledging Chinese opposition to the move and the potential for the case to lead to arbitration before the United Nations.The government submitted a claim to the U.N. on Dec. 12 to increase Malaysia's continental shelf beyond the standard 200 nautical miles off the northernmost point of Malaysian Borneo, according to submission documents viewed by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.In 2009, Malaysia and Vietnam jointly petitioned the U.N. to extend their boundaries into the South China Sea, in an area between their respective Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs)."We expected China to object, but it is our claim and we will maintain our claim," Saifuddin told reporters in Putrajaya, Malaysia's administrative capital."One, there will always be dispute[s], just like there are certain areas in the South China Sea where there will always be dispute[s]. Second, the end game, which rarely happens, you go for arbitration."Shortly after Malaysia filed submission documents last month under the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), China protested with the same language it used since as early as 2016 to state its case to the United Nations."China has internal waters, territorial sea and a contiguous zone based on its Nanhai Zhudao," the Chinese mission said in a note to the U.N., referring to its islands in the South China Sea."China has an exclusive economic zone and continental shelf," the note said, according to the South China Morning Post. "China has historic rights in the South China Sea."The statement mirrors language in a Chinese government statement on its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea published on July 12, 2016.China claims almost all of the South China Sea, a vital waterway for international shipping and trade, while Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Taiwan have their own overlapping claims to portions of the disputed waters.In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines over China, saying there was no legal basis for Beijing to claim historical rights in the sea region.On Dec. 20, Saifuddin questioned China's claim to nearly all of the sea."It is our sovereign right to claim whatever is there within our waters and which is not claimed by others," he said at the time. "For China that the whole of the South China Sea belongs to them, I think that is ridiculous."On Friday, a reporter asked Saifuddin whether the Malaysian government feared any retaliation from China, such as through sanctions."If we fear that, we wouldn't submit our claim," he responded.The Malaysian move came months after Saifuddin traveled to Beijing where he and his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, agreed to establish a "bilateral consultative mechanism" to resolve differences in the South China Sea. During the September 2019 visit, Saifuddin said he would co-chair a joint dialogue panel with Wang, who said the panel would promote maritime cooperation and regional stability.Meanwhile, an analyst linked to a Japanese university told Voice of America that Kuala Lumpur could be seeking to get more aid from Beijing while expanding its South China Sea foothold."They're looking at all this really hard-core pressure against the Chinese and seeing it's a potential strategic window to probably exploit more financial aid, more development aid from China," said Stephen Nagy, senior associate politics and international studies professor at International Christian University in Tokyo."They're exerting the pressure at the right time, understanding it's in line with the other states in the region rather than being an outlier," he told VOA, which pointed out that rivals of China were resisting its expansion in the region and, in some cases, were receiving military aid from the United States.On Friday, a reporter asked Saifuddin whether the Malaysian government feared any retaliation from China, such as through sanctions."If we fear that, we wouldn't submit our claim," he responded.Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: January 4, 2020End of Document

Global Temporary Power Industry; The global market for Temporary Power is projected to reach US$8 billion by 2025, driven by the growth in construction projects and the need for site preparation with the necessary infrastructure that includes electrical power supply.GlobeNewswireJanuary 24, 2020 Friday 3:46 AM PTCopyright 2020 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENTLength: 5542 wordsBodyNew York, Jan.  24, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report "Global Temporary Power Industry" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p05799785/?utm_source=GNW Temporary power is critical for construction projects to power onsite construction machinery and tools such as powered tools, and lighting etc. required to support the construction activities, site workforce and equipment. Residential construction, commercial construction and public works require electricity to be delivered onsite. Temporary power can be provided in two basic configurations i.e. overhead and underground. Long-term projects with higher electrical loads and safety issues often require underground provision of temporary power via underground placement of electrical cables, trenching, and wiring. The market is therefore benefiting from the recovering construction activity in most countries across the global and the huge opportunities in the retrofit market driven by global 'green' building standards will also influence growth in the market. Recovery in construction which began in 2011 in the aftermath of the great recession is continuing even today, albeit with slight bumps and turns. This is largely because of the success with which the industry has and continues to evolve and adapt to changes in labor availability, technology and economic turmoil. Digital technologies for concept, design, engineering and building; rise of AR/VR in digital construction; connected construction; smart on-site equipment; increase in modular and prefabricated construction; use of Building Information Monitoring (BIM), automation , robotics, AI, Drones and 3D Printing etc. have helped the industry fight the changing economic realities and remain afloat. Healthy outlook for global investments in construction technologies (Contech) also bodes well for the overall outlook for the construction industry in 2020. - The rise of smart cities will emerge as the single most important factor driving demand for temporary power in the construction industry. Growth of megacities will fuel residential and infrastructure construction projects worldwide. The over 9,280 ongoing megacity construction projects worldwide create robust demand temporary job site power. Dubai flaunts the highest megacity pipeline project value and will remain an attractive market for temporary power solutions. In addition to construction, demand for temporary power solutions and services is also benefiting from the increase in trade shows/fairs, exhibitions, conventions and special events being organized. Growing competition and increased focus on innovation and new product development are stepping up the importance of showcasing products and services to leverage new business opportunities. Number of exhibition venues globally stands at an approximate 1,300 covering over 36.8 million sqm of space. The scenario benefits demand for temporary electrical power supply and distribution to support digital display areas, special lighting, sales demos and presentations, live entertainment production and operation of equipment such as lifts, scissor lifts and forklifts, among others. The United States, Europe, Latin America. Middle East and Africa represent large markets worldwide with a combined share of 76% of the market. China ranks as one of fastest growing markets with a CAGR of 12.8% over the analysis period supported by the Chinese government's plans to step up infrastructure investment as a way of boosting its slowing economy. - Competitors identified in this market include, among others, Aggreko Ltd., APR Energy, Ashtead Group Plc., Atlas Copco AB, Caterpillar Inc., Cummins Inc., Diamond Environmental Services LLC, Herc Rentals Inc., Kohler Co., Rental Solutions & Services LLC, Smart Energy Solutions, Speedy Hire Plc, Temp-Power Inc., Trinity Power Rentals Inc., United Rentals Inc.Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05799785/?utm_source=GNW TEMPORARY POWER MCP15 MARKET ANALYSIS, TRENDS, AND FORECASTS, JANUARY 2 CONTENTS  I.

WhatsApp seized on US allegations against Huawei to defend encryption against the government's demands for backdoorsBusiness Insider USFebruary 13, 2020 Thursday 06:34 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 656 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Isobel Asher Hamilton)Highlight: WhatsApp and its parent company Facebook have been fighting off US demands to build methods for law enforcement to infiltrate encrypted messaging.BodyKyodo News via Getty Image• Earlier this week US officials accused Chinese tech giant Huawei of spying for the Chinese government by using telecoms backdoors designed for use by law enforcement.• WhatsApp seized on the story as an example of why it shouldn't build backdoors in its encrypted messaging for law enforcement.• WhatsApp and its parent company Facebook have been fighting off US government demands to build methods for law enforcement to infiltrate encrypted messaging.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.The US government may have shot itself in the foot in its ongoing struggle to make tech companies give it access to encrypted messages and devices.The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that            US officials accused Chinese tech giant Huawei of spying through backdoors built in telecoms equipment intended for use by law enforcement.Although the US has long accused Huawei of spying for the Chinese government, this was the first time it gave a specific detail about how it thinks the company does this, saying it had built equipment capable of tapping into "lawful interception interfaces," backdoors purposefully left in telecoms equipment so it can gain access.Huawei has repeatedly denied spying for China, and refuted the specific allegations made in the Journal piece, calling them a "smokescreen."Now a major US tech company is using the government's Huawei allegations to push back against it.Head of WhatsApp, Will Cathcart did an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, announcing that the            Facebook-owned messaging platform has hit 2 billion users. Cathcart also stressed that WhatsApp plans to hold the line against pressure from the US government to            build ways to infiltrate WhatsApp encrypted messaging for law enforcement.A WhatsApp spokesperson specifically pointed the Journal to the Huawei case as an example why WhatsApp shouldn't grant the government's wish. The argument runs that backdoors pose a broad security risk as even if they only intended to be used by law enforcement, they could be exploited by other malicious actors.Privacy experts also worry backdoors could be used as tools for mass surveillance by authoritarian regimes."The US government's concern about possible backdoors in Huawei-built networks only underscores why it is untenable for the government to demand that US-based tech companies create backdoors for domestic law enforcement agencies," Andrew Crocker, Senior Staff Attorney at the digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Business Insider in a statement. "Once built, these mechanisms can be co-opted by governments around the world." Facebook isn't the only tech company fending off demands to break encryption. Apple also tangled with the government in 2015 when the FBI demanded it help the agency break into a shooter's iPhone. Apple refused, and eventually the FBI dropped its court case against the company, after saying it had found a third party capable of helping it open the phone.Last month, the FBI made a similar request which Apple once again denied,            prompting President Trump to lash out at the company on Twitter.NOW WATCH: 62 new emoji and emoji variations were just finalized, including a bubble tea emoji and a transgender flag. Here's how everyday people submit their own emoji.See Also:• WhatsApp has hit 2 billion users, and it's pushing back hard against the US government for demanding a way to break encryption• The US says Huawei has been spying through 'back doors' designed for law enforcement - which is what the US has been pressuring tech companies to do for years• Facebook employees reportedly feel guilty that the company didn't fix a known security risk fast enough to prevent its biggest data breach everSEE ALSO: WhatsApp has hit 2 billion users, and it's pushing back hard against the US government for demanding a way to break encryptionLoad-Date: February 13, 2020End of Document

China denies involvement in US mass data theft caseCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 11, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 501 wordsBodyChina on Tuesday denied its involvement in a case of massive data theft in the United States after four Chinese military were indicted by US justice.In 2017, personal data was stolen from 145 million people from Equifax, a US credit agency, Justice Minister Bill Barr said Monday.Equifax is a company that collects the personal data of consumers who ask for a credit to assess their creditworthiness.After two years of investigations, four people (Wu Zhiyong, Wang Qian, Xu Ke and Liu Lei) were blamed last week in Atlanta for criminal organization to commit computer fraud, economic espionage and communications fraud.All four are suspected members of a Chinese army investigative unit and are in China, so they cannot be arrested.They are accused of taking advantage of a ruling in the program used by Equifax on their litigation resolution website.Once they entered the agency's computer system, they managed to obtain names, dates of birth and social security numbers of 147 million people, according to the indictment."This theft not only caused significant financial damage to Equifax but (...) substantial costs and burdens were imposed on all those who had to take steps to protect themselves against the usurpation of their identity," the Minister of Justice said.China flatly denied the allegations on Monday and said she was a "big advocate for cybersecurity.""The Chinese government and the military, as well as those associated with it, never performed or participated in thefts of trade secrets over the internet," said Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry.The United States has attributed several cyberattacks to China, such as access to a Marriott hotel group database in 2018.According to Bill Barr, there were also "state-supported computer intrusions against industrial secrets and confidential economic information."The Minister of Justice also mentioned open research in the nuclear, aeronautics or metallurgical sectors.According to him, 80% of open investigations in recent years by economic espionage involve the Chinese government and 60% of cases of theft of trade secrets are related to China.Geng Shuang, for his part, accused the United States of being the first cyberespionage manager in the world, with "large-scale, organized and undifferentiated surveillance" of foreign governments, businesses and individuals."Of the WikiLeaks cases to Edward Snowden's, America's hypocrisy and double standards of cybersecurity have long been clear," the Chinese spokesman said.Despite Equifax's data theft, experts saw no data for sale on the black market.The company was in turn investigated because the bug that allowed entry into the system was identified two months before the theft but was not corrected.The agency received criticism for its insufficient security systems and because it took time to uncover the theft. The case led to the resignation of its president, Richard Smith.In July Equifax agreed to pay at least $575 million for the case.chp-ehl/bar/cf/pc/zmLoad-Date: February 12, 2020End of Document

Equities Futures Look to Higher Opening on Optimism About China Response to CoronavirusMT Newswires Live Briefs PROJanuary 24, 2020 Friday 9:06 AM ESTCopyright 2020 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 306 wordsBody Stock futures pointed to a higher open on Friday as investor concerns ease over the outbreak of the coronavirus in China and economic data in Europe showed signs of growth.The World Health Organization on Thursday said it does not yet consider the outbreak a global health crisis. China's government earlier Friday widened its restrictions on travel to 35 million people.The Chinese government has said there are 830 confirmed cases of the virus, and 26 people have died from it. Cases have also been reported in Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and the US.IHS Markit Purchasing Managers Index surveys showed private sector services growth in Germany and an improvement in manufacturing. Services data in the UK returned to positive territory while manufacturing improved, according to the firm.In the US. Intel (INTC) was 4.8% higher in pre-market trading after the chipmaker late Thursday reported better-than-expected quarterly results and a dividend increase.Broadcom (AVGO) was 3.2% higher after it said late Thursday that it had reached a deal with Apple (AAPL) to supply components to the computer giant through 2023. Apple was up 0.3%. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) , a Broadcom competitor, was 0.9% lower.American Express (AXP) gained 2.2% after the payment processor and credit-card card company early Friday reported fourth-quarter results that beat expectations.Walt Disney (DIS) shed 0.7% after it said it will shut its Shanghai park due to the coronavirus until further notice. The closure comes amid the seven-day Lunar New Year holiday in China, which is a peak time for the resort. A holiday celebration in Beijing also was canceled in a bid to keep the disease contained.Dow futures were up more than 0.2% while Standard & Poor's 500 Futures added nearly 0.2%. Nasdaq futures were up almost 0.3%.Load-Date: January 25, 2020End of Document

These are just some of the banned games in ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 25, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 795 wordsBody       "Devotion", one of the victimsThe Chinese government has always endeaved for the stability and protection of its society. And such is the zeal that its protectionism ends up becoming explicit censorship. Measures such as limiting the use of video games for a limit of 90 minutesa day, not playing between 10 pm and 8 in the morning seem, at first glance, accurate. Banning gambling on 18-year-olds imposes a much more aggressive and unfortunate cultural reading.But outside these laws, the key lies in the cultural biases to which the General Administration puts its citizens: many games never get to stack the starting grid. Games that here, in Spain and the West in general, we enjoy without cutters. These are some of the banned publications without invitation to debate.Devotion and Devotion'Devotion'and'Detention'are two games that faced front censorship as soon as they were published. The study then decided to remove its pieces and subject them to a "quality check", a euphemism to study which parts they would remove or refine. The games disappeared from Steam and Red Candle Games, the Taiwanese studio, kept quiet for months.In the manner of PT or Layers of Fear, Devotion explored family terrors, ghosts of the past and worship plaking the pain, while Detention explores the experiences of two students trapped at GreenwoodHigh School while paranormal phenomena occur. Beating under their shadows, both possess an important social burden. Although the former is no longer available to purchase, Detention can be purchased and played on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.Luckily, both games are now part of the Harvard-Yenching library, on the occasion of their cultural preservation. Founded in 1928, this Chinese-Japanese library is the largest in East Asia maintained and coordinated by an American university.Football also offendsWho would tell Oliver and Benji that''Football Manager 2005'was once censored for 'harming the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country'. But it did.The Chinese ministry ordered culture departments across the country to "investigate, confiscate and punish websites, software markets and cybercafés, to broadcast or sell Football Manager 2005". Delirious. The reason, as rare as it may seem, lies in the low statistical values of chinese players.This war is very bitchy.The censorship story of 'Battlefield 4' is, at the very least, comical. The DLCmultiplayer'China Rising'raised blisters and the country's government accused Electronic Arts of threatening national security by attacking the country's culture by tarracing the image of the Chinese army and its military history. Instead of blocking the expansion, the government banned the marketing of the entire game.A situation analogous to that lived with'I.G.I.-2: CovertStrike','Hearts of Iron',and'Command &ConquerGenerals;'. These three games, like so many other films or comics, are part of a group of cultural products censored for "distorting history and damaging China's sovereignty and territorial integrity." Did anyone stress that these video games are works of fiction intended for pure entertainment?Being gay: almost a crimeAnd, while we could open up discussion about social influence andcultural elcolonialism of certain war games, Chinese censorship did not only deal with war affairs. Those of the heart also knock at the door of government ministries.TheSims 3was censored for its libertine tone. Although homosexuality is not a crime in China, something that in the Russian government receives even greater retaliation, the truth is that there are strict rules regarding the exposure of "gay content" encine, television and other audiovisual formats. And of course, in The Sims you can begay, but also a two-meter alien and have a chalet with several Olympic pools in the backyard.Too sexy for the bodyAnd if we remove the homo ingredient from the recipe, the sexy is also seen with bad eyes. "RapeLay"and"Grand Theft Auto V"were censored for their sexually explicit content.The first because it is a festival of curves and visual onanism; the second to contain a sex scene that we will describe as unconventional, duly truncated by a careful visual montage - in Rockstar they don't have a hair of fools and always dance in that thin line between the suggested and the explicit. Be that as it may, the game cannot be purchased in storesin a "natural" way, you have to resort to import.The religious questionSome time ago we covered the different censorship practices in religious matters. While these games are not prohibited, if they have been forced to trim and modify their content in order to be published, such as theWorld of Warcraftitself. Anyway, the Chinese state dad doesn't see such good eyes as creative debauchery.Load-Date: February 27, 2020End of Document

TikTok Shares Transparency Report Amid Suspicions of Chinese CensorshipBillboardJanuary 3, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Prometheus Global Media, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; TAGLength: 392 wordsByline: Chris EggertsenHighlight: TikTok released its first-ever transparency report on Monday (Dec. 30) in a seeming effort to combat claims that the video-sharing app -- which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance -- has been complying with content takedown requests from the Chinese government.BodyTikTok released its first-ever transparency report on Monday in a seeming effort to combat claims that the video-sharing app -- which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance -- has been complying with content takedown requests from the Chinese government and the country's ruling Communist party.The report, which covers the first six months of 2019, lists a total of 278 requests for user data and content removal from 28 countries during that time period, including a total of 110 from India, 74 from the U.S. and 31 from Japan. China is not one of the countries listed.In a blog post announcing the report, TikTok’s director of public policy Eric Ebenstein laid out the rationale behind its release.“To foster candid dialogue essential to earning and maintaining trust, we're releasing our first Transparency Report this year to show how we responsibly engage with government bodies in the markets where TikTok operates,” he wrote.Later in the post, Ebenstein states that TikTok will begin regularly releasing these reports, with one covering the second half of 2019 “to follow in the coming months.”Monday’s report additionally includes data on takedown notices from copyright holders, of which 3,345 were lodged in the first six months of 2019. According to the company, 85 percent of these requests were honored.TikTok has come under intense scrutiny for its relationship to China in recent months, partially stemming from a Washington Post report that indicated the app had been censoring content related to pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.Weeks later, multiple outlets reported that the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) had opened an inquiry into ByteDance’s $1 billion acquisition of the U.S.-based app Musical.ly in 2017. The CFIUS -- which reviews foreign investment in U.S. companies for possible national security risks -- had reportedly engaged in talks with TikTok about divesting from Musical.ly, which was absorbed into the TikTok platform in August 2018. In a statement sent to Billboard at the time, a TikTok spokesperson stated, "While we cannot comment on ongoing regulatory processes, TikTok has made clear that we have no higher priority than earning the trust of users and regulators in the US. Part of that effort includes working with Congress and we are committed to doing so.”Link to ImageLoad-Date: January 5, 2020End of Document

CHINESE AUTHORITIES STILL HOLDING FIVE TIBETAN MONKS ARRESTED IN NOVEMBERStates News ServiceJanuary 6, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 520 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in western China's Sichuan province are continuing to hold in detention seven people, including four monks who were arrested in November after scattering pro-independence leaflets in front of a Chinese government building.The monks, identified as Kunsal, 20, Tsultrim, 18, Tamey, 18, and Soeta, 18, were seized in their rooms at Dza Wonpo Ganden Shedrub monastery in the Kardze (in Chinese, Ganzi) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.The group had allegedly scattered hundreds of leaflets on Nov. 7 in the courtyard of the Chinese administrative office in the Dza Wonpo village of Dza Mey township in Sershul.On Nov.18 another monk named Nimey was taken into custody after posting online expressions of support for those held.A few days later on Nov. 21, Nimey's brother Choegyal and another person named Yonten shouted support for Tibetan independence in front of a Chinese police station. They were also detained.The seven are still being detained, Jampa Yonten, a monk at India's Sera monasterytold RFA, citing sources in the region.Between Nov. 24 and Jan. 3, Jampa Yonten learned from his sources that the Dza Mey local government had arrested around 30 people, including monks, on different charges, keeping them detained for more than a month.According to Jampa Yonten, the arrested were charged for activities like using social media, displaying pictures of the Dalai Lama, or having contact with people outside Tibet.He said the 30 were fed only barley flour during their detention. They were given political re-education classes for half a month and authorities threatened to punish the masses severely if they were to involve themselves in any political activities, he added.Police raid WonpoMobile phones of Tibetans living in Wonpo Township and other nearby Townships were searched by Chinese and many were summoned to the police station, interrogated and later forced to sign certain documents, Jampa Yonten told RFA, citing his Tibetan sources.Following the incident, armed Chinese security forces poured into the Tibetan township and patrolled the streets causing fear among the local Tibetan resident, he said.An RFA source in Tibet sent photo evidence of Chinese security forces patrolling Wonpo. The source said the presence of armed Chinese personnel is restricting the free movement of Tibetans there.According to the RFA source, the Chinese security force were in the town between Nov. 7 and Dec. 12, but they have since withdrawn.Already tightly restricted following widespread protests in Tibetan regions in 2008, Dza Wonpo monastery drew increased police scrutiny in 2012 when monks refused to hoist Chinese national flags on the monastery's roofs, and an ensuing crackdown led to scores of arbitrary detentions, arrests, and searches of Tibetan homes, sources told RFA in earlier reports.Tibetans say Chinese authorities regularly restrict their political activities and peaceful expression of ethnic and religious identity in the Tibetan region, and subject them to persecution, torture, imprisonment, and extrajudicial killings.Load-Date: January 7, 2020End of Document

HRW calls on global community to combat China's threat to human rightsUPIJanuary 15, 2020 Wednesday 4:30 AM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 583 wordsByline: DARRYL COOTEDateline: Dec. 31 BodyThe Chinese government poses a threat to the rights of people worldwide, non-governmental organization Human Rights Watch said, calling on the international community to band together to counter Beijing's attacks.In HRW's annual 2020 report analyzing the world's human rights situation, its executive director, , warned that since China sees human rights as an existential threat, how it combats that threat jeopardizes the rights and freedoms of the rest of the world."At home, the Chinese Communist Party, worried that permitting political freedom would jeopardize its grasp on power, has constructed an Orwellian high-tech surveillance state and a sophisticated Internet censorship system to monitor and suppress public criticism," wrote Roth. "Abroad, it uses its growing economic clout to silence critics and carry out the most intense attack on the global system for enforcing human rights since the system began to emerge in the mid-20th century."Roth -- who was recently denied entry to Hong Kong by China -- wrote other countries also pose threats to human rights but the Asian nation stands out for undermining worldwide institutions that protect rights and freedoms as it attempts to avoid international criticism for its suppression within its borders.China is building a network of "cheerleader states" that depend upon it for aid and business while punishing those that cross it, he said, urging the international community to repel its attempts to undermine the human rights system."If not challenged, Beijing's actions portend a dystopian future in which no one is beyond the reach of Chinese censors, and an international human rights system so weakened that it no longer serves as a check on government repression," he said.Roth also chastised the United Nations, specifically its secretary general, , for being unwilling to demand China end its mass detention of some 1 million ethnic Muslims under the pretense of counterterrorism while praising it for its economic progress."Unless we want to return to an era in which people are pawns to be manipulated or discarded according to the whims of their overlords, the Chinese government's attack on the international human rights system must be resisted," Roth wrote. "Now is the time to take a stand."Secretary of State  echoed some of these fears, albeit tempered, on Tuesday during a speech on Silicon Valley and national security, stating that they must make sure American technology isn't used by China's "Orwellian surveillance state.""We need to make sure American principles aren't sacrificed for prosperity," he said.China responded to Pompeo's comments, stating it urged the United States to let go of its "consistent prejudice" and work to foster better relations between the two nations."Certain people in American keep attacking and smearing China by force of habit," Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday in a regular press briefing. "This has not only tarnished America's international credibility but has been questioned and rejected by more and more countries."Roth's condemnation comes after China sanctioned several NGOs, including HRW, following the United States' passing of a bill to put pressure on the Communist Party for its treatment of Hong Kong demonstrators during seven months of pro-democracy protests that have rocked the semi-autonomous region. China said it blamed the NGOs for supporting "anti-China forces to create chaos in Hong Kong" and encouraging "extreme violent criminal acts."Load-Date: January 16, 2020End of Document

Brick-and-mortar businesses are heeding the warnings and adjusting to the conditions.Major retailers such as Nike and Adidas have both announced mass closures and reduced hours of many of their Chinese stores. Nike has further stated, "In the short term, we expect the situation to have a material impact on our operations in Greater China."Individuals are exercising precaution by restricting their travel and daily outings. As a direct consequence, online shopping has spiked.Daniel Dai founder of RebatesMe, a US cashback site popular with many Chinese online shoppers, goes on to explain, "We've seen online sales from China more than double recently for US brands. This is highly unusual. The Lunar New Year is a time where online shopping decreases due to people traveling and spending time with their extended family. But because of the virus, a lot of people are spending the holiday at home and online."The disruption of normal celebrations coupled with precautionary health practices have seen people turning to online resources to fill their needs. Along with increases in overall online shopping, RebatesMe also observed increases in specific areas such as streaming services and online educational services.However, the long-term ramifications on ecommerce are unknown. As governments, businesses, and health organizations fight to determine the spread and scope of the virus, its overall economic impact on both brick-and-mortar and online retailers worldwide remains unknown.About: RebatesMe.comSince 2013, RebatesMe has been offering people around the world cashback, deals, and discounts when they shop online.

US writer's post backing China's efforts draws global attentionPR NewswireFebruary 13, 2020 Thursday 11:00 PM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 744 wordsDateline: BEIJING, Feb. 13, 2020 BodyPR NewswireA news report by China Daily, Xing Yi in Shanghai:Author Mario Cavolo of the United States might be known for his books about China, but it is one of his LinkedIn posts that has gone viral on the internet.Based in Shenyang, Liaoning province, the Italian American writer had on Feb 5 written a commentary on the social networking site about the global reactions to China during the ongoing novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak.The article, titled Something's Not Right Here Folks, delves into the overreaction of some Western governments, the discrimination against Chinese people and Western media coverage that discredits the Chinese government's efforts in controlling the epidemic. Cavolo also compares China's response to the novel coronavirus epidemic with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in the United States, and highlights the contrasting reactions to the two health crises.An excerpt of his article, which has since been viewed more than a million times, reads, "During 2009 H1N1 outbreak, I don't recall xenophobic anti-America attacks across the globe, do you? Do you recall it took six months for the United States to declare a national emergency? Did any government from the onset in April 2009 through the end in April 2010, including the month of June, when H1N1 was declared an international emergency global pandemic, then send out a notice to its citizens that they should leave the US? Close their borders to American travelers? Nope, not a peep."In an interview with China Daily on Wednesday, Cavolo explained what compelled him to write the post."Every country is great, and every country has problems, but when we read major headlines in the West, we find these negative slams, these negative biases. ... I felt tired of it, so I wrote the article, " he said. "Surely enough, I struck a nerve in the hearts of people."Cavolo said that the majority of the comments on his post have been "super supportive", noting that many people agree with him.Maria Vesterlund, a former General Electric senior supply chain manager who is based in Shanghai, is among those who share the sentiment."We moved to Shanghai last year in August and now sadly face the same media pollution of gossips and panic information spread. ... I hear friends telling me they don't go to the local Chinese restaurants in Munich or Frankfurt－afraid of the coronavirus," she wrote in her comment on Cavolo's post."We stay here and do not run away. ... We feel with the people here, locals and expats who suffer the consequences, closing their shops, missing their incomes for living, staying home for weeks, not meeting friends, missing all the joy of life－to support the stop of spread around."Born in Yonkers, New York, Cavolo moved to China in 1999 and worked as a consultant for various companies before starting his own business in public relations. He has written two books on China's economic boom and lived in several cities across the country, including Chengdu in Sichuan province, Hangzhou in Zhejiang province and Shanghai. He currently resides in Shenyang, his wife's hometown.While Cavolo noted that China's management of the SARS epidemic in 2003 was not ideal, he pointed out that the authorities have learned from past experience and have responded better to the current crisis."Chinese media have been talking more and more about problems happening in the society, and problems of the government are discussed on the news," he added. "Such things are not being suppressed, which was what the West accuses China of. Such accusations are not sensible and have to stop."Cavolo said that it is important for people to empathize with the Chinese at this point in time and to seek to uplift their spirits as they work to combat the virus. He also expressed confidence that the epidemic will pass by the time spring arrives."I think I will play the piano and do a victory concert in spring," he said. "There will be victory concerts all over the country, and we will have a great time and things will be even better than people expect. Wuhan, stay strong! China, stay strong!" he said.Video creditsReporter: Xing YiVideo editors: Gao Wenxuan, Jiang YijingSubtitles: Ma Chi, Li DanqingCoordinator: Wang ChengmengPresenters: Zhang Chunyan, Wang JianfenSupervisor: Han LeiProducer: Wang Hao View original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-writers-post-backing-chinas-efforts-draws-global-attention-301005082.htmlSOURCE China DailyCONTACT: Wang Jianfen, 474030446@qq.com, +86-18500151556Load-Date: February 14, 2020End of Document

Reporters Without Borders Urges China to Rescind Decision to Expel Three WSJ ReportersTargeted News ServiceFebruary 22, 2020 Saturday 7:56 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 500 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: PARIS, France BodyReporters Without Borders (Reporters Sans Frontieres) issued the following news:Reporters Without Borders (RSF) calls on the Chinese authorities to reverse their decision to expel three Wall Street Journal journalists based in Beijing because of an opinion piece the newspaper published about China's handling of the coronavirus epidemic.The decision was announced on Wednesday February 19th by foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, who said the journalists' press cards were being withdrawn because the article contained "racially discriminatory" language and because the newspaper failed to apologize.Although they had no role in writing the opinion piece, the three journalists - deputy bureau chief Josh Chin and reporters Chao Deng and Philip Wen - have been given five days to leave the country. Chin and Deng are US citizens and Wen is Australian.The decision to expel them came one day after the US government announced that it was changing the status of five Chinese state-owned media outlets in the United States. Officials said they would be treated as foreign embassies because they were government propaganda mouthpieces.RSF urges the Chinese government to rescind this triple expulsion at once because it constitutes a serious press freedom violation."The coronavirus epidemic is of great interest to the international public and it is normal for a media outlet such as the Wall Street Journal to publish analyses and opinion pieces on the subject," said Cedric Alviani, the head of RSF's East Asia bureau. "If the Chinese authorities don't like the tone of this particular article, they can use their right of reply to present their counter-arguments. But reprisals against media outlets or their employees are unacceptable."The Chinese regime often uses the threat of withdrawing press visas to pressure foreign media outlets. Wong Chun Han, a Beijing-based Singaporean journalist working for the Wall Street Journal, was forced to leave on 30 August after reporting that a cousin of President Xi Jinping was being investigated in Australia as part of a probe into money-laundering.No fewer than nine journalists have had to leave China since 2013 because the Chinese authorities failed to renew their press visas on expiry. The victims include Ursula Gauthier, a reporter for the French news magazine L'Obs, who had to leave in 2015.The regime has been much criticized for its opaque handling of the ongoing coronavirus epidemic, which has so far killed more than 2,000 people and infected an estimated 70,000, mainly in China.In January, many Chinese Internet users took the risk of publicly expressing their discontent with the lack of transparency. The authorities responded by arresting two citizen-journalists, Chen Qiushi and Fang Bin, and several political commentators, and by stepping up censorship of media outlets and social networks.China is ranked 177th out of 180 countries in RSF's 2019 World Press Freedom Index.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7028895 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 22, 2020End of Document

Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi, on Dec. 19, 2019.Excerpts of the report follow:PurposeThe purpose of S. 893, the Secure 5G and Beyond Act of 2019, is to require the President to develop a strategy to ensure the security of 5th generation (5G) and other future generations of wireless communications systems and infrastructure in the United States, and to assist allies in maximizing the security of their 5G and other future generations of wireless communications systems and infrastructure, and software.Background and NeedsThe United States and some other countries have concluded that Chinese communications equipment vendors Huawei and ZTE pose a national security risk,/1 because Chinese law requires organizations and citizens to "support, cooperate with, and collaborate in national intelligence work."/2 U.S. communications providers have been urged to remove Huawei and ZTE equipment from their networks to prevent cyberattacks and other threats to the stability and reliability of the Nation's communications systems./3 As early as 2012, a report issued by the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives warned of the national security threat posed by Huawei and ZTE./4In 2018, Congress barred Federal agencies from procuring communications services from providers that have purchased equipment from Huawei and ZTE, and also limited the ability of the Federal Government to provide grants, loans, and loan guarantees to providers who intend to use that money to purchase equipment from those same providers./5 On May 15, 2019, President Trump issued an Executive order prohibiting the "acquisition, importation, transfer, installation, dealing in, or use of any information and communications technology or service . . . where the transaction involves any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest. . . ."/6 On November 22, 2019, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) approved a prohibition on the use of universal service funds to purchase equipment or services from any communications equipment or service providers identified as posing a national security risk to communications networks or the communications supply chain./7 The Commission also recently denied an application by China Mobile to provide international telecommunications services between the United States and foreign destinations, citing "China Mobile USA's ownership and control by the Chinese Government."/8The U.S. Government and allies are taking steps to help protect their communications networks from potential risks posed by Huawei and ZTE equipment and services./9 Australia and New Zealand have blocked the use of Huawei to provide the technology for their 5G networks./10 Japan has effectively banned Huawei and ZTE from official contracts, with its top three telecom operators following suit./11 Canada is reviewing its relationship with Huawei./12 The United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre has warned of the potential threats,/13 and British Telecom is removing Huawei equipment from key areas of its 4G network and will not use Huawei in central parts of its 5G network./14Yet although there is significant international concern about the national security implications of the use of Huawei and ZTE equipment, not all countries have limited the use of those companies' equipment in their domestic communications networks./15 Furthermore, there is concern about the availability of alternative secure communications infrastructure and software for use in U.S. and international wireless networks./16 Many have argued it would be helpful for the Federal Government to develop a single unified strategy for how to deal with the national security implications related to Huawei and ZTE, both within domestic communications networks and in the Nation's international diplomatic relationships./17Summary of ProvisionsS. 893 would do the following: Require the President of the United States to develop a Federal Government-wide strategy to ensure the security of the Nation's next-generation--and future generations--wireless telecommunications systems and infrastructure.Direct the U.S. Government to assist allies and strategic partners in maximizing the security of next- generation wireless telecommunications systems, infrastructure, and software.Legislative HistoryS. 893 was introduced on March 27, 2019, by Senator Cornyn (for himself and Senators Burr, Warner, Collins, Rubio, Bennet, Cotton, and Feinstein) and was referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. Senators Blackburn, Murphy, and Sullivan are additional cosponsors. On July 24, 2019, the Committee met in open Executive Session and, by voice vote, ordered S. 893 reported favorably with an amendment (in the nature of a substitute) offered by Senator Wicker. The Committee also adopted two additional amendments related to the bill. The first, offered by Senator Lee, would provide that the strategy developed pursuant to the bill shall include the provision of technical assistance to other countries to maximize the security of 5th and future generations wireless communications systems and infrastructure. The second, offered by Senator Cruz, would require that the strategy include identification and assessment of the global competitiveness and vulnerabilities of United States manufacturers and suppliers of 5th and future generations wireless communications equipment, and identify incentives and policy options to ensure the economic viability of the U.S. domestic industrial base.Similar legislation, H.R. 2881, is pending in the House of Representatives. On May 21, 2019, H.R. 2881 was introduced by Representative Spanberger (D-VA) (for herself and Representatives Stefanik (R-NY), Slotkin (D-MI), Rooney (R-FL), O'Halleran (D-AZ), and Brooks (R-IN)) and was referred to the Committees on Energy and Commerce, and Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives.Estimated CostsIn accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate, prepared by the Congressional Budget Office: S. 893 would require the President, acting through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and other federal agencies, to develop and submit to the Congress a strategy to ensure the security of 5G and future generations wireless communications systems and infrastructure owned by the United States and its allies. Among various other requirements, the NTIA would have to assess potential security threats to American 5G systems and infrastructure and analyze how competitive American 5G manufacturers and suppliers are globally.Using information from the NTIA, CBO estimates that implementing S. 893 would cost $1 million for the interagency group to formulate the strategy. Such spending would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds. CBO expects that NTIA would coordinate the interagency group and complete the strategy in 2020. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would incur insignificant costs to help formulate the strategy. However, because the FCC is authorized under current law to collect fees sufficient to offset the appropriated costs of its regulatory activities each year, CBO estimates that the net cost to the FCC would be negligible, assuming appropriation actions consistent with that authority.If the FCC increases annual fee collections to offset the costs of implementing provisions in the bill, S. 893 would increase the cost of an existing private-sector mandate on entities required to pay those fees. Using information from the FCC, CBO estimates that the incremental cost of the mandate would be small and would fall well below the annual threshold established in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) for private-sector mandates ($164 million in 2019, adjusted annually for inflation).The bill contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in UMRA.The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are David Hughes (for federal costs) and Rachel Austin (for mandates). The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.Regulatory Impact StatementIn accordance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides the following evaluation of the regulatory impact of the legislation, as reported: number of persons covered The number of persons covered by S. 893 would be consistent with current levels. S. 893 would have no effect on the number or types of individuals and businesses regulated.Economic impact S. 893 would have no economic impact. By promoting more secure deployment of next-generation communications throughout the United States and the world, the bill would allow the Nation to extend its technology leadership in the next generation of communications technology and promote investment and innovation.Privacy S. 893 would not have any adverse impact on the personal privacy of affected individuals.Paperwork The Committee does not anticipate a major increase in paperwork burdens resulting from the passage of this legislation. The bill, as reported, would direct a broad group of Federal stakeholders to prepare a whole-of-government strategy concerning the security of 5th and future generations wireless communications systems and infrastructure and various other issues. The bill would direct the stakeholders to prepare and submit a report to Congress outlining the strategy within 180 days of the enactment of the bill.Congressionally Directed SpendingIn compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no provisions contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congressionally directed spending items under the rule.Section-by-Section AnalysisSection 1. Short titleThis section would provide that the bill may be cited as the "Secure 5G and Beyond Act of 2019".Section 2. Strategy to ensure security of next generation wireless communications systems and infrastructureSubsection (a) of this section would define the term "appropriate committees of Congress" for purposes of the bill.Subsections (b) and (c) of this section would require the President, in consultation with various other Federal officials, to develop and submit to the appropriate committees of Congress within 180 days of enactment a "Secure Next Generation Wireless Communications Strategy" to do the following: Ensure the security of 5th generation (5G) and future generations of U.S. wireless communications systems and infrastructure.* Provide technical assistance to U.S. mutual defense treaty allies, strategic partners, and other countries, when in the security interests of the United States, to maximize the security of 5G and future generations of wireless communications systems and infrastructure inside their countries.* Protect the competitiveness of U.S. companies, the privacy of U.S. consumers, and the integrity and impartiality of standards-setting bodies related to 5G and future generations of wireless communications systems and infrastructure.Subsection (d) of this section would require that the strategy represent a whole-of-government approach to the issues set forth in section 2(b). The subsection then outlines 19 elements that would need to be included in the strategy as follows: (1) A description of U.S. national and economic security interests pertaining to the deployment of 5G and future generations of wireless communications systems and infrastructure.(2) An identification and assessment of potential security threats and vulnerabilities to the infrastructure, equipment, systems, software, and virtually defined networks that support 5G and future generations of wireless communications systems and infrastructure. This assessment would also include a comprehensive evaluation of the full range of threats to, and unique security challenges posed by such systems and infrastructure, as well as steps that public and private sector entities can take to mitigate such threats. The Committee intends for this evaluation to include a detailed discussion of the cybersecurity issues posed by the deployment and use of such systems and infrastructure.(3) An identification and assessment of the global competitiveness and vulnerabilities of U.S. manufacturers and suppliers of 5G and future generations of wireless communications equipment.(4) A list of domestic suppliers of

domestic or mutual defense treaty allies and strategic partner communications equipment supply chain for 5G and future generations wireless communications systems and infrastructure.(7) Identification of incentives and policy options to help close or narrow any security gaps in, and ensure the economic viability of, the U.S. domestic industrial base, including research and development in critical technologies and workforce development in 5G and future generations wireless communications systems and infrastructure.(8) Identification of incentives and policy options for leveraging the communications equipment suppliers from mutual defense treaty allies, strategic partners, or other countries to ensure that U.S. private industry has adequate sources for secure, effective, and reliable 5G and future generations of wireless communications systems and infrastructure equipment.(9) A strategy for diplomatic engagement with mutual defense treaty allies, strategic partners, and other countries to share security risk information and findings pertaining to 5G and future generations wireless communications systems and infrastructure equipment and cooperation on mitigating those risks.(10) A strategy for engagement with private sector communications infrastructure and systems equipment developers to share information and findings on 5G and future generations wireless communications systems and infrastructure equipment standards to secure platforms.(11) A strategy for engagement with private sector communications infrastructure and systems equipment developers to encourage the maximum participation possible on standards- setting bodies related to such systems and infrastructure equipment standards by U.S. public and private sector entities.(12) A strategy for diplomatic engagement with mutual defense treaty allies, strategic partners, and other countries to share information and findings on 5G and future generations wireless communications systems and infrastructure equipment standards to promote maximum interoperability, competitiveness, openness, and secure platforms.(13) A strategy for diplomatic engagement with mutual defense treaty allies, strategic partners, and other countries to share information and findings on 5G and future generations wireless communications infrastructure and systems equipment concerning the standards-setting bodies related to such systems and infrastructure to promote maximum transparency, openness, impartiality, integrity, and neutrality.(14) A strategy for joint testing environments with mutual defense treaty allies, strategic partners, and other countries to ensure a trusted marketplace for 5G and future generations wireless communications systems and infrastructure equipment.(15) A strategy for research and development by the Federal Government, in close partnership with trusted supplier entities, mutual defense treaty allies, strategic partners, and other countries to reach and maintain U.S. leadership in 5G and future generations wireless communications systems and infrastructure security, including the development of an ongoing monitoring capability for such systems to identify security vulnerabilities.(16) Options for identifying and helping to mitigate the security risks of 5G and future generations wireless communications systems and infrastructure that have security flaws or vulnerabilities, or are utilizing equipment sourced from countries of concern, and that have already been put in place within the systems and infrastructure of mutual defense treaty allies, strategic partners, and other countries, when in U.S. security interests.(17) Development of a plan that includes a description of the appropriate roles and responsibilities of the appropriate executive branch agencies and interagency mechanisms for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to act as the executive agent to coordinate implementation of the strategy consistent with section 2(g).(18) An identification of the key diplomatic, development, intelligence, military, and economic resources necessary to implement the strategy, including specific budgetary requests.(19) A description of such legislative or administrative action as may be necessary to carry out the strategy.Subsection (e) of this section would prohibit the strategy from including a recommendation or proposal to federalize 5G or future generations of wireless telecommunications systems or infrastructure. This subsection would further make clear that nothing in the subsection shall be construed to limit the authority or ability of a Federal agency to do the following:* Conduct cybersecurity incident, threat, or asset response and recovery activities;* Obtain or execute warrants or other investigative or intelligence tools; or* Provide assistance to a private entity upon the request of such entity.Subsection (f) of this section would require the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information, and other Federal officials as designated by the President, to provide the appropriate committees of Congress with a briefing on the implementation of the strategy within 14 days of its completion. The briefing would need to be held in an unclassified setting to the maximum extent possible.Subsection (g) of this section would designate the National Telecommunications and Information Administration as the executive agent to coordinate implementation of the strategy and keep Congress apprised of progress on implementation. The Committee intends for such coordination activity to be performed in due regard of the fact that the FCC (one of the participants in the development of the strategy) is an independent agency subject to the jurisdiction of Congress, not the executive branch.Subsection (h) of this section would specify that the strategy must be submitted to Congress in unclassified form, but may include a classified annex.Changes in Existing LawIn compliance with paragraph 12 of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Committee states that the bill as reported would make no change to existing law.The full text of the report is found at: https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/116th-congress/senate-report/184/1?s=3&r=6* * *Footnotes:1/See, e.g., Executive Order on Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain, May 15, 2019, Executive order (https://www.whitehouse.gov/ presidential-actions/executive-order-securing-information- communications-technology-services-supply-chain/); see also, Michael Kahn and Jan Lopatka, "Western Allies Agree 5G Security Guidelines Warn of Outside Influence," Reuters, May 3, 2019 (https://            www.reuters.com/ article/us-telecoms-5g-security/western-allies-agree-5g-security- guidelines-warn-of-outside- influence-idUSKCN1S91D2).2/Michael Kahn and Jan Lopatka, "Western Allies Agree 5G Security Guidelines Warn of Outside Influence," Reuters, May 3, 2019 (https:// www.reuters.com/article/us-telecoms-5g- security/western-allies-agree-5g-security-guidelines-warn-of-outside- influence-idUSKCN1S91D2).3/Tom Cotton and John Cornyn, "Keep the Chinese Government Away From 5G Technology," Washington Post, April 1, 2019 (https:// www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/keep-the-chinese-government-away-from- 5g-technology/2019/04/01/ba7a30ac-54b3-11e9-9136- f8e636f1f6df_story.html?utm_term=.055accd882e0).4/U.S. Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, "Investigative Report on the U.S. National Security Issues Posed by Chinese Telecommunications Companies Huawei and ZTE," October 8, 2012 (https:/ /intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=96).5/John S.

Officials Reach a Breakthrough in the U.S. - China Trade Dispute; FinancialBuzz.com News CommentaryPR NewswireJanuary 16, 2020 Thursday 9:00 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2497 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, Jan. 16, 2020 BodyPR NewswireU.S. stock indexes touched record highs but ended up ambling into the close Wednesday after President Donald Trump signed the first phase of a trade deal with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, deescalating an 18-month conflict between the world's two largest economies. The first phase of the trade agreement includes promises by the Chinese government to increase their purchases of U.S. agricultural, manufacturing, and energy products by more than USD 200 Billion over the next two years. Additionally, changes to Chinese regulation and criminal codes regarding intellectual property theft and counterfeiting were also included. "This is a very important and remarkable occasion. Today, we take a momentous step, one that has never been taken before with China, toward a future with a fair and reciprocal trade as we sign Phase 1 of the historic trade deal between the United States and China," the President said during the White House press conference. CTI Industries Corporation (NASDAQ: CTIB), Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ: PDD), Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA), Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ: BIDU), JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: JD)The first phase of the trade deal has already received its fair share of criticism. According to a report by Politico, critics have warned that the 86-page agreement fails to resolve the enduring U.S. concerns about China's industrial policy, specifically how to restrain the billions of dollars in government subsidies Beijing grants to its state-owned corporations. "That's a giant hole in the phase one deal, and there's no way to get around it," said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. "We're no closer today to resolving any of those fundamental frictions than we were before the trade war started," Bown added. Negotiations regarding the second phase of the trade deal are set to begin in the near future, with uncertainties abound on how long it will take for the deal to materialize. But in the meantime, phase one is expected to somewhat stabilize the relationship between two nations as well as provide relief to farmers and manufacturers bearing the impact of the Trump's tariffs.CTI Industries Corporation (NASDAQ: CTIB) announced today, "the first closing of a previously announced stock purchase agreement (the 'Offering') on January 13, 2020, for total gross proceeds of $2,500,000. On January 3, 2020, the Company disclosed that it had entered into a stock purchase agreement ('The Purchase Agreement'), with LF International Pte. Ltd., a Singapore private limited company (the 'Investor'), for a strategic investment, which the Company expects to resolve the over advance circumstance with its primary lender and provide a confident first step in reconstructing a healthy capital structure.This initial closing is part of a larger Offering of 500,000 shares of the Company's newly created Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, no par value per share ('Series A Preferred'), with each share of Series A Preferred initially convertible into ten shares of the Company's common stock, at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $5,000,000 (the 'Offering'). The gross proceeds from the Offering of $5,000,000 were held in escrow; the first closing resulted in the release of $2,500,000 in cash from the funds held in escrow, with a remaining $2,500,000 still held in escrow, which will be released upon completion of specific events. The Company's management team considers the Offering and strategic partner representative of a shift and plans to utilize the cash influx to continue to steer CTI into a new more focused direction on behalf of their shareholders.'This is the sort of strong financial partner that CTI determined would be a key element to our future business operations,' said Frank Cesario, President and CEO. 'With deals such as the Offering with LF International, and the impending sale of our subsidiary in Mexico, we will reduce our debt by nearly $6 million. The second closing with LF International will provide funds for us to further invest in executing our blueprint for a significantly renewed CTI.  We look forward to creating value together.'CTI entered into a Loan Agreement with its primary lender on December 14, 2017, and had been operating under a Forbearance Agreement due to certain events of default. The Forbearance was scheduled to terminate on January 10, 2020.On January 13, 2020, a new Forbearance between CTI and its lender became effective, for a period ending no later than December 31, 2020 and the Company incorporated the proceeds from the first closing of the Offering into an ongoing credit facility, including new loan covenants. CTI expects to proceed shortly with the second closing of the Offering.About CTI: CTI Industries Corporation is one of the leading manufacturers and marketers of foil and latex balloons, and produces laminated and printed films for commercial uses.  CTI also distributes Candy Blossoms and other gift items. CTI markets its products throughout the United States and in several other countries."For our latest "Buzz on the Street" Show featuring CTI Industries Corporation recent corporate news, please head over to:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZEPeywmSykPinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ: PDD) is a technology platform and one of the leading Chinese e-commerce players. In their third quarter earnings from earlier last year, Pinduoduo announced total revenues in the quarter were RMB7,513.9 million (US$1,051.2 million), an increase of 123% from RMB3,372.4 million in the same quarter of 2018. "We celebrated our fourth anniversary in early October with an annual active buyer base exceeding half a billion for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2019," said Mr. Zheng Huang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pinduoduo. "We continued to invest in our users throughout the third quarter, and stepped our marketing up a notch from the second half of September for the launch of our anniversary sale. This has added to our steady momentum of user growth as our average monthly active users grew by 64 million from the prior quarter to reach 430 million.

Human Rights Watch head says he was denied entry to Hong Kong to launch report critical of ChinaCNN.comJanuary 12, 2020 Sunday 11:59 PM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 585 wordsByline: By Nectar Gan, CNNBodyThe international head of Human Rights Watch said he was denied entry to Hong Kong on Sunday, ahead of the launch of a report critical of the Chinese government.Kenneth Roth, the group's executive director, said he was barred from entering the Chinese territory upon landing at the city's international airport on Sunday, with no reason given by immigration authorities."I had hoped to spotlight Beijing's deepening assault on international efforts to uphold human rights," Roth said in a statement on the group's website."The refusal to let me enter Hong Kong vividly illustrates the problem," he said.The Hong Kong Immigration Department declined to comment on individual cases. In a short statement to CNN, it said the department considers "all relevant factors and circumstances of the case before deciding whether the entry should be allowed or not."Hong Kong is in the midst of a months-long anti-government protest movement that calls for greater democracy and police accountability.Mass demonstrations have at times turned violent as police fired tear gas and forcibly arrested protesters they accused of rioting and vandalism. Demonstrators have accused the police of using excessive force.Roth, a US citizen who had freely entered Hong Kong before, said he had hoped to release Human Rights Watch's World Report 2020 at the city's Foreign Correspondents' Club on Wednesday.The report, which reviews human rights practices in nearly 100 countries, is led by Roth's introductory essay that warns the Chinese government is carrying out an intensive attack on the global system for enforcing human rights.Following the alleged denial of entry, Roth boarded a plane back to New York, where he will launch the report at the United Nations on Tuesday."I suppose I should be grateful to Hong Kong immigration authorities for this shoot-yourself-in-the-foot publicity for (Human Rights Watch's) World Report release," he said in a post on his Twitter account.The semi-autonomous city has denied entry to a string of activists, foreign journalists and a US academic in recent years, drawing criticism at home and abroad for what some fear is an increasingly authoritarian approach in dealing with voices of dissent."This disappointing action is yet another sign that Beijing is tightening its oppressive grip on Hong Kong and further restricting the limited freedom Hong Kong people enjoy under 'one country, two systems,'" Roth said, referring to the arrangement under which the former British colony was returned to Beijing's rule.Beijing has repeatedly denied interference and accused "foreign forces," including the US and the UK, as "black hands" behind the social unrest in Hong Kong.Based in New York, Human Rights Watch was one of several US-based non-government organizations which the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had threatened to impose "sanctions" against in December.They include the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democractic Institute for International Affairs, the International Republican Institute and Freedom House.The groups, which had been monitoring and reporting on the protests in Hong Kong, was accused by Beijing of supporting "anti-China" people. It said they were instigating protesters "engaging in extreme crimes" in pursuit of Hong Kong's separation from China.HRW's criticism of China goes far beyond the Hong Kong protests. The group said fundamental rights and freedoms are "increasingly at jeopardy as Beijing seeks to broaden its repression globally."Load-Date: January 14, 2020End of Document

Only 10% said they would be able to hold out through the second half of the year."China started returning to work on February 10, but high frequency data suggests the economy is far from running at full capacity," said Mark Haefele, the chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. Against a backdrop of a crackdown on lending and a trade dispute with the US, Chinese businesses not backed by the government were already under pressure before the coronavirus outbreak began to escalate in early 2020. The blow could be significant in the second-largest economy, which forecasters said this year could post its first quarterly contraction in decades. Private businesses in China fuel about 60% of gross domestic product, 80% of jobs, three-quarters of technological innovation and more than half of tax revenue, according to internal estimates.Seeking to soften the blow, the Chinese government has cut interest rates and asked banks to offer more credit. But the moves may not be enough to keep small- and medium-sized businesses up and running."China will respond to the coronavirus with extra monetary and fiscal stimulus," Andrea Cicione, the head of macro strategy at TS Lombard, said in a research note this month. "This will matter little in the end unless earnings start growing again."NOW WATCH: A big-money investor in juggernauts like Facebook and Netflix breaks down the '3rd wave' firms that are leading the next round of tech disruptionSee Also:• A look at the demanding schedule of Elon Musk, who plans his day in 5-minute slots, constantly multitasks, and avoids phone calls• 'It's a clear bubble': A former Goldman Sachs hedge fund chief sounds the alarm on flailing stocks - and warns the nefarious effects of coronavirus have 'only just started'• A Wall Street firm lists its 5 best hedges for an unusual coronavirus-driven market crash - and shares what to do if it's successfully containedSEE ALSO: The White House is preparing to ask Congress for emergency funding as coronavirus hits the USLoad-Date: March 5, 2020End of Document

AMERICAN BUSINESSMAN WHO RAN HOUSTON-BASED SUBSIDIARY OF CHINESE COMPANY SENTENCED TO PRISON FOR THEFT OF TRADE SECRETSUS Fed NewsFebruary 11, 2020 Tuesday 11:09 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 693 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, Feb. 11 -- The U.S. Department of Justice's Criminal Division issued the following news release:The head of a Houston-based company that was the subsidiary of a Chinese company that developed stolen trade secrets was sentenced to 16 months in prison and ordered to forfeit more than $330,000 by U.S. District Judge Christopher R. Cooper of the District of Columbia.Shan Shi, 55, of Houston, Texas, had previously been found guilty of conspiracy to steal trade secrets by a jury on July 29, 2019. Evidence admitted during a three-week trial showed that Shi had signed an agreement with Taizhou CBM Future New Material Science and Technology Co. Ltd (CBMF), to develop the manufacture of syntactic foam, which is a buoyancy material that aids in offshore oil and gas drilling. The defendant specifically pledged to "digest/absorb" the relevant technology in the United States. The defendant then set up a U.S.-based corporation, CBM International Inc., (CBMI) and hired ex-employees of a victim company that manufactured syntactic foam, located in Houston, Texas. These employees had access to trade secrets developed by the victim company, and the defendant was aware that they had signed agreements with the victim company not to disclose proprietary information. The other employees then transferred proprietary information to CBMI and the defendant, who used the information to create a syntactic foam manufacturing process in China.The defendant was arrested along with five other individuals in the United States after he and CBMI attempted to market related-technology in the District of Columbia. An additional Chinese national living in China, Hui Huang, was also charged. The trial was solely of defendant Shi."The Department of Justice is committed to protecting the intellectual property of American companies, particularly against Chinese malign economic aggression," said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department's Criminal Division. "As Shan Shi's prosecution demonstrates, we will steadfastly defend the right of U.S. entrepreneurs to reap the benefits of their innovations.""Yesterday's sentencing underscores our determination to prosecute those who would steal trade secrets from American businesses and further misuse them for their own research and development," said U.S. Attorney Timothy J. Shea for the District of Columbia. "The Court made clear that the defendant knew or intended that the offense would benefit the People's Republic of China. To those who would steal proprietary information from U.S. companies and provide it to a foreign government, our message is that you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""Shan Shi will now pay the consequences in prison for stealing trade secrets from a U.S. company for the benefit of China, while he himself also profited from that theft. This is just another example of the serious and growing threat the Chinese government poses to the United States and our industries," said Special Agent in Charge Perrye K. Turner of the FBI's Houston Field Office. "Just as the People's Republic of China is determined to steal from the United States, the FBI and DOJ is determined to protect America's national and economic security and intellectual property from unscrupulous foreign adversaries."The FBI's Houston Field Office, Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security Office of Export Enforcement and IRS-Criminal Investigation investigated the case.Senior Counsel Matthew R. Walczewski of the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, Trial Attorney David Recker of the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jeff Pearlman, Luke Jones and Zia Faruqui of the District of Columbia, and former Special Assistant U.S. Attorney W. Joss Nichols prosecuted the case.The year 2020 marks the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice. Learn more about the history of our agency at www.Justice.gov/Celebrating150Years.

China's travel reservation to America is slumped 22%CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 31, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 504 wordsBody       ? A health worker, dressed in protective suit, helps a couple outside a hospital in Wuhan, Hubei Province, in central China.Photo Ap Julio Reyna Quiroz Newspaper The DayFriday, January 31, 2020, p. 4Travel bookings from China to Countries in the Americas plummeted 22 percent from 26 January last year, when Beijing halted the transit of Chinese groups of tourists abroad in order to limit the spread of coronavirus, according to calculations from ForwardKeys, a big data company that analyzes global flight booking information and travel flows.America is one of the regions hardest hit globally by the Chinese government's prohibitive measure, although Asia-Pacific is the area that welcomes three out of four tourists from China.Towards America, only 7 percent of all Chinese tourists are headed, while Mexico captures less than one percent of the passenger flows from that market.In 2019, 105,835 travelers residing in China arrived in Mexico via air, representing an increase of 2.5 percent compared to 2018. Last December, before the coronavirus outbreak, Mexico received 9,832 Chinese passengers, 1.8 percent higher over the same period in 2018.As of this week, direct flights between Mexico and China were suspended for technical and market reasons, unrelated to the coronavirus outbreak.Hainan Airlines stopped flying to Mexico City, via Tijuana, due to the maintenance of the runway at the border city airport, while Aeromexico moved its aircraft in December to the Barcelona-Mexico City route.China Southern Airlines, which flies to the Mexican capital with technical stopover in Vancouver, Canada, would leave the route in March for market reasons.Reservation debacleThe fall on Chinese overseas travel reservations began on April 19 and was accentuated a week later. Until Sunday 19, reserves leaving China, not counting Hong Kong and Taiwan because of the political unrest that have affected travel, rose 7.3 percent compared to 2019.Reservations for the holiday period in China were down 6.8 percent from January 26, when Wuhan Airport was closed and the government prevented the trip of groups of tourists, ForwardKeys explained.The analytics firm considered that the dramatic slowdown has affected travel to all parts of the world, but Asia Pacific is the hardest-hit region. As of January 19, reserves were 1.3 percent below last year's and a week later were placed 15.1 percent below.ForwardKeys noted that as of January 19, bookings to America had a 14.3 percent drop; Africa and the Middle East, 0.7, and Europe recorded an increase of 10.5 per cent. Seven days later, reserves to America fell 22.5 percent, to Africa and the Middle East 9.9 and Europe to 0.5 percent.Meanwhile, global agencies recommend their clients travel to China after February.We understand that you may be concerned about the pneumonia outbreak in China. Based on the SARS outbreak in 2003, we recommend that you visit China after February 2020, China Highlights, one of the Largest Travel Agencies of the Asian Nation, noted.Load-Date: February 1, 2020End of Document

In snub to US, Britain will allow Chinese tech giant Huawei in 5G networksThe Ledger (Lakeland, Florida)January 28, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 The LedgerDistributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWSLength: 898 wordsByline: Kelvin Chan & Danica Kirka,, The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.BodyJan. 28--     Jan. 28--LONDON -- Britain decided Tuesday to allow Chinese tech giant Huawei to supply new high-speed network equipment, ignoring the U.S. government's warnings that it would sever intelligence cooperation if the company was not banned.Britain's decision is the first by a major U.S. ally in Europe, and follows intense lobbying from the Trump administration and China as the two vie for technological dominance.It sets up a diplomatic clash with the Americans, who claim that British sovereignty is at risk because the company could give the Chinese government access to data, an allegation Huawei denies."We would never take decisions that threaten our national security or the security of our Five Eyes partners," Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said, referring a security arrangement in which Britain, the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, share intelligence. "We know more about Huawei and the risks that it poses than any other country in the world."The decision was awkward for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who risks the fury of one of Britain's closest allies at just the moment it needs Trump's administration to quickly strike a trade deal after Brexit. Britain is also loath to insult China, which it likewise needs for future trade deals.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is due to visit London on Wednesday to meet with Johnson and Raab to reaffirm the tran-Atlantic relationship.A senior Trump administration official said the U.S. is disappointed by the decision, adding that the U.S. government would work with the U.K. on a "way forward" that leads to the exclusion of "untrusted vendor components" from 5G networks. The official was not authorized to comment on the sensitive diplomacy between longstanding allies and spoke on condition of anonymity.In its decision, the British government said it was excluding "high risk" companies from supplying the sensitive "core" parts of the new fifth-generation, or 5G, networks. The core is the brain that keeps track, among other things, of smartphones connecting to networks and helps manage data traffic.But Britain will allow high risk suppliers to provide up to 35% of the less risky radio access network of antennas and base stations.The announcement did not mention any companies by name but said "high risk vendors are those who pose greater security and resilience risks to U.K. telecoms networks" -- a clear reference to Huawei.By giving Huawei limited access, Johnson's government is attempting to thread a path between the U.S. and China.Huawei said it was "reassured" by the British decision."This evidence-based decision will result in a more advanced, more secure and more cost-effective telecoms infrastructure that is fit for the future," Vice-President Victor Zhang said. "It gives the U.K. access to world-leading technology and ensures a competitive market."The 5G technology is expected to drive the next wave of innovation, transmitting massive amounts of data from more objects and locations. It would, for example, help make possible self-driving cars or allow telemedicine, in which doctors control robots in remote surgery on patients miles away.Huawei is the top global supplier of mobile networks, with its gear often considered cost-effective and high-quality.The United States says that China's communist leaders could, under a 2017 national intelligence law, compel Huawei to carry out cyberespionage. The U.S. has threatened repeatedly to cut off intelligence sharing with allies that use Huawei."Here's the sad truth: our special relationship is less special now that the U.K. has embraced the surveillance state commies at Huawei," said U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence . "During the Cold War, Margaret Thatcher never contracted with the KGB to save a few pennies."With 5G, U.S. officials also worry that because the "core" will run extensively on software, it could be nearly impossible to spot an accidental vulnerability or a malicious "backdoor" among millions of lines of computer code. Huawei denies the allegations, saying there's never been any evidence it is responsible for a breach.For Britain, the 5G infrastructure program is considered critical as it leaves the European Union and aims to position its economy to benefit from technological innovation.The government said Tuesday it is taking some steps that will allow it "to mitigate the potential risk posed by the supply chain and to combat the range of threats, whether cyber criminals, or state sponsored attacks."The U.K. National Cyber Security Centre will issue guidance with practical steps on how to mitigate the risks to wireless operators, some of whom have have already started installing Huawei 5G gear into their networks. They were reluctant to rip it out and replace it with equipment from rivals including Finland's Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson.British carrier Vodafone, which doesn't use Huawei in its core, said that using multiple suppliers "is the best way to safeguard the delivery of services to all mobile customers." ___Associated Press Writer Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this story.___Follow the AP's coverage of technology at: https://apnews.com/apf-technology___ (c)2020 The Ledger (Lakeland, Fla.)

Plague Inc. sales soared over coronavirus in ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 25, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 712 wordsBodyInternational pages, in recent days, are filled with coronavirus, a deadly virus that began in China and appears to have arrived in Europe, with the recent cases detected in France. It may be strange, or not so much, that, given this, sales of Plague Inc., the game that debuted in 2013 on mobile and that in 2015, with Plague Inc: Evolved, came to PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. It is basically a video game where you can simulate the progress of all kinds of diseases and see how it spreads in hours, days and even months. Since January 22, according to a report by Sensor Tower, a company dedicated to auditing the mobile gaming market, Plague Inc. is the most downloaded paid game for iPhone in China (also in Britain and the United States) and one of the most downloaded on Google's Play Store.We're getting a lot of questions about the ongoing Coronavirus outbreak- the World Health Organization has some great information here: https://t.co/aG29SD68Iu pic.twitter.com/kLFq6CmPGo— Plague Inc. / Rebel Inc. (@NdemicCreations) January 22, 2020The Asian country announced that it is already building a hospital in Wuhan, a region where the outbreak was born, especially dedicated to patients suffering from coronavirus. The Chinese government reported that it plans to finish the important work, for about a thousand sick people, in a few days, on February 10. The public, however, has been critical of the Asian regime's late-to-let response. Critics, both local and international, say that government censorship in the early days of the outbreak hid information and pursued those who wanted to report the serious disease, triggering further spread of the virus.Plague Inc. users are using the game to criticize, veiledly due to the strong repercussions they may suffer, to the Chinese government for their censorship: they massively recreate the appearance of a virus in China and to enhance its contagion use the function misinformation. They thus expose how the Asian regime denied the existence of the disease and minimized the contagion capacity and severity of the disease. The official website of the game is dropped by the high number of players who have joined, reported from Ndemic Creations, responsible for the title in question.However, this is not the first time the game has received this kind of attention. A similar situation occurred in 2014 when the Ebola epidemic hit the world, and especially Africa. On that occasion Plague Inc. added nearly one million additional players in two weeks, in the same period when the death toll exceeded 4,000. The owners of Ndemic Creations decided to launch a fundraising and awareness-raising campaign on the Ebola outbreak involving more than 800,000 players and collected more than $76,000 for charities dedicated to combating the Virus.Plague Inc., its sales soared by the Coronavirus outbreak.Researchers are trying to find patient zero in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus was originally detected, so that they can explain how this fearsome threat arose. Meanwhile the Asian government has decided to isolate Wuhan, so no citizen can enter or leave wuhan while researching and deciding how to proceed. Some of the researchers have publicly stated that there is a possibility thattoxin has jumped directly from some animal to humans. The most recent numbers bring deaths to 41, of which 39 are in Wuhan, and more than 12000 infected. In addition to China, cases have been detected in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, the United States, France and Australia.At the moment, the World Health Organization (WHO) did not declare the international emergency over the outbreak, as the severity of the disease, its ability to spread and death, among many other issues, must be well assessed first.$(document).ready(function() ? var cX ? window.cX window.cX . {}; cX.callQueue ? cX.callQueue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

House Technology Committee Issues Testimony From Schmidt FuturesTargeted News ServiceJanuary 30, 2020 Thursday 9:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2987 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe House Science, Space and Technology Committee issued the following testimony on Jan. 29 by Eric Schmidt, founder of the Schmidt Futures, at a hearing entitled "Losing Ground: U.S. Competitiveness in Critical Technologies":Thank you for the opportunity to testify on the importance of U.S. competitiveness in critical technologies. I appear today as a long-time advocate for federal government investments in technology research and development, having seen first hand how these investments can bolster America's competitiveness in the global economy. I am proud to have been CEO of Google, and recall how the National Science Foundation helped fund the scientific advances that Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin commercialized so successfully to build the first broadly adopted search engine. I have also focused on understanding the role of new technology in protecting our national security, as chair of two government panels -- the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence and the Defense Innovation Board. Today, however, I am speaking not as a representative of these organizations, but as a private citizen.I commend the Committee for the breadth of this hearing. The range of technologies discussed today must be understood as interconnected opportunities. Advances in quantum computing will spur developments in AI, progress in AI will help accelerate discoveries in biotechnology, 5G networks will open up new opportunities to leverage AI applications, and so on. We must find an integrated approach to federal investments across emerging technologies.Doing so requires a comprehensive national strategy, to set and reinforce priorities and to reconcile budget tradeoffs. This Committee has a central role in that urgent project.My central argument is this: If we do not make serious investments now, we stand to lose our global leadership position in critical technology areas by the end of this new decade, with significant consequences for our country's prosperity and security.I will offer my view on the imperative of global technology leadership and our complex technology competition with China, and then offer a series of proposals for this Committee's consideration. I will focus mainly on AI and associated issues such as advanced computing, but many of my points are applicable more broadly. Based on my recent experience working with the defense and intelligence communities, I also want to emphasize the national security dimensions of these issues. The AI Commission's recently published Interim Report expands upon some of these points, and I have attached it here for the Committee's reference.Global Technology LeadershipHolding a global leadership position in emerging technology is both an economic and a national security imperative. Innovation is the foundation of the U.S. economy, as well as the Page 2 of 6 source of the military advantage that protects us and our allies and deters aggressors. Leadership gives our security agencies access to the best available technologies, and puts the United States in the best position to secure them against vulnerabilities and develop standards for their responsible use.Because the commercial sector vastly outspends the government on R&D, the government must partner more closely with private companies to shape technology development. The commercial sector alone will not meet every or even most of our economic competitiveness or security needs. The U.S. government must prioritize and catalyze. The government's responsibility is to steer advancements in ways that protect Americans, preserve a robust basic research environment, and fill gaps where commercial enterprises have not focused their attention or resources.The United States now faces an economic and military competitor in China that is aggressively trying to close our lead in emerging technologies. Many Americans still have an outdated vision of China. In three generations China transformed from having a per capita income of about $90 in 1960 to about $10,000 today./1China has already passed the United States in GDP based on purchasing power parity. China poses a larger economic challenge than the Soviet Union did. As a leading historian recently noted, "the Soviet Union could never draw on the resources of a dynamic private sector. China can."/2Now, the Chinese government has ambitions -- and specific plans, with promises of billions of dollars in funding -- to surpass the United States in areas such as quantum communications, supercomputing, aerospace, 5G, mobile payment, new energy vehicles, high-speed rail, financial technology, and AI.With AI in particular, where do we stand today? By most estimates the United States is the global leader in 2020. There are many different metrics and I won't go into them here. But consider the most recent attempt to do a comprehensive assessment, called the Global AI Index, which measured 150 indicators. It found the United States is the "undisputed leader" in AI development, with a score almost twice that of China, which placed second./3But now consider how fragile that lead is. The same study projected that based on current AI trends, China will overtake the United States in only five to ten years. From my own experience, which includes frequent interaction with China's technology community, I think that's about right.Many data points and observations lead me to such a projection. Here are just a few.Today, China has almost twice as many supercomputers as the United States. It has approximately 15 times the number of deployed 5G base stations as the United States./4By 2025, Chinese researchers are expected to overtake American researchers in the one percent of most-cited scientific papers in AI./5By 2030, China is expected to spend more than the United States on overall R&D, in absolute terms./6Sometime after 2030, the Chinese economy likely will become larger than ours./7In other words, unless trends change, we will be competing with a country that has a bigger economy, more R&D investments, better quality research, wider application of new technologies, and stronger computing infrastructure. As the 2020s begin, we should be gearing our policy and legislation to compete effectively in a 2030s world that may look very different.Complex Competition with China The technology competition with China is not straightforward or zero sum. Speaking of an arms race is too simplistic. We should not only compete with the Chinese but also work with them. Many breakthroughs in one country will benefit researchers in the other, because they are openly available -- or were produced through cooperation. In the AI field, for example, the number of research papers published with American and Chinese co-authors has doubled in the last decade./8Chinese nationals are important contributors to U.S. universities and research institutes.There are many areas where cooperation would have clear mutual benefits, for example in AIbased approaches to climate challenges, disaster relief, and health care. We should also engage in collaborative discussions on AI safety -- that is, ensuring AI systems only do what they are designed to do.Simple decoupling is unwise because it would significantly harm the United States. Still, there are aspects of the U.S.-China technology relationship that need to be recalibrated. China's well-documented espionage, intellectual property theft, and talent recruitment programs are disadvantaging our companies, our universities, and our military. The findings of a recent Senate investigation into China's methods to unfairly exploit U.S. taxpayer-funded research for its own benefit is a case in point./9I commend the intense focus in Congress on these issues.But as we find areas for prudent disengagement, we should bear in mind that unwinding the complex web of connections between our countries -- people, hardware, supply chains, investments, research -- will have costs, and possibly consequences we don't foresee, for our economy and research system. We should take careful stock of our choices.The way to technology leadership is a dual path: better protect our innovations, and outinnovate our competitors. The best outcome is having U.S. tech firms out-compete their global competition on a more level playing field to win greater market share, and to integrate that worldleading technology into our government agencies to use in national security missions.We also need to reframe the bilateral disputes in a more global context. Technology developments, especially in AI applications and 5G infrastructure, are pointing toward a world that risks becoming divided into technological and ideological spheres of influence. This world would have American and Western technologies predominant in some regions and Chinese systems more established in others. We do not seek a divided world, but neither do we want to live in a world shaped by China's view of the relationship between technology and governance.For example, Chinese companies already supply AI surveillance technology to 63 countries, according to a recent study./10China's so-called "digital silk road" initiative could provide technology infrastructure to enable more governments to impose the authoritarian norms found in China -- including the disappearance of individual privacy under state surveillance, and the repression of speech and expression through state censorship.My concern is that as China tries to fulfill a vision of high-tech authoritarianism, that governing model will appeal to other governments searching for a foundation on which to exercise their power. It is incumbent upon our country and other free societies to present a model of hightech democracy that is even more compelling and economically viable, because it preserves foundations of individual freedom.So U.S. technology leadership is imperative not only for our economic competitiveness and for our military advantage -- it is also imperative to uphold the democratic model of governance and prove its resilience in the face of technological changes that could be used to threaten it.What To Do NowLet me turn to some nuts and bolts of what the U.S. government -- and this Committee in particular -- can do to change current trends and extend U.S. technology leadership. The past year has seen several positive steps, such as the National Quantum Initiative, progress in the Energy Department's exascale supercomputer project, and NSF's new initiative to build a series of AI research institutes. Here are six proposals that would have a broad impact on new technology development in the United States. They focus on civilian investments, given the jurisdiction of this Committee, but they could also benefit military competitiveness. Many are described with more context or detail in the AI Commission's report.1) Funding: Overall federal R&D spending has not kept pace with technological change.Simply put, we need to place big bets. U.S. government funding for R&D has seen a decades-long decline, and is now at pre-Sputnik levels as a percentage of GDP./11For AI, the scale of investment should be multiple times current levels. In computer science in particular, more research funding is critical to help stabilize academic research and mitigate a brain drain from academia to industry. Student enrollment in computer science classes has skyrocketed, but universities aren't retaining enough faculty to teach this next generation.2) Nationwide Infrastructure: Given the interconnected nature of emerging technologies, we must invest in foundational infrastructure. This includes supporting a competitive and secure global alternative to Huawei in 5G, ensuring the U.S. microelectronics supply chain is resilient and assured, and investing in next-generation and high-performance computing.Congress should consider national models that have worked well, such as the National Nanotechnology Initiative. Launched in 2000, that effort integrated the work of 20 government bodies and prompted huge growth in the nanotech field, including a network of labs and research centers across the country.3) Flexible Grants: The United States graduates the largest number of science and engineering doctorates of any country. We need new mechanisms to accelerate expert research. Congress should consider models for multi-year investments in promising individuals, not just specific projects, as is done at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and through the Defense Department's Vannevar Bush faculty fellowships.4) Government-Industry-Academia Collaborations: Partnerships can help researchers overcome technical and financial barriers, as NSF is doing through its CloudBank initiative to connect NSF-sponsored researchers to cloud computing resources. This could expand into a nation-wide National Research Cloud. Congress should also explore tax incentives for companies to share data and provide computing capabilities to research institutions, and accelerate efforts to make government datasets more widely available.Talent Development: The United States needs major new STEM education initiatives at the K-12, college, and graduate levels. This includes expanding the existing STEM scholarship programs and designing new ones. We also need to attract more global expertise to America. Around 80% of computer science PhD students who come from abroad to study end up staying in the United States after graduation./12Students all over the world want to study here, and we should make it easier for them to stay. That helps our competitiveness. But more countries are trying to recruit science and technology experts - - not just China, but also friends like Canada -- through immigration and work incentives.Experts in fields like AI have highly-specialized skills and are in demand. The more competitive our talent retention policy, the better our chances to lead.6) Public Confidence: If we do not earn the public's trust in the benefits of new technologies, especially AI, doubts will hold us back. An international survey found that China has a huge lead in public confidence in AI: 70% of Chinese said they trust AI technology, compared to 25% of Americans./13Legislators, researchers, and tech companies need to confront the concerns Americans have, while also communicating the great potential to improve lives. That means, among other things, enhancing privacy rules, investing in security research, developing technical standards, and preparing for workforce impacts from more automation.In sum, U.S. global technology leadership is an imperative, and there are near-term steps this Committee can take to extend our leadership in new technologies beyond what many experts currently predict. The Defense Innovation Board has published many other recommendations, and the AI Commission is preparing more detailed prescriptions, and will provide them on a rolling basis as they are developed, leading up to a final report next year. Thank you again for the chance to appear today, and I look forward to your questions.* * *Footnotes:1. World Bank, "GDP per capita (current US$) - China."

A Global Perspective on All Things Waste and Recycling (Transcript)waste360.comFebruary 27, 2020Copyright 2020 Informa Business Media, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 6447 wordsBody[00:00:00] Liz Bothwell:   Hi everyone, welcome to Waste360's   NothingWasted! Podcast. On every episode, we invite the most interesting people in waste recycling and organics to sit down with us and chat candidly about their thoughts, their work, this unique industry and so much more. Thanks for listening and enjoy this episode.[music][00:00:26]   Liz:   Hi everyone, this is Liz Bothwell from Waste360 with Adam Minter author of   Junkyard Planet   and Bloomberg opinion columnist. Welcome, Adam and thank you for being here.[00:00:37]   Adam Minter:   Well, it's great to be here.[00:00:38]   Liz:   I'm so excited to have you on the show, I've been reading your work for years. You had an interesting childhood, could you share a bit about your background and how you ended up writing about the global waste and recycling industry?[00:00:49]   Adam:   Sure. I like to say I grew up in a junkyard, which is only a slight exaggeration. My family had been in the business since the early 20th century and my great-grandfather came over to the United States and started work as a rag picker. Eventually made his way up to Minneapolis and that's where the family business was, we had a small metal scrap yard. I worked there really as far back as I can remember, doing the simple tasks in the warehouse, sorting plumbing scrap, whatever it might be.In my 20s, I decided that business wasn't for me, I enjoyed the business, but I was not good at it, and the city of Minneapolis wanted to acquire the land from our company. I transitioned into journalism not thinking that I would actually ever return to scrap, but I eventually made my way over to China as a foreign correspondent. The timing was good, that was 2002 as many of your listeners would know, that's really when the commodity supercycle really started happening and really started driving up the price of scrap recyclables from all over the world, and the flow of scrap recyclables from developed countries into China, including from the US, really surged.I had this instant beat that I didn't know that I wanted to cover, I thought, "I'm getting from recycling, finally", but it was just too interesting story, it's not just about recycling, it's about trade and globalization and it became a big part of what I have done for almost going on 20 years now.[00:02:27]   Liz:   That's amazing. I've read your fantastic book   Junkyard Planet   a few years ago, you really were one of the first people to shed light on the multi-billion-dollar global recycling industry to folks outside of the industry itself. We all knew it was fantastic, but I don't think the mass media understood what was going on with this amazing industry. Were you surprised by the success of that book and the continued success of this book?[00:02:55]   Adam:   Yes, I did not expect it to explode in the way that it did, very quickly. Public Radio was very supportive and I probably should have figured that out from the beginning because Public Radio listeners are very interested in recycling. Once Public Radio discovered the book and I started doing Public Radio shows, I saw the audience growing and the interest in this topic growing.That was really gratifying, but what's really surprised me is that the book came out in 2013 and it continues to be demand for, we just did another paperback printing. That demand is coming from places I never expected, it's being assigned and a lot of geography courses, economic geography courses in universities, at business schools, and that's incredibly gratifying, not just for me personally, but I care about the industry and I truly care that people see it in the correct way, so if it's going in front of students, graduate students and people who are going to be engaging in sustainability and recycling on a very deep level, that's a really good feeling as a writer. It's been a surprise, but it's been a wonderful surprise, one of my career's great surprises.[00:04:05]   Liz:   That's great, good for you. You've lived in and traveled all over Asia, so you have a bird's-eye view of recycling conditions and what got us to where we are today. Looking back, China needed our raw materials but, when do you think the shift happened that made today's climate around the bans and regulations possible?[00:04:26]   Adam:   It's interesting. A lot of your listeners will remember things started getting a little shaky, actually, in the early part of this decade, that's when we started seeing some of these earlier bans. I remember as far back as 2008, hearing rumors from Chinese government officials, who would know what they are talking about, saying that there are serious discussions ongoing in Beijing about eventually ending the trade in recyclables.At the time I was shocked, because it was booming, this is before the global financial crisis, but at the time, what was being said was that, "Look, if we're ever going to develop our own recycling industry here in China, especially household recycling, we will need to stop competing against imported recyclables." All this talk about contamination, people think of recyclables from the United States or Europe being very low quality, and that's open to debate, but what isn't open to debate is that imported recyclables from -I'm just talking about the United States, but it goes for Europe or Japan- are especially important to household recyclables, are much higher quality than what's generated in China. That comes down to one simple fact and that there is simply no city in China that has a functioning Venus full recycling system where people are actually sorting their recyclables.By the theory of the Chinese government officials who I was talking to in the late part of the last decade, they really felt that they had to get rid of some of these imported recyclables because there were no incentives for private entities or government to start collecting from domestic recyclers. That, I think, is really where the stage was set. I know there's been a lot of talk in recent years that this was motivated by environmental concerns, that they didn't want to be importing foreign trash, but at least according to the conversations I had as far back as 10 years ago, the real concern was that they could not compete against the quality of the imported material.[00:06:34]   Liz:   Okay, that makes sense. I've heard you say, "Watch what they do, don't listen to what they say", it's easy to blame the contamination but the end, that wasn't actually the case.[00:06:48]   Adam:   Right. That's always the case and it's not just with the recycling in China. I cover other things in China, even still though I live in Malaysia and you always have to be careful how you parse Chinese government statements, there's oftentimes other audiences for them, you just don't know what the motivation is.We all remember the footage coming out of, say Southern China, it's been a few years of the so-called the e-waste dumping ground in Guiyu. The government would hide Guiyu and say, "This is terrible, the foreign governments are dumping their stuff", and then you would see very high-level Politburo members go down there, tour it and extol the sustainability benefits and how it supplies raw materials and reusable parts to the tech industry there.Recycling industry, in general, is never a black-and-white industry or black and green industry, though I think we'd all like it to be, it's very complicated and in China, the complications are even grander, you could say.[00:07:46]   Liz:   I bet. You heard talk of this back in 2008, is China any closer to establishing more infrastructure, like modernizing their landfills, incinerators or recycling systems? Or is the issues still the same?[00:08:02]   Adam:   They've really improved a lot. There's been a tremendous improvement, especially in the disposal systems. I'm talking largely on the east coast of China where there have been massive investments made in incinerator technology. At least on the East Coast, because the land is so valuable and so scarce for development, they're just not going to develop landfills anymore, though they do have some modern landfills. They are investing in good incinerators, they're very interested and have acquired Japanese incinerator technology and the Japanese incinerators are as clean as an incinerator can be. That's something that they've really improved quite a bit.In terms of the scrap recycling industry, it runs much cleaner than it did when I first arrived in China in 2002, you just don't see the open burning anymore, at least in the more developed regions. I don't want to say it's always gone, it's in a massive country, but yes, to your question, there has been improvement, but it's going to take time and it's a massive country with huge city clusters, it won't happen in 10 years, you're talking generational changes.[00:09:18]   Liz:   Definitely. How are they with public education about recycling? I'm just comparing them to Japan and Japan sounds like they're worlds ahead of the US in this regard, so just wondering how it is in China.[00:09:32]   Adam:   Yes, I spent the last time in Japan over the last two years for this next book and I consider myself a very conscientious recycler. The granularity of instructions in Japanese homes, on the street and where you put various containers had me doubting myself and feeling guilty. It's fantastic, they really have a public ethic and there's all kinds of reasons for their cultural recycling, but it's impressive and I think it's hard to replicate anywhere, I think they, in terms of that public education component, are the tops.China is not, like a lot of developing countries, most of the population still looks at recycling as an economic act, as something that can be put out inside their home and somebody will pick it up, so the environmental motivation isn't there. During my time in Shanghai, the government with some private entities tried several times, there were several efforts to start sorting programs, getting people to do the equivalent of a blue bin -who was never a blue bin- but getting people to think about sorting their trash. It just never caught on.The efforts were harmed as well by the fact that you can see this stuff being sorted and then the garbage truck comes and everything is just thrown together into the garbage truck. I saw that in Beijing as well. They've made efforts in the biggest cities, but these efforts -I don't want to say they're half-hearted- but they don't follow through on them, they may last six months to a year and then it just falls off.It's going to take time. Again, it's a generational change, it's a developing country transitioning, and at least in the big cities, I think, you'll see younger people start thinking in terms of environmental issues and sustainability, but it's going to take time.[00:11:31] Liz:   Definitely. I've heard you say before that China's got the circular economy down. Do you still think we can learn from them with what they're doing with everything from Christmas lights to iPhones?[00:11:45] Adam:   I do. Let me relate to an experience I recently had. I had an iPad Mini, the second generation one that had finally given up the ghost recently, it just was done. I didn't, obviously, want to throw it in the trash, I didn't want to throw it in the recycling bin. I spoke to my wife, she crossed her arms and said, "So, Mister. Recycling, what are you going to do?"[laughter]One easy option would be to take it to the Apple store. At the Apple store, they would have taken it for free, there's no trade-in value, it's a much older device, it would have been taken to a recycler and shredded and there would have been some raw material value taken out of it. What I ended up opting to do was I went on eBay and you could find the same model of older iPad Mini, people bidding on them 30$ to 50$. Most of the people doing the bidding had ethnic Chinese names, some of them were in California, so I thought, "Well, I'll see what happens" and I ended up selling it, with shipping, for a little over $50, that far exceeds. Yes, I mean, far exceeds what the raw material value is in that iPad Mini, everybody knows that.I didn't ask the guy who bought it what he was going to do with it, he was buying a lot of electronics I saw, older vintage electronics, but clearly at that price something was going to be reused, either the device itself, maybe it was going to be refurbished, whatever was not working anymore they would replace the parts in it and sell it in a developing country, or this person or whoever he works with would extract the parts and those parts would be resold, possibly as new, possibly as refurbished, we don't know.Of course, you can do that in the US, I think he was in San Jose, but that's a much more common thing to have happen in a developing country like China, which has a large reuse infrastructure, massive reuse infrastructure, mostly based in Shenzhen, where instead of looking at a broken device as something that should be shredded and what limited raw material to be taken out of it will be taken out of it, they look at an old device as a combination of older parts that can be reused.There is a massive economy, a multi-billion dollar economy in reusing parts in China. That is something that I do believe, not just the United States, but the EU, which is pushing very hard, circular economy initiatives can learn from. But it's hard as well because there's all kinds of issues wrapped up within that, including intellectual property issues. That makes it hard, but I do think that at least theoretically, there's something to be learned from this.[00:14:30] Liz:   Definitely. What do you think is the future of e-waste? As a planet, how are we going to deal with this influx as 5G comes in and we just know what's coming? Or at least we think we know what it's coming around the corner in terms of what we will be disposing of and it's a lot more than what we have right now?[00:14:49] Adam:   Yes. I'm both worried and not worried. Let me tell you the not worried side of it first. One, we often hear that e-waste is the world's fastest-growing waste stream. That's not true, the world's fastest-growing waste stream, if you travel around the developing world, is automobiles. Where people have gotten the idea that e-waste is it, small phones, I don't know, the growth in automobiles is enormous. That's a huge problem, and if you go to automobile recycling yards in the developing world, then you'll see a real problem, not the e-waste recycling yards.The second thing is I do have some faith that design for recycling, design for reuse principles, are starting to penetrate into product designer's and manufacturer's consciousness. I think that will be helpful, it's certainly very early, but 10 years from now, I think we'll actually see products being much more recyclable, much more reusable than they are right now. In fact, I would be astonished if it's not the case. Part of that, simply, has to do with the fact that the manufacturers are seeing economic incentives in it, especially with batteries, in memory modules, there's real value there. I think that value is there.The other reason that I feel very confident in the ability of the situation to get better is because the industry is so globalized now. I spent quite a bit of time in West Africa for this new book. West Africa has this reputation as being a dumping ground, people dump their stuff, I've never seen anything dumped in the recycling industry, I see it bought and sold, but not dumped. One of the things that happens in West Africa that I think has been wildly overlooked by people who profess to be concerned about this is the amount of e-waste that is exported out of Africa, specifically memory chips, CPUs, screens.Those modules, those parts, are being exported in many cases to Nigeria, where they're reused in new or refurbished devices, and an extraordinary amount of gold-bearing electronic scrap is being exported back to China. You have this robust trade, not just West Africa, but Africa in general, with West Africa and China, which is very keen to get that raw material so that it can reprocess it and it can be reused again, either as parts or as a commodity. China is rapidly upgrading its technology so that it can do this thing in an environmentally sound   way, they see an economic incentive for doing it.I'm very optimistic in that sense. It will everything be perfect? No, but I think there's a lot of reason to be optimistic. There are also reasons to be pessimistic, I think something that the recycling industry, the electronics industry and the automobile industry are roundly unprepared for is the recycling of electric vehicles. These are no longer going to be mechanical devices, they're going to be more akin to drones, with very few moving parts, a lot of silicon, a lot of high extremely expensive components, and it's going to require a revolution in how these products are disassembled, who owns them post first owner. I'm not sure how that's all going to shake out, especially in developing countries where the infrastructure may not be there to handle it. It's going to be complicated.[00:18:30] Liz:   That is and that's a good point, I hadn't even thought of that. I want to get to ask about your book, but before we do I wanted to talk to you. I loved your recent Bloomberg article that mentions the Norwegian government's proposal, it's intended to curb the tide of plastics in our ocean, it seems like the intention is noble but may be short-sighted. Could you share your thoughts on this and give our listeners a little bit of background about your article?[00:18:57] Adam:   Sure. Well, as we speak this week, in Switzerland there are the COP meetings, which are basically regular meetings of signatories to several conventions that are designed to restrict the export of hazardous waste to developing countries, one of these is the Basel Convention.Last year, Norway proposed amending the Basel Convention so that basically plastic waste would now be considered a hazardous waste. Once it's considered a hazardous waste, there would be restrictions on its trade. The intention is to make it harder and to create a more thoughtful process in how waste plastics ends up in the developing world. Norway, like a lot of other countries, would like to see fewer waste plastics going to the developing world.That's what the proposal is, it would treat waste plastics like arsenic, for example. The key provision, the way it would work would be, currently, if somebody wants the ship arsenic waste to a developing country, say from Norway, they would have to notify the developing country and receive consent to actually make that shipment. Under this new Norwegian proposal, the same procedure would exist for plastic waste.In my column, which was published few days ago, basically argues that this is going to not be good for the oceans, but in fact, it may actually increase the amount of plastics flowing into the oceans because it will inhibit the reuse of plastics, it would promote landfilling and incineration and encourage the use of virgin raw materials, all because it's going to make the transportation and trade in waste plastics harder.[00:21:01] Liz:   Right. Okay. Well, we will be following that for sure. Packaging is a huge issue in our waste stream now. How is the packaging situation there with Alibaba and other retailers?[00:21:15] Adam:   I would say it's reached crisis proportions, I'm sure you've seen some of the pictures and videos of what some of these Chinese warehouses and waste facilities look like after Singles Day, which is the single largest shopping day of the year in China and increasingly in Southeast Asia.Of course, there's a great amount of recycling infrastructure in China, and the paper recyclers, in particular, are keen to get all of that stuff especially because they can't get the imported material anymore, but that's not the extent of the problem, the bigger problem and one that the government is starting to panic about in China is e-commerce, our food delivery packaging. Styrofoam containers and other food delivery packaging that's basically enabling China's massive, there's nothing close to it in the US, massive, massive e-commerce-based food delivery system.There's multi-billion dollar companies now that are founded upon it and largely operate by delivering food from restaurants and by and large the packaging that they use is not designed for recycling. Even if it were designed for recycling, it would be smeared with sauce and everything else, and as we know well, in the United States and in Europe that's contamination. They're really at a loss right now as to how to handle this and it's going to be a bigger and growing problem.[00:22:48] Liz:   I like that. Now, do you think solutions like robotics and AI can help with some of the contamination issues? Or is it just not there yet?[00:23:00] Adam:   It's not there yet. I'm just talking about-- In developing Asia in general, outside of Singapore. Outside of Singapore, Japan, and Korea, the developed countries, there just isn't the waste sorting, it's not happening, you don't have the recycling bin in developing Asia, including China. Obviously, optical sorting and the various robotics, that's just not going to be an effective solution when you've got a massively commingled truck filled with food waste and other recyclables. So no, not yet, what China and other developing countries and Asia really need to do is they need to be able to build household recycling infrastructure so that they can get to the point where they can talk about robotics.[00:23:51] Liz:   That makes sense. You have a new book on the horizon, It's called   Secondhand. Could you talk more about that? I would love to hear about this one.[00:24:01] Adam:   Sure. Well,   Secondhand   really was born out of the last couple chapters of   Junkyard Planet, when I started looking at basically, rather than   [unintelligible 00:24:11]   commodities I started looking at whole things, clothing, a whole electronics,   [unintelligible 00:24:18]. What happens to these? Not when we dropped them off at the recycling center, but what happens when we drop them off at the Goodwill.It was a personal quest as well because, like most people in the developed world now, I lost a parent, and after you lose a parent part of the mourning process, frankly, is trying to figure out what to do with the stuff they left behind. I started trying to figure out what was going to happen to my mother's things after she passed away and a lot of them went to Goodwill, so I made it a quest to figure out what happens within the thrift infrastructure, the thrift industry. Where do things go? Is there a better way to do it?I just really wanted to explain to my readers what that all looks like. The book opens literally at a Goodwill donation door and I take you on a journey from the donation door, through the thrift system and around the world. Ultimately, it's also a book about consumption because it turns out -and I knew this and I think anybody in the recycling industry knows it- there's a real limit to how much of your stuff can be reused, whether it be clothing, computers, the glow sticks from that concert you just went to, whatever it is, there's a very limited amount of use for it.The book towards the end starts posing the question, "What can we do about this?" I argue that the problem we have -and I think it is a problem- isn't a crisis of quantity of stuff, but rather there's a crisis of quality, the quality of stuff is declining and because of that, the quantity is increasing. We need to start looking at ways to improve the quality of the goods that we're buying, in that way we can have a better reuse system and we'll also have less personal property flowing into the waste system.[00:26:07] Liz:   Did you see differences based on the geography of how people treated their things and [crosstalk]?[00:26:13] Adam:   Yes. This was a really exhausting book to do and a really fun book, it takes place in Japan, Malaysia, West Africa, Ghana, Benin and all over the United States. The twin cities, the Goodwill that I focus on is in Tucson, Arizona, and I spend quite a bit of time with traders there because Tucson's Goodwill system really depend upon traders coming up from Mexico, so I really show you how there has been so much of our thrift system, especially. Our thrift system in the United States is dependent upon globalized trade, if there weren't traders coming up from Mexico, that stuff wouldn't get reused.To a certain extent, everybody reuses in the same way, but what I think is surprising is that a lot of the stereotypes that we have about reuse, go by the wayside at least as I found them, I expect it to see far more reuse in Japan. But the one thing I consistently heard in Japan, home to Marie Kondo, is that they are far more wasteful than Americans, they actually go through things much more quickly, they're much more fashion-oriented. That's why you see something like Marie Kondo emerging there, it's not because of any heightened ecological consciousness, it's because they're consumers   [unintelligible 00:27:33]   a lot.It was really interesting and I spent quite a bit of time there with companies that are devoted to exporting Japanese property into developing countries because, I'm sure you know, Japan's population is shrinking, and as the population shrinks, they're leaving behind a lot of stuff. Well, where is all that stuff going to go? Well, it's going to developing Asia and Africa. The process of parsing that out, figuring out what works for use goods traders in Mali, as compared to use good traders in the Philippines, is very interesting to me.[00:28:08] Liz:   I like that. I can't wait to read it. It feels it could be just the US bias, but it feels there is a movement to minimize. Did you see that?[00:28:20] Adam:   Yes, I did. I did feel it and if you talk to the people in the thrift industry and Goodwill, they're feeling grow. Especially the kind of phenomenon ended up pumping a lot of secondhand stuff into the system, and there seems to be -and it's hard to quantify- but there seems to be a growing interest in upcycling and reuse. That's really interesting and that's really encouraging.One of the points of the book, however, it's maybe a little bit more pessimistic, which is to say, "Yes, you should upcycle and reuse, but you can't upcycle and reuse your way out of our current sustainability crisis, ultimately it's going to require a change in how we make, in how we manufacture stuff and how we buy it", meaning not buying the disposable TV, the one that lasts three years, but buying a better quality product that lasts longer. A washing machine that lasts 25 years instead of seven years in some of the warranties promises. It also refocuses things in that way.[00:29:29] Liz:   I like that, that's great. It's coming out in November?[00:29:32] Adam:   Yes, November 12.[00:29:33] Liz:   Can we pre-order on Amazon?[00:29:36] Adam:   Yes, if you look up, Adam Minter's   Secondhand   on Amazon, you'll find the page there and it can be pre-ordered as an e-book and as a hardcover.[00:29:46] Liz:   That's awesome. Okay, good.[00:29:49] Adam:   Thanks.[00:29:50] Liz:   You know that will be happening [laughs] for sure. Back to your first book, I know that you mentioned in there, I forget which chapter. Everyone thinks right now is the biggest crisis that we've ever had in recycling, but I know that you've reminded us on Twitter that's not necessarily the case, it's not all doom and gloom, there are solutions coming out of it. What do you think?[00:30:16] Adam:   Right. Well, yes, that's correct. One of my favorite parts of researching   Junkyard Planet   was actually going through the trade journal archives at   [unintelligible 00:30:27]   and   Washington DC back in 2012. I went back to the very beginning of recycling trade magazines, I think was 1905, and it was remarkable how many times over the next hundred years people said the recycling industry as we know it is over. "Prices are low, people aren't buying this anymore, there's quality issues", and you would see huge turnover in the number of companies and who owned the companies, but inevitably the recycling industry resuscitated itself. That is because, ultimately, there's value in these materials.The way they flow in the markets change over and over, but ultimately there will be value. There's a lot of people upset that these materials are now flowing into Southeast Asia, but they're flowing into Southeast Asia for two very important reasons. One, they can be reused, and two, they're cheap. They're cheaper than, in many cases, using the alternative. Those are the new markets emerging and perhaps the old markets are dying.One of the things that I think changed in the recycling industry is that many of the participants, the people are being hurt by this current crisis, entered the industry in the last 20 years. They entered as the commodity supercycle began, not just for recycling commodities, but also for virgin commodities, and they've never faced a real downturn quite like we're seeing right now. But if you talk to people who were in the industry before the supercycle, before the 1990s, they are starting to say the same thing, which is this industry as it is right now, with it's tighter margins and lower demand, reminds them of the 1970s and 1980s, where it was a shock to see a copper move 10 cents in a year, much less than a day.But these older entrepreneurs and managers all managed to make a living in the industry, it was just harder, it was an instant. I think some of these lessons that were learned in the '70s and '80s are now being relearned. I think five years from now things will be going better and we'll have much more experience. Harden, I guess you would say, our recycling professionals, and that will make for a more resilient industry.[00:32:45] Liz:   Definitely. Yes, there's definitely life. Now, do you think technology has shaped the global perspective on waste and recycling? You're talking about these videos and everything's shared on social media.[00:32:55] Adam:   Sure. Yes, in many ways I think social media has actually hurt perceptions of the recycling industry, simply because it's so easy to put a photo of, say, a young African man next to a broken computer on Twitter and say, "Look what happens to your developed country waste." There's no context there, it might be highly misleading, but it's an emotional image.This isn't just a problem with reporting on the recycling industry, but there's no context there, there's no nuance and it tends to get people angry and emotional, but it doesn't give somebody who might know how that computer ended up there and what the full story is. Maybe, it is a sustainable story after all, it doesn't give that person the oxygen, the room or even the tolerance to explain that at times. I've had instances where I've tried to offer some nuance to some very, I would say, explosive looking photos of recycling on the internet, and I know exactly what has happened there and it's not how people are taking it, I'll be subject to your usual Twitter abuse. It becomes not worth it.I think, in many ways, it's hurt the industry. On the other hand, I've also felt -and I have mixed feelings on this- I don't think that the recycling industry over the years has necessarily done a great job of telling its story to the mainstream. It's still, in my impression of somebody who grew up in it, it's an industry that likes to keep the gates closed and talk to itself.There's good reasons for that, but increasingly in a connected world, I think it needs to open the gates wider, be more willing to explain what it's doing and be willing to take that criticism while delivering a more nuanced message. It just has to because the alternative is you're going to let the Twitter mobs and advocacy journalists, who don't understand the economics of the recycling industry, control the narrative.[00:35:03] Liz:   Right. That's a good point storytelling is such a huge part of our lives now and I think the recycling industry is doing a lot of good things, and with storytelling being such a huge part of what we're all doing, regardless of industry, we all need to do a better job of communicating it to the masses because, to your point, otherwise you are going to have pundits and Twitter trolls telling your story, and it's out of context and not necessarily true.[00:35:31] Adam:   Right. Absolutely. I'm not trying to point fingers at all, don't get me wrong, I consider my responsibility to tell the story as well, also, sometimes I feel I haven't always done a good job, but I just think in general people associated with the industry should be willing to step up and tell these more subtle nuanced and, yes, personal stories out the industry.[00:35:55] Liz:   Hopefully, we will see more of that.[00:35:57] Adam:   The other thing I think is positive is a lot of brands and large companies, as they understand that sustainability can just be a label, they actually have to do it, they are becoming more involved in the recycling supply chain. Revealing it in good ways and explaining what it is in good ways. I think that's very encouraging.[00:36:19] Liz:   Yes. I think so too. To that point, I know that part of what you try to do is to elevate in China what you call The junk men and the junk people. Do you think that's happening now that sustainability it's so top of mind to everyone?[00:36:37] Adam:   I don't think so. To be honest with you, I don't, I don't know how I'm going to do it, but it's become a bit of a pet peeve of mine, is the language that is used around recycling, especially the term dumping. Because the term dumping it's a very powerful word, everybody assumes they know what it means, but amongst its many problems is that it takes agency away from the people who are actually doing the trading.As I said earlier, I've never seen a load of recycling dumped in a developing country, there is always somebody in that developing country who has paid for it, imported it, paid for the shipping as someone would pay for an Amazon package, and has an intention of extracting some economic value out of it. That story is never told. If you look at the way that the recycling stories have been told over the last year about the shift to Southeast Asia, you'll always see the recycling facility in San Francisco, and then the next image you'll see is the leftover waste in a field in Malaysia. But who is the person who got that through the port and why did they do it?Nobody is digging up those. They're not hard to dig up, they're right on the shipping documents. I think there's a certain amount of erasure going on, and I don't think that's healthy, I don't think it tells the industries truths or its stories very well. At times I think it also takes on a bit of a racial component because so much of the global recycling industry is mediated by people of color, they're the traders. Most of them, small business people, and yet mainstream media coverage of the global recycling industry erases them almost entirely from the story, and I think that's extremely unhealthy. It's something that needs to change.[00:38:32] Liz:   That, I hope it does. What else do you think we should be paying attention to around waste and recycling from your global perspective?[00:38:38] Adam:   One of the things that I found really interesting doing this new book was the opportunity to really dive into the state of secondhand clothing and textile recycling. What I found was a market that's extremely complex, that's very robust, that's as globalized as anything -most people in the recycling industry do- but it's also a market that's about to undergo a massive disruption for two big reasons.One, the world is producing and consuming more clothes than ever before. For a long time, it used to be that the buyers of second-hand clothes were in developing Asia and developing Africa, and the donors and sellers were in wealthy countries. Well, that's changing. China is now I think -or will soon be- the world's largest consumer of clothes. One of the things I found when I was in Africa is there are large shipments of Chinese secondhand clothing going into Africa. That is driving down the price of secondhand clothing globally, because there's all this new supply.At the same time as developing Asia and developing Africa get their own middle classes who want to buy new. I don't know how this is going to work out, but I spend quite a bit of time in the new book looking at this, there's going to be a real shift in how textiles and clothing are handled, whether people want them. I think inevitably technology is going to have to come into this.There's a big change coming in that market, and I think even people who aren't involved in secondhand textiles will feel it in other ways because I think to a certain extent it's going to be repeated in other markets that were dependent upon income inequalities to make the trades work.[00:40:21] Liz:   What keeps you busy outside of your work?[00:40:24] Adam:   What keeps me busy outside of my work? I got a four-year-old. As soon as I'm done with work, I head home and Sam I head out to the big field across from our home, kick around a soccer ball, just run like mad or jump on the playground equipment. He's my hobby, so there's work and there's my son. My wife would agree with this, whatever time my wife and I can squeeze in outside of what she does and what we're doing with our son, we do. I'm plenty busy and it's all good [crosstalk].[00:41:01] Liz:   What a great   [unintelligible 00:41:02]   enjoy every minute of that [laughs]. This has been fantastic, can you please let us know when you will be coming to New York to do your book tour for a SecondHand?[00:41:13] Adam:   I absolutely will. I can tell you right now, we were actually just discussing some of this on email yesterday, I should probably be arriving in New York on November 10th. There will be a launch event on the 12th and probably something on the 13th, as well. Yes, thank you so much for having me on, this is great. I really loved doing this.[00:41:28] Liz:   Well, Thank you so much. I can't wait for listeners to hear this, you've just given us so much to think about and your global perspective it's just amazing, thank you.[00:41:37] Adam:   Good. Thanks again for having me, we'll be in touch.[00:41:38] Liz:   Bye-bye.[music]Load-Date: February 27, 2020End of Document

Chinese academic suspended for plagiarizing PythonCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 22, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 362 wordsBodyOne of China's leading scientific research institutes suspended an academic after discovering that its "fully independently developed" programming language was based on a widely used precursor, Python.Liu Lei, a researcher at the Institute of Computer Technology (ICT) at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, announced last week that his research group developed a new programming language "independently," called Mulan after the legendary heroine, and touted him as to have "application for artificial intelligence and the internet of things."Days later, Liu wrote an apology to the national media for "exaggerating" his achievements. He admitted that Mulan relied on Python, a programming language whose components are available for free under an "open source" license, and designed primarily to teach programming to children, not artificial intelligence applications.The case comes as China renews its momentum for technologies developed in the country in the face of US threats to cut the country's technology supply chain. Last year, Beijing set all government offices the ambitious goal of eliminating foreign technology in three years.On Sunday, the ICT announced Liu's suspension, while "apologizing for the harmful influence" caused by the case."Labeling projects as 'independently developed' is sometimes a requirement to apply for government funding," said Wang Hanyang, founder of GAAS, an open source drone software project."That doesn't mean a project has to reinvent the wheel, but can still be used on the stage that China is isolated from the outside world. China needs technologies for such an eventuality, even if those technologies are not as good as those for international use," Wang added.Over the past year, the US government deployed a series of export sanctions from Chinese tech companies, for example, cut off Huawei's smartphone division of Google's mobile apps.But U.S. export sanctions have an exemption for open source projects like Python, which are designed to be available to everyone at no cost. The Chinese government said it wanted national engineers to engage with open source projects, in part to protect themselves from trade restrictions.Load-Date: February 26, 2020End of Document

Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, February 18th. Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.Apple's coronavirus warning this morning setting the tone for markets. The technology giant saying that the outbreak will hit sales. The stock is down better than 3 percent right now.Walmart had an earnings miss this morning as well. The company missed fourth quarter expectations. We are breaking down the numbers coming up. But this stock is well off of the lows of the morning. Nonetheless, it is negative.Futures this morning, lower. Take a look at Dow futures down 180 points. The S&P futures down 16 and the Nasdaq futures lower by 75.Apple is the big drag ahead of the open, set to cut about 85 points off of the Dow Industrials. Red (ph) out of the gate.Bloomberg is making the cut. The 2020 candidate qualifying for tomorrow's Democratic debate in Nevada. How he stacks up coming up.And then blue collar jobs in focus this morning. We are looking at the state of the American worker.And then this, scary mommies at Daytona. Nascar nation pray for driver Ryan Newman this morning after a terrifying crash at the Daytona 500 yesterday - - Sunday, rather. We have the very latest on his condition.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.And we kick it off with stocks. Take a look at this negative performance this morning. At the opening bell, we are expecting to see a deadline of about 180 points on Dow Industrials. Markets are back open after the holiday weekend and the markets closed yesterday. Indications are that we'll see a decline of 73 points on the Nasdaq right out of the gate and the S&P lowered by 16 and a quarter.Apple and its warning over the coronavirus really set the tone across the world. European indices are down across the board as well. As you can see, the FT 100 down 50 points, the CAC quarante in Paris down 31, and the DAX index in Germany lower by 107 points.In Asia overnight, in Japan, Hong Kong and Korea all down amid the coronavirus fears. Shanghai, the lone bright spot. It was up a fraction in China.Meanwhile this, Walmart reporting weaker than expected fourth quarter earnings. The stock is lower but well off of earlier lows.Lauren Simonetti with more number this morning where there were some bright spots in this Walmart report.Lauren.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and at one point, Maria, the stock even traded positive. So the reaction has really been all over the place.Let's -- let's start with the negative and that was the disappointing holiday season, disappointing clothing, toy and electronic sales. Their guidance for the full year also coming in short of what we expected.Now, now that excludes any potential effect from the coronavirus. I know that's interesting because when you look at a company like Walmart, 26 percent of what they import to stock their shelves comes from China. Good news is, most of that stuff is already here. But some analysts say, look, if you -- if you go to mid-April, for instance, you might see out of stock signs at Walmart and other stores.As for the positives, there are a few of those too. They increased their dividend by 2 percent. Online sales relatively strong. Food and delivery strong as well. But as I'm speaking, Maria, the stock, which, as I mentioned, had been positive at one point, is now down about 1.2 percent right here in the pre-market Maria.BARTIROMO: All right, Lauren, thank you.Joining us right now is Strategic Resource Group Managing Director Burt Flickinger.And, Burt, it is great to sees you, giving us your read on the consumer. Your reaction to the Walmart numbers.BURT FLICKINGER, MANAGING DIRECTOR, STRATEGIC RESOURCE GROUP: Deminimis. Down less than 1 percent. Walmart's made a strategic switch to consumable food, beverage. Most of their sales are fresh, refrigerated and frozen food sourced from the U.S.And what Lauren reported so well, the general merchandise that they import, those only turn one or two times a year. So the consumer is really not buying them much during spring and early summer.Walmart also invested in the best distribution system and supply chain, has more inventory at local than any other retail chain. So Walmart's well positioned. And as Lauren referenced really well, Walmart, this year, will be able to deliver to the homes of 90 percent of U.S. consumers. So even if consumer are afraid to go to the store, Walmart's better positioned than anyone to deliver to that consumer.BARTIROMO: Sounds like you're not worried about this miss on the top and the bottom line at all but --FLICKINGER: I've been a shareholder since 1983.BARTIROMO: But, Burt, there is -- there are examples of sort of this retail ice age --FLICKINGER: Yes.BARTIROMO: As you've put it in the past. Pier 1 Imports filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. You see a real bifurcated situation when you look at retail. Malls are in trouble and yet, you know, the high end is doing OK.Well, how do you assess?FLICKINGER: Malls are in trouble, but everyone who gives a shop are looking for a saving bargain tends to win. So if you look at anybody who's price impact off price, Costco doing well, Walmart, Target, Burlington, Ross, T.J. Maxx, Lowe's, led by dynamic new leadership, Marvin Ellison and Joe McFarland hitting 52 week highs.So, you're right, Maria, it's stick (ph) and ask (ph). It's the best of times and the worst of times, like a "Tale of Two Cities." So 20th century Roman empires of retail collapsing, where the modern retailers that give the best bargain for the shoppers who look for price discovery, those retailers are winning and will continue to win.LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, COLUMNIST FOR "THE HILL": Burt, after the Apple announcement everyone is going to be looking to see who else is hurt by coronavirus and China. As you look at the retail sector, what names pop out to you?FLICKINGER: That Checkma (ph) is U.N. team reported well last week.BARTIROMO: Alibaba.FLICKINGER: (INAUDIBLE) for Alibaba. So look at consumer electronics. Best -- Best Buy, Bed Bath and Beyond pre-announced, all the department stores without exception, even with good management. Kohl's soft and getting softer --PEEK: Because of sourcing issues.FLICKINGER: Yes. Sourcing and also America's going from 400 percent overstored to 200 percent. So to Maria's point, that's creating an unbelievable retail rationalization. And the Chinese luxury shoppers, whether it's Paris, London or the gateway cities of the U.S. -- or across Asia and Oceana (ph), losing that China -- Chinese luxury shopper is really going to hit the moderate to high end stores very hard.BARTIROMO: Well, this is what I've been talking about recently. And I think Apple's revenue warning rippling through the market is an indication that you've got parts and components of devises, computers, TVs, et cetera, those parts and those components are made in China. So they're going to have bottlenecks in terms of the supply chain.So is this -- is the market expecting this or is this going to be a surprise to the market where -- whereas we will see a big selloff coming?FLICKINGER: Maria, your prescient (ph) point is, no one other than you and team are reporting it. So the XRT, which is the S&P retail index, is near a 52 week high. And we're not --BARTIROMO: More room for error.FLICKINGER: We're not locally source. We don't have enough robotization (ph), mechanization in the U.S. It's coming. But people like Nike that have strip mind America for two generations have offshored all their -- all their sourcing and -- and many of the apparel and clothing and consumer electronics, all the way to auto, as you've reported well.BARTIROMO: So watch the autos. Watch the -- the Under Armours and the Nikes of the world.FLICKINGER: Yes.BARTIROMO: Watch these retailers who are getting stuff from China.We haven't spoken enough about the health care issue though.FLICKINGER: Right.BARTIROMO: We just had a whole conversation about the number of prescription drugs that come from China. That's going to hit some of the health care companies as well. That's another important point that we need to underline.FLICKINGER: It's going to hit health care and chain drug really struggling in terms of stock prices, CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens, Boots. That's going to struggle a little bit.And Walmart, Costco, Target is going to pick up a lot of that slack.BARTIROMO: OK.FLICKINGER: And also in terms of onshore, look at Asics. It's making everything in the U.S., in Byhalia, Mississippi, powered by solar. And Nike and the others who took away American jobs, they're the ones that have to worry.BARTIROMO: Yes.FLICKINGER: And Asics, they're sustainable and supporting U.S. jobs and that's (ph) a win.BARTIROMO: Well, Kelly made that point earlier, right, the fact that now we're going to see a whole new thinking about where to manufacture. This is sort of a -- they're being forced to -- to get a plan b.KELLY TORRANCE, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, "NEW YORK POST": Exactly. I'm not - - that's what I was wondering --BARTIROMO: Yes.TORRANCE: If you put -- if you had thought on whether this is actually, you know, in a way could -- could we see a renaissance of Americans manufacturing because people now see the danger of being so tied to a place like China?FLICKINGER: Kelly's bringing up an important point. We worked for John Bryan and Sara Lee, Haines, Champion, Balli, Knit (ph) Products for years and they were making all their products in North Carolina and in the south. And then Mr. Sam Walton first asked them to go to CAFTA countries in Central America, then People's Republic of China, literally to get a six pack of socks for one to two cents less.And now to Kelly's key point, you'll see sourcing onshore and at Cornell University, where I teach, there's a program like FIT in fashion and fiber innovation, so you can make everything here. With people, as well as robotics, so you don't have to go on water and have tremendous cost and the uncertainty Maria referenced well in terms of supply chain parts components.BARTIROMO: Interesting that that -- that there's a class for that as well.PEEK: Yes.FLICKINGER: Yes.BARTIROMO: I like that.Great to talk with you, Burt. Thank you so much.FLICKINGER: Great to team up, as always. And as you said, hearts and prayers are with Ryan Newman and his family and from Nascar.BARTIROMO: Absolutely. Yes.PEEK: For sure.BARTIROMO: Of course.Burt, thank you for weighing in.FLICKINGER: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We will see you soon.

We're taking a look at potential cancer risk from an unlikely source. Don't miss that when Dr. Mike joins us at 7:50.Then this, Bloomberg is making the cut. The 2020 candidate and billionaire set to participate in tomorrow's Nevada Democratic debate. More on the now polls plus Bloomberg's plan from Wall Street.Then this, economic war of words happening. President Trump and President Obama trading barbs over the economy. What they said coming up.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Making the cut. 2020 hopeful Michael Bloomberg is qualifying for his first Democratic presidential debate. It will be tomorrow night in Las Vegas. It comes as early voting is wrapping up in Nevada ahead of Saturday's caucuses with more than 26,000 early voters. But some fear in Iowa -- a repeat of Iowa, sounding the alarm over the technology being used to tally the votes.Let's talk about this here with the panel because this is going to be the first time that we actually hear Michael Bloomberg take questions and play with the others in the sand box.Liz.PEEK: High time to. Look, I think the DNC made a mistake noting having him engage earlier on because right now he's spent almost $400 million, or maybe even that amount, on ads. All voters know of him is this sort of plastic presence which is all very glossy and sounds terrific.But, look, all these things that have come out in the last 48 hours about redlining, you know, basically saying that was what the cause of the financial -- the end of redlining causing the financial crisis and all these things that are pretty questionable in today's environment. All his competitors need to be able to take him on, on that. And tomorrow they get a chance.TORRANCE: See, I wonder -- I wonder if they do.BARTIROMO: We'll see if they do. Wait -- wait, let's go do some of their things, Kelly. Let's go through some of his plans because we haven't heard a lot about Michael Bloomberg's plans, by the way.PEEK: No.TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, REALCLEARPOLITICS: No.BARTIROMO: But we've got Bloomberg taking on Wall Street now. The former New York City mayor sharing his plans to reform the financial services industry with "The New York Times." OK, here's what they are.His proposals include stricter banking regulation, taking on corporate crime, strengthening consumer protections, he says. He's also wanting financial transaction tax, Kelly, of the top one-tenth of a percent. And he wants to merge Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Your reaction.TORRANCE: Yes. I -- you know, it was not enough for him to come up with a $5 trillion over 10 years tax plan. He's -- to win the Democratic nomination, you've got to go left. And I have to say, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, he wants to add to its jurisdiction auto lending credit reporting. I mean this is something that shouldn't even exist.So for him to go that far. And, again, the financial transactions tax, you know, you're making -- again, making it more expensive to trade. I mean why does he want to hurt -- especially here in New York, which, you know, he's former New York mayor, he really wants to hit the industry. I just --BARTIROMO: Well, if he chooses Hillary Clinton as his running mate, though -- because you're not supposed to have two people from the same state --TORRANCE: Exactly.BARTIROMO: He said, no problem, I'll just say that I live in Colorado or Florida, because I have homes there. So there you go. The problem is solved.BEVAN: He's not -- he's not picking Hillary.BARTIROMO: You don't think so?BEVAN: No, I think that was actually probably if I -- you know, if I had to guess, it was probably someone from Hillary world who is spreading that rumor to sort of keep her in the mix.PEEK: Exactly.BARTIROMO: Or was it a distraction to "The Washington Post" story about Michael Bloomberg over the weekend about his misogynistic ways toward women?BEVAN: Could -- could have been that. I mean I don't think there's any chance that he's going to pick Hillary Clinton. And, quite frankly, I don't -- she may not even accepted it if -- if he offered it to her.But, look, here's the problem for Bloomberg, he was against a lot of these things. And right now Michael Bloomberg is facing this -- these revelations about him, statements about, you know, stop and frisk and we mentioned the thing about women and then he offended farmers the other days. These are not statements that happened 40 years ago when he was a young man. This is five years ago, seven years ago, nine years ago. And, again, he's going to have to stand on that stage.He's going to have to answer why he's now, you know, in favor of things he once opposed and vice versa. And he's also going to have to answer the question that Bernie Sanders is posing to him, and that a lot of Democrats are actually worried about, which is, why are you coming in here and trying to steal this election -- buy this election,. excuse me, with your, you know, $2 billion that you're willing to spend here.BARTIROMO: And we know how Bernie feels about billionaires.PEEK: We sure do.BARTIROMO: There should be none of them in this country.TORRANCE: Millionaires are OK because Bernie is a millionaire.PEEK: That's right.BARTIROMO: Yes, millionaire is OK but not billionaire.TORRANCE: Exactly.But I wonder if -- I mean I'm curious to see how tough they are going to be on Mike Bloomberg on that stage because he's promising to $2 billion even if he's not the nominee. So are any of them --PEEK: Which I basically don't believe for a minute.TORRANCE: Really?BARTIROMO: You don't believe it, Liz?PEEK: I don't. Well, look, the reason he's in the race is he can't stand Elizabeth Warren's platform. He can't stand Bernie Sanders' platform. So he's going to work -- he -- look, I think --BARTIROMO: Oh, yes, that's a good point.PEEK: I think this has been really an unfortunate chapter in Mike Bloomberg's life, because to Tom's point, he has completely reinvented himself. He's walked back and challenged everything he said in the past. Authenticity is a word we hear a lot today in terms of why Bernie Sanders is successful and others like Elizabeth Warren aren't. Authenticity with Mike Bloomberg is under -- under fire, I would say.BARTIROMO: Not only that, but what's difference about this list that we have not heard before, financial transaction tax? Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I always laugh when I hear Elizabeth Warren, you know, rail on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and how there's all this corporate crime. Wait, wasn't she running it?TORRANCE: It was her idea. It was her idea.PEEK: Well, she never ran it officially, but the truth is they never --BARTIROMO: She was running the Consumer Financial -- what -- what did she do?PEEK: They never found a single financial fraud. And, in fact, talking about getting into auto lending, if you remember, they did that. They charged the lenders in auto -- the people who were packaging up auto loans for desperate impact, if you'll remember that. It was one of the most horrendous chapters in that institution's life.So, honestly, look, Mike Bloomberg is Mike Bloomberg because of the financial industry. His industry -- his business grew out of basically charging financial companies. So he has no now tell everybody he doesn't really like the financial industry, even though that's what made him $57 billion.BARTIROMO: Absolutely.PEEK: Just a little --BARTIROMO: You are absolutely right.PEEK: Hard to believe, right?BARTIROMO: It sure is. Yes.PEEK: Yes.BARTIROMO: All right, we'll go -- I've got to get those polls from you. What polls are most important to you, Tom Bevan, we'll come back to that and what do you see out of those polls.And quick break and then an economic war of words to tell you about. President's Trump and Obama traded barbs over the economy over the weekend. What they are saying coming up.And then the best state economies. Where Americans are winning the money game.Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Now this, President Trump taking on former President Obama on Twitter over the booming economy. So first President Obama tweets this out yesterday, eleven years ago today, near the bottom of the worst recession in generations, I signed the Recovery Act, paving the way for more than a decade of economic growth, and the longest streak of job creation in American history.President Trump sees the tweet and fires back and write this, did you hear the latest con job? President Obama is now trying to take credit for the economy boom taking place under the Trump administration. He had the weakest recovery since the Great Depression, despite zero Fed rate and massive quantitative easing. Now, best jobs numbers ever.Had to rebuild our military which was totally depleted. Fed rate up, taxes and regulations way down. If Dems won in 2016, the USA would be in big, economic depression, he writes, question mark, and military trouble right now. The best is yet to come. Keep America great, writes the president.Joining us right now is media reporter for "The Hill," Joe Concha.Joe, great to see you.JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, "THE HILL": Hey, Maria.BARTIROMO: A really big war of words here. Your reaction?CONCHA: It doesn't matter what President Trump says and it doesn't matter what President Obama says. Listen to the American people in this situation.Six in ten say they're better off than they were three years ago. That's a huge number in an election year, right, because how do you run against that.Plus, what's the Democratic bumper sticker, you know, in terms of the economy? Capitalism versus socialism? You want to go with that? Or the Mondale rule of we're going to raise your taxes so we can pay for climate change?PEEK: Right.CONCHA: That's not going to work out too well.Here's another one as well, 60 percent of people say that they were better off three years ago. Forty-five percent said that under Obama in 2012. That's a 15 point jump. Ninety percent tell Gallup that they're satisfied with their personal lives.Here's the bottom line, the Obama argument is that, well, look at all the jobs you've created. That's easier to do out of a recession when your unemployment's at 10 percent than when you're at full employment. And those jobs are mainly in manufacturing, construction, productivity. All the places where remember Obama said you'll need a magic wand to get those jobs back.BARTIROMO: That's right. That's right.CONCHA: Well, apparently Trump has a magic wand.BARTIROMO: Right.CONCHA: And that's what's resonating in the states that matter, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, as Tom Bevan will tell you.BARTIROMO: Yes. And Tom made a great point earlier, saying, look, half of the Democrats who want President Trump's job won't even admit that the economy is doing well. You can't have it both ways, Tom.BEVAN: No, it's been one of the ongoing struggles for the Democratic Party, how they're going to take on Trump on this economy because if you look at his job approval rating, he's at 45 percent. But on economy, he's at 55 percent. And you can make the argument that that's more the real number because Trump is such a uniquely polarizing figure. And they -- they still haven't gotten their arm around it. And here comes Barack Obama to tell everybody, hey, the economy's great and it's my -- and it's because of me.TORRANCE: Has he spoken about doing that 10 years from now? I mean how long can you take credit for something.BARTIROMO: Yes. Especially since you said that, what do you need -- you know, what does he have, a magic wand? Where are these jobs going to come from?TORRANCE: Exactly.BARTIROMO: So Michael Bloomberg is now taking on the so-called Bernie brothers, Joe. What's your reaction to this? Former New York City mayor tweeted out a campaign ad on Monday calling out Bernie Sanders' supporters for social media attacks on him and other presidential candidate over more moderate policies.Joe.CONCHA: Yes. Look, the Bernie bros apparently are the new deplorables. Never a good campaign strategy to go after somebody's supporters because maybe if you get to a general election, you might need those people to beat a President Trump in these situations.And, by the way, you know, to talk about how people say mean things on the cesspool that is Twitter, yes, that happen. And I don't think you want to be going after somebody supporters at this point.PEEK: So do you think that Bloomberg is going to exhaust people with the advertising campaign? I mean I'm even over it and I live in New York where we're not even seeing it most of the time, right?TORRANCE: I have family in Canada who have seen Bloomberg ads. That's how many Bloomberg ads.PEEK: And are they going to the vote for him? Absolutely.BARTIROMO: Wow.CONCHA: Wow. What -- how many electoral votes are there in Toronto these days?BARTIROMO: Well, you -- during the impeachment trial, if you Googled impeachment, you got a Bloomberg ad.CONCHA: It's amazing. Right.BARTIROMO: I mean --PEEK: But does it get old? I mean --CONCHA: He's spent already $420 million in advertising. That's ten times as much as Bernie Sanders.PEEK: Yes.CONCHA: Remember, Bloomberg jumped in, in November. Bernie's been running basically since 2016. It's 100 million more than all the Democratic candidates combined. So, yes --PEEK: It's really amazing.CONCHA: He's finally going to be, I think, in a debate tonight. Remember, he hasn't done one from a media perspective --PEEK: Tomorrow, yes.BARTIROMO: Tomorrow night, yes.CONCHA: Tomorrow night, excuse me.PEEK: Yes.CONCHA: Where he hasn't done one major interview when you think about it. Sat down, taken any tough question from anybody. And now he'll be on a debate stage. And, believe me, he'll be the target, no question about it.BARTIROMO: Yes.CONCHA: And everybody will forget that Tom Steyer is also a billionaire.BARTIROMO: Especially since he is reversing many of his previous stances on financial regulation with these new regulations that the media was just given to today. And they include a financial transaction's tax, more rules toughens banking regulation, like the Volker rule, merging Fannie and Freddie and strengthening the Consumer Financial Protection Agencies.We've got a lot to dig in here.BEVAN: The bad news for Bloomberg is, he's going to get it from all sides tomorrow night, from the left and from the right.But the good news for Bloomberg is it's all going to be about him.PEEK: Yes.BEVAN: So if he has --PEEK: Yes.BEVAN: If he's able to parry these attacks, have good responses, come off well, it could boost his campaign.CONCHA: It's a -- it's just funny, right, that the guy they hate in the White House more than anybody, the billionaire, white, New Yorker, they want to, you know, now maybe nominate the billionaire white New Yorker --PEEK: Replace him.CONCHA: The woke party's going to do that? AOC is going to allow that to happen? Don't think so.BARTIROMO: Wow. What a New York story, by the way. You've got the real estate developer, President Donald Trump. You've got financial titan who built his business by, you know, connecting markets globally, Michael Bloomberg. And, potentially, Hillary Clinton also in the mix there according to Drudge. We'll see.Joe, good to see you this morning.CONCHA: Good to see you. Thanks.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Joe Concha joining us.Coming up, hitting Huawei where it hurts. The U.S. reportedly limiting its access to vital technology. The strategy coming up on Huawei.And then love hurts. Why too many partners could put you in an unexpected risk, if you didn't know that.

I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, February 18th.Here's a look now at the markets at 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Opening bell about two hours away and we are expecting a decline at the start of trading. Dow Futures down 158 points, the NASDAQ down 61, S&P down 13.Markets reopening after a holiday yesterday.

Cheryl, thank you.Meanwhile, folks on Huawei this morning, the Trump administration weighing potential trade restrictions on China that would limit the use of American chip making equipment to produce chip for the telecom giant. The American opposition against Huawei is a bipartisan issue.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warning European allies against allowing Huawei to build their 5G infrastructure. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): While some people say, well, it's cheaper to do Huawei. Well yes, because it's a -- people's liberation army developed initiative using reversed engineering from Amer -- western technology. So, of course, it's going to be cheaper to put on the market and if it's cheaper, they get the market share. And then they bring in their autocracy of lack of privacy and other --(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Of course, this is something that the president has been moving aggressively on. Joining me right now is former U.S. ambassador to Germany, Robert Kimmitt. And Ambassador, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.ROBERT KIMMITT, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO GERMANY: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: How big of a threat is China in your view? Tell us what the most important threats to focus on with regard to China are, including the Huawei issue?KIMMITT: China is kind of a major threat to the United States. It's a completely different system than ours. They've been quite clear that they want to be the dominant country in the world.I'd say the principle concern is that they are weaponizing their economy as part of their national security strategy. Huawei, Chinese investment into the United States and elsewhere are the leading edges of that.And I give speaker Pelosi credit. I was there at Munich when she said that. I think Europeans wanted to shrug off concerns about Huawei and 5G as something that was just part of the Trump administration battle with China. In fact, they saw that it is a bipartisan concern in the United States.BARTIROMO: The president along with the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been making these points for a long time about Huawei. And it's been hard to get Europe to change its stance because there are a lot of a Huawei infrastructures built throughout Europe, throughout Africa.Do you think that Europeans are finally understanding what it means to have a back door in Huawei where all of your data goes back to the Chinese communist government?KIMMITT: I think they understand it, but for some reason they're just averting their gaze. And they're saying our trade relationship with China is so important, we cannot say no to Huawei or China is going to say no to us.I think that is shortsightedness on their part, I think it's going to hurt them at home. It's also going to hurt the transatlantic trade on which they are so dependent.Think of it, how can we let European companies operate freely in the United States if they come from a country that has Huawei 5G in its infrastructure including the infrastructure of those companies they're going to be using?So I think, it's a little bit, Maria, if I may say it, a bit like Europe in the 1990s and 2000s allowing Iranian money to course through their financial system.Finally, we said you cannot do that and continue to operate in the United States. I think Huawei is going to be the new elicit finance issue between us and Europe on a going forward basis.BARTIROMO: And it's a great analogy because that was another hard one fight, getting the Europeans to understand doing business with Iran meant you're not going to do business with the United States.Look, you just mentioned Munich, you are just back from a trip to the Munich Security Conference, and also coming back from London as well amid a new back drop in Europe as the United Kingdom officially left the European Union last month. The west facing threats from Russia, China, what was your biggest take away from the Munich Conference, sir? And go anywhere, wherever you -- whatever struck you at that conference.KIMMITT: Well, the theme of the conference was Westlessness, picking up on restlessness it was Westlessness, that somehow the west has lost its way. That we don't any longer have common values, we're not working together toward common goals.I think that was a foolish statement to make. I think Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Esper were quite clear in saying, it's not a Westlessness, the west is doing just fine. But there is a restlessness for the west to produce results not just rhetoric and finger pointing.And I think one area where we could come together is a transatlantic strategy on how to deal with China. China is a fact of life. It will only be a tougher competitor on a going-forward basis. We need to find the way to work with Europe on traditional political military but also economic financial issues with regard to China. That's how you get rid of a feeling of Westlessness and again, start focusing on the results for which the alliance was known so well during the Cold War period.BARTIROMO: It's interesting that they would choose that as the title given the fact that it's the west that's doing well right now.KIMMITT: And that was the theme that Secretary Pompeo put forward was met with a little bit of skepticism.My sense right now in Europe, Maria, and I've spent a lot of my life there, is they are once again very much focused inward post Brexit, they have a lot of questions about where does European Union go from here? I think Britain is even wondering where it goes from here.I've always thought Europe is in a better place and we're in a better place if Europe comes together strongly, but on an outward looking basis. I think they have lost that outward focus that's so important for them and for us. It's not a lack again of western resolve. I think it's a lack of western result.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. Ambassador, great to get your insights this morning, thanks so much.KIMMITT: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Robert Kimmitt joining us there.Coming up, hitting the beauty industry. I will be speaking with the L'Oreal chairman and CEO about coronavirus and about business today. Its serious impact on cosmetics.Then Doctor Mike in studio talking about a potential cancer risk from an unlikely source. Don't miss that. Back in a minute with all of that.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The big business of beauty. L'Oreal is one of the largest cosmetic companies and top beauty brands in the world. The company announcing its strong fourth quarter, seeing major growth in the Asia- Pacific region.But L'Oreal is also warning that coronavirus could cause a temporary slowdown in the beauty market in China. And joining us right now is the chairman and CEO -- global chairman and CEO of L'Oreal, he is Jean-Paul Agon. Jean-Paul, great to have you this morning.JEAN-PAUL AGON, GLOBAL CHAIRMAN AND CEO, L'OREAL: Good morning. Thank you for having me.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us this morning. What a gigantic business that you run across the world. They have a great insight into what's driving business and the economy today. How would you characterize business?AGON: Well, business was very good. The last year was one of our best years in history. With a very strong organic growth, it was eight percent, gaining market shares everywhere, strengthening oppositions everywhere in the world.Our big brands are getting even bigger. You know that we have bigger American brands like Maybelline, Kiehl's, Ralph Lauren and many others. So doing business have been very good.BARTIROMO: Do you want to add to those brands and keep acquiring smaller brands that then ultimately give you more scale but also drive those brands, make them bigger?AGON: Yes, exactly, you're right, that's what we do. You know, what we do that we acquire small brands like Kiehl's. You know, we acquired Kiehl's in 2000. It was a $20 million brand and this year it's going to be $1.5 billion.BARTIROMO: Wow, that's terrific.AGON: So, that's a longer construction, globalization and make these brands known everywhere in the planet.BARTIROMO: So we've been talking all morning about coronavirus and the impact, Kelly, you wanted to jump in.TORRANCE: Yes, Jean-Paul, you know we're seeing a lot of -- you know, Asian companies and Asian beauty products have become a lot more popular over the last few years in America. Now, are you seeing the reverse American products -- you know really becoming popular there?And what about supply chain worries with the coronavirus? Where are your products made and assembled, that sort of thing?AGON: OK, that's two different questions. So, the first -- the first one, for example, we are making some American brands very popular in China, for example. Maybelline is the number one maker brand in China. Kiehl's is one of the top luxury brands in China. Ralph Lauren will be present too. So we are really making some of these American brands successful.And on the other question, yes, the supply chain is impacted. But we find solutions, and not of course, everything is made in China, of course.And for example, usually, you know, we manufacture in a country what we said in the country. So what we manufacture in China is only for China or mostly for China and the rest is just for the countries in Asia.BARTIROMO: How hard is it then to switch? I mean, if you -- if you got supply chain issues in China, what do you do in terms of manufacturing those products?AGON: No, we'd find other solution. But again, you know, it's not a global supply chain organization.BARTIROMO: Because you're selling it locally?AGON: Yes, we sell it locally. For example, in the U.S., we have our plants in Kentucky, in Arkansas and we are manufacturing 75 percent of what we sell in the U.S. in the U.S. And then we export from the U.S. to the rest of the world.And of course, we import few brands like I don't know (INAUDIBLE) for example, white sale. But globally speaking, the situation in China is not bothering us.TORRANCE: So you don't rely on just one country heavily like so many other companies do?AGON: No, absolutely not -- absolutely not.BARTIROMO: What about technology and artificial intelligence? How is that impacting cosmetics and skin care purchases? How do you implement A.I.?AGON: Yes, you know, there are many, many ways. One thing that is very interesting is that all the progress we made in the virtual reality. We bought a company, a Canadian company by the way called ModiFace and it has a fantastic capacity to do virtual reality online.So with this -- with this company, with this technology, we can offer consumers to test online on their smart phone real make-up.BARTIROMO: Yes. We did that story when you first announced it, that was terrific. I loved it.AGON: You can also do skin care diagnosis. You know, you take a picture of your -- of your face, and the artificial intelligence will tell you if your -- if your skin is perfect, what should you do if you have acne, what type of product you should use. So it's --BARTIROMO: It's amazing what you can do with your phone.AGON: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: Real quick, Jean-Paul, before you go, just characterize the rest of the year. Do you think this coronavirus is going to be an issue for increasingly, whether it's supply chain issues or even a demand story coming out of China?AGON: I think it's going to be temporary.BARTIROMO: OK.AGON: First, you know, do not forget its first human problem.BARTIROMO: Yes, of course.AGON: Human tragedy. But once the epidemic will be contained, I think it will be temporary. We have seen that in the past.You know, I remember in 2003 and 2015 there was the SARS and the MERS epidemic and so it didn't last too long. And the good thing also is that, after it finished, there was really bounce back of the -- of the consumption.So, we are -- we are assuming that the same pattern will happen.BARTIROMO: We love getting your insights. Jean-Paul, thank you so much for joining us this morning.AGON: Thank you very much.BARTIROMO: Jean-Paul Agon joining us, global chairman and CEO of L'Oreal.Coming up, too much fun leading to cancer? How increased intimacy can be putting your life at risk. We've got Doctor Mike on set weighing in about this report. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, your love life is now a cancer risk. That according to a new study out of England this morning that finds people who have had 10 or more sexual partners in their life have increased our odds of being diagnosed with cancer.Joining us right now is Doctor Mike. Thank you for being here on this. How did researchers make this conclusion? Take us through this synopsis.DR. MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, PHYSICIAN, FAMILY MEDICINE: So, they did a study where they looked at individuals out of the U.K. about 6,000 individuals over the age of 50 and they asked them a questionnaire. How many partners have you had lifetime and do you have cancer, were you ever diagnosed with cancer. And they came up with these statistics.Now, to me as a Family Medicine physician, this isn't that surprising. Because when you have more sexual partners, you're more likely to get a sexually transmitted infection, what we know as an STI.When you get one of these STIs like HPV human papillomavirus, you're more likely to be diagnosed with oral, anal, penile or cervical cancer. If you're diagnosed with hepatitis B or C, another STI, you can get liver cancer. So already there you have a high risk of developing --BARTIROMO: Wow, and men are at a higher risk.VARSHAVSKI: Women are actually at a higher risk.BARTIROMO: Women at a higher risk.VARSHAVSKI: Specifically because -- and this is our sort of assumption here, because their more susceptible to the HPV virus causing cervical cancer.This is a great time, Maria, to get a message out there. Let's get vaccinated against the HPV virus, get your Gardasil shot, that way you can actually prevent cancer from happening.I mean, we've never had that ability in the past. Let's get our children vaccinated, let's get ourselves vaccinated.PEEK: So there's an age cutoff for the HPV virus or vaccine, correct?VARSHAVSKI: Correct.PEEK: And by the way, this is a crummy story to have right after Valentine's Day, right? But I guess it's -- I guess it's better than to come out before Valentine's Day. But anyway, there is an age issue there?VARSHAVSKI: There is an age issue. Before we had the vaccine recommended for those below the age of 27, now we're expanding that into the 40s. So there is reason to get the vaccine. Talk to your doctor. Figure out what's best for you.And also, those who are having more partners also tend to have more bad habits smoking, excess drinking. If you are one of those individuals, it's easy to go see your doctor, have a conversation, figure out how to mitigate that risk. Perhaps we can get you off smoking. There's patches, there's gum, there's medications we can use, behavioral counseling. All those things can mitigate risk and make your sex life that much safer.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's very important point that you make that 10 partners over your lifetime exposes you to this risk.VARSHAVSKI: Yes, it's not so like -- there's some level of that does actual STI that's causing this risk. But sex itself is now its raising your cancer risk.So I don't want to scare people away from that. It's about your other behaviors and you can mitigate that risk.BARTIROMO: Doctor Mike, thank you.VARSHAVSKI: Thank you so much, Maria.BARTIROMO: Yes, Doctor Mike Varshavski.Coming up, Bloomberg's Wall Street plan, the 2020 hopeful telling voters how he would change finance, that's all right here next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

This was made known by the federal unit through the official Twitter account."These are all the people in that city who up to that point requested such support from the government of Mexico," the Mexican chancellery said in a statement.The Government of Mexico repatriates with the support of France ten citizens of its country who were in the Chinese city of Wuhan, epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak that has already caused at least 305 deaths, Mexican health and foreign ministryes reported in a joint statement.These people are all those who had requested the support of the Mexican Government to vacate the Wuhan area, both government agencies specified, stating that their cases meet the health criteria applicable to the 2019-nCoV virus outbreak.(Photo: Sergio Maldonado /Reuters/File)  (SERGIO MALDONADO/)"All passengers were medically tested to confirm that none of them had symptoms. On arrival in France, health protocols established by the authorities of that country will follow. Mexicans will continue to receive assistance until their subsequent return to Mexico," the text states.This official transfer is added to the arrival, this Saturday, of 18 Mexican students on a commercial flight to Mexico City International Airport (AICM) from Xi'An-Xianyang International Airport, in the Chinese city of Xi'an, capital of the Shaanx central province.These young people are part of a group of 52 Mexicans studying in China who, fearing contagion, will return to Mexico in the coming days at the request of their families.Mexican Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard had reported from this Friday on progress in diplomatic efforts to evacuate Mexicans in Wuhan, as the Chinese government had advised the other countries not to evict their citizens.(Photo: Sergio Maldonado /Reuters/File)  (SERGIO MALDONADO/)Some countries sent aircraft to the area where the epidemic arose to repatriate their citizens, while others chose to impose restrictions on the entry of people from China.According to Reuters, the tests carried out on a group of returnees on Sunday to France from Wuhan who exhibited symptoms of the new coronavirus were negative, the French government announced on Monday."The tests came back negative and therefore all these people could be transferred" to two centres in southern France where they will be quarantined for 14 days, the Secretary of State for Health, Adrien Taquet, announced on the BFMTV network.(Photo: Sergio Maldonado /Reuters/File)  (SERGIO MALDONADO/)In total, 254 people arrived in France on Sunday evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where a newcoronavirus that has already killed 362 people (361 victims in China and 1 in the Philippines).64 were French and the rest of thirty other nationalities.124 foreigners returned to their countries by plane.

CONFRONTING THE CHINA THREAT; DIRECTOR WRAY SAYS WHOLE-OF-SOCIETY RESPONSE IS NEEDED TO PROTECT U.S. ECONOMIC AND NATIONAL SECURITYStates News ServiceFebruary 6, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 435 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the FBI:FBI Director Christopher Wray speaks at the Department of Justice China Initiative Conference held February 6, 2020 at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.China is threatening the U.S. economyand national securitywith its relentless efforts to steal sensitive technology and proprietary information from U.S. companies, academic institutions, and other organizations, FBI Director Christopher Wray said today.Wray described the threat from China as diverse and multi-layered. He noted that the Chinese government exploits the openness of the American economy and society.They've pioneered an expansive approach to stealing innovation through a wide range of actors, Wray said during opening remarks at the half-day Department of Justice China Initiative Conference in Washington, D.C.Wray told the audience that China is targeting everything from agricultural techniques to medical devices in its efforts to get ahead economically. While this is sometimes done legally, such as through company acquisitions, China often takes illegal approaches, including cyber intrusions and corporate espionage.They've shown that they're willing to steal their way up the economic ladder at our expense, he said.The FBI is using traditional law enforcement techniques as well as its intelligence capabilities to combat these threats. He said the FBI currently has about 1,000 investigations into Chinese technology theft.They've shown that they're willing to steal their way up the economic ladder at our expense.FBI Director Christopher WrayJust last month, a Harvard University professor was charged with lying about his contractual arrangement with China.Wray also called for a whole-of-society response to these threats. He urged U.S. companies to carefully consider their supply lines and whether and how they do business with Chinese companies. While a partnership with a Chinese company may seem profitable today, a U.S. company may find themselves losing their intellectual property in the long run.Additionally, U.S. universities should work to protect their foreign students from coercion from foreign governments, Wray said.Wray noted, however, that these threats do not mean the U.S. shouldn't welcome Chinese students or visitors.What it does mean is that when China violates our criminal laws and well-established international norms, we are not going to tolerate it, much less enable it, he said. The Department of Justice and the FBI are going to hold people accountable for that and protect our nation's innovation and ideas.Load-Date: February 6, 2020End of Document

CHINA DETAINS HUI MUSLIM POET WHO SPOKE OUT AGAINST XINJIANG CAMPSStates News ServiceJanuary 27, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1120 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Authorities in the eastern province of Shandong have detained a Hui Muslim poet and author after he tweeted about the incarceration, surveillance and persecution of Chinese Muslims, both in Xinjiang and across China, RFA has learned.Poet Cui Haoxinknown by his pen name An Ranwas detained by state security police in the provincial capital Jinan on Friday, when families traditionally gather to mark the Lunar New Year.Cui is currently being held under criminal detention on suspicion of "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble," a charge frequently leveled at peaceful critics of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.It was unclear what had triggered his detention, but Cui has been an outspoken critic of China's mass incarceration of Uyghurs and other Muslims in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, where authorities have placed as many as 1.8 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities accused of harboring "strong religious views" and "politically incorrect" ideas in a network of internment camps since April 2017.While Beijing initially denied the existence of the camps, Chinese officials have more recently begun describing the facilities as "boarding schools" that provide vocational training for Uyghurs, discourage "radicalization," and help protect the country from terrorism.But reporting by RFA's Uyghur Service and other media outlets indicate that those in the camps are detained against their will and subjected to political indoctrination, routinely face rough treatment at the hands of their overseers, and endure poor diets and unhygienic conditions in the often overcrowded facilities.RFA has confirmed dozens of cases of deaths in detention or shortly after release since the internment system began, and while only a handful can be definitively linked to torture or abuse, several appear to be the result of "willful negligence" by authorities who do not provide access to sufficient treatment or of poor camp conditions that exacerbate an existing medical condition.Woman's story toldCui posted to his Twitter account on Jan. 12 about his reaction to the story of a Hui Muslim woman who was locked up in a "re-education camp" as she vacationed back in China from studying in the United States, her degree still incomplete."There are about one million Hui Muslims in #Xinjiang," Cui wrote in a series of tweets after reading her story, adding that he had narrowly avoided being sent for "re-education" himself in 2018."I was also requested to receive an additional check like that Hui girl in story, but I refused," Cui wrote. "That [was] outside JingGangShan airport on 8 April 2018."He also referred to the experience of a Hui Muslim friend in Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture in the western province of Gansu, who was told to delete a video from WeChat of the large-scale demolition of local mosques."There are several hundred mosques and facing the destruction on the large scale. One day, he sadly saw the scene and shot it. After he share the video on Wechat, he soon received the call of political police," Cui tweeted.He added: "[The] Xinjiang model is not a distant rumor. Muslim minorities live in the surveillance and fear."Cui was detained and questioned by state security police in 2018 over critical tweets, and warned not to use overseas social media or to become a "tool" of hostile foreign forces.In April 2018, Cui was sent on a weeklong 're-education course' in eastern China and was briefly detained in connection with his poetry and other writings that reference Xinjiang, it said.Jailed for 11 monthsThe Washington Post reported recently on the case of Hui university student Zhou Yueming, also known as Vera Zhou, who was incarcerated by authorities in Kuitun, Xinjiang, after she returned home to visit her father and submitted a college assignment using a banned VPN service to circumvent China's Great Firewall of internet blocks and filters.Zhou, 21, spent 11 months in a small cell with 11 other Muslim women with no trial or charges brought against her. She was denied proper medical treatment despite being a cancer patient.Inside the camp, prisoners were forced to sing revolutionary songs, and were banned from speaking any language other than Chinese. They were also prevented from practising their religion.Following Zhou's release, the Kuitun authorities confiscated her passport and kept her under surveillance for a further 18 months before finally allowing her to resume her studies in the United States.Her mother Ma Caiyun told RFA that her daughter has been traumatized by her ordeal and that the family has hired a lawyer in the U.S. to represent her interests."She has been very damaged by this thing that happened all of a sudden, as you can imagine," Ma said. "She is seeing a psychologist."School fails to helpBob Fu, founder and president of the Christian rights group ChinaAid said Zhou had been released to continue her studies after diplomatic pressure from Washington, but that she had been forced to sign a gag order before she could get her passport back."This shows the kind of religious persecution the Chinese Communist Party engages in a regime with no rule of law," Fu told RFA. He hit out at Zhou's school, the University of Washington, for failing to call for her release when it knew very well what had befallen her."It is shameless and chilling that they refused to make any representations to the Chinese government," Fu said. "It looks as if the University of Washington kowtowed to China to preserve its exchanges with them."The school currently has an exchange program with Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University and a Confucius Institute, run by the State Council's language teaching and cultural exchange office the Hanban, on campus.Zhou may be free, but her ordeal is far from over.The University of Washington has continued to bill her for tuition fees, and she is in default on her student loans since being incarcerated.A group of alumni appealed to the president of the university on Jan. 10 to throw Zhou a financial lifeline and to make public statements supporting her.The school has said there is little it can do, as Zhou is a Chinese national.The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) has said it is "deeply concerned" by reports that China "has turned the [Xinjiang] Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) into something that resembles a massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy" in the name of eradicating "religious extremism" and "maintaining social stability."Reported by Ng Yik-tung and Sing Man for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Wang Yun for the Mandarin Service.

China of 2020 looks little like the country it was when SARS emergedCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 1, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 593 wordsBodyA new coronavirus that originated in central China already killed 259 people and infected approximately another 12,000. The outbreak inevitably suggests SARS, which emerged almost 20 years ago in China as well.Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) killed nearly 800 people worldwide between 2002 and 2003, and at that time, the Chinese government received countless criticism for trying to cover up or minimize the outbreak.Since then, China and the lifestyle of its citizens have changed radically, implying that this epidemic has its own characteristics.- Tourism boom -Rising incomes have made China, where the population is around 1.4 billion people, the world's largest source of tourists in the past decade, according to the World Tourism Organization, to the point that Chinese tourists are a major source of income for many countries.The Chinese made nearly 150 million trips abroad in 2018, nearly ten times the 16.6 million in 2002, according to figures from the Ministry of Tourism.The travel boom has complicated efforts to control the spread of the new coronavirus, and Chinese authorities urged citizens on Tuesday to delay travel abroad.- Social media -China's connected population grew from 68 million in 2003 to 829 million in 2018, according to the national cybersecurity authority.The popularity of the social media platforms Weibo and WeChat has fueled the dissemination of misinformation and there are also netizens who share fake remedies for the virus and embarrass inept officials.The Internet has also become a battleground between authorities interested in maintaining stability and citizens claiming a cover-up.Eight people were reprimanded by Wuhan police for allegedly posting false claims on WeChat that SARS had resurfaced in the city.- More trips -China became a mostly urban country in 2011, and the country's domestic migrant population nearly doubled between 2005 and 2018 to more than 240 million, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.Every year, the largest influx of travel in the world takes place in China when workers return home for the lunar New Year from the cities where they work. Many of these workers are often excluded from the public social security system due to urban registration rules.The coincidence of the coronavirus outbreak and the holiday period has complicated efforts to control its spread.The authorities have established fever checkpoints at airports and train stations across the country and have extended the holiday period by three days.- Surveillance -With the increasing use of the internet and smartphones, citizens' daily lives are more monitored by the state.Recently, authorities have been questioned by certain surveillance systems: from security cameras with facial recognition to applications used by police to extract personal information from smartphones at points control.Chinese rail transport officers said Thursday that they had set up a department to gather information about travellers, mainly to know which people were seated next to an infected person during a train ride.- E-commerce -At the time of the SARS outbreak, Chinese consumers shopped almost exclusively in physical stores and shopping malls. Only 0.07% of purchases in 2003 were made online, according to the United Nations Development OrganizationIndustrial.Now, e-commerce and home delivery apps have become commonplace in Chinese cities and citizens concerned about coronavirus may choose to shop online rather than step on crowded stores where contagion would be easier.tjx/rox/gle/axn/ahg-bl/enLoad-Date: February 2, 2020End of Document

The Car Sharing Market in China, Forecast to 2025 - Market is Shifting from Traditional to Modern Travel, with the Penetration Enabled by Mobile Internet and Electric Powertrain SolutionsPR NewswireJanuary 24, 2020 Friday 9:15 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 957 wordsDateline: DUBLIN, Jan. 24, 2020 BodyPR NewswireThe"Car Sharing Market in China - Forecast to 2025"report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.This study analyzes opportunities and challenges in the car sharing market in China. It examines the current market structure and business models, as well as factors that drive and restrain the market growth. It also discusses the growth opportunities and trends up to 2025.Key FeaturesTo provide a strategic review of the car sharing ecosystem and market, involving main technology trends in China To analyze the key car sharing operators and their business strategies in China To identify car sharing market trends, such as strategic alliances and collaborative services To evaluate the present market size and the growth opportunities for stakeholdersKey Issues AddressedWhat is the present business environment for car sharing services? Who are the key participants in the car sharing market? What are the present and anticipated trends in the car sharing market? What are the market drivers and restraints influencing the development of the car sharing market? What are the policies and regulations established to manage the car sharing business in China?The car sharing market in China has approximately 30 active operators. These companies are operated by automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), transportation companies and start-ups. The top 5 operators - EVCard (by SAIC Motor Co., Ltd.), Weigongjiao (by Geely), GoFun (by Beijing Shouqi Group Co., Ltd.), MoreFun (by BAIC Mobility Co., Ltd.) and PandAuto (by Chongqing Lifan Automobile Co., Ltd.) - accounted for 72.8% of the fleet size in 2018.In China, the sharing economic activity has been able to achieve lower cost, lower entry barriers and lower pollution, as well as higher efficiency, higher experience and higher credibility within the industry. Transportation sharing activities, including car sharing and ride sharing, have accounted for 8.4% of the sharing economy in the country in 2018. The Chinese are also gradually shifting towards Internet applications for their transportation needs, such as reserving riding services from mobile apps, finding solutions to traffic blocks, and using real-time navigation and traffic services.The operation charge fee per service is the main revenue generator for car sharing companies. However, the Chinese car sharing market has been undergoing restructuring since 2017. It has witnessed a few exits, such as the withdrawals of Youyouyongche, Ezzy, and Togo, and some collaborations - for instance, BMW AG has collaborated with EVCard, while Daimler Mobility Services GmbH has tied up with Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., Ltd. to carry out car sharing business in the country.In line with the Chinese government's vision of increasing electric vehicle (EV) penetration and promoting green development, automotive OEMs are expected to further expand their EV sales through their subsidiaries in the car sharing industry. For instance, the car sharing market is expected to be more competitive, especially for the vertical value chain and ecosystem integration developed by automotive OEMs and transportation companies.Key Topics Covered1.

PEN America: China Detains Coronavirus ReporterTargeted News ServiceFebruary 11, 2020 Tuesday 8:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 659 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyPEN America issued the following news release:* * *- PEN America concerned quarantine is attempt to silence journalist Chen Qiushi* * *Chinese authorities have reportedly detained and quarantined citizen journalist Chen Qiushi, who has been reporting on the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan. PEN America said holding Chen incommunicado suggests he may have been targeted for his reporting, and that such actions jeopardize not just his rights but the rights of all Chinese citizens to access information about the epidemic."Given China's widespread censorship of stories about the coronavirus, PEN America is gravely concerned over the possibility that Chen has been arbitrarily detained and that authorities are using 'quarantine' as a pretext to justify their actions," said James Tager, deputy director of Free Expression Research and Policy at PEN America, "Even if Chen is ill, there seems to be no discernable reason why he can't use a phone or a computer, and yet his friends and family say they've heard nothing from him. The Chinese government must be transparent about why Chen has been detained, and if there is no compelling medical reason, they should release him immediately."On January 24, Chen-a lawyer, activist, and citizen journalist-traveled to Wuhan to report on the coronavirus outbreak. As part of his coverage, Chen posted a series of videos shot in Wuhan's hospitals and streets, as well as interviews with coronavirus patients and doctors. On February 6, Chen's mother posted a video saying that friends and family had not heard from Chen and asking for help locating him. Later that day, a friend of Chen's posted a video saying authorities had told Chen's friends and family that he had been forcibly quarantined, although officials apparently have not shared when or where this happened.Chen began acting as a citizen journalist in 2019, reporting on a flooding disaster in Ganzhou, Jiangxi province. In the summer of 2019, Chen went to Hong Kong to report on the ongoing protests there. Upon his return, authorities reportedly repeatedly questioned him and deleted all his domestic social media accounts. In December of last year, Chen shared on his Twitter, he attempted to travel to Japan but was informed by government officials that he was not allowed to leave the country."Chen has been targeted for his work as a citizen journalist before, and we fear that the exact same thing may have happened here," said PEN America's Tager. "If he has been detained for his work, this would represent not only an obvious assault on Chen's freedom of expression but also on the right of all Chinese people to have access to information about serious health threats. It already seems clear that the government's attempt to censor information about the coronavirus has potentially worsened the public health situation. We urge China's leaders to take a more transparent approach, and to refrain from targeting those who are speaking up about the coronavirus and the government's response."The outbreak of the coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan, China in late December 2019. A group of several doctors who first went public with information about the virus were reprimanded by police. Among the whistleblower doctors was 34-year-old opthamologist Li Wenliang, whose subsequent death from the coronavirus has resulted in online outrage and calls for freedom of speech. The government is still reportedly engaging in widespread censorship of coronavirus-related stories and news.* * *PEN America stands at the intersection of literature and human rights to protect open expression in the United States and worldwide.

Fiat Chrysler and Foxconn plan Chinese electric vehicle joint ventureStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeJanuary 18, 2020 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: HI TECH; Pg. 1Length: 458 wordsByline: Sandy MccarthyBodyAmbitious in his approach, Liu said that he aims to capture up to 10 percent of the market share in the electric-vehicle industry by 2025, or US$130 billion, as well as the digital health and robotics industries, through investments of about NT$10 billion per year over the next two to three years.However, it seems that the electronics company isn't exclusively based around smartphones as it is forming a joint venture with Fiat Chrysler (the automobile giant) to build electric cars in China.Speaking with Bloomberg,Foxconn chairman Young Liu said "Hon Hai will be responsible for design, components and supply chain management", but avoided providing more specifics."The proposed collaboration ... would allow the parties to bring engineering, manufacturing and mobile software technology together to focus on the growing battery electric vehicle market", said aFiat Chrysler statement.Intesa Sanpaolo analyst Monica Bosio described the possible deal as "positive", though it was not expected to have a significant impact on FCA fundamentals in 2020 and 2021.Companies like General Motors Co. and Toyota Motor Co. have entered into electric vehicle joint ventures with Chinese partners to leverage their experience in manufacturing low-priced vehicles.Talks were aimed at reaching a binding agreement "in the next few months", the company said.No offer for Eriksen yet, says Spurs boss MourinhoVecino's agent insists that his client is happy at Inter; he has also been linked with AC Milan and Lazio. On the win over Middlesbrough , Mourinho added: "3-0 was so close so many times".The joint venture was disclosed in a regulatory filing.However, the joint venture does not produce electric models, raising doubts it could meet China's tough emissions rules and green vehicle quotas. Initially, EVs made by this new pairing will be targeted at the Chinese market, but exports may be considered further down the track.Foxconn has been investing heavily in a variety of future transport ventures for several years, including Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride services giant, and Chinese electric vehicle start-ups Byton and Xpeng.Meanwhile, Great Wall Motor has agreed to buy General Motors' auto plant in India, the companies said on Friday, as the Chinese automaker expands overseas amid slowing domestic demand.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and PSA Peugeot announced Wednesday, Dec. 18, 2019, that their boards signed a binding deal to merge the two automakers, creating the world's fourth-largest auto company.The Chinese government has a credit-based system that encourages automaker to sell electric vehicles, leading to a proliferation of brands.The Chinese electronics giant is in talks withFiat Chrysler to develop and build electric cars in China.Load-Date: January 19, 2020End of Document

The race was originally supposed to be run on March 21st in Sanya, an island city in Hainan province.China has always been an important part of Formula E. The young racing series  inaugural race in September 2014 took place in Beijing, and Formula E also kicked off its second season in 2015 with a race in the capital city. Formula E returned to China during its fifth season after striking a deal to race on the streets of Sanya, and has raced there since. Formula E has also featured a number of Chinese teams and drivers in its half-decade of operation. The driver who won the first Formula E drivers  championship in season one did so while racing for the series  first Chinese team. And last season, Chinese team Techeetah won both the drivers  and teams  championships.The recent coronavirus outbreak started in China at the end of 2019. Since then, there have been over 362 deaths and 17,000 confirmed cases, the majority of which are in China. The outbreak has caused all sorts of disruptions, ranging from the Chinese government s lockdown of multiple cities near the epicenter of the outbreak, to the US government s recent refusal to admit foreign nationals who ve traveled to China within the last two weeks.Tags:See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21120981/formula-e-coronavirus-china-race-canceledContact Information:Sean O'KaneTags:, Artificial Intelligence Newswire, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: February 5, 2020End of Document

AMID HUAWEI SECURITY CONCERNS, SPANBERGER'S BIPARTISAN BILL TO BUILD NATIONAL 5G STRATEGY AND PROTECT U.S. TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS TO RECEIVE VOTE ON HOUSE FLOORStates News ServiceJanuary 7, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 624 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger:U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger's legislation to protect next-generation U.S. telecommunications systems and mobile infrastructure will come up for consideration on the House floor tomorrowWednesday, January 8, 2020. Spanberger worked to build a strong bipartisan coalition in support of her bill, with 11 Republicans and 16 Democrats cosponsoring the legislation.In November 2019, the Federal Communications Commission placed greater restrictions on Huawei and fellow Chinese tech firm ZTE due to widespread security concerns. According to a 2018 North Atlantic Treaty Organization report, Huawei's growing influence as a leading supplier of 5G technology could be exploited by China to engage in espionage, monitor foreign corporations and governments, and support Chinese military operations.The Spanberger-led Secure 5G and Beyond Act would require the administration to develop an unclassified, national strategy to protect U.S. consumers and assist allies in maximizing the security of their 5G telecommunications systems. This strategy would also identify additional ways to spur research and development by U.S. companies in a way that maintains reliable internet access for all Americans."As Huawei and ZTE aggressively work to expand their footprint in Europe and around the world, substantial national security concerns are emerging. As a result, many of our alliesincluding Great Britain and Germanyare demonstrating necessary caution before implementing these systems, and we need to do the same," said Spanberger. "That's why I'm proud to see my bill come to the floor of the U.S. House with strong support from both Democrats and Republicans, because we are long overdue for a national strategy to protect against threats from the growing influence of 5G-focused companies like Huawei. The economic potential of 5G infrastructure growth in the United States is tremendous, but we need to pursue this growth with all of the security risks in mindand my bill would make sure steps are put in place to protect against these cyber-threats."In May 2019, Spanberger introduced the Secure 5G and Beyond Act alongside U.S. Representatives Susan W. Brooks (R-IN-05), Tom O'Halleran (D-AZ-01), Francis Rooney (R-FL-19), Elissa Slotkin (D-MI-08), and Elise Stefanik (R-NY-21). Her bill is companion legislation to a bill introduced in the U.S. Senate by U.S. Senators John Cornyn (R-TX), Mark Warner (D-VA), and Richard Burr (R-NC).Spanberger's bipartisan bill was passed in the House Foreign Affairs Committee in October 2019 and passed in the House Energy and Commerce Committee in November 2019.Specifically, the bipartisan Secure 5G and Beyond Act would require the administration to build an interagency strategy to:Secure 5th generation and future-generation telecommunications systems and infrastructure across the United States;Assist U.S. allies and defense partners in maximizing the security of 5G systems and infrastructure in their countries; andProtect the competitiveness of U.S. companies, the privacy of U.S. consumers, and the integrity of international standards-setting bodies against foreign political influence.Click here to read the full bill text.BACKGROUNDThe Chinese government's "Made in China 2025" plan calls 5G a "strategic emerging industry." As of February 2019, Chinese tech companies owned 36 percent of all 5G standard-essential patents, whereas U.S.-based companies only possessed 14 percent of critical 5G patents.Last year, then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford called the potential risks of a Chinese-built 5G network "a critical national security issue" for the United States.###Load-Date: January 7, 2020End of Document

They are the Mexicans trapped in Wuhan, the Chinese province where the coronavirus appearedCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 26, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 905 wordsBodyA Mexican who is located in Wuhan, a province of China where the disease known as Coronavirus began to spread, has asked various Mexican authorities to support him in order to leave that country.The architect, Jesús Daniel Stamatis Portugal, requested the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico through his Twitter account to help him leave the country through the planes that mexico will be using to get U.S. citizens out of the Chinese province.Is there any chance I'll get on the plane that the U.S. sends Wuhan to its citizens? I'm mexican in Wuhan, with American Visa. President Xi Jinping announces that virus is accelerating. Thank you very muchThe Mexican's consultation with the embassy authorities came after the United States disclosed that it was organizing a flight to evacuate local diplomatic staff and other U.S. citizens at the infectious epicenter of the Coronavirus.This flight will depart from Wuhan and will have a destination for San Francisco. The country has a consulate in the province where the disease began and where the number of contagions has been highest. They stated that:The site is extremely limited and, if it is not possible to transport everyone, priority will be given to the people most at riskThe Mexican, a descendant of Chinese immigrants who lived in the state of Sinaloa, explained that he is an architect and has the necessary documentation to make the trip. In his Twitter thread, he asked for support from various authorities including President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and Chancellor Marcelo Ebrard. Faced with the message, and after it went viral on social media, Ambassador Christopher Landau said his case would be reviewed by consular attachées.WHO reported that cases of coronavirus have occurred worldwide (Photo: Reuters) (DAVID STANWAY/)Living at the epicenter of CoronavirusOn January 25, the newspaper Reforma disclosed that Jorge Vázquez Lujano, a student of the PhD in Materials Science and Engineering at Wuhan University of Technology, was living in that province.He explained that after closing the family and friends entrances and exits, they contacted him to find out his health. The national polytechnic institute (IPN) graduate said:I try to be calm and not panic, do my due and abide by the instructionsHe told the Mexican media that he and his roommates are constantly being checked by university staff to find out the state of health they present. Academic activities were suspended until further notice and raised concerns about the consequences of being isolated about first-hand items that might needMartha Bárcena, who is Mexico's ambassador to the United States, disclosed that the embassies of the two American countries are in contact with the Directorate-General for Protection to determine the options available to them.In addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (SRE) reported that both the Mexican embassy and consulates in China are already in contact with the Mexican community there to monitor health conditions, the control measures of the authorities and mobility options for co-nationals in China.Faced with China's entry and exit restriction...the place with the highest number of recorded cases (Photo: Reuters)" height"3350" src"https://www.infobae.com/new-resizer/lZ8dcc2JkIR2C91qeFL5LjT3mpA-/arc -anglerfish-arc2-prod-infobae.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KKXPYVFKWKKDVJTWWGAEHJDWSI.jpg" width"5024"/>The coravirus began in Wuhan Province, China, and is the place with the highest number of cases recorded (Photo: Reuters) (CARLOS JASSO/)The institution shared with its Twitter followers the Traveler's Guide, a document detailing prevention measures, coronavirus symptoms and contacts from the authorities in charge of the subject, but above all, it recommended that, in response to the measures restriction of access and exit that the Chinese government took, Mexicans avoided or postponed trips to the Hubei Province of that country.The prevention measures that the secretariat shared for the general population are:-Avoid contact with sick people, especially if they have respiratory diseases-Avoid contact with poultry animals, bats, raccoon dog, Chinese nougat badger and masked palm civet.- Do not go to animal markets or consume products from them.- Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds-Use hand sanitizer-When coughing or sneezing, cover mouth and nose with a handkerchief or with the sleeve-Eating meat products only if cooked wellIn the specific case of travelers to China recommended:- Seek medical attention if you feel sick, especially if you traveled to Wuhan, avoid contact with others.

Trade deal: US eases sanctions, China to buy more US exportsAssociated Press InternationalJanuary 15, 2020 Wednesday 10:21 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 365 wordsByline: By The Associated PressBodyThe United States and China signed an initial trade pact Wednesday, easing tensions between the world's two largest economies.A look at highlights of the 86-page deal.U.S. EXPORTS: China agreed to increase purchases of U.S. services and manufactured, energy and farm products by $200 billion this year and next. The arrangement means that China is supposed to buy $40 billion a year in U.S. farm exports. It's an ambitious goal. China has never bought more than $26 billion in U.S. agricultural products in a year.TARIFFS: The United States dropped plans to extend tariffs to an additional $160 billion worth of Chinese imports. That move, originally scheduled for Dec. 15, would have extended the tariffs to just about everything China ships to the United States. The U.S. also cut in half, to 7.5%, the U.S. tariffs on another $110 billion in Chinese goods. Still, the U.S. maintains tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese imports, nearly two-thirds of the total. It's a figure that would have been unthinkable before President Donald Trump took office and took a far more aggressive approach to China and trade. It is unclear what China is going to do with the retaliatory tariffs it has imposed on U.S. products.TECH TRANSFERS: China pledged to stop forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over technology as the price of admission to the Chinese market. Any transfer of technology must be made for business reasons and not be coerced. Still, China has sworn off forced technology transfers before.INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY: The agreement makes it easier to bring criminal cases in China against those accused of stealing trade secrets. It includes provisions designed to stop Chinese government officials from using administrative and regulatory procedures to ferret out foreign companies' trade secrets and allowing that information to get into the hands of Chinese competitors.The deal also requires China to come up with procedures to "permit effective and expeditious action'' to take down websites that sell pirated goods. China also must make it possible for e-commerce sites to lose their licenses for "repeated failures to curb the sale of counterfeit or pirated goods.''Load-Date: January 16, 2020End of Document

USING SOCIAL MEDIA TO UNDERSTAND THE VACCINE DEBATE IN CHINAStates News ServiceFebruary 26, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 423 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the George Washington University:THE SITUATIONVaccine acceptance is a crucial public health issue, which has been exacerbated by the use of social media to spread content expressing vaccine hesitancy. Studies have shown that social media can provide new information regarding the dynamics of vaccine communication online, potentially affecting real-world vaccine behaviors.A team of United States-based researchers observed an example of this in 2018 related to the Changchun Changsheng Biotechnology vaccine incident in China. The researchers found:Expressions of distrust in government pertaining to vaccines increased significantly during and immediately after the incident.Self-reports of vaccination changed from positive endorsements of vaccination to concerns about vaccine harms.Expressed support for vaccine acceptance in China may be decreasing.FROM THE RESEARCHER:"The World Health Organization identified vaccine hesitancy as one of their top 10 challenges of 2019. When combined with virulent illnesses, such as COVID-19 or influenza, small changes in vaccination rates could spell the difference between smaller, contained outbreaks and a worldwide pandemic. Governments and public health agencies around the world need to prioritize health communication efforts. Even the safest and most effective vaccine is useless if people refuse to take it."- David Broniatowski, associate professor of engineering management and systems engineering at the George Washington University.CONCLUSIONSThe new study, "Chinese Social Media Suggest Decreased Vaccine Acceptance in China: An Observational Study on Weibo Following the 2018 Changchun Changsheng Vaccine Incident," highlights the dangers of public perception of even a single vaccine safety incident, according to the researchers.The team also believes the possible emergence of vaccine opposition in China is a potential cause for concern, especially considering the density of several large Chinese population centers.2018 VACCINE INCIDENT IN CHINAIn July 2018, Chinese government inspectors determined that Changchun Changsheng Biotechnology, a prominent manufacturer of vaccines in China, had violated national regulations and standards when producing 250,000 rabies vaccine doses. The violation might have undermined the effectiveness of the involved vaccines. News began slowly escalating on Chinese social media platforms not long after the incident.PUBLICATION INFORMATIONThe study was published this week in the journal Vaccine.Load-Date: February 26, 2020End of Document

China investigates doctor's death that sounded alarm bellsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 840 wordsBodyBEIJING (AP) — Top investigators from the Communist Party of China on Friday addressed "relevant issues raised by the population" about a doctor who received threats from the police after making public his concern for the new virus and who has now died because of him. The announcement friday for the party came after the online controversy over the Chinese government's treatment of Dr Li Wenliang.The death toll in mainland China was at least 636. The outbreak has already infected more than 31,400 people worldwide.Dr. Li Wenliang, 34, had worked at a hospital located at the epicenter of the outbreak, the city of Wuhan, in central China. He was one of eight medical professionals in the city who tried to warn his colleagues and others when the government did not, with a message on December 3 in his account of Weibo, a social network similar to Twitter, which said he had seen a sample indicating the presence of a coronavirus similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). That outbreak killed nearly 800 people in an outbreak in 2002-2003 that the government initially tried to hide.Local police visited him a month later and forced him to sign a statement admitting that he had spread falsehoods, warning him of sanctions if he went ahead.The outbreak of the new virus has spread to twenty countries, unleashing travel restrictions and quarantines in different parts of the world, as well as a crisis within the country of 1.4 billion people."We are deeply saddened by the passing of Dr. Li Wenliang. We must all pay tribute to the work he did" on the virus, the World Health Organization tweeted.In the early hours of Friday morning, less than half an hour after the announcement that Li _ who in early January had reported his symptoms through social media _ was in critical condition, the hospital received about 500,000 comments, many of those who wished his Recovery."We're not going to go to sleep. We are waiting for a miracle," one of them wrote.Two cruise ships docked in Hong Kong and Japan with thousands of passengers and crew remained under 14-day quarantines. Japan reported 41 new cases on one of the ships, anchored in The Port of Yokohama, and rejected the arrival of another luxury ocean liner.Before all 41 cases were confirmed on Friday, 20 infected passengers were evacuated from the Diamond Princess boat in Yokohama, near Tokyo. Some 3,700 people are being held on the boat.Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced Thursday that the country will deny entry to foreign passengers on another cruise ship _ the Holland America ship Westerdam, which travels to Okinawa from Hong Kong _ on suspicion that potential patients travel on board. The Seattle-based operator of the boat denied that none of its occupants had the virus.According to Abe, the new immigration policy that will come into force on Friday to ensure border control to prevent the disease from entering and spreading further through the country.In China, a newborn who tested positive with 36 hours of life became the youngest person infected with the virus. The number of confirmed cases worldwide stands at more than 31,000. The way the baby was infected was not immediately clear."The baby was separated from the mother immediately after birth and was under artificial feeding. There was no direct contact with the parents, but he was diagnosed with the disease," Zeng Lingkong, director of neonatal diseases at Wuhan Children's Hospital, told Chinese television.According to Zeng, other infected mothers gave birth to childrenso it is not yet known whether the virus can be transmitted during pregnancy.Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke on the phone with President Donald Trump, who said the United States was working closely with China in the fight against the outbreak.Xi urged the United States to "reasonably respond" to the outbreak, echoing complaints that some countries are overly acting by restricting Chinese travelers. Those complaints come even when China keeps some 50 million residents of the hardest-hit city of Wuhan and its surroundings under indefinite quarantine.The White House noted that Trump "expressed confidence in China's strength and resilience to meet the challenge" of the virus.In recent weeks, Wuhan has built two new prefabricated hospitals and is adapting gyms, convention center and other spaces to accommodate patients with mild symptoms. Authorities also sent thousands of civilian and military medical workers to the city.However, those within a quarantine zone that affects about 50 million people are talking about a completely outdated health system.Chen Jiaxin, 22, told The Associated Press on the phone from Wuhan that his father fell ill on January 28 but had to return home because he was not accepted to any hospital. When he called an ambulance after his father's fever suffered Thursday morning, he was told he had 400 people waiting in front of him, Chen added.___Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo.

ATTORNEY GENERAL WILLIAM P. BARR ANNOUNCES INDICTMENT OF FOUR MEMBERS OF CHINA'S MILITARY FOR HACKING INTO EQUIFAXStates News ServiceFebruary 10, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 895 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of Justice:Remarks as Prepared for DeliveryGood morning. I am here to announce the indictment of Chinese military hackers specifically, four members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army for breaking into the computer systems of the credit-reporting agency Equifax, and for stealing the sensitive personal information of nearly half of all American citizens, and also Equifax's hard-earned intellectual property.This was one of the largest data breaches in history. It came to light in the summer of 2017, when Equifax announced the theft. The scale of the theft was staggering. As alleged in the indictment, the hackers obtained the names, birth dates, and social security numbers of nearly 150 million Americans, and the driver's license numbers of at least 10 million Americans. This theft not only caused significant financial damage to Equifax, but invaded the privacy of many millions of Americans, and imposed substantial costs and burdens on them as they have had to take measures to protect against identity theft.As described in the indictment, the hackers broke into Equifax's network through a vulnerability in the company's dispute resolution website. Once in the network, the hackers spent weeks conducting reconnaissance, uploading malicious software, and stealing login credentials, all to set the stage to steal vast amounts of data from Equifax's systems. While doing this, the hackers also stole Equifax's trade secrets, embodied by the compiled data and complex database designs used to store the personal information. Those trade secrets were the product of decades of investment and hard work by the company.Today's announcement comes after two years of investigation. According to the nine-count indictment handed down by a grand jury in Atlanta, four members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, or PLA Wang Qian, Wu Zhiyong, Xu Ke, and Liu Lei are alleged to have conspired to hack Equifax's computer systems and commit economic espionage. In doing so, they are alleged to have damaged Equifax's computer systems and to have committed wire fraud.This kind of attack on American industry is of a piece with other Chinese illegal acquisitions of sensitive personal data. For years, we have witnessed China's voracious appetite for the personal data of Americans, including the theft of personnel records from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, the intrusion into Marriott hotels, and Anthem health insurance company, and now the wholesale theft of credit and other information from Equifax. This data has economic value, and these thefts can feed China's development of artificial intelligence tools as well as the creation of intelligence targeting packages.In addition to thefts of sensitive personal data, our cases reveal a pattern of state-sponsored computer intrusions and thefts by China targeting trade secrets and confidential business information: hacks by a group known as APT 10, which worked in association with the Chinese Ministry of State Security, or MSS, to target managed service providers and their clients worldwide across industries; hacks by MSS intelligence officers who sought to steal intellectual property related to turbofan engines by using both insiders and computer operations, and; hacks by PLA officers who targeted victims in the nuclear power, metals, and solar products industries for the economic benefit of Chinese companies. Indeed, about 80 percent of our economic espionage prosecutions have implicated the Chinese government, and about 60 percent of all trade secret theft cases in recent years involved some connection to China.We do not normally bring criminal charges against the members of another country's military or intelligence services outside the United States. In general, traditional military and intelligence activity is a separate sphere of conduct that ought not be subject to domestic criminal law. There are exceptions to this rule, of course. For instance, we have brought charges against intelligence officers operating undercover in the United States. And more recently, we have charged state-sponsored actors for computer intrusions into the United States for the purpose of intellectual property theft for the use of their private sector, bank robbery, and interfering with our democratic elections. Like those cases, the deliberate, indiscriminate theft of vast amounts of sensitive personal data of civilians, as occurred here, cannot be countenanced.The United States, like other nations, has gathered intelligence throughout its history to ensure that national security and foreign policy decisionmakers have access to timely, accurate, and insightful information. But we collect information only for legitimate national security purposes; we do not indiscriminately violate the privacy of ordinary civilians.Today's indictment would not have been possible without the hard work of a dedicated team of FBI agents and federal prosecutors in Atlanta and here in Washington, D.C. In addition, the Department's Office of International Affairs provided valuable assistance in working with other nations to secure evidence located overseas. Notably, Equifax cooperation throughout the investigation was critical to our development of the case.I would like to now invite U.S. Attorney BJay Pak to provide remarks.***Load-Date: February 10, 2020End of Document

RUBIO URGES PRIME MINISTER BORIS JOHNSON TO EXCLUDE HUAWEI IN THE UNITED KINGDOM'S 5G INFRASTRUCTUREStates News ServiceJanuary 15, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 464 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by Florida Senator Marco Rubio:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, urged United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson to exclude Huawei and other Chinese state-directed telecommunications company products in their 5G telecommunications network infrastructure."While the United Kingdom has strong communication and cybersecurity safeguards in place, there are widespread and serious concerns that such measures are inadequate given what the United States, and other Five Eye partners, know about Huawei," Rubio wrote. "Ultimately, I have concerns about the impact that any decision to include Huawei in the United Kingdom's 5G network will have on both your national security, and the Five Eyes joint intelligence cooperation with the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada."The full text of the letter is belowDear Mr. Prime Minister:I write to urge the United Kingdom, our closest ally, not to include Huawei Technologies or other Chinese state-directed telecommunications company products in your fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications network infrastructure. As you know, Huawei is not a standard private-sector company. There is ample evidence to suggest that no major Chinese company is independent of the Chinese Government and Communist Party, and Huawei, which China's government and military tout as a "national champion," is no exception.While the United Kingdom has strong communication and cybersecurity safeguards in place, there are widespread and serious concerns that such measures are inadequate given what the United States, and other Five Eye partners, know about Huawei. Ultimately, I have concerns about the impact that any decision to include Huawei in the United Kingdom's 5G network will have on both your national security, and the Five Eyes joint intelligence cooperation with the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.Although Huawei's equipment may be cheaper than its competitors' today, the cost of mitigating risks on such equipment will increase over time. More secure equipment from trustworthy suppliers will yield affordability over the equipment's lifetime and help ensure sensitive data is not easily accessible to Chinese operators. Additionally, the cost of replacing such equipment if China exploits Huawei's access should be a factor in your government's deliberations.Considering the strong concerns shared by U.S. and U.K. intelligence agencies on the risks posed by Chinese telecommunications equipment, I hope that you will promptly reject Huawei's inclusion in any aspect of the United Kingdom's 5G introduction and development.Thank you for your attention to this important matter.Load-Date: January 20, 2020End of Document

To combat misinformation about the virus, which has sickened thousands and led to more than 500 deaths, the Annenberg Public Policy Center's FactCheck.org has published a series of articles countering common misunderstandings and mistruths.FactCheck.org's work debunking coronavirus myths has been cited by news organizations across the world and its fact-checkers have been interviewed by English-language stations serving Korean and Chinese audiences.China's National Health Commission first reported the coronavirus outbreak in the city of Wuhan on December 31, 2019. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency to help mobilize international aid and political support to contain the outbreak. By Feb. 6, 565 people had died from the virus, two in Hong Kong and the Philippines and the rest in China, according to the New York Times. Globally, 28,285 cases were confirmed and an additional 24,702 cases were suspected, according to MSN.com.Despite the facts, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and other social media sites have been used to spread false claims about the scale of the virus, with some posts declaring that as many as 10,000 people had died from infection, as well as conspiracy theories about the virus's origin. Here are some of the most prevalent coronavirus myths, as debunked by the team at FactCheck.org:This illustration, created at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), reveals ultrastructural morphology exhibited by coronaviruses. Credit: Alissa Eckert, MS, Dan Higgins, MAM.Some social media posts claim that a vaccine is available for the coronavirus. That's "bogus" (Matthew Frieman, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Maryland). These posts refer to patents for different viruses. (See Social Media Posts Spread Bogus Coronavirus Conspiracy Theory)A Facebook post falsely blamed comedian and actor Sam Hyde for the spread of the new coronavirus. Though researchers are still working to determine its source, evidence indicates that the virus's origin was zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans), not the result of bioterrorism, as the post claims. (Comedian Sam Hyde Not 'Behind' Spread of Coronavirus)Social media sites and blogs have propagated the myth that "thousands" to "10,000" deaths from the coronavirus had gone unreported because of Chinese government censorship. When FactCheck.org published its story on Jan. 27, the estimated death toll was 81. (Misinformation on Coronavirus Death Toll)Social media posts erroneously claimed that a Chinese husband-and-wife spy team working in a Canadian government lab sent "pathogens to the Wuhan facility" before the outbreak of the coronavirus. FactCheck.org contacted spokespeople for Canada's Public Health Agency and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police; both agencies decried the claims as false. (Coronavirus Wasn't Sent by 'Spy' From Canada)The conspiracy theory website InfoWars distorted the findings of a Gates Foundation emergency preparedness exercise to claim that "GATES FOUNDATION and OTHERS PREDICTED UP TO 65 MILLION DEATHS." The Gates Foundation's exercise dealt with a "very severe" pandemic involving a fictional virus, not the novel coronavirus, and the exercise did not make predictions about death tolls. (New Coronavirus Wasn't 'Predicted' In Simulation)Posts on Twitter and Facebook falsely suggest that because Clorox and Lysol products list "Human Coronavirus" on their bottles, the novel coronavirus was already known by scientists. In this case, "Human Coronavirus" refers to a group of viruses, and Clorox and Lysol products were tested against a strain of human coronavirus that causes the human cold, not the novel coronavirus behind the outbreak in Wuhan. (No, Clorox and Lysol Didn't Already 'Know' About New Coronavirus)In a comprehensive QandA, FactCheck.org sums up what is known about the novel coronavirus's origins, symptoms, death toll, transmission, and U.S. cases. (QandA on the Wuhan Coronavirus)The complete series of posts on coronavirus can be found here.Cited by news mediaThe articles, in which FactCheck.org debunks coronavirus myths, led by science writer Jessica McDonald and staff writers Saranac Hale Spencer and Angelo Fichera, have been cited on domestic and international news sites, including:"The false information was posted on January 21, and was still up a week later on a public page, despite being linked to in a story by the Factcheck.org about it and other posts spreading inaccurate information on Facebook. The post has been shared 4,800 times, and has 432 comments. One comment to the false Facebook post includes a link to a website that calls the coronavirus itself a hoax and suggests that drinking Corona beer alone will cure the virus. Facebook formed an alliance with media outlets and other fact checkers, including FactCheck.org, to help it determine what news was false and either remove the posts or label them as false." (Jan. 29, 2020, CBS News)"On Jan. 25, hedge fund manager Kyle Bass tweeted this version of the hoax. His tweet was retweeted over 12,000 times and has gone viral as a screenshot on Facebook. Factcheck.org, one of the platform's official independent fact-checking organizations, debunked it, and on Facebook, screenshots of Bass's tweet now appear with a 'false information' disclaimer. Eric Morrissette, a spokesperson for the Public Health Agency of Canada, told Factcheck.org, 'this is misinformation and there is no factual basis for claims being made on social media.'" (Jan. 31, 2020, BuzzFeed)"The nonprofit website FactCheck.org, which has a partnership with Facebook that allows users to flag fake news, has also been debunking false clams linked to the virus, such as one that claims that it was made in a lab and a vaccine was available."

Mastercard will be eligible for the card business in ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 12, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 274 wordsBodyUs bank card company Mastercard announced on Tuesday that it has received a "principle of approval" from the People's Bank of China (BPC) to prepare for the establishment of its business in the Asian giant. The company asked the Chinese central bank for its foray as a payment card entity through a joint subsidiary with NetsUnion Clearing Corporation (Nucc) and has a one-year deadline to finalize the preparations.  In this regard, the New York-based firm explained that it may apply within a year for "formal approval" to begin its business operations from the authorities.  Mastercard President and Chief Executive Ajay Banga said he was delighted with the Pcb's decision and said he will work "with the Chinese government and local partners to grow a global payment infrastructure. China is a vital market for us and we have reiterated our firm commitment to help drive a safer, more inclusive and more efficient payment ecosystem for consumers and businesses," he added.  Mastercard stressed that its collaboration with Nucc is based on "mutual synergies and will lead to a simple, secure and intelligent payment experience in a well-regarded market as one of the global pioneers of digital payment technology". It is not the first U.S. bank card company to get that green light to settle in China, as others like American Express also have a principle of approval, but the decision indicates that Beijing is getting underway with what was agreed in the first-phase trade pact with Washington.  According to this agreement, the Chinese government must respond in a timely manner to such requests, something that us media say was not common.Load-Date: February 13, 2020End of Document

Rep. Timmons Introduces Bill to Counter China's Efforts to Expand 5G InfluenceTargeted News ServiceFebruary 13, 2020 Thursday 7:26 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 504 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. William Timmons, R-South Carolina, issued the following news release:Congressman William Timmons recently introduced H.R. 5698, the Promoting Secure 5G Act of 2020, which seeks to counter China's efforts to expand its 5G influence in countries receiving assistance from the international financial institutions."U.S. national security and economic growth will depend on 5G technologies in the near future. But these technologies also pose serious risks to U.S. national and economic security if they are not deployed properly," said Congressman Timmons (SC-04). "With an aggressive China attempting to construct not only their own 5G network but also other countries' networks, such as the United Kingdom, it is imperative that the United States have sound policy when it comes to financing and protecting wireless technologies around the world."With the news this week that The Department of Justice indicted four Chinese military members for their role in the Equifax data breach in 2017, it is clearer than ever that China will exploit any vulnerability to their advantage, and the U.S. must take the necessary steps to ensure that our national security is protected from the risks that China 5G technologies pose. With Chinese companies such as Huawei effectively operating as part of the Chinese Communist Party, U.S. foreign policy must respond. This legislation is a good first step.""Huawei is the Chinese Communist Party's attempt to set the 5G network standards for the future," said Ranking Member Patrick McHenry (NC-10). "We need a whole-of-government approach to counter the global security and economic threat that the regime poses. Congressman Timmons' bill is an important piece of this approach and will help ensure secure 5G infrastructure through multilateral financing, not backdoor vulnerabilities that the Chinese government will undoubtedly exploit."The Promoting Secure 5G Act of 2020 would establish a U.S. policy at the international financial institutions (IFIs) in support of financing for wireless technologies - including 5G networks - only if the technologies include appropriate security measures. This legislation would also require U.S. support for related infrastructure and policy reforms in countries benefiting from the IFIs, and it would encourage cooperation with U.S. allies to strengthen support for secure wireless technologies.The IFIs include the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and regional development banks such as the Asian Development Bank, African Development Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.The text of the bill can be found here (https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.congress.gov_116_bills_hr5698_BILLS-2D116hr5698ih.pdf&d=DwMFaQ&c=L93KkjKsAC98uTvC4KvQDdTDRzAeWDDRmG6S3YXllH0&r=gkSsiH5PpE2RqtW3kUBt6wxyAwFZuUlN7kJEQeXuFYM&m=RtqDTN6ACFN9QZho5vWcyJ5KKnw9dJ8A8AR9z6j0nKE&s=N2YL4nzkc164WoewOnLieGpCfTmOfrUzaYWceRK-Rrg&e=).Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7018249 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 13, 2020End of Document

US Charges Four In Chinese Military With Massive Equifax BreachThe FrontrunnerFebruary 11, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 456 wordsBodyThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution (2/10, Kanell, 895K) reports DOJ yesterday "charged hackers allegedly working for the Chinese government with the 2017 cyber attack on Atlanta-based Equifax," as "a federal grand jury in Atlanta returned an indictment charging four members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army with hacking into Equifax systems in a three-month campaign aimed at stealing the personal data of American consumers and the company's trade secrets." The Journal-Constitution adds that the "attack, arguably the worst theft of consumer data on record, led to the theft of more than 147 million credit reports." The AP (2/10) says "the hackers successfully" stole "names, addresses, Social Security and driver's license numbers and other personal information stored in the company's databases." The four accused are members of the People's Liberation Army and "are also accused of stealing the company's trade secrets, including database designs." Reuters (2/10, Chiacu, Bartz) quotes Attorney General Barr as saying, "This was a deliberate and sweeping intrusion into the private information of the American people."All three major network newscasts covered the story last night. ABC World News Tonight (2/10, story 6, 1:20, Thomas, 7.51M) said that "beyond the massive privacy breach, authorities say the computer attack is a part of a broader plan by China to commit economic espionage," the CBS Evening News (2/10, story 4, 1:40, Pegues, 5.01M) that "the FBI is worried the data the hackers swept up might later be used to target American intelligence officers or other individuals China sees as adversaries," and NBC Nightly News (2/10, lead story, 2:20, Costello, 6.41M) that the FBI "believes this could be part of an effort to gather information on Americans in government, the military, big companies, universities, to eventually target them for blackmail or even espionage. Could be years down the road."The New York Times (2/10, Benner, 18.61M) reports that the indictment "suggests the hack was part of a series of major of big data thefts organized by the People's Liberation Army and Chinese intelligence agencies." The Times adds "the information stolen from Equifax, which is based in Atlanta, could reveal whether any American officials are under financial stress and thus susceptible to bribery or blackmail." The Washington Post (2/10, Barrett, Zapotosky, 14.2M) reports that Barr "said China has a 'voracious appetite' for Americans' personal information and pointed to other intrusions that he alleged have been carried out by Beijing's actors in recent years, including hacks in 2015 of the health insurer Anthem and the Office of Personnel Management, as well as a 2018 hack of the hotel chain Marriott."Load-Date: February 11, 2020End of Document

McDonald's closes restaurants in five Chinese cities because of the coronavirusCNN WireJanuary 24, 2020 Friday 3:26 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 524 wordsDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  McDonald's has closed restaurants in five Chinese cities and is implementing new health protocols in the region as the deadly coronavirus continues to spread. On Friday, the company shuttered locations in Wuhan, Ezhou, Huanggang, Qianjiang and Xiantao --- all cities that have been impacted by the Chinese government's travel restrictions, company spokesperson Barry Sum told CNN Business in an email. At least 10 cities in central Hubei province are facing travel restrictions, including Wuhan, where this strain of coronavirus originated. "McDonald's restaurant operation in Hubei province runs normally in cities where public transportation is available," Sum said. "Staff and customers' safety is our first priority and we have comprehensive, precautious measures being implemented to all restaurant operations and office staff." It's not clear when the affected restaurants will reopen.At least 800 people have been infected with the virus, which has killed dozens. The respiratory infection has spread to Japan, Thailand and the United States, among other countries. Major cities including Beijing have canceled some or all major Lunar New Year celebrations in an attempt to prevent more illness and death. McDonald's "will maintain close communication with local health and other relevant authorities, actively implement any guidance by medical authorities for containment of the virus, and continue to work together to fight this epidemic," Sum said. In addition to suspending service, McDonald's is also enacting strict new standards to monitor employees for signs of the infection. The company shared on its Chinese social media platforms that "all restaurants are required to commence a system of measuring body temperatures of all crews upon arrival at work," adding that it has "established a reporting, recording and observation mechanism for employees traveling to and from Wuhan during the New Year Spring Festival." Employees with fevers or cold symptoms are to be sent home. Additionally, workers will start wearing masks and are being instructed to wash their hands and use disinfectants more frequently.The chain is also placing hand sanitizers in stores for customer use, increasing the frequency of cleanings in stores and instructing suppliers to take safety precautions, as well. McDonald's is betting big on China as a growth market. During an October call discussing the company's third-quarter earnings, former CEO Steve Easterbrook pointed to China as one of the best-performing international markets. During the quarter, he said, more customers went to Chinese restaurants and spent more compared to the year before. Chinese customers responded especially well to McDonald's digital initiatives, he added. Other global businesses are responding to the outbreak, as well. Shanghai Disney Resort is closing its doors during the holiday "in response to the prevention and control of the disease outbreak." It's not clear when the park will reopen. ---- CNN Business' Sherisse Pham contributed to this report. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Facebook and Google among companies banning China travel after outbreakCNN WireJanuary 29, 2020 Wednesday 10:14 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 688 wordsDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  Facebook, Microsoft and other high-profile companies have told their employees not to travel to China as the deadly coronavirus continues to spread.The Wuhan outbreak has claimed more than 100 lives and caused corporations across China to shut down operations. Now, a slew of companies are limiting business trips to the country, with some telling their employees to avoid coming to work if they've visited China recently.Facebook told its employees to suspend non-essential travel to the mainland, in line with guidance Monday from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC's level 3 warning, its highest-degree alert, cautioned travelers to refrain from going to China. The social media giant also told employees who'd recently returned from the country to work from home for an undetermined period of time.Goldman Sachs took the same steps as Facebook. Microsoft also directed employees to defer trips and advised staff in China to work from home. The virus hadn't affected any of the software firm's employees as of Tuesday.Google also restricted travel to mainland China and Hong Kong. The tech company confirmed its offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen -- as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan -- had been closed for the Lunar New Year festival, and the company is extending the closures in light of the outbreak.Meanwhile, Ford banned travel to, from and inside China, telling employees who had traveled there to quarantine themselves for 14 days after returning. At Johnson & Johnson, employees can only travel to China for business critical situations and need approval from senior leadership, a spokesperson said. The company told staff returning from China to countries such as the U.S. to expect increased scrutiny, also asking them to work from home if they were coming back from Hubei Province, where Wuhan is located.Japanese car manufacturer Nissan is reportedly evacuating employees from its Wuhan-based operations. A spokesperson for the company told CNN Business that "Japanese expatriates and their family members in Wuhan will be returned to Japan on the Japanese government's charter flight, excluding some who will remain." On Thursday, a GM spokesperson told CNN Business that none of its employees had contracted the virus, and that it had restricted trips to China with exceptions for "business critical needs." The representative added that its offices and plants in the country have been closed since Jan. 24 for the traditional Lunar New Year festival.UK bank Standard Chartered also limited travel to China, telling employees to limit face-to-face meetings as well as any work in China and Hong Kong. It's also offering workers guidance on how to disinfect buildings and recognize the virus' symptoms.As of Tuesday, 106 people had died from the virus and 4,610 had contracted it, according to Chinese health authorities. The spread of the disease prompted Hong Kong to close its borders with the mainland, and it has led businesses such as Starbucks and McDonald's to shutter stores across China. The coffee company said Tuesday it was closing over half of its roughly 4,300 shops in the country.Starbucks and McDonald's to shut down operations in Wuhan. The Chinese government has imposed travel restrictions on about 60 million people. Johnson & Johnson is donating 300 boxes of its HIV medication Prezcobix to the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, which requested it after a research agency recommended testing to see if the drug could treat the coronavirus, the spokesperson said. Tech giants are also chipping in, with Microsoft saying it would donate 1 million renminbi to the Hubei Red Cross Foundation for relief efforts and Google's charitable arm giving $250,000 to the Chinese Red Cross.Five cases of the virus have been confirmed in the U.S., but the CDC said the virus was not spreading in the country and the public health risk was low. -- CNN's Donie O'Sullivan, Kate Trafecante, Eoin McSweeney and Cristina Alesci contributed to this report.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Melco considers its core operations to be those businesses where it is the managing and majority shareholder. This includes operations in Macau, the Philippines, and Cyprus and its efforts to obtain a license to operate a Melco-owned (IR) in Japan. Melco intends to continue its operations in these jurisdictions and carry out key investments currently earmarked for Macau, Manila, Cyprus, and Japan, including the construction of Studio City phase 2 and City of Dreams Mediterranean. Management attention will remain focused on these critical areas of Melco's business until such time as operations and business throughout Asia have returned to normal. As a result of this decision, Melco will not pursue its planned investment in Australia for the second tranche of shares in Crown Resorts Limited (CWLDY). It is Melco's belief that, at this time, its capital needs to be deployed on its core assets. CPH Crown Holdings Pty Limited and Melco have agreed to terminate the obligation to purchase the second tranche of Crown shares under the purchase agreement announced by the Company on May 30, 2019 and amended on August 28, 2019.

The first quarter is generally our weakest quarter of the year as we experience lower revenue per tractor and higher costs than the other quarters due to seasonal freight fluctuations and harsher operating conditions. While we see positive trends in certain areas, there continues to be uncertainty in the short-term environment, which will impact the actual sequential margin deterioration in the first quarter.

In contract drilling, our rig count averaged 123 rigs in the fourth quarter, down from 142 rigs in the third quarter.

The Group has strong capacity to generate cash flow and, in a 60 $/b environment, expects to increase it by approximately 1 B$ per year starting from 2019. The Group will continue to implement its strategy for profitable growth on the integrated gas and low-carbon electricity chains. LNG sales will benefit notably in 2020 from the start-ups of Yamal LNG train 4 as well as Cameron LNG train 3 and be more than 30 Mt/y.Spending discipline is maintained and the Group continues its cost reduction program with an objective of more than 5 B$ in cumulative savings in 2020. Net investments in 2020 should be on the order of 18 B$, and the Group will complete its 5 B$ asset sale program over the years 2019-20 (~3 B$ already announced). Organic production growth should be more than 2% in 2020, thanks to ramp-ups of projects started in 2019 and expected start-ups in 2020, notably Iara 2 in Brazil. Since the start of the fourth quarter, global refining margins are weak as a result of high product inventories and oil prices supported by OPEC. The Downstream will continue to rely on its diversified portfolio, notably its integrated platforms in Refining & Chemicals as well as its non-cyclical businesses. Taking into account the strong visibility on cash flow, the Group will continue to increase the dividend with a guidance of 5-6% per year. It will also continue to buy back shares, with an amount expected for 2020 of 2.0 B$ in a 60 $/b environment.Additionally, Total has divested its 27.5% interest in Fosmax LNG, operator of the Fos Cavaou liquefied natural gas terminal, as a result of a competitive sale process to Elengy, Fosmax LNG's shareholder with a 72.5% stake, that exercised its preemption right. The consideration for the transaction is around $260 million, including acquisition of a shareholder loan and excluding any earnouts. This sale of non-strategic midstream infrastructure asset will contribute to Total's objective of divesting five billion dollars in 2019-2020.05:26WIRES On The WiresCGG (CGG) and Fairfield Geotechnologies have signed a second cooperation agreement to acquire a series of large-scale, high-density, multi-client surveys in the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin located in West Texas.

Orders from the microelectronics market were well above a book-to-bill of one. We received new ELA system orders, and service revenues reflected increases in consumer purchases of OLED-equipped handsets. The wafer fab equipment market has accelerated over the past three months after two major chip manufacturers announced higher capex budgets for 2020, which contributed to better than expected bookings during fiscal Q1. The advanced packaging market is also trending up due to 5G investments in China," said John Ambroseo, Coherent's President and Chief Executive Officer. "The materials processing (MP) market took another step forward with a book-to-bill of one in a seasonally-adjusted quarter. Concerns about weak PMIs in the Eurozone are partially offset by strength in North America and a domestic-led recovery in China. Competition remains tough in the MP market, especially in China where domestic suppliers are gaining share through a combination of improved performance and reliability coupled with aggressive pricing," he added.16:20RYN Rayonier beats by $0.02, misses on revs (30.56 +0.70)Reports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.12 per share, $0.02 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.10; revenues rose 7.6% year/year to $178.8 mln vs the $193.18 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

In our Pacific Northwest Timber segment, we expect to achieve harvest volumes of 1.4 to 1.5 million tons, while we expect relatively stable pricing as markets have adjusted to lower log export volumes resulting from China tariffs and competition from European salvage volume. We remain cautiously optimistic that export market conditions in both Southern Timber and Pacific Northwest Timber will gradually improve as the U.S.-China Phase 1 trade agreement is implemented and as additional details of the agreement become clear, although we expect near-term headwinds associated with the coronavirus outbreak in China."16:19QNST QuinStreet reports EPS in-line, beats on revs (12.59 )Reports Q2 (Dec) earnings of $0.12 per share, excluding non-recurring items, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.12; revenues rose 13.4% year/year to $118.1 mln vs the $114.31 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus."We delivered record fiscal second quarter revenue.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+1.7%) and Russell 2000 (+1.5%) outperformed the benchmark index. The Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) underperformed in a rare outing, although it still closed at a new high.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors contributed to the advance, especially the energy sector (+3.8%) after weeks of underperformance and a nice rebound in oil prices ($50.85, +1.24, +2.5%). The real estate sector (-0.1%) was the lone holdout today.The bullish price action was driven mostly by optimism, particularly tied to the prevailing view that the economy is fine and any negative impact resulting from the coronavirus will be minimal. Aiding this sentiment were reports that progress is being made in developing a vaccine and economic data depicting a healthy labor market and services sector.Specifically, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January increased to 55.5% (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) from 54.9% in December. The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000).That's not to say that the coronavirus is behind the market, though. For instance, Walt Disney (DIS 141.37, -3.36, -2.3%), Nike (NKE 100.54, -0.84, -0.8%), and Capri Holdings (CPRI 33.31, +2.55, +8.3%) formally stated that the coronavirus will have a negative impact on financial results. The market is simply viewing the situation through a positive lens.In earnings news, Merck (MRK 85.83, -2.53, -2.9%) fell despite beating profit estimates. Ford Motor (F 8.31, -0.87, -9.5%) and General Motors (GM 35.03, +0.66, +1.9%) trended in opposite directions following their resultsOther story stocks included Tesla (TSLA 734.70, -152.36, -17.2%), which pulled back from its parabolic rise, and Biogen (BIIB 332.87, +49.58, +17.5%), which was awarded a favorable patent decision for a multiple sclerosis drug.U.S. Treasuries succumbed to selling interest for the second straight session. The 2-yr yield increased four basis points to 1.45%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.65%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 98.28.Reviewing Wednesday's economic data:The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January registered a 55.5% reading (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) versus a downwardly revised 54.9% (from 55.0%) in December. The January reading eclipsed the December reading as the fastest pace of expansion since August 2019.The key takeaway from the report is that it marked the second straight month of accelerating activity in the services sector, which is an encouraging sign that the U.S. economic expansion is poised to continue.The Trade Balance report for December showed a widening in the deficit to $48.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$48.2 billion) from a downwardly revised -$43.7 billion (from -$43.1 billion). Exports were $1.6 billion more than November exports while imports were $6.8 billion more than November imports.The key takeaway from the report is that the goods deficit with China decreased by $73.9 billion in 2019 to $345.6 billion, as tariff measures contributed to a $13.5 billion decrease in exports and an $87.4 billion decrease in imports.The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), with healthy gains across small, midsized, and large employers. In turn, there was a nice pickup in jobs added on the goods-producing side of the economy (+54,000).The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index rose 5.0% following a 7.2% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report and preliminary Q4 readings for Productivity and Unit Labor Costs on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +6.0% YTDS&P 500 +3.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +2.6% YTDRussell 2000 +0.8% YTD16:16GRUB GrubHub misses by $0.02, beats on revs; guides Q1 revs in-line, but Q1 EBITDA guidance is light; guides FY20 revs in-line (55.46 -0.53)Reports Q4 (Dec) loss of $(0.05) per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.03); revenues rose 18.6% year/year to $341.27 mln vs the $324.68 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Q4 adjusted EBITDA fell 37% yr/yr to $26.7 mln vs prior guidance of $15-25 mln and consensus of $20.8 mln.Co issues in-line guidance for Q1, sees Q1 revs of $350-370 mln vs. $365.85 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The company anticipates steel price volatility to decrease in 2020, as uncertainty caused by global and regional trade negotiations appears to have moderated after significant turbulence during the past two years and a prolonged steel inventory destocking in North America recently has come to an end.Ternium expects EBITDA to increase in the first quarter 2020 compared to the fourth quarter 2019, with higher shipments and a recovery in steel margin, mainly as a result of slightly lower costs.With marginally improving steel market sentiment in Mexico, the company anticipates steel shipments in the country to increase in the first quarter of the year after a seasonally weak fourth quarter 2019. Demand in Mexico's industrial markets remains stable and public construction activity in the country is beginning to show some signs of improvement. In addition, the recent ratification by the USA of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has reduced uncertainty, which should help foster economic activity and investment in Mexico in the years to come.16:40AWK American Water Works misses by $0.01, misses on revs; reaffirms FY20 EPS guidance (139.26 -0.06)Reports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.73 per share, $0.01 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.74; revenues rose 6.1% year/year to $902 mln vs the $928.56 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Currently, BIFMA is forecasting 2% growth for the coming year. That seems like a reasonable starting point for core growth, though it is quite a bit lower than the double digit increases in both the number of and dollar value of the projects we are tracking and the growth in the number of clients visiting with us. We have seen average order size continue to stabilize and believe some of that is a function of our ability to capture a greater portion of our client's workplace spend. If you add on approximately three quarters of Fully sales, you arrive at a mid-single digit top line growth rate for 2020.We expect gross margin expansion of 20 to 30 basis points during 2020, driven primarily by continued lean initiatives in our manufacturing facilities and supply chain, and favorable commodity pricing. Mid-term gross margin expansion will be bolstered by our manufacturing footprint optimization and we expect to begin recognizing savings late in 2020, but more meaningfully in 2021, delivering an additional 50 basis points of improvement. However, we do expect that the combination of a slight reduction in production capacity during the first quarter of 2020 as the result of our manufacturing optimization moves, combined with somewhat extended client request dates in our backlog, will result in a shift of revenue from the first to the second quarter. Additionally, while we have very little revenue exposure in China, we are watching any potential supply disruptions due to extended supplier shutdowns in China. At this point in time we do not see any material impact but understand that the situation is fluid.As we look out over the 2020 year, we expect EBITDA margin expansion to be more modest. Looking to 2021, we will move closer to our long-term goal of 15% consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin with the benefit of a year of savings related to the footprint and logistics optimization activities. As we continue to focus on debt reduction as a use of available free cash, we believe our average outstanding debt will be approximately $435 million during 2020, with an average interest rate of approximately 3.7%. This is reflective of the $250 million interest rate swap for 2020 and an average credit spread of 150 basis points. We expect our consolidated effective tax rate to be between 25% and 26% for full year 2020.As a result of the continued efforts around showroom enhancements to make the most use of our floor space to support the constellation selling strategy and residential initiatives, as well as investments in new product development and technology expansion for our e-commerce capabilities, we expect 2020 capital expenditures will be between $55 million and $60 million.16:23DT Dynatrace launches follow-on public offering of 25.0 mln shares of common stock by certain selling stockholders (35.14 -0.98)Dynatrace will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares being offered by the selling stockholders but will bear the costs associated with the sale of such shares.16:22KRG Kite Realty beats by $0.01, beats on revs; guides FY20 FFO below consensus (18.00 +0.08)Reports Q4 (Dec) funds from operations of $0.40 per share, $0.01 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.39; revenues fell 13.4% year/year to $75.27 mln vs the $73.17 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The market resiliently cut its losses during the afternoon, though, leaving the S&P 500 down 0.3% for the session.The Nasdaq Composite (+0.02%) eked out a closing record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) still finished lower.Apple specifically said it doesn't expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to the coronavirus restraining its supply chain and impacting consumer demand in China. The news didn't come as a surprise given similar warnings previously issued by companies, and investors presumably viewed the situation as temporary and China-specific.Investors, however, did assume some defensive positioning, evident by the gains in bonds, gold futures ($1590.00, +$19.00, +1.2%), and the CBOE Volatility Index (14.83, +1.15, +8.4%). The resulting decline in Treasury yields undercut the financials sector (-0.9%), while it benefited the utilities sector (+0.8%).The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.40%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.4% to 99.43. WTI crude inched up 0.1% (+$0.05) to $52.10/bbl, recouping its intraday losses.Microsoft (MSFT 187.23, +1.88, +1.0%) and Amazon (AMZN 2155.67, +20.80, +1.0%), which have a combined market cap of nearly $2.5 trillion, helped offset the weakness in Apple with 1% gains of their own. Both stocks extended their yearly gains to 18.7% and 16.6%, respectively, while Apple trimmed its yearly gain to 8.6%.Walmart (WMT 119.63, +1.74, +1.5%) also outperformed despite missing profit estimates.

In the first-quarter 2020, oil production is projected to average in the range of 158,000 to 163,000 barrels per day. Importantly, Devon expects to deliver this improved oil growth outlook with less capital than previously projected. The company is now lowering the top end of its upstream capital guidance by $50 million to a range of $1.7 billion to $1.85 billion in 2020. Furthermore, the capital efficiency of this investment in 2020 is expected to be enhanced by reallocation of capital to the Delaware Basin from the STACK play. The company now projects that capital spending in the Delaware Basin will increase by approximately 15 percent year-over-year and account for approximately 60 percent of Devon's total capital investment in 2020. Another noteworthy guidance item for 2020 is the company's full-year G&A outlook that is expected to decline to a range of $360 million to $400 million. Including costs reclassified as discontinued operations, this represents an improvement of more than 20 percent compared to 2019. With this outlook, Devon remains on track to meet or exceed its stated goal of reducing total G&A expense to a level of $350 million by the end of 2021.16:13TPH TRI Pointe Homes beats by $0.14, beats on revs (17.23 -0.27)Reports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.85 per share, $0.14 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.71; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $1.14 bln vs the $1.09 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Excluding interest, impairments and lot option abandonments, adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was 26.2%.New home orders of 1,235 compared to 812, an increase of 52%.Backlog units at quarter end of 1,752 homes compared to 1,335, an increase of 31%.For the first quarter of 2020, the Company expects to open 15 new communities and close out of 7 communities, which would result in 145 active selling communities as of March 31, 2020.

The company anticipates steel price volatility to decrease in 2020, as uncertainty caused by global and regional trade negotiations appears to have moderated after significant turbulence during the past two years and a prolonged steel inventory destocking in North America recently has come to an end.Ternium expects EBITDA to increase in the first quarter 2020 compared to the fourth quarter 2019, with higher shipments and a recovery in steel margin, mainly as a result of slightly lower costs.With marginally improving steel market sentiment in Mexico, the company anticipates steel shipments in the country to increase in the first quarter of the year after a seasonally weak fourth quarter 2019. Demand in Mexico's industrial markets remains stable and public construction activity in the country is beginning to show some signs of improvement. In addition, the recent ratification by the USA of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has reduced uncertainty, which should help foster economic activity and investment in Mexico in the years to come.16:40AWK American Water Works misses by $0.01, misses on revs; reaffirms FY20 EPS guidance (139.26 -0.06)Reports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.73 per share, $0.01 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.74; revenues rose 6.1% year/year to $902 mln vs the $928.56 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Currently, BIFMA is forecasting 2% growth for the coming year. That seems like a reasonable starting point for core growth, though it is quite a bit lower than the double digit increases in both the number of and dollar value of the projects we are tracking and the growth in the number of clients visiting with us. We have seen average order size continue to stabilize and believe some of that is a function of our ability to capture a greater portion of our client's workplace spend. If you add on approximately three quarters of Fully sales, you arrive at a mid-single digit top line growth rate for 2020.We expect gross margin expansion of 20 to 30 basis points during 2020, driven primarily by continued lean initiatives in our manufacturing facilities and supply chain, and favorable commodity pricing. Mid-term gross margin expansion will be bolstered by our manufacturing footprint optimization and we expect to begin recognizing savings late in 2020, but more meaningfully in 2021, delivering an additional 50 basis points of improvement. However, we do expect that the combination of a slight reduction in production capacity during the first quarter of 2020 as the result of our manufacturing optimization moves, combined with somewhat extended client request dates in our backlog, will result in a shift of revenue from the first to the second quarter. Additionally, while we have very little revenue exposure in China, we are watching any potential supply disruptions due to extended supplier shutdowns in China. At this point in time we do not see any material impact but understand that the situation is fluid.As we look out over the 2020 year, we expect EBITDA margin expansion to be more modest. Looking to 2021, we will move closer to our long-term goal of 15% consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin with the benefit of a year of savings related to the footprint and logistics optimization activities. As we continue to focus on debt reduction as a use of available free cash, we believe our average outstanding debt will be approximately $435 million during 2020, with an average interest rate of approximately 3.7%. This is reflective of the $250 million interest rate swap for 2020 and an average credit spread of 150 basis points. We expect our consolidated effective tax rate to be between 25% and 26% for full year 2020.As a result of the continued efforts around showroom enhancements to make the most use of our floor space to support the constellation selling strategy and residential initiatives, as well as investments in new product development and technology expansion for our e-commerce capabilities, we expect 2020 capital expenditures will be between $55 million and $60 million.16:23DT Dynatrace launches follow-on public offering of 25.0 mln shares of common stock by certain selling stockholders (35.14 -0.98)Dynatrace will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares being offered by the selling stockholders but will bear the costs associated with the sale of such shares.16:22KRG Kite Realty beats by $0.01, beats on revs; guides FY20 FFO below consensus (18.00 +0.08)Reports Q4 (Dec) funds from operations of $0.40 per share, $0.01 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.39; revenues fell 13.4% year/year to $75.27 mln vs the $73.17 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The market resiliently cut its losses during the afternoon, though, leaving the S&P 500 down 0.3% for the session.The Nasdaq Composite (+0.02%) eked out a closing record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) still finished lower.Apple specifically said it doesn't expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to the coronavirus restraining its supply chain and impacting consumer demand in China. The news didn't come as a surprise given similar warnings previously issued by companies, and investors presumably viewed the situation as temporary and China-specific.Investors, however, did assume some defensive positioning, evident by the gains in bonds, gold futures ($1590.00, +$19.00, +1.2%), and the CBOE Volatility Index (14.83, +1.15, +8.4%). The resulting decline in Treasury yields undercut the financials sector (-0.9%), while it benefited the utilities sector (+0.8%).The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.40%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.4% to 99.43. WTI crude inched up 0.1% (+$0.05) to $52.10/bbl, recouping its intraday losses.Microsoft (MSFT 187.23, +1.88, +1.0%) and Amazon (AMZN 2155.67, +20.80, +1.0%), which have a combined market cap of nearly $2.5 trillion, helped offset the weakness in Apple with 1% gains of their own. Both stocks extended their yearly gains to 18.7% and 16.6%, respectively, while Apple trimmed its yearly gain to 8.6%.Walmart (WMT 119.63, +1.74, +1.5%) also outperformed despite missing profit estimates.

In the first-quarter 2020, oil production is projected to average in the range of 158,000 to 163,000 barrels per day. Importantly, Devon expects to deliver this improved oil growth outlook with less capital than previously projected. The company is now lowering the top end of its upstream capital guidance by $50 million to a range of $1.7 billion to $1.85 billion in 2020. Furthermore, the capital efficiency of this investment in 2020 is expected to be enhanced by reallocation of capital to the Delaware Basin from the STACK play. The company now projects that capital spending in the Delaware Basin will increase by approximately 15 percent year-over-year and account for approximately 60 percent of Devon's total capital investment in 2020. Another noteworthy guidance item for 2020 is the company's full-year G&A outlook that is expected to decline to a range of $360 million to $400 million. Including costs reclassified as discontinued operations, this represents an improvement of more than 20 percent compared to 2019. With this outlook, Devon remains on track to meet or exceed its stated goal of reducing total G&A expense to a level of $350 million by the end of 2021.16:13TPH TRI Pointe Homes beats by $0.14, beats on revs (17.23 -0.27)Reports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.85 per share, $0.14 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.71; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $1.14 bln vs the $1.09 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Excluding interest, impairments and lot option abandonments, adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was 26.2%.New home orders of 1,235 compared to 812, an increase of 52%.Backlog units at quarter end of 1,752 homes compared to 1,335, an increase of 31%.For the first quarter of 2020, the Company expects to open 15 new communities and close out of 7 communities, which would result in 145 active selling communities as of March 31, 2020. In addition, the Company anticipates delivering between 875 and 950 homes at an average sales price of approximately $600,000. The Company expects its homebuilding gross margin percentage to be in the range of 19.5% to 20.5% for the first quarter of 2020 and anticipates its SG&A expense as a percentage of homes sales revenue will be approximately 15% during such period. Lastly, the Company expects its effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 to be approximately 25%.For the full year, the Company anticipates delivering between 5,100 and 5,300 homes at an average sales price between $605,000 to $615,000. In addition, the Company expects homebuilding gross margin percentage to be in the range of 19.5% to 20.5% for the full year and anticipates its SG&A expense as a percentage of homes sales revenue will be approximately 11.5%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.6%.Apple (AAPL 324.44, +5.44, +1.7%) has essentially recouped all losses that followed its revenue warning yesterday, reflecting the market's lack of concern for the coronavirus. Apple's 1.7% gain, coupled with Amazon's (AMZN 2181.66, +25.99, +1.2%) gain, is providing influential support for the market.The S&P 500 information technology (+1.2%) and financials (+0.9%) sectors outperform, while the defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%) and utilities (-0.8%) sectors trade in negative territory.Semiconductor stocks are rallying following positive news in NVIDIA (NVDA 311.97, +15.33, +5.2%) and Analog Devices (ADI 124.10, +5.54, +4.7%). NVIDIA was upgraded to Outperform from Mkt Perform at Bernstein, and Analog Devices beat profit expectations. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.6%.There also remain pockets of euphoria in the market, namely in shares of Tesla (TSLA 911.99, +52.90, +6.1%) and Virgin Galactic (SPCE 33.21, +2.92, +9.6%). Tesla's price target was raised to $928 from $729 at Piper Sandler. SPCE is up nearly 200% this year.Interestingly, U.S. Treasuries are barely moving despite the bullish bias in equities and the 0.5% increase in the Producer Price Index for January (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%). Regarding the latter, the market will presumably need to see a sustained rise in inflation pressure to even start to think about the Fed.The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.42%, and the 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.3% to 99.70. WTI crude is up 2.6% to $53.65/bbl.Reviewing today's economic data, which focused on producer prices and the housing sector:The Producer Price Index for January was up 0.5% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) and core PPI, which excludes food and energy, was also up 0.5% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%).Notwithstanding the large m/m increases, the key takeaway from the report is that producer prices remain relatively tame on a yr/yr basis, up 2.1% for total PPI and up 1.7% for core PPI. Also, with the Consumer Price Index released last week, it is clear today that there wasn't much bleed-through in January to the consumer side of things from the uptick in producer prices.Granted total housing starts declined 3.6% m/m in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.567 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.390 million), but that was well above expectations and marked a 21.4% yr/yr increase. Building permits -- a leading indicator -- increased 9.2% m/m to 1.551 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.460 million) and were up 17.9% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that the three-month moving average for starts (1.525 mln) is the highest since January 2007.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index fell 6.4% following a 1.1% increase in the prior week.As a reminder, the FOMC Minutes from the January meeting will be released at 2:00 p.m. ET.12:53MCS Marcus increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.17 per share of common stock from $0.16 per share of common stock (31.30 +0.60)12:38SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (221) outpacing new lows (32) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: AAXN, AB, ACGL, ACN, ADBE, ADI, ADSK, ADVM, AGNC, AGR, AMD, AMRC, ANSS, AON, APD, ARNC, ATH, ATVI, AVB, AWI, AWK, AY, BDN, BIO, BIP, BKI, BLD, BLDR, BMI, BRO, BURL, BWXT, BXMT, BXP, BYD, CACI, CALA, CAR, CCC, CCI, CCOI, CCXI, CDNS, CELH, CEVA, CGEN, CHDN, CHTR, CIM, CLGX, CMG, CNNE, CNS, COST, COUP, CPRT, CRL, CRM, CRMT, CTAS, CVM, CVNA, CWEN, CZR, D, DGX, DLB, DOCU, DOOR, DOV, DX, DXCM, ECL, EHC, EHTH, ELS, ENPH, ERI, ES, ETN, ETR, EV, EVBG, EVRI, EXLS, EXPO, FAST, FATE, FCN, FDS, FICO, FIVN, FLGT, FND, FRPT, GGG, GL, GLIBA, GOOGL, GPN, GRMN, GWRE, HQY, HSIC, IDXX, INOV, INTU, ITGR, IVR, J, JEF, KMI, KNSL, KNX, KSU, LBRDK, LGIH, LPX, LULU, LW, LYV, MA, MCO, MDLZ, MEDP, MELI, MGP, MLNX, MNST, MSCI, MSI, NEM, NERV, NFLX, NHI, NLY, NOVA, NOW, NRZ, NUAN, NVDA, NVRO, NWE, NYT, ODFL, OKTA, OMN, ORA, PAYX, PCTY, PEN, PHM, PHR, PLD, PLNT, PLUG, PODD, POOL, POR, PRFT, PSN, PTCT, PYPL, QTS, RCUS, REGI, RGEN, RH, RJF, RMD, RNG, ROST, RPAY, RSG, RUBI, S, SEDG, SGRY, SLGN, SNPS, SNR, SPGI, SPLK, SQ, STE, SUI, SYK, SYNH, TDOC, TEAM, TERP, TFX, THRM, TJX, TLRA, TMHC, TMUS, TNDM, TPH, TRNO, TRTX, TRU, TTD, TWO, V, VRRM, VRTX, VSLR, WEC, WEN, WEX, WIX, WM, WMC, WMS, WST, XPO, Z, ZAYO, ZBH, ZNGAStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ADS, ARLP, BNFT, CAL, CASI, CHK, CPS, DNOW, ECOL, ENBL, F, FLR, FOSL, GEL, GLOP, GNMK, GRPN, KRNY, MGY, MRO, MTRN, PEI, PLT, R, SKT, TDC, TGP, UAA, VSAT, WBT, WTI, XOG12:12SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: AGI ALB Y ALSN CRMT AROC CAR AXTI SAM BCOV CAKE XEC CDE CYH CONE ESRT EIG ET FARO FIVN LOPE GDOT HCR HNI HST H IAG ICLR IMAX INOV IVR NVTA JACK JBT KALU KBR KL LSI MX MANT MASI MOS MSA LASR NE NDSN OIS OGS OSUR OR OVV PAAS PE PRDO PXD QTWO O RETA RBBN RPT SNBR SM SED SPTN STMP SUI SUN SNPS TVTY TSLX TRN UCTT UFPI VMI HCC WMB ZGTomorrow Morning: AAN AKS AEP ARD AAWW BRC CAMT CBZ CLF COMM CSTM COT DNR DPZ EPAM FOCS GIL HEES HSIC HFC HRL HPP IDA ITGR I IDCC LAMR LXP LKQ MD MFA NEM NCLH OPI PCRX PQG RCM RS RGEN SHLX SIX SO STFC SCL STOR SYNH TFX TNC TEN TXMD VTR VIAC VC WIX12:10SUMRX Economic SummaryEconomic Data Summary:02/15 MBA Mortgage Applications Index -6.4%; prior was 1.1% Jan PPI 0.5% vs Briefing.com consensus of 0.1%; prior was revised to 0.2% from 0.1%Notwithstanding the large m/m increases, the key takeaway from the report is that producer prices remain relatively tame on a yr/yr basis, up 2.1% for total PPI and up 1.7% for core PPI.

Demand in Mexico's industrial markets remains stable and public construction activity in the country is beginning to show some signs of improvement.

Currently, BIFMA is forecasting 2% growth for the coming year. That seems like a reasonable starting point for core growth, though it is quite a bit lower than the double digit increases in both the number of and dollar value of the projects we are tracking and the growth in the number of clients visiting with us. We have seen average order size continue to stabilize and believe some of that is a function of our ability to capture a greater portion of our client's workplace spend. If you add on approximately three quarters of Fully sales, you arrive at a mid-single digit top line growth rate for 2020.We expect gross margin expansion of 20 to 30 basis points during 2020, driven primarily by continued lean initiatives in our manufacturing facilities and supply chain, and favorable commodity pricing. Mid-term gross margin expansion will be bolstered by our manufacturing footprint optimization and we expect to begin recognizing savings late in 2020, but more meaningfully in 2021, delivering an additional 50 basis points of improvement. However, we do expect that the combination of a slight reduction in production capacity during the first quarter of 2020 as the result of our manufacturing optimization moves, combined with somewhat extended client request dates in our backlog, will result in a shift of revenue from the first to the second quarter. Additionally, while we have very little revenue exposure in China, we are watching any potential supply disruptions due to extended supplier shutdowns in China. At this point in time we do not see any material impact but understand that the situation is fluid.As we look out over the 2020 year, we expect EBITDA margin expansion to be more modest. Looking to 2021, we will move closer to our long-term goal of 15% consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin with the benefit of a year of savings related to the footprint and logistics optimization activities. As we continue to focus on debt reduction as a use of available free cash, we believe our average outstanding debt will be approximately $435 million during 2020, with an average interest rate of approximately 3.7%. This is reflective of the $250 million interest rate swap for 2020 and an average credit spread of 150 basis points. We expect our consolidated effective tax rate to be between 25% and 26% for full year 2020.As a result of the continued efforts around showroom enhancements to make the most use of our floor space to support the constellation selling strategy and residential initiatives, as well as investments in new product development and technology expansion for our e-commerce capabilities, we expect 2020 capital expenditures will be between $55 million and $60 million.16:23DT Dynatrace launches follow-on public offering of 25.0 mln shares of common stock by certain selling stockholders (35.14 -0.98)Dynatrace will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares being offered by the selling stockholders but will bear the costs associated with the sale of such shares.16:22KRG Kite Realty beats by $0.01, beats on revs; guides FY20 FFO below consensus (18.00 +0.08)Reports Q4 (Dec) funds from operations of $0.40 per share, $0.01 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.39; revenues fell 13.4% year/year to $75.27 mln vs the $73.17 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The market resiliently cut its losses during the afternoon, though, leaving the S&P 500 down 0.3% for the session.The Nasdaq Composite (+0.02%) eked out a closing record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) still finished lower.Apple specifically said it doesn't expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to the coronavirus restraining its supply chain and impacting consumer demand in China. The news didn't come as a surprise given similar warnings previously issued by companies, and investors presumably viewed the situation as temporary and China-specific.Investors, however, did assume some defensive positioning, evident by the gains in bonds, gold futures ($1590.00, +$19.00, +1.2%), and the CBOE Volatility Index (14.83, +1.15, +8.4%). The resulting decline in Treasury yields undercut the financials sector (-0.9%), while it benefited the utilities sector (+0.8%).The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.40%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.4% to 99.43. WTI crude inched up 0.1% (+$0.05) to $52.10/bbl, recouping its intraday losses.Microsoft (MSFT 187.23, +1.88, +1.0%) and Amazon (AMZN 2155.67, +20.80, +1.0%), which have a combined market cap of nearly $2.5 trillion, helped offset the weakness in Apple with 1% gains of their own. Both stocks extended their yearly gains to 18.7% and 16.6%, respectively, while Apple trimmed its yearly gain to 8.6%.Walmart (WMT 119.63, +1.74, +1.5%) also outperformed despite missing profit estimates. Tesla (TSLA 858.40, +58.37, +7.3%) resumed its parabolic advance after its price target was raised at Bernstein and Morgan Stanley, although both targets were well below TSLA's closing price.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the Empire State Manufacturing Survey and NAHB Housing Market Index:The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for February increased to 12.9 (Briefing.com consensus 6.3) from the prior month's reading of 4.8.The NAHB Housing Market Index for February declined to 74 (Briefing.com consensus 75) from 75 in January.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for January, Housing Starts and Building Permits for January and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +8.5% YTDS&P 500 +4.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +2.4% YTDRussell 2000 +0.9% YTD16:18INVH Invitation Homes misses by $0.01, misses on revs; guides FY20 FFO in-line (32.61 +0.06)Reports Q4 (Dec) funds from operations of $0.32 per share, $0.01 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.33; revenues rose 2.7% year/year to $444.28 mln vs the $450.54 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

In the first-quarter 2020, oil production is projected to average in the range of 158,000 to 163,000 barrels per day. Importantly, Devon expects to deliver this improved oil growth outlook with less capital than previously projected. The company is now lowering the top end of its upstream capital guidance by $50 million to a range of $1.7 billion to $1.85 billion in 2020. Furthermore, the capital efficiency of this investment in 2020 is expected to be enhanced by reallocation of capital to the Delaware Basin from the STACK play. The company now projects that capital spending in the Delaware Basin will increase by approximately 15 percent year-over-year and account for approximately 60 percent of Devon's total capital investment in 2020. Another noteworthy guidance item for 2020 is the company's full-year G&A outlook that is expected to decline to a range of $360 million to $400 million. Including costs reclassified as discontinued operations, this represents an improvement of more than 20 percent compared to 2019. With this outlook, Devon remains on track to meet or exceed its stated goal of reducing total G&A expense to a level of $350 million by the end of 2021.16:13TPH TRI Pointe Homes beats by $0.14, beats on revs (17.23 -0.27)Reports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.85 per share, $0.14 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.71; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $1.14 bln vs the $1.09 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Excluding interest, impairments and lot option abandonments, adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was 26.2%.New home orders of 1,235 compared to 812, an increase of 52%.Backlog units at quarter end of 1,752 homes compared to 1,335, an increase of 31%.For the first quarter of 2020, the Company expects to open 15 new communities and close out of 7 communities, which would result in 145 active selling communities as of March 31, 2020.

The energy sector has seen increased volatility in recent weeks, but it currently trades within 1.0% of this month's high. Factors contributing to the outperformance:A sharp gain in crude oil, which has climbed $1.20, or 2.3%, to $53.25/bbl, reaching its highest level since January 29. Accordingly, the rally has given a boost to oil producers. Continued bullish momentum in the broader market.Notable movers:Concho Resources (CXO 82.08, +5.48, +7.2%): best performer in the sector, nearing its 50-day moving average (82.90) after beating Q4 expectations. Diamondback Energy (FANG 79.18, +4.62, +6.2%): trading at its best level in three weeks after beating Q4 expectations and raising its dividend. Cimarex (XEC 41.00, +2.07, +5.3%): extending its rebound from a six-month low. Devon Energy (DVN 22.54, +0.38, +1.7%): reported in-line results and lowered the top end of its upstream capital guidance for 2020.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.6%.Apple (AAPL 324.44, +5.44, +1.7%) has essentially recouped all losses that followed its revenue warning yesterday, reflecting the market's lack of concern for the coronavirus. Apple's 1.7% gain, coupled with Amazon's (AMZN 2181.66, +25.99, +1.2%) gain, is providing influential support for the market.The S&P 500 information technology (+1.2%) and financials (+0.9%) sectors outperform, while the defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%) and utilities (-0.8%) sectors trade in negative territory.Semiconductor stocks are rallying following positive news in NVIDIA (NVDA 311.97, +15.33, +5.2%) and Analog Devices (ADI 124.10, +5.54, +4.7%). NVIDIA was upgraded to Outperform from Mkt Perform at Bernstein, and Analog Devices beat profit expectations. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.6%.There also remain pockets of euphoria in the market, namely in shares of Tesla (TSLA 911.99, +52.90, +6.1%) and Virgin Galactic (SPCE 33.21, +2.92, +9.6%). Tesla's price target was raised to $928 from $729 at Piper Sandler. SPCE is up nearly 200% this year.Interestingly, U.S. Treasuries are barely moving despite the bullish bias in equities and the 0.5% increase in the Producer Price Index for January (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%). Regarding the latter, the market will presumably need to see a sustained rise in inflation pressure to even start to think about the Fed.The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.42%, and the 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.3% to 99.70. WTI crude is up 2.6% to $53.65/bbl.Reviewing today's economic data, which focused on producer prices and the housing sector:The Producer Price Index for January was up 0.5% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) and core PPI, which excludes food and energy, was also up 0.5% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%).Notwithstanding the large m/m increases, the key takeaway from the report is that producer prices remain relatively tame on a yr/yr basis, up 2.1% for total PPI and up 1.7% for core PPI. Also, with the Consumer Price Index released last week, it is clear today that there wasn't much bleed-through in January to the consumer side of things from the uptick in producer prices.Granted total housing starts declined 3.6% m/m in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.567 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.390 million), but that was well above expectations and marked a 21.4% yr/yr increase. Building permits -- a leading indicator -- increased 9.2% m/m to 1.551 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.460 million) and were up 17.9% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that the three-month moving average for starts (1.525 mln) is the highest since January 2007.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index fell 6.4% following a 1.1% increase in the prior week.As a reminder, the FOMC Minutes from the January meeting will be released at 2:00 p.m. ET.12:53MCS Marcus increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.17 per share of common stock from $0.16 per share of common stock (31.30 +0.60)12:38SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (221) outpacing new lows (32) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: AAXN, AB, ACGL, ACN, ADBE, ADI, ADSK, ADVM, AGNC, AGR, AMD, AMRC, ANSS, AON, APD, ARNC, ATH, ATVI, AVB, AWI, AWK, AY, BDN, BIO, BIP, BKI, BLD, BLDR, BMI, BRO, BURL, BWXT, BXMT, BXP, BYD, CACI, CALA, CAR, CCC, CCI, CCOI, CCXI, CDNS, CELH, CEVA, CGEN, CHDN, CHTR, CIM, CLGX, CMG, CNNE, CNS, COST, COUP, CPRT, CRL, CRM, CRMT, CTAS, CVM, CVNA, CWEN, CZR, D, DGX, DLB, DOCU, DOOR, DOV, DX, DXCM, ECL, EHC, EHTH, ELS, ENPH, ERI, ES, ETN, ETR, EV, EVBG, EVRI, EXLS, EXPO, FAST, FATE, FCN, FDS, FICO, FIVN, FLGT, FND, FRPT, GGG, GL, GLIBA, GOOGL, GPN, GRMN, GWRE, HQY, HSIC, IDXX, INOV, INTU, ITGR, IVR, J, JEF, KMI, KNSL, KNX, KSU, LBRDK, LGIH, LPX, LULU, LW, LYV, MA, MCO, MDLZ, MEDP, MELI, MGP, MLNX, MNST, MSCI, MSI, NEM, NERV, NFLX, NHI, NLY, NOVA, NOW, NRZ, NUAN, NVDA, NVRO, NWE, NYT, ODFL, OKTA, OMN, ORA, PAYX, PCTY, PEN, PHM, PHR, PLD, PLNT, PLUG, PODD, POOL, POR, PRFT, PSN, PTCT, PYPL, QTS, RCUS, REGI, RGEN, RH, RJF, RMD, RNG, ROST, RPAY, RSG, RUBI, S, SEDG, SGRY, SLGN, SNPS, SNR, SPGI, SPLK, SQ, STE, SUI, SYK, SYNH, TDOC, TEAM, TERP, TFX, THRM, TJX, TLRA, TMHC, TMUS, TNDM, TPH, TRNO, TRTX, TRU, TTD, TWO, V, VRRM, VRTX, VSLR, WEC, WEN, WEX, WIX, WM, WMC, WMS, WST, XPO, Z, ZAYO, ZBH, ZNGAStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ADS, ARLP, BNFT, CAL, CASI, CHK, CPS, DNOW, ECOL, ENBL, F, FLR, FOSL, GEL, GLOP, GNMK, GRPN, KRNY, MGY, MRO, MTRN, PEI, PLT, R, SKT, TDC, TGP, UAA, VSAT, WBT, WTI, XOG12:12SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: AGI ALB Y ALSN CRMT AROC CAR AXTI SAM BCOV CAKE XEC CDE CYH CONE ESRT EIG ET FARO FIVN LOPE GDOT HCR HNI HST H IAG ICLR IMAX INOV IVR NVTA JACK JBT KALU KBR KL LSI MX MANT MASI MOS MSA LASR NE NDSN OIS OGS OSUR OR OVV PAAS PE PRDO PXD QTWO O RETA RBBN RPT SNBR SM SED SPTN STMP SUI SUN SNPS TVTY TSLX TRN UCTT UFPI VMI HCC WMB ZGTomorrow Morning: AAN AKS AEP ARD AAWW BRC CAMT CBZ CLF COMM CSTM COT DNR DPZ EPAM FOCS GIL HEES HSIC HFC HRL HPP IDA ITGR I IDCC LAMR LXP LKQ MD MFA NEM NCLH OPI PCRX PQG RCM RS RGEN SHLX SIX SO STFC SCL STOR SYNH TFX TNC TEN TXMD VTR VIAC VC WIX12:10SUMRX Economic SummaryEconomic Data Summary:02/15 MBA Mortgage Applications Index -6.4%; prior was 1.1% Jan PPI 0.5% vs Briefing.com consensus of 0.1%; prior was revised to 0.2% from 0.1%Notwithstanding the large m/m increases, the key takeaway from the report is that producer prices remain relatively tame on a yr/yr basis, up 2.1% for total PPI and up 1.7% for core PPI.

Demand in Mexico's industrial markets remains stable and public construction activity in the country is beginning to show some signs of improvement.

Currently, BIFMA is forecasting 2% growth for the coming year. That seems like a reasonable starting point for core growth, though it is quite a bit lower than the double digit increases in both the number of and dollar value of the projects we are tracking and the growth in the number of clients visiting with us. We have seen average order size continue to stabilize and believe some of that is a function of our ability to capture a greater portion of our client's workplace spend. If you add on approximately three quarters of Fully sales, you arrive at a mid-single digit top line growth rate for 2020.We expect gross margin expansion of 20 to 30 basis points during 2020, driven primarily by continued lean initiatives in our manufacturing facilities and supply chain, and favorable commodity pricing. Mid-term gross margin expansion will be bolstered by our manufacturing footprint optimization and we expect to begin recognizing savings late in 2020, but more meaningfully in 2021, delivering an additional 50 basis points of improvement. However, we do expect that the combination of a slight reduction in production capacity during the first quarter of 2020 as the result of our manufacturing optimization moves, combined with somewhat extended client request dates in our backlog, will result in a shift of revenue from the first to the second quarter. Additionally, while we have very little revenue exposure in China, we are watching any potential supply disruptions due to extended supplier shutdowns in China. At this point in time we do not see any material impact but understand that the situation is fluid.As we look out over the 2020 year, we expect EBITDA margin expansion to be more modest. Looking to 2021, we will move closer to our long-term goal of 15% consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin with the benefit of a year of savings related to the footprint and logistics optimization activities. As we continue to focus on debt reduction as a use of available free cash, we believe our average outstanding debt will be approximately $435 million during 2020, with an average interest rate of approximately 3.7%. This is reflective of the $250 million interest rate swap for 2020 and an average credit spread of 150 basis points. We expect our consolidated effective tax rate to be between 25% and 26% for full year 2020.As a result of the continued efforts around showroom enhancements to make the most use of our floor space to support the constellation selling strategy and residential initiatives, as well as investments in new product development and technology expansion for our e-commerce capabilities, we expect 2020 capital expenditures will be between $55 million and $60 million.16:23DT Dynatrace launches follow-on public offering of 25.0 mln shares of common stock by certain selling stockholders (35.14 -0.98)Dynatrace will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares being offered by the selling stockholders but will bear the costs associated with the sale of such shares.16:22KRG Kite Realty beats by $0.01, beats on revs; guides FY20 FFO below consensus (18.00 +0.08)Reports Q4 (Dec) funds from operations of $0.40 per share, $0.01 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.39; revenues fell 13.4% year/year to $75.27 mln vs the $73.17 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The market resiliently cut its losses during the afternoon, though, leaving the S&P 500 down 0.3% for the session.The Nasdaq Composite (+0.02%) eked out a closing record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) still finished lower.Apple specifically said it doesn't expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to the coronavirus restraining its supply chain and impacting consumer demand in China. The news didn't come as a surprise given similar warnings previously issued by companies, and investors presumably viewed the situation as temporary and China-specific.Investors, however, did assume some defensive positioning, evident by the gains in bonds, gold futures ($1590.00, +$19.00, +1.2%), and the CBOE Volatility Index (14.83, +1.15, +8.4%). The resulting decline in Treasury yields undercut the financials sector (-0.9%), while it benefited the utilities sector (+0.8%).The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.40%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.4% to 99.43. WTI crude inched up 0.1% (+$0.05) to $52.10/bbl, recouping its intraday losses.Microsoft (MSFT 187.23, +1.88, +1.0%) and Amazon (AMZN 2155.67, +20.80, +1.0%), which have a combined market cap of nearly $2.5 trillion, helped offset the weakness in Apple with 1% gains of their own. Both stocks extended their yearly gains to 18.7% and 16.6%, respectively, while Apple trimmed its yearly gain to 8.6%.Walmart (WMT 119.63, +1.74, +1.5%) also outperformed despite missing profit estimates. Tesla (TSLA 858.40, +58.37, +7.3%) resumed its parabolic advance after its price target was raised at Bernstein and Morgan Stanley, although both targets were well below TSLA's closing price.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the Empire State Manufacturing Survey and NAHB Housing Market Index:The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for February increased to 12.9 (Briefing.com consensus 6.3) from the prior month's reading of 4.8.The NAHB Housing Market Index for February declined to 74 (Briefing.com consensus 75) from 75 in January.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for January, Housing Starts and Building Permits for January and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +8.5% YTDS&P 500 +4.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +2.4% YTDRussell 2000 +0.9% YTD16:18INVH Invitation Homes misses by $0.01, misses on revs; guides FY20 FFO in-line (32.61 +0.06)Reports Q4 (Dec) funds from operations of $0.32 per share, $0.01 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.33; revenues rose 2.7% year/year to $444.28 mln vs the $450.54 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

In the first-quarter 2020, oil production is projected to average in the range of 158,000 to 163,000 barrels per day. Importantly, Devon expects to deliver this improved oil growth outlook with less capital than previously projected. The company is now lowering the top end of its upstream capital guidance by $50 million to a range of $1.7 billion to $1.85 billion in 2020. Furthermore, the capital efficiency of this investment in 2020 is expected to be enhanced by reallocation of capital to the Delaware Basin from the STACK play. The company now projects that capital spending in the Delaware Basin will increase by approximately 15 percent year-over-year and account for approximately 60 percent of Devon's total capital investment in 2020. Another noteworthy guidance item for 2020 is the company's full-year G&A outlook that is expected to decline to a range of $360 million to $400 million. Including costs reclassified as discontinued operations, this represents an improvement of more than 20 percent compared to 2019. With this outlook, Devon remains on track to meet or exceed its stated goal of reducing total G&A expense to a level of $350 million by the end of 2021.16:13TPH TRI Pointe Homes beats by $0.14, beats on revs (17.23 -0.27)Reports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.85 per share, $0.14 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.71; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $1.14 bln vs the $1.09 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Excluding interest, impairments and lot option abandonments, adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was 26.2%.New home orders of 1,235 compared to 812, an increase of 52%.Backlog units at quarter end of 1,752 homes compared to 1,335, an increase of 31%.For the first quarter of 2020, the Company expects to open 15 new communities and close out of 7 communities, which would result in 145 active selling communities as of March 31, 2020.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.6%.Apple (AAPL 324.44, +5.44, +1.7%) has essentially recouped all losses that followed its revenue warning yesterday, reflecting the market's lack of concern for the coronavirus. Apple's 1.7% gain, coupled with Amazon's (AMZN 2181.66, +25.99, +1.2%) gain, is providing influential support for the market.The S&P 500 information technology (+1.2%) and financials (+0.9%) sectors outperform, while the defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%) and utilities (-0.8%) sectors trade in negative territory.Semiconductor stocks are rallying following positive news in NVIDIA (NVDA 311.97, +15.33, +5.2%) and Analog Devices (ADI 124.10, +5.54, +4.7%). NVIDIA was upgraded to Outperform from Mkt Perform at Bernstein, and Analog Devices beat profit expectations. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.6%.There also remain pockets of euphoria in the market, namely in shares of Tesla (TSLA 911.99, +52.90, +6.1%) and Virgin Galactic (SPCE 33.21, +2.92, +9.6%). Tesla's price target was raised to $928 from $729 at Piper Sandler. SPCE is up nearly 200% this year.Interestingly, U.S. Treasuries are barely moving despite the bullish bias in equities and the 0.5% increase in the Producer Price Index for January (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%). Regarding the latter, the market will presumably need to see a sustained rise in inflation pressure to even start to think about the Fed.The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.42%, and the 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.3% to 99.70. WTI crude is up 2.6% to $53.65/bbl.Reviewing today's economic data, which focused on producer prices and the housing sector:The Producer Price Index for January was up 0.5% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) and core PPI, which excludes food and energy, was also up 0.5% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%).Notwithstanding the large m/m increases, the key takeaway from the report is that producer prices remain relatively tame on a yr/yr basis, up 2.1% for total PPI and up 1.7% for core PPI. Also, with the Consumer Price Index released last week, it is clear today that there wasn't much bleed-through in January to the consumer side of things from the uptick in producer prices.Granted total housing starts declined 3.6% m/m in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.567 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.390 million), but that was well above expectations and marked a 21.4% yr/yr increase. Building permits -- a leading indicator -- increased 9.2% m/m to 1.551 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.460 million) and were up 17.9% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that the three-month moving average for starts (1.525 mln) is the highest since January 2007.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index fell 6.4% following a 1.1% increase in the prior week.As a reminder, the FOMC Minutes from the January meeting will be released at 2:00 p.m. ET.12:53MCS Marcus increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.17 per share of common stock from $0.16 per share of common stock (31.30 +0.60)12:38SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (221) outpacing new lows (32) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: AAXN, AB, ACGL, ACN, ADBE, ADI, ADSK, ADVM, AGNC, AGR, AMD, AMRC, ANSS, AON, APD, ARNC, ATH, ATVI, AVB, AWI, AWK, AY, BDN, BIO, BIP, BKI, BLD, BLDR, BMI, BRO, BURL, BWXT, BXMT, BXP, BYD, CACI, CALA, CAR, CCC, CCI, CCOI, CCXI, CDNS, CELH, CEVA, CGEN, CHDN, CHTR, CIM, CLGX, CMG, CNNE, CNS, COST, COUP, CPRT, CRL, CRM, CRMT, CTAS, CVM, CVNA, CWEN, CZR, D, DGX, DLB, DOCU, DOOR, DOV, DX, DXCM, ECL, EHC, EHTH, ELS, ENPH, ERI, ES, ETN, ETR, EV, EVBG, EVRI, EXLS, EXPO, FAST, FATE, FCN, FDS, FICO, FIVN, FLGT, FND, FRPT, GGG, GL, GLIBA, GOOGL, GPN, GRMN, GWRE, HQY, HSIC, IDXX, INOV, INTU, ITGR, IVR, J, JEF, KMI, KNSL, KNX, KSU, LBRDK, LGIH, LPX, LULU, LW, LYV, MA, MCO, MDLZ, MEDP, MELI, MGP, MLNX, MNST, MSCI, MSI, NEM, NERV, NFLX, NHI, NLY, NOVA, NOW, NRZ, NUAN, NVDA, NVRO, NWE, NYT, ODFL, OKTA, OMN, ORA, PAYX, PCTY, PEN, PHM, PHR, PLD, PLNT, PLUG, PODD, POOL, POR, PRFT, PSN, PTCT, PYPL, QTS, RCUS, REGI, RGEN, RH, RJF, RMD, RNG, ROST, RPAY, RSG, RUBI, S, SEDG, SGRY, SLGN, SNPS, SNR, SPGI, SPLK, SQ, STE, SUI, SYK, SYNH, TDOC, TEAM, TERP, TFX, THRM, TJX, TLRA, TMHC, TMUS, TNDM, TPH, TRNO, TRTX, TRU, TTD, TWO, V, VRRM, VRTX, VSLR, WEC, WEN, WEX, WIX, WM, WMC, WMS, WST, XPO, Z, ZAYO, ZBH, ZNGAStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ADS, ARLP, BNFT, CAL, CASI, CHK, CPS, DNOW, ECOL, ENBL, F, FLR, FOSL, GEL, GLOP, GNMK, GRPN, KRNY, MGY, MRO, MTRN, PEI, PLT, R, SKT, TDC, TGP, UAA, VSAT, WBT, WTI, XOG12:12SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: AGI ALB Y ALSN CRMT AROC CAR AXTI SAM BCOV CAKE XEC CDE CYH CONE ESRT EIG ET FARO FIVN LOPE GDOT HCR HNI HST H IAG ICLR IMAX INOV IVR NVTA JACK JBT KALU KBR KL LSI MX MANT MASI MOS MSA LASR NE NDSN OIS OGS OSUR OR OVV PAAS PE PRDO PXD QTWO O RETA RBBN RPT SNBR SM SED SPTN STMP SUI SUN SNPS TVTY TSLX TRN UCTT UFPI VMI HCC WMB ZGTomorrow Morning: AAN AKS AEP ARD AAWW BRC CAMT CBZ CLF COMM CSTM COT DNR DPZ EPAM FOCS GIL HEES HSIC HFC HRL HPP IDA ITGR I IDCC LAMR LXP LKQ MD MFA NEM NCLH OPI PCRX PQG RCM RS RGEN SHLX SIX SO STFC SCL STOR SYNH TFX TNC TEN TXMD VTR VIAC VC WIX12:10SUMRX Economic SummaryEconomic Data Summary:02/15 MBA Mortgage Applications Index -6.4%; prior was 1.1% Jan PPI 0.5% vs Briefing.com consensus of 0.1%; prior was revised to 0.2% from 0.1%Notwithstanding the large m/m increases, the key takeaway from the report is that producer prices remain relatively tame on a yr/yr basis, up 2.1% for total PPI and up 1.7% for core PPI.

The company anticipates steel price volatility to decrease in 2020, as uncertainty caused by global and regional trade negotiations appears to have moderated after significant turbulence during the past two years and a prolonged steel inventory destocking in North America recently has come to an end.Ternium expects EBITDA to increase in the first quarter 2020 compared to the fourth quarter 2019, with higher shipments and a recovery in steel margin, mainly as a result of slightly lower costs.With marginally improving steel market sentiment in Mexico, the company anticipates steel shipments in the country to increase in the first quarter of the year after a seasonally weak fourth quarter 2019. Demand in Mexico's industrial markets remains stable and public construction activity in the country is beginning to show some signs of improvement. In addition, the recent ratification by the USA of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has reduced uncertainty, which should help foster economic activity and investment in Mexico in the years to come.16:40AWK American Water Works misses by $0.01, misses on revs; reaffirms FY20 EPS guidance (139.26 -0.06)Reports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.73 per share, $0.01 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.74; revenues rose 6.1% year/year to $902 mln vs the $928.56 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Currently, BIFMA is forecasting 2% growth for the coming year. That seems like a reasonable starting point for core growth, though it is quite a bit lower than the double digit increases in both the number of and dollar value of the projects we are tracking and the growth in the number of clients visiting with us. We have seen average order size continue to stabilize and believe some of that is a function of our ability to capture a greater portion of our client's workplace spend. If you add on approximately three quarters of Fully sales, you arrive at a mid-single digit top line growth rate for 2020.We expect gross margin expansion of 20 to 30 basis points during 2020, driven primarily by continued lean initiatives in our manufacturing facilities and supply chain, and favorable commodity pricing. Mid-term gross margin expansion will be bolstered by our manufacturing footprint optimization and we expect to begin recognizing savings late in 2020, but more meaningfully in 2021, delivering an additional 50 basis points of improvement. However, we do expect that the combination of a slight reduction in production capacity during the first quarter of 2020 as the result of our manufacturing optimization moves, combined with somewhat extended client request dates in our backlog, will result in a shift of revenue from the first to the second quarter. Additionally, while we have very little revenue exposure in China, we are watching any potential supply disruptions due to extended supplier shutdowns in China. At this point in time we do not see any material impact but understand that the situation is fluid.As we look out over the 2020 year, we expect EBITDA margin expansion to be more modest. Looking to 2021, we will move closer to our long-term goal of 15% consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin with the benefit of a year of savings related to the footprint and logistics optimization activities. As we continue to focus on debt reduction as a use of available free cash, we believe our average outstanding debt will be approximately $435 million during 2020, with an average interest rate of approximately 3.7%. This is reflective of the $250 million interest rate swap for 2020 and an average credit spread of 150 basis points. We expect our consolidated effective tax rate to be between 25% and 26% for full year 2020.As a result of the continued efforts around showroom enhancements to make the most use of our floor space to support the constellation selling strategy and residential initiatives, as well as investments in new product development and technology expansion for our e-commerce capabilities, we expect 2020 capital expenditures will be between $55 million and $60 million.16:23DT Dynatrace launches follow-on public offering of 25.0 mln shares of common stock by certain selling stockholders (35.14 -0.98)Dynatrace will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares being offered by the selling stockholders but will bear the costs associated with the sale of such shares.16:22KRG Kite Realty beats by $0.01, beats on revs; guides FY20 FFO below consensus (18.00 +0.08)Reports Q4 (Dec) funds from operations of $0.40 per share, $0.01 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.39; revenues fell 13.4% year/year to $75.27 mln vs the $73.17 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The market resiliently cut its losses during the afternoon, though, leaving the S&P 500 down 0.3% for the session.The Nasdaq Composite (+0.02%) eked out a closing record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) still finished lower.Apple specifically said it doesn't expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to the coronavirus restraining its supply chain and impacting consumer demand in China. The news didn't come as a surprise given similar warnings previously issued by companies, and investors presumably viewed the situation as temporary and China-specific.Investors, however, did assume some defensive positioning, evident by the gains in bonds, gold futures ($1590.00, +$19.00, +1.2%), and the CBOE Volatility Index (14.83, +1.15, +8.4%). The resulting decline in Treasury yields undercut the financials sector (-0.9%), while it benefited the utilities sector (+0.8%).The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.40%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.4% to 99.43. WTI crude inched up 0.1% (+$0.05) to $52.10/bbl, recouping its intraday losses.Microsoft (MSFT 187.23, +1.88, +1.0%) and Amazon (AMZN 2155.67, +20.80, +1.0%), which have a combined market cap of nearly $2.5 trillion, helped offset the weakness in Apple with 1% gains of their own. Both stocks extended their yearly gains to 18.7% and 16.6%, respectively, while Apple trimmed its yearly gain to 8.6%.Walmart (WMT 119.63, +1.74, +1.5%) also outperformed despite missing profit estimates.

In the first-quarter 2020, oil production is projected to average in the range of 158,000 to 163,000 barrels per day. Importantly, Devon expects to deliver this improved oil growth outlook with less capital than previously projected. The company is now lowering the top end of its upstream capital guidance by $50 million to a range of $1.7 billion to $1.85 billion in 2020. Furthermore, the capital efficiency of this investment in 2020 is expected to be enhanced by reallocation of capital to the Delaware Basin from the STACK play. The company now projects that capital spending in the Delaware Basin will increase by approximately 15 percent year-over-year and account for approximately 60 percent of Devon's total capital investment in 2020.

Ikea shuts down all mainland China stores over coronavirusCNN WireJanuary 30, 2020 Thursday 6:52 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 364 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  Ikea is shutting down all of its stores across China as the deadly Wuhan coronavirus outbreak escalates. The furniture store will "temporarily close" its dozens of brick-and-mortar stores in mainland China starting Thursday, a spokeswoman for Ikea China said in a statement."We will pay close attention to the epidemic situation, and the stores will be closed until further notice," she said, adding that Ikea's online shopping service will continue to operate. Ikea has 30 stores across China, including one in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, according to the company's website. In China, Ikea is a popular place for shoppers to nap and hang out for long periods of time on the many bed, sofa and furniture displays. Such shopping habits would be counterproductive to containing the coronavirus, as experts and officials advise people to avoid crowded areas. The coronavirus outbreak has killed 170 people and sickened more than 7,000 people in China so far, with dozens more confirmed cases in countries such as Canada, Japan and Australia. The Chinese government has taken unprecedented measures to try to contain the virus, including placing millions of people in major cities on lockdown and extending the Lunar New Year holiday. Ikea is just the latest company to feel the effects of the outbreak. Restaurants such as McDonald's, Starbucks and Yum China-owned KFC and Pizza Hut have closed thousands of stores across the country. Electric car maker Tesla's brand new Shanghai factory has halted production due to a government-ordered shutdown. Disney parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong are shuttered, as museums and major attractions such as the Forbidden City remain closed. The virus could hit China's economy hard. The country's GDP growth could slow by a percentage point this quarter --- or even more --- because of the outbreak, according to Zhang Ming, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Science, a major Beijing brain trust. His assessment was published Wednesday in a Chinese financial magazine.-- Laura He contributed to this report.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

SCHUMER REVEALS: TSA IS STILL USING 'TIKTOK' APP ON SOCIAL MEDIA; SENATOR SAYS RISKS TO AMERICAN AND FED SECURITY VIA THE PLATFORM REMAIN; PENTAGON AND DHS HAVE BANNED IT, TSA SHOULD TOOStates News ServiceFebruary 23, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1106 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by New York Senator Charles Schumer:The Pentagon and The Department Of Homeland Security, Which Oversees The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Have ALL Prohibited, Banned The Use Of The China-Owned Social Media Platform 'TikTok'BUT TSA Is Still Using It On Verified Government Account(s) To Engage TravelersSchumer, Who First Sounded The Alarm On The App's Security Concerns and Prompted Fed Action, Says TSA Is One Of THE Main Agencies We Should Absolutely Not Allow TikTok To Collect Government Data On, Including Possible Communications About Airport SecuritySchumer: Given The Risks, Feds Cannot Continue To Allow TSA's Use Of TikTok App To FlyCiting concerns for the security of a federal agency and potentially the flying public, as well as an existing ban of the China-owned TikTok app within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Senator Charles Schumer revealed today that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is still using the app on social media. Schumer said the risks to American and federal agency security via the platform remain very real and urged the TSA to cease its use of TikTok. Schumer says the TSA, charged with ensuring the security of our airports and the flying public, should not be exempt from the ban, especially given its parent agency, DHS, already has a prohibition policy in place."The TSA is to be recognized for its work to engage a variety of stakeholders with airline rules and safety, but it also must acknowledge the ironic risk it's placing its own agencyand potentially the publicin with its continued use of the China-owned TikTok app," said U.S. Senator Charles Schumer. "Given the widely reported threats, the already-in-place agency bans, and the existing national security concerns posed by TikTok, the feds cannot continue to allow the TSA's use of the platform to fly."Even amidst federal inquiries into the TikTok app, the TSA was postingand continues to posta variety of videos from agency accounts, which Schumer says raises security concerns. On Thanksgiving, the TSA posted a TikTok that went viral related to the 'nopes' and 'yeps' of carry-on luggage. And this past Valentine's Day, the agency posted 'romantic tips' for travelers in another TikTok. Schumer says the more recent TikToks are even more concerning because they are posted amidst the DHS' own TikTok ban, which the TSA is overseen by. In addition, the official TSA account on twitter shares these TikToks, which garner hundreds of views. And the official "AskTSA" Twitter account even comments on them."These videos sure do make you chuckle; they're creative," said Schumer. "But China might be laughing at these TSA postings for very different reasons, and that should concern us and it's why I am urging the TSA to find a different platform, and cease its use of TikTok now."On October 23, 2019, Schumer sent a letter to the Acting Director of National Intelligence requesting that the Intelligence Community conduct an assessment of the national security risks posed by TikTok and other China-owned content platforms operating in the United States. Schumer explained that national security experts have raised concerns about TikTok's collection and handling of user data, including user content and communications, IP addresses, location-related data, metadata, and other sensitive personal information, particularly when viewed in light of laws that compel Chinese companies to support and cooperate with intelligence work controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. Schumer further explained that due to a lack of transparency and without an independent judiciary to review requests made by the Chinese government for user data or other actions, that there is no legal mechanism for Chinese companies to appeal if they disagree with a request by the government.Soon after Schumer's initial concerns were aired, the Department of Defense, the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security all banned the use of TikTok as it related to government devices, and encouraged personnel to avoid the app altogether.Schumer's letter to TSA Administrator David Pekoske appears below:Dear Administrator Pekoske:I write to express my concern about the use of China-owned social media platforms, such as TikTok, by your agency, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).Recently, both the U.S. military and the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the TSA, detailed social media policies and guidelines as it relates to use of the China-owned app TikTok due to security and privacy concerns. Despite these restrictions, including at TSA's parent DHS, your agency continues to utilize TikTok to communicate with the American public in an official capacity. While I recognize that the TSA must adapt its outreach techniques in order to communicate with a variety of Americans, I urge you to assess the potential national security risks posed by China-owned technology companies before choosing to utilize certain platforms.On October 23, 2019, I sent a letter to the Acting Director of National Intelligence requesting that the Intelligence Community conduct an assessment of the national security risks posed by TikTok and other China-owned content platforms operating in the United States. National security experts have raised concerns about TikTok's collection and handling of user data, including user content and communications, IP addresses, location-related data, metadata, and other sensitive personal information, particularly when viewed in light of laws that compel Chinese companies to support and cooperate with intelligence work controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. Further, due to a lack of transparency and without an independent judiciary to review requests made by the Chinese government for user data or other actions, there is no legal mechanism for Chinese companies to appeal if they disagree with a request.Consequently, I respectfully ask that you provide answers to the following questions as soon as possible:1. Has the TSA consulted with the Intelligence Community and the Department of Homeland Security with regard to TikTok and other China-owned social media platforms, and whether they pose security risks as platforms for engaging the flying public? If not, does the TSA have future plans for such consultations?2. Has the TSA been given an exemption from the Department of Homeland Security's own ban of TikTok?3. Are TSA officials using government issued devices as part of their official TikTok usage?Thank you for your consideration of this request.Sincerely,U.S. Senator Charles SchumerLoad-Date: February 23, 2020End of Document

Wary of irking China, Trump offers rosy take on virus threatAssociated Press State & LocalJanuary 31, 2020 Friday 3:18 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICAL NEWSLength: 935 wordsByline: By DARLENE SUPERVILLE, AAMER MADHANI and JONATHAN LEMIRE, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump regaled a friendly New Jersey campaign crowd with his thoughts about with his thoughts about impeachment, the economy, the border wall, local politics and much more.But he was conspicuously quiet Tuesday about one big issue keeping much of the globe on pins and needles: the spread of a deadly new type of coronavirus. It has killed more than 170 people in China, sickened thousands more there and led to a handful of confirmed cases in the U.S., including the first U.S. case of person-to-person transmission reported Thursday by health officials. The State Department on Thursday advised all U.S. citizens against traveling to China.Trump, a self-described germaphobe, generally has discussed the virus in broad terms, but he offered some of his most extensive comments on the issue to date during an appearance Thursday at a Michigan manufacturing plant."Hopefully, it won't be as bad as some people think it could be, but we're working very closely with them (Chinese) and with a lot of other people and a lot of other countries," he said. "We think we have it very well under control."Trump described the handful of U.S. cases as a "very little problem" and said those people were "recuperating successfully.""But we're working very closely with China and other countries and we think it's going to have a very good ending for us. That I can assure you," he said.Trump also has discussed the situation with Chinese President Xi Jinping.Aides and confidants say Trump's careful approach is part of a political strategy crafted to avoid upsetting the stock market or angering China by calling too much attention to the virus or blaming Beijing for not managing the situation better, according to a White House official and a Republican close to the White House. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations.Late Wednesday, Trump tweeted photos from a White House Situation Room briefing on the virus, writing that "we have the best experts anywhere in the world and they are on top of it 24/7!"In keeping with the low-profile approach, the White House announced by email Wednesday night that the meeting included members of a task force that will lead the U.S. response. The 12-person team is chaired by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and coordinated through the National Security Council.The president's comments contrast sharply with the fierce criticism he lobbed at his predecessor, President Barack Obama, during the 2014-15 Ebola crisis, which left more than 11,000 dead in three West African nations.At the time, Trump ripped into Obama as a "dope" and "incompetent" and called for a travel ban on visitors from Ebola-infected countries. Trump also advocated preventing infected American health care workers from coming home for treatment.Obama faced some criticism from public health officials for being slow to address the Ebola crisis initially, but also received plaudits for eventually attacking it with vigor. He nudged Congress to make a $5.4 billion emergency appropriation to aid the fight and sent 3,000 U.S. troops to West Africa to help with the international response.Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, said he's taken a measure of comfort in the fact that Trump, so far, hasn't overreacted and has resisted "fanning the flames" as he did with his rhetoric during the Ebola crisis. That leaves room, Gostin said, for public health professionals to take the lead."As long as that continues and as long as there isn't political interference or mass quarantines in the U.S. or outright travel bans, I will feel comfortable with how the White House is handling it," Gostin said. He added that he'd like to see Trump ask Congress for a $1 billion emergency appropriation to help agencies battling to contain the virus.Trump is well aware the virus outbreak in China could create a wild card for the U.S. economy during an election year. And he has long prioritized the U.S. economic relationship with China, especially during trade negotiations, and similarly largely held his tongue during widespread protests in Hong Kong. He also takes enormous pride in the personal relationship he's developed with Xi and has commended him for demonstrating "transparency" as he deals with the crisis.Asked about the virus while traveling abroad last week, Trump said "we have it totally under control." In a separate Twitter posting, he offered reassurance but scant detail for his confidence."China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus," Trump tweeted. "The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well."But some public health experts say Trump's rosy assessments of the situation don't match the ground truth.Gostin pointed to Chinese government bureaucratic delays that led to tens of thousands of people traveling outside of Wuhan province, increasing the likelihood that the virus will travel far beyond China."It's not accurate at all," Gostin said of Trump's assessment of China's handling of the outbreak. "China manifestly does not have this under control."Trump's budgets have proposed cuts to public health, only to be overruled by Congress, where there's strong bipartisan support for agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Indeed, the money government disease detectives are tapping to fight the latest outbreak was a congressional idea.___Associated Press writers Josh Boak, Lauran Neergaard and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed to this report.Load-Date: January 31, 2020End of Document

China confirmed that the mysterious coronavirus is transmitted between people and WHO convened an emergency committeeCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 21, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 949 wordsBodyA team of experts from the Chinese government confirmed that human-to-human transmission of a new coronavirus is possible, as reported by China's National Health Commission team leader. This fact increases the chances that this virus will spread faster and more widely.Zhong Nanshan, an expert in respiratory health, noted that relatives infected two people in Guangdong province in southern China, according to the official press. Some medical workers also tested positive for the virus, the English-english-reported newspaper China Daily reported.The announcement marked a day when authorities announced a sharp increase in the number of confirmed cases, to more than 200, and on which the Chinese representative called on the government to take all possible measures to combat the outbreak. At the moment, health authorities in Wuhan, the main affected city, which has more than eleven million inhabitants, confirmed the deaths of a third person, 1,723 cases in total and new contagions of 217 citizens due to the new coronavirus. In addition, two cases have been confirmed in Thailand, one in Beijing and one in Shenzen, as well as in Japan and South Korea.A medical team carries a box as they walk to Jinyintan Hospital, where there are patients with pneumonia caused by the new strain of coronavirus being treated, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China (REUTERS/Stringer/China Out) (DARLEY SHEN/)"The recent outbreak of pneumonia from the new coronavirus in Wuhan and elsewhere must be taken seriously," President Xi Jinping said in his first public statement on the crisis. "Party, government and relevant departmentcommittees at all levels must put the lives and health of the people first."The Un agency, which is based in Geneva, convened a committee of experts to assess on Wednesday whether the outbreak constitutes an international emergency and what measures should be taken to manage it.The World Health Organization (WHO) argued on Monday that "an animal source" would appear to be the main source of the outbreak and that there was a "limited human-to-human transmission" between close contacts.In Wuhan, there are already 1,723 total cases and new recent contagions of 217 citizens due to the new coronavirus (Shutterstock)According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), "Common human coronoaviruses cause mild to moderate diseases in the upper respiratory tract, such as the common cold. However, other human coronaviruses are known to exist, such as those identified as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, which often cause severe symptoms: fever, cough, shortness of breath, which often progress in pneumonia."Coronaviruses, named after the crown shape that take a view of the microscope, often attack the airways of mammals. Only six types were known: four cause mild cold-like symptoms, while the otherstwo, were infamous in 2002. It happens that SARS coronavirus, originating in China, caused the deaths of more than 800 people worldwide; while in 2015 MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) left 449 dead.In Geneva, the World Health Organization announced that it would convene the Emergency Committee for a meeting on Wednesday to determine whether outbreaks warrant a global health crisis.Health professionals on Monday enter A patient with symptoms of the strange coronavirus virus in Wuhan, China (REUTERS/Stringer/China Out) on Monday (DARLEY SHEN/)Such declarations are often made for epidemics of severe diseases that threaten to cross borders and require a coordinated international response. Global crisis emergencies have been declared including the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the emergence of Zika virus in America in 2016 and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014.As Dr. Ana Putruele, chief pneumonologist in the Pneumonology division of the Clinic Hospital, explained to Infobae, "There were similar cases in the past of this type of virus but there are no proven treatments, there is not much published about it".

THE US accused China of the hacking of Equifax, one of the largest in historyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 10, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 413 wordsBodyFour Chinese military personnel were charged on Monday by the U.S. government to break into the database of the credit rating agency Equifax and steal information from hundreds of millions of Americans.In a press intervention, U.S. Attorney General and Justice Department Chief William Barrunequivocally accused China of being behind the massive hacking of 2017, considered one of the greatest in history.The intrusion affected more than 145 million people,who were robbed of names, document and credit card numbers, addresses, birthdays and other personal information stored in the database.Barr said the four military ones charged are members of the People's Liberation Army (PRS), which is part of the Chinese Army, and that they are free in China."This was one of the biggest data breaches in history," Barr said. "They stole sensitive personal information from nearly half of U.S. citizens," he added.For its part, the FBI posted the names of the military on Twitter. "Wu Zhiyong, Wang Qian, Xu Ke and Liu Lei face charges of computer fraud, economic espionage and electronic fraud for their role in one of the largest theft of personally identifiable information by state-sponsored hackers."The charges against the defendants were brought by the government before a court in Atlanta, Georgia, where Equifax is based."This was a vast and deliberate intrusion into the private information of the American people," Barr said in making the accusations."Today, we hold these ELP hackers responsible for their criminal actions, and remind the Chinese government that we have the ability to remove the mantle of anonymity from the Internet and find the hackers that the nation repeatedly deploys against us," he added.All four are accused in addition to stealing Trade Secrets from Equifax,including database design, security officials told US media outlets, unidentified.The defendants took advantage of a software vulnerability that allowed them to obtain access keys and navigate the company's network while stealing information, officials, quoted by CNN, added.Donald Trump's administration warned several times about China's growing political and economic influence, and accused Beijing of collecting data from Americans and stealing scientific research and innovation.Washington is also pursuing a lobbying campaign on its allies to convince them not to allow Chinese giant Huawei to participate in 5G telecommunications networks, as it is considered dangerous to cybersecurity.Load-Date: February 11, 2020End of Document

U.S. accuses Huawei of organized crimeCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 13, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 273 wordsBodyThe U.S. government has accused Chinese tech giant Huawei of organized crime and conspiracy to steal trade secrets. The indictment, which is also directed against two subsidiary companies, was filed this Thursday in Brooklyn federal court and also includes other charges, including money laundering, obstruction of justice, and violation of sanctions. The Justice Department's move is a major escalation in the Trump Administration's legal battle against the world's largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment.The indictment is in addition to other charges filed last year against Huawei CEO Meng Wanzhou, who is in Canada, on bail, awaiting his extradition to the United States."Today we announce that we are bringing criminal charges against telecoms giant Huawei and its associates for nearly two dozen alleged crimes," said Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker. "As I told Chinese officials in August, China must make its companies and citizens comply with the law."In the indictment, the Department of Justice accuses Huawei and its affiliates of implementing "an organized crime scheme to the detriment of U.S. security." He accuses them of making "decades-long efforts" to steal trade secrets, including source codes and user manuals for Internet routers, with the aim of "growing Huawei's business."Washington has long fought Huawei, a company it believes can be exploited by the Chinese government for espionage. The U.S. administration has banned the federal government from using technology from the Chinese telecoms giant, and is trying to pressure partner countries not to turn to Huawei to develop its 5G networks.Load-Date: February 14, 2020End of Document

The week in GRC: Nissan CEO faces angry shareholders, and SEC presses firms on Chinese audits amid coronavirusCorporatesecretary.comFebruary 21, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 IR Media Group, LTD All Rights ReservedSection: COMPLIANCELength: 1476 wordsByline: Ben MaidenBody- The Guardian reported that companies paid out a record $1.43 trillion in dividends to shareholders around the world in 2019. The record-breaking payout from public companies was driven by strong performances in stock markets in North America and emerging economies, including by some unusually high special dividends. The total payment was 3.5 percent higher than in 2018.Analysts at Janus Henderson studied dividends paid by the world's 1,200 largest companies in 2019. They found that shareholder payouts from UK and European firms were less generous than the global average. Payouts to investors in oil companies rose more quickly, by 10 percent, but dividends from telecoms stocks fell.- Asset management firm Water Island Capital urged Pattern Energy Group shareholders to reject a $2.63 billion buyout offer from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, describing it as undervalued, according to Reuters. Water Island said that in light of a surge in renewable energy companies' valuations Pattern Energy's stand-alone price would exceed $30 per share. Pattern Energy has scheduled a special meeting of its shareholders for March 10 to vote on the deal.- The Wall Street Journal said Franklin Resources agreed to buy fellow asset manager Legg Mason for $4.5 billion in cash. The combined firm will manage roughly $1.5 trillion in assets under management, 'well balanced' between individual investors and pensions and other large institutions. A deal clears uncertainty around Legg Mason's future that has existed for almost a year, since activist investor Trian Fund Management took a stake in the company and secured representation on its board. Franklin said Trian has agreed to vote on the deal.- Nissan Motor Co CEO Makoto Uchida faced angry shareholders at a rowdy meeting during which they questioned whether he had a plan to reverse the company's losses, the WSJ reported. Several shareholders at the meeting called for executives to take a pay cut as penance.Uchida said he intends to cut costs by making Nissan's alliance with Renault work better. 'Nissan is a great company,' he said. 'We have a lot of problems, but we will make this company one that people will take pride in again.'The special shareholder meeting was called to ratify the board nominations of Uchida and other directors to replace those who have resigned or have been ousted from Nissan and Renault. Keiko Ihara, who heads the board's compensation committee, said directors were now accounting for performance when setting executive severance payments.- CNBC reported that Attorney General William Barr said at a US Department of Justice (DoJ) workshop that in addition to questions regarding potentially anti-competitive behavior, the agency is considering what a concentrated tech market means for a legal immunity originally created to help small start-ups.Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which says tech companies cannot be held legally liable for content posted by third-party users, has been important in allowing some of the biggest tech firms to grow while keeping community standards on their platforms and without becoming buried by lawsuits. Executives say the law is still key to their work, particularly in allowing for 'good faith' content moderation. But Barr said the industry Section 230 protects is no longer fragile or emerging.- In addition, US tech companies will soon need to comply with new requirements in the EU regarding artificial intelligence and sharing data with smaller rivals, as the EU seeks to assert its 'technological sovereignty' from the US and China, according to the WSJ. EU regulators revealed plans aimed at placing more restrictions on machine learning-enabled technologies in fields ranging from public surveillance cameras to cancer scans and self-driving cars.EDiMA, an industry group representing big platforms including Google, Amazon and Facebook, welcomed the proposals as a 'starting point' and said it would engage with the European Commission to address some of the shared concerns.- CNN reported that former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg unveiled a tougher-than-expected Wall Street reform plan that calls for restoring some of the post-crisis financial guardrails 'gutted' by President Donald Trump. Bloomberg, who has deep ties to Wall Street, wants to fortify the Volcker Rule, reinstate consumer protections overturned by the Trump administration, bolster the Elizabeth Warren-inspired Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, create a dedicated corporate crime group at the DoJ and require companies to report climate change risks.He does not support more sweeping changes embraced by more progressive rivals such as Bernie Sanders, who wants to break up big banks and has vowed to be a 'nightmare' for Wall Street.- According to the WSJ, the UK's Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said companies and auditors should provide up-to-date information on the risks arising from the novel coronavirus when reporting their year-end results. Companies with operations or close trading ties to China should detail how they could be affected by the outbreak as part of their obligation to disclose the principal risks to their business, the FRC said.'Companies will need to monitor developments and ensure they are providing up-to-date and meaningful disclosures to their shareholders when preparing their year-end reports,' a spokesperson said.SEC chair Jay Clayton on January 30 said he had asked the agency's staff to monitor the potential effects of the virus and, if necessary, to provide guidance and other assistance to companies regarding disclosures. If enough companies are affected by an event or situation, the SEC could issue a deadline extension for affected parties.- The WSJ reported that UBS Group CEO Sergio Ermotti is stepping down and will be succeeded by ING Group boss Ralph Hamers. UBS, Switzerland's largest bank by assets, said Hamers will join its board in September and become CEO on November 1. Ermotti has been UBS's CEO since 2011 and was expected to announce his departure this year or next.UBS chair Axel Weber said Hamers is 'the right CEO' to lead the company through changes across the banking industry, as a 'seasoned and well-respected banker with proven expertise in digital transformation.' He thanked Ermotti for 'adding a successful chapter to the history of this more than 150-year-old bank.'- The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has launched a major review into whether companies and their auditors are adequately reflecting the financial risks of the climate crisis in their accounts, according to The Guardian. The FRC plans to use the review to make sure companies are being clear with investors about their exposure to climate-based risks.FRC chief executive Sir Jon Thompson said company reports and accounts were 'essential to understanding how the corporate world is responding to the challenge of climate change.' The FRC will also examine whether companies have adopted the recommendations put forward by the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, which was set up to highlight the financial exposure of companies to the risk of climate chaos.- The SEC said it was pressing the Big Four accounting firms to ramp up internal controls on audits of US-listed Chinese companies, particularly in light of business risks posed by the coronavirus, according to Reuters. The commission has been engaged in a decade-long struggle with the Chinese government to inspect audits of US-listed Chinese companies. The PCAOB is still unable to access those, it said.The SEC said on Wednesday that it had been urging the largest accounting firms, which audit roughly 140 US-listed Chinese companies, to ensure they are scrutinizing how firms are managing and disclosing the risks. The agency said it had also asked the firms to keep an eye on the impact of the virus on audit quality, since the coronavirus had caused personnel disruptions in mainland China and Hong Kong.- The WSJ reported that, according to people familiar with the matter, Nissan's board cut the exit package of former CEO Hiroto Saikawa, who presided over a fall in the car maker's earnings. The board also stopped a process that had allowed departing executives to remain with the company in a consulting role.At a special shareholder meeting on February 18, Saikawa lost his board seat at Nissan, his final position at the company, triggering the departure payment. Saikawa didn't contest the payment decision, one of the people familiar with the matter said.'In the past, we didn't have a clear policy on compensation at the end of service,' said Keiko Ihara, the director in charge of compensation issues, at the shareholder meeting. She said the board decided to take into account the reasons for an executive's departure and the performance of the company.Link to ImageLoad-Date: February 21, 2020End of Document

The U.S. accused four Chinese military men for the hacking of Equifax, the largest data breach in historyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 10, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 559 wordsBodyThe U.S. Department of Justice announced the indictment of four members of China's People's Liberation Army for their alleged involvement in the massive hacking of the us-earnings credit rating agency's massive database Equifax in 2017."This was one of the largest data breaches in history," said Attorney General William Barr.Hackers stole "the sensitive personal information of nearly half of American citizens," he added. Equifax, one of the three largest credit bureaus in the United States, suffered a security breach in 2017 that exposed data for 147 million people.The four defendants are also accused of stealing the company's trade secrets. The case comes when the Trump administration has warned against what it sees as China's growing political and economic influence, and Beijing's efforts to gather data on Americans and steal scientific research and innovation."Today, we hold Army hackers accountable for their criminal actions, and remind the Chinese government that we have the ability to remove the mantle of anonymity from the Internet and find the hackers that the nation repeatedly deploys against us," added the attorney general.The Credit Reporting Agency (Reuters) (Tami Chappell/)The case is one of several that the Department of Justice has filed over the years against members of the People's Liberation Army. In 2014, the Obama administration accused five Chinese military hackers of breaking into the networks of major U.S. corporations to deflect trade secrets.Criminal charges were filed in federal court in Atlanta, where the company is based. The indictment details the efforts the hackers made to cover their tracks, including daily erasing log files and routing traffic across dozens of servers in nearly 20 countries. It includes charges of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, conspiracy to commit economic espionage, and conspiracy to commit electronic fraud.Equifax did not notice the intruders targeting its databases for more than six weeks. The hackers exploited a known security vulnerability that Equifax had not fixed. Once inside the network, officials said hackers were able to download and exfiltrate Equifax data to computers outside the United States.According to the Government's Office of Responsibility, the Congressional Investigator's Arm, a server hosting Equifax's online dispute portal, was running software with a known weakness. The hackers made their way to reach databases containing personal consumer information.Equifax officials told the GAO that the company made many mistakes, including having an outdated list of COMPUTER system administrators. When the company circulated a notice to install a patch for the software vulnerability, the employees responsible for installing the patch never received it.Equifax's $700 million agreement with the U.S. government offers affected consumers free credit control and identity restoration services, as well as money for their time or reimbursement of certain services. However, because so many people made claims, officials said that some consumerswould get much less than the eligible amounts due to the caps on the common fund of the agreement.(With Information from AFP and AP)MORE ON THIS THEME:Equifax: how to tell if you were the victim of the worst personal data theft in historyEquifax: how to know if you're compensated for data breachesLoad-Date: February 11, 2020End of Document

A world trade war is brewing. The US-China deal won't stop itCNN WireJanuary 15, 2020 Wednesday 6:16 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1295 wordsDateline: HONG KONG / LONDON (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG / LONDON (CNN Business) --  The United States has signed a partial trade agreement with China. But that doesn't mean simmering conflicts and uncertainty over trade won't drag down the global economy this year.Tensions between the world's two biggest economies are likely to persist in 2020 as Beijing and Washington enter a second round of trade talks that are expected to be more difficult than the "phase one" process that culminated in a deal Wednesday in Washington.The European Union is also locked in its own trade dispute with the United States that has strained ties between the preeminent western powers. And the United Kingdom's looming break with Europe brings with it a slew of challenges as the country attempts to forge a new relationship with its largest export market.Reaching past the 'low-hanging fruit'President Donald Trump has heralded the "phase one" US-China trade deal as a significant breakthrough. US officials said the agreement will reduce some tariffs and allow Beijing to avoid additional taxes on almost $160 billion of the country's goods. The Trump administration also said it received commitments from China to purchase billions worth of agricultural goods and crack down on intellectual property theft. "Are we in an ideal spot? No," Robert Lighthizer, the president's top trade negotiator, told reporters before the signing. "Is this a massively good first step? Yes."But more specific details about the text of the agreement have been elusive. Economists, market analysts and trade experts also remain wary about whether the two countries can make serious headway on more substantial issues, such as Washington's demand that the Chinese government significantly reduce its role in the country's economy. "The deal as outlined harvests all the low-hanging fruit," analysts at Capital Economics wrote in a research note last month. The initial deal "does not mark the end of tensions between the US and China," they added.The two sides are keeping substantial tariffs in place. About two-thirds of all US imports from China --- roughly $370 billion worth --- will still be covered by tariffs after the deal is signed, according to a December analysis from the Peterson Institute for International Economics. More than half of US exports to China would also still be subject to retaliatory tariffs, the institute said. "Steep tariffs are the new normal," wrote Chad Brown, a senior fellow at the institute and former economist at the World Bank.Others have cited "more troublesome" issues on the horizon. Speaking at an event in Hong Kong this week, former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen warned that competition between the United States and China could slow the development of artificial intelligence, 5G mobile networks and other technology related to national security.China and the United States are already locked in a fight over Chinese tech company Huawei, a leading global provider of telecoms equipment used to build 5G networks. The rift between the United States and China has other implications for the global economy. "The world is edging towards distinct economic spheres centered on the US and China," Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics, wrote last October. While he noted that geopolitical rivalries can be productive --- think of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union --- he said it is more likely that "limits to flows of people, technology and ideas" hold back global productivity.Tensions with EuropeChina isn't the only world power tangling with the United States over trade. The Trump administration is weighing whether to impose tariffs on $2.4 billion in French products --- including cheeses, handbags and champagne --- to punish the country for its new tax on digital services.The United States has argued that France's tax, which affects large American tech firms such as Facebook and Google, represents a barrier to trade. The European Union, which manages trade policy on behalf of its member states, has threatened to respond if provoked.New tariffs would escalate an already tense relationship between Washington and Brussels. The Trump administration imposed a 25% tariff on most European wine in October, in retaliation for government subsidies received by planemaker Airbus. Since then, the White House has threatened to raise the tax because of a lack of progress in resolving the issue.Washington had also already imposed taxes on steel and aluminum made in the European Union and threatened higher tariffs on German cars despite substantial investments made in the United States by BMW, Volkswagen and Daimler.An agreement that addresses these issues with Europe will be one of Trump's priorities for 2020, according to William Reinsch, an expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who served for 15 years as president of the National Foreign Trade Council. It's an immensely important relationship for both sides to maintain. Trade between the United States and the European Union is worth more than $1.1 trillion a year --- the largest bilateral relationship anywhere in the world.Yet a deal is likely to prove elusive. Reinsch pointed out in a recent blog post that talks may not even get off the ground because of a disagreement over whether agriculture --- a highly subsidized and protected industry in Europe --- should be included in negotiations. Even if discussions begin, Reinsch argued they could be derailed by a number of threats including higher auto tariffs, which will resurface "the first time the president loses patience with the slow pace of talks."He added that if progress is made, "the president's desire for a 'victory' he can brag about before the election will take precedence over substance ... and hollow victories will be declared."Brokering a Brexit deal?With Brexit set for January 31, the United Kingdom is also seeking a trade deal with the European Union.This one must be completed before the end of the year or trade barriers will be erected between the country and its biggest export market.Most trade deals take years to negotiate, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson has insisted that he will not extend talks beyond the end of the year. That could hurt the United Kingdom's chances of striking a comprehensive agreement. "If the government is to stick to the timetable at all costs then only a very limited deal ... is likely to be possible," said analysts at French bank Société Générale. "This will mean sacrificing the possibility of a good deal for services on the altar of political expediency."Johnson has to strike a delicate balance. While the United Kingdom does a lot of business with the European Union --- the market accounted for 44% of total UK exports of goods and services in 2017 --- staying close to Brussels would limit its ability to reach a new trade deal with the United States. Johnson's supporters have touted that as a major potential benefit of Brexit.Even so, new trade barriers are something the UK economy cannot afford. Experts have warned that such restrictions would limit economic growth and put the country's auto industry at risk of collapse.Data published Monday showed a steep decline in Britain's GDP in November, suggesting the country's economy stagnated or contracted in the fourth quarter. The Bank of England may now resort to an interest rate cut in order to support growth.Uncertainty over the United Kingdom's future trading relationships is likely to restrain GDP growth and the strength of the pound this year, according to Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. --- Ivana Kottasová, Katie Lobosco and Donna Borak contributed to this report.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.
