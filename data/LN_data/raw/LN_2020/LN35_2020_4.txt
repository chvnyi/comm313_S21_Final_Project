Huawei s terrible weekiCrowdNewswire (English)May 31, 2020 Sunday 2:18 PM GMTCopyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1120 wordsBodyWhen news broke Friday morning that Britain is looking to propose an alliance of democracies to build a 5G alternative to Huawei, you might think that that was the worst thing to happen to the controversial Chinese telecoms giant this week.

Continue reading Huawei s terrible weekWhen news broke Friday morning that Britain is looking to propose an alliance of democracies to build a 5G alternative to Huawei, you might think that that was the worst thing to happen to the controversial Chinese telecoms giant this week. In fact, it just caps off a series of fast-moving events that surely makes this one of the most decisive weeks yet in the global fight over next-generation 5G networks.So let s go back a step. After all, readers who have been following the Huawei debate might recall that not long ago the UK had controversially agreed to allow Huawei to attain up to 35% market share in  non-core areas  of its 5G network. So what was behind London s sudden about-face?The answer is politics. There was always a loud group of China-skeptic dissenters in Parliament, but anger over China s handling of the novel coronavirus pandemic pushed more MPs from Prime Minister Boris Johnson s own Conservative Party into the anti-Huawei camp and made the government s position untenable. Rather than face a large parliamentary rebellion and possible legislative defeat later this year, Johnson instead gave in and announced plans earlier this week to phase out Huawei s participation in Britain s 5G network by 2023.Now, Johnson seems to be going a step further. Reports indicate that he is seeking to organize fellow G7 countries Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the United States, as well as Australia, South Korea, and India on the issue. Skeptics of the U.S. campaign against Huawei have long lamented that Washington is asking governments to oppose Huawei without proposing a viable alternative. London s so-called D10 alliance is the first attempt to explicitly try to answer that question.Meanwhile on the legal front, British Columbia s Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that proceedings to extradite Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou to the United States could go ahead. Instead of being released and on her way back to China, Meng, who is the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, is now one step closer to facing trial in the U.S. on fraud charges relating to Huawei s circumvention of U.S. sanctions on Iran.Huawei is used to geopolitical maneuvering, of course. After all, its plans to build an underseas cable last year connecting Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands with high speed internet were preempted when Australia, wary of growing Chinese influence in its South Pacific backyard, offered to pay for it instead.When the Chinese ambassador to Denmark threatened to scuttle a trade deal with the Faroe Islands, a semi-autonomous Danish region, if Denmark didn t choose it for its 5G network, Copenhagen responded by issuing tough new security requirements that Huawei has said would give it no choice but to leave the country entirely. And as I wrote in March, the question of Huawei has been increasingly debated at the highest levels of government around the world.Yet, this week does seem to mark a dramatic turning point in the global 5G battle.First, even limited access to the UK market had been a coup for Huawei. With its well-regarded Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre, Britain s seal of approval was a valuable signal to other governments on the fence about whether or not Huawei is worth the security risk. For Britain to not only reverse itself but then take the lead on coordinating an international alternative just a few days later marks a remarkable course correction.A former British diplomat told me in March that the West s lack of cooperation on the issue was  a striking failure  of political coordination. That s certainly not the case anymore   and as other NATO, EU, and Five Eye intelligence allies consider whether or not to permit Huawei themselves, the existence of a democratic anti-Huawei consortium (should it truly develop) would make it that much harder for them to justify going against the U.S.Second, the Meng case might be soundly based in international law, but to paraphrase Clausewitz: it s international relations by other means. After all, U.S. investigators, concerned that Huawei was acting as an arm of the Chinese government, had been looking for an excuse to file charges against the company for years. Fittingly enough, the charges against Meng were linked to an unrelated geopolitical issue: violating U.S. sanctions on Iran.A defeat for the U.S. in the British Columbia Supreme Court would have struck a blow to the U.S. government s attempts to extend its legal reach around the globe. Instead, its victory solidifies an already escalating global sanctions regime that is proving devastating for any company caught in its dragnet. As if the Meng case weren t enough, TSMC, one of the world s largest semiconductors contractors, also announced that it would no longer sell to Huawei in order to comply with new US export controls.The question is thus: if this does mark a turning point in the US-China global tech rivalry, what will the next stage look like?Given its history, there s not much suspense in what the Trump administration will likely do next. Certainly it will keep pursuing Huawei s Meng in court. And count on a new round of pressure in Europe as the EU deadline for members to stake out their 5G security protocols fast approaches this summer. But America s 5G diplomatic push has been seen as tone deaf in European capitals   now that Britain is onside, Washington would be smart to let London take the lead.How China responds is the more important question. Its continued strong and vocal support for Huawei should be assumed, but what form will it take? Huawei s conciliatory approach in the UK has now clearly failed. But so too did its attempts to strong-arm Denmark. Will the gloves now come off? Or will Beijing be forced to distance itself from its national champion for Huawei s own good?Huawei has tried to have it both ways, benefiting from the support it draws from the Chinese government while assuring foreign governments of its independence at the same time. But as global public opinion harden against Beijing in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and Western nations take stronger actions against his company, Huawei CEO Ren might consider just how hazardous being yoked to a superpower can be.See Campaign:https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/30/huaweis-terrible-week/Contact Information:Scott BadeTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: May 31, 2020End of Document

OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT XI JINPING. THE VIRUS THRIVES ON CENSORSHIP. FREE AND RELIABLE INFORMATION IS NECESSARY TO AVOID THE WORST.States News ServiceMarch 26, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 620 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: PARIS, France. BodyThe following information was released by the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA):In an open letter to President Xi Jinping, WAN-IFRA and the World Editors Forum urge the Chinese government to reverse its decision to force foreign reporters to leave the country and, more broadly, to ease the growing crackdown on independent news organisations that preceded this action.We are writing on behalf of the World Association of News Publishers (WAN-IFRA) and the World Editors Forum, which represent 18,000 publications, 15,000 online sites and over 3,000 companies in more than 120 countries, to urge the Chinese government to reverse its decision to force foreign reporters to leave the country and, more broadly, to ease the growing crackdown on independent news organisations that preceded this action.According to reports, the Chinese government has extended its targeting of foreign international news organisations with a decision to expel American journalists from a number of news organisations including The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and The New York Times.The decision not to renew the press credentials of these China-based U.S. reporters constitutes the largest expulsion of journalists from the country in more than 30 years. It follows an escalation in diplomatic tensions in light of the designation by the U.S. Administration of five Chinese media outlets with operations in the U.S. as official government entities. Further administrative injunctions against four Chinese news organisations, including the Xinhua News Agency and the China Daily newspaper, have reduced their U.S. staff by at least a third.Your Excellency, this latest retaliatory round of censorship fits a worrying pattern that has seen your government block a range of foreign news portals over the past 12 months: the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Suddeutsche Zeitung and Spiegel Online; the German TV programme 'Tagesschau'; TV channel ZDF and the Swiss Broadcasting Company; The Guardian, The Washington Post, The Mail Online and Singapore's The Straits Times. These moves coincided with both the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre, and the extensive foreign reporting of mass protests in Hong Kong.Any banning of media or placing of restrictions on journalists or media organisations is an attack on freedom of expression. The loss of journalists in China, particularly at this time of major global health concern, is all the more serious as the world seeks transparent, reliable information about China's ongoing efforts to combat the novel Coronavirus that causes the disease Covid-19Without the control and censorship imposed by the Chinese authorities, Chinese media would have been in a position to inform the public at a much earlier stage of the severity of the Coronavirus epidemic, potentially sparing thousands of lives and perhaps avoiding the current global pandemic.Your decision is not only an attack on the freedom to inform and to be informed, but it also carries serious consequences in terms of China's responsibility for contributing to one of the most serious humanitarian and economic crises we have experienced in the last one hundred years.We respectfully call on you to end the crackdown on foreign journalists and news organisations, and to immediately lift restrictions on U.S. journalists most recently targeted. Moreover, we urge you rethink your wider policy of censorship and to respect international standards of freedom of expression and press freedom, allowing citizens access to free information, wherever it originates.Fernando De Yarza Lopez-MadrazoPresident, WAN-IFRAWarren FernandezPresident, World Editors ForumLoad-Date: March 28, 2020End of Document

Stock exchanges have mixed week closure in the face of new China-EU trade tensionCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 15, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 429 wordsBodyThe world's most prominent stock markets are a reflection on Friday of tensions between the United States and China,after President Donald Trump called for blocking semiconductor shipments for Huawei Technologies. The action provoked almost immediate reaction from the Assypatic country.The editor-in-chief of the Global Times - a means that the Chinese government consistently relies on to communicate its stance on the trade measures that the U.S. government implements in the context of its trade war - disclosed that the Chinese administration poses retaliation."If the United States blocks Huawei's key technology delivery, China will activate the list of unreliable entities and restrict or investigate U.S. companies such as Qualcomm, Cisco, and Apple. The purchase of Boeing aircraft would be suspended," journalist Hu Xijin said on Twitter on Friday.The Fear &Greed; Index, which measures fear in the U.S. stock market by a range between zero and 100, ranks at 39 units below the 50-point barrier indicating fear in the market. Wall Street stock indices are influenced by this trading factor.Wall Street's main index, the Dow JonesIndustrial Average, which makes up the stocks of 30 industrial giants, backs down -0.32 percent. The Nasdaqcomposite market index, with large technology companies, falls by -0.15 percent. The S&P; 500,with 500 shares, falls -0.32 percent.Apple'sshares, among the companies mentioned by the Chinese journalist, operate with a heavy loss of -1.75 percent. Qualcomm'sshares, also in the group of companies, go back -5.38 percent. The papers of the aerospace company Boeing move downwards -2 percent.QCOM Chart by TradingViewEuropean stock market indices, which opened on Friday with solid progress, cut their profits. Spain's Ibex 35 was the most affected and closed with a loss of -1.08% and in Italy, ftSE MIB,from Milan, lost -0.09 percent. Other bags only cut back on their advances today.The London Stock Exchange, UNITED Kingdom, which was suffering from heavy losses from the publication of weak economic data, closed the session with a slowing 1.07% increase in its FTSE 100index. The Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Germany, topped the area's profits, with a 1.24% advance in its main index, the DAX.The Euro Stoxx 50 index, which measures the shareholding performance of 50 companies, closed with a 0.38% sharp recovery, following its heavy losses throughout the week. The MSCI Global Stock Index, which includes benchmarks from 49 countries, earns a marginal 0.07%, but accumulates a setback of more than 2% in the week.[email protected]Load-Date: May 16, 2020End of Document

Coronavirus closures leave skies clearer in ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 3, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 415 wordsBodyWASHINGTON (AP) -- China's measures to contain the spread of the new coronavirus have led to the closure of factories and kept airports empty, resulting in a sharp decline in carbon emissions and other Contaminants. However, analysts warned that the reduction in pollution may be temporary."The immediate reduction in emissions is spectacular," said Lauri Myllyvirta, senior analyst at the Centre for Energy and Clean Air Research in Helsinki.Using industry data, including coal, steel and oil, Myllyvirta estimated that China's carbon emissions were 25% lower in the four weeks after the end of the Lunar New Year holidays — virtually the entire month of February — compared to the same period last year.He doesn't think the trend will hold."The question now is: how will the Chinese government respond? To compensate for losses in economic activity — including after the 2008-09 financial crisis — the government's usual response is to launch huge stimulus packages focused on the most polluting industries," he said. "That would make the environment worse in the long run."NASA and the European Space Agency say that, since January, their pollution monitoring satellites over China have detected huge decreases in nitrogen dioxide, which is usually produced by vehicle engines, thermoelectric plants and factories . "There is evidence that the change is at least partially related to the economic slowdown following the coronavirus outbreak," NASA said in a statement.The nitrogen dioxide drop was first detected in the Wuhan area, the epicenter of the virus, and subsequently spread throughout the country, NASA commented.Satellite images that NASA posted online on Monday reveal how the toxic cloud hanging over much of China has virtually disappeared between January 1 and February 25.At the moment, residents of many Chinese cities breathe cleaner air.Nationally, nitrogen dioxide level was reduced by 42%, while the level of fine particles of 2.5 microns (PM 2.5), which can penetrate the lungs and other organs, dropped by 27%, according to government monitoring stations.Beijing residents were not so lucky.The smog in the capital, measured at PM2.5 levels, was worse last February than in the same month of the previous year. Steel plants in regions near Beijing did not cease operations, according to Myllyvirta's industrial analysis."Beijing has also had no luck with its weather patterns, as winds drag pollution into Beijing," he said.___Larson is on Twitter as: @larsonchristinaLoad-Date: March 4, 2020End of Document

"Chinese digital currency marks start of currency war against dollar"CE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 5, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 323 wordsBodyMEXICO CITY, May 5.- The Chinese government's announcement of the new e-RMB digital currency which will be used by MEXICO to replace the dollar in some operations, marks the start of a monetary war by the Asian giant to consolidate its currency as the main means of global payment, Monex said. "Going forward, the monetary authorities of the Asian country are likely to decide to link the yuan to gold, with the aim of positioning the new currency as a reserve currency of value in central banks around the world," the firm explained. Monex explained that e-RMB digital currency will be a functional alternative to the dollar settlement system that can reduce the impact of sanction or a threat of exclusion from other nations. "The new digital currency will not be a cryptocurrency, as it will be managed by the People's Bank of China, will be 100% linked to the yuan and can be used by different digital means of payment within the Asian country and will allow monitoring of transactions in real time," Monex added. The firm explained that the new digital currency has been in development for a few years, but it wasn't until August last year that China's central bank reported that it was about to put the currency into circulation. "Until now in China, e-wallets were frequent, but they did not replace the currency, so this initiative would allow the Central Bank to track transactions in real time. Currently, e-RMB is being tested in cities such as Shenzhen, Suzhou, Chengdu, in Xiong'an, south of Beijing, and in other areas that will be used at the Winter Olympics, to be held in 2022," he added. Similarly, the Chinese press reported that many public employees will start collecting their salaries with this digital currency starting in May. Thus, in the city of Suzhou, for example, its use will focus on the subsidy to public transport, while in Xiong'an it will be used for shopping in commercial and fast food establishments.Load-Date: May 6, 2020End of Document

MORE EVIDENCE YET OF CHINA'S SYSTEMIC PENETRATION OF U.S. ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH INSTITUTIONSStates News ServiceMarch 4, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 950 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for Immigration Studies:By Dan CadmanAnother prominent researcher, Anming Hu, has been taken into custody for inappropriately sharing sensitive information with the People's Republic of China (PRC) while hiding his relationship with that country. Although the Department of Justice (DOJ) press release doesn't say he's an American citizen, that's a reasonable conclusion given that the data he gave to the PRC came from his work on behalf of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and federal rules require that individuals working on classified U.S. government projects must be citizens with clearances.I'm delighted that another individual has been unmasked for engaging in espionage on behalf of what is perhaps the world's largest intelligence-gathering apparatus. But my darker side says, "Chill your enthusiasm, this is a 'shooting fish in a barrel' exercise."Certainly the evidence seems to suggest the latter. Only a month ago, I blogged about a spate of arrests that included just such a case involving a researcher sharing his data with the PRC in return for millions of dollars and a cushy position at a Chinese university. And I have been periodically highlighting similar espionage and data theft cases for a long time now. The United States appears to be engaged in a belated game of catch-up regarding the penetration of our academic and research institutions at all levels by the PRC government.While Hu's instant case slogs through the courts, and if (as the odds dictate) he is a naturalized American, then this is a good chance for DOJ to stretch its newfound denaturalization wings and add that charge to the others he faces, because chances are pretty darn good that Hu was working for the Chinese government all during the period before he naturalized. That's not the kind of thing that just happens overnight. People like him are groomed to work their way through the system and obtain the kind of job he obtained for the express purpose of siphoning off data and technology from our most sensitive enterprises. It's notable that the DOJ press release mentions the investigation involving not just NASA, but Department of Energy (DOE) agents. Keep in mind that the Oak Ridge National Laboratory is centered in Tennessee and uses the University of Tennessee Hu's U.S. employer as administrator and manager of this DOE-sponsored facility engaged in many highly classified programs.I have a few unsolicited comments and questions to offer Uncle Sam:To the investigators and hunters: Keep up the good work. It may be like shooting fish in a barrel because of the lax practices that have been allowed to fester at U.S. academic and research institutions, but it sorely needs to be done. Sooner or later, it will dawn on even the most venal or casual in those rarified atmospheres that it's no longer business as usual, because the stakes have been ratcheted up and the U.S. government is serious about keeping its secrets. That will allow you to then concentrate your efforts on the more hardcore spies.To the federal departments and agencies sponsoring and administering the many thousands of such grants and programs, while spending tens (hundreds?) of millions of taxpayer dollars in the process: Isn't it time to start contemplating better vetting procedures as a part of your oversight mechanisms? How about, for starters, engaging in personal interviews with the principals who will be doing the work rather than just reading grant papers and proposals prepared by their most gifted writers? Ask pointed questions, and record the answers. That will surely focus the weak-minded who otherwise might be tempted to take money or accept straw-man positions whose real purpose is to pour information into the massive PRC intelligence siphon. Conduct physical security audits of the work environs in these places. Are they lax and conducive to inappropriate revelations, whether on purpose or inadvertent, such as over water coolers and in break rooms? While you're at it, develop serious debarment procedures for those institutions whose principals and corollary researchers are caught giving away secrets, whether to the PRC or anyone else. Nothing will gain institutional attention more quickly than the fear of losing a massive amount in federal funds.Finally, to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS): When are you going to get serious about your own part in all of this, and crack down on bogus students and scholars whose purpose is to steal U.S. technology, data, and other classified or highly sensitive materials? You need to put some backbone in the folks at your Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which has the regulatory authority to strip institutions of their right to accept foreign students. When was the last time this was done, other than a couple of fourth-rate visa mills here and there? Closing visa mills down is of some significance as a matter of numbers and system integrity, but if you want to contribute to national security, then you need to work with NASA, DOE, the Defense Department, and others to ensure that academia and its correlated scientific research world take their responsibilities to shield sensitive data with the seriousness it deserves and if they can't, then take away their right to host foreign students.The problem seems to me that while the PRC manages and integrates its intelligence-gathering and theft operations extremely well, our government doesn't seem to have any kind of coordinated mechanism at all to defend against their (or any other hostile nation's) efforts. It's an "ad hoc-ery" of responses which does not serve our long-term interests.Load-Date: March 5, 2020End of Document

Coronavirus War: Trump threatens to break relations with ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 14, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 289 wordsBodyU.S.President Donald Trumpagain questioned China's handling of the coronavirus pandemic on Thursday and, in one of his most forceful threats, raised the possibility of "breaking all relationship" with the Asian giant."There's a lot we could do," Trump said in an interview with Fox News, then adding,"We could break up every relationship." The president even noted that such a breakup would mean "saving $500 billion."In this regard, he said that despite his good relationship with China's representative, Xi Jinping,at this time " I do not feel like talking to him".Trump repeatedly accused Beijing of hiding the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in its early stages and has even questioned the official version of the origin of the virus, in contravention of the thesis of the World Health Organization (WHO) and experts.The Republican representative said he was "very disappointed" by the Chinese government's actions and its failure to stop the Covid-19 "where it came from," referring to the city of Wuhan,which would have prevented its expansion into the rest of the world."Itwas a matter of stupidity, or of incompetence or deliberation,"Trump opined in a further allusion to China's alleged guilt and responsibility in the outbreak.He was therefore not interested in resuming trade talks right now,especially with regard to the so-called Phase 1 of the trade agreement reached between the two.The United States is currently considering how to secure compensation for china's damage through the pandemic, as announced by the president.Trump also complained about the possibility that Chinese hackers may be stealing information and data from the U.S. government regarding the development of coronavirus vaccines or treatments.Load-Date: May 15, 2020End of Document

U.S. detected cyber espionage attempts from ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 25, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 547 wordsBodyA U.S. cybersecurity company said this week that it had detected the emergence of a spying situation by an alleged Chinese group, which occurred last January, when the coronavirus began to expand beyond China's borders.FireEye, the company cited, said in a report that it identified a peak in the activity of a hacker group under the name "APT41". The company said the situation began on January 20 and more than 75 of FireEye's customers were the target of cyberattacks, from manufacturers, media companies, to health organizations and nonprofit foundations.There were "multiple possible explanations" for peak activity, Said FireEye security architect Christopher Glyer, pointing to wide-ranging tensions between Washington and Beijing over trade and more recently on trade disputes over the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 17,000 people since last year.FireEye Logo (Photo: Reuters)The report stated that the situation was "one of the largest cyberespionage campaigns conducted by a Chinese organization in recent years that we have observed."FireEye declined to deliver identification of its affected customers. The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to the request for statements. For its part, the United States National Security Council and the Office of the National Director of Intelligence also did not make statements.The cybersecurity firm said the APT41 group abused failures recently found in software developed by Cisco, Citrix and other computer companies to try to penetrate network networks of network companies in the United States, Canada, Brittany, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and more than a dozen other countries.It is not yet known whether the data fell into the hands of cybercriminals but the vulnerability exposed millions of data (Photo: File)Cisco explained in an email that it has fixed the vulnerability and is aware of attempts to exploit that vulnerability. This was also shared by Citrix. The company said it has worked with FireEye to help identify "potential compromised areas."Other organizations have also identified a recent uptick in Beijing-linked cyberespionage acythivity.Matt Webster, a researcher at Secureworks, Dell's cybersecurity arm, explained in an email that his team has also seen evidence of increased activity from Chinese hacker groups "over the past few weeks." In particular, the professional said his team has identified a new digital infrastructure associated with APT41, naming it "Bronze Atlas".Joining hacking situations to any specific country or entity is generally tense and uncertain, however, FireEye said it has judged with "moderate confidence" that APT41 is composed of people hired by the Chinese government.FireEye's head of analysis, John Hultquist, said the activity was surprising because the hacking situation attributed to China has generally been more focused. "This broader action is a departure from that standard," he explainedthe professional.MORE ON THIS TOPIC:A Brooklyn principal died of coronavirus, the first known death of a public school staff memberA volunteer who will test the coronavirus vaccine spoke to Infobae: "This is my chance to make a difference in the world"I have coronavirus: today my mandatory isolation ends and the volunteer beginsLoad-Date: March 26, 2020End of Document

Continue reading WeChat has been censoring keywords about coronavirus, study findsChinese live-streaming platform YY has also been censoring coronavirus contentChina s most popular messaging app, Tencent-owned WeChat, has been censoring keywords about coronavirus since as early as January 1st, an analysis found. Popular Chinese livestreaming platform YY has been censoring coronavirus content, too.To make this determination, the research group Citizen Lab scripted group chat conversations and sent them to three test WeChat accounts, two in Canada and one in China. The chat conversations consisted of article headlines and text. The group, which is affiliated with the University of Toronto, sent them from one of the Canadian WeChat accounts to the Chinese one, and observed which messages the Chinese account got. 132 keyword combinations were censored in January, but that number rose to 516 keywords by the second week of February.ON WECHAT, 384 NEW CENSORED KEYWORDS WERE ADDED IN TWO WEEKS IN FEBRUARYOn YY, which is similar to Twitch or Mixer, 45 keywords were added to a blacklist on December 31st, 2019; five of those keywords were removed on February 10th, Citizen Lab found. YY s blacklist is in the app itself, unlike WeChat s, which uses a remote server for censorship.Public health officials from China first informed the World Health Organization about the virus at the end of December. The censorship has been going on since at least January 1st, and continued through the most intense part of the outbreak. WeChat has a monthly active user base of over one billion people   which means that a lot of users may have missed important information about the coronavirus, as well as how to prevent its spread.Censored keywords included factual information on the disease, references to the government s epidemic policies, and the name of Li Wenliang, a doctor who was among the earliest to warn the population about the disease. Li caught the disease while treating coronavirus patients and died on February 7th. His story created public outcry against the government s handling of the coronavirus.IT S NOT CLEAR WHY THE TWO COMPANIES DECIDED TO CENSOR CORONAVIRUS KEYWORDSIt s not clear why the two companies decided to censor keywords about coronavirus, though it s possible they were ordered to do so by the Chinese government. WeChat has close ties with the Chinese government, and the government has already used WeChat and Twitter to track down people Chinese officials felt were sharing negative information about the coronavirus outbreak.The censorship is particularly pernicious because the WeChat is a crucial part of many Chinese people s lives, David Jacobson, a professor of global business strategy at SMU s Cox School of Business and a visiting professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing, told BuzzFeed News.  As a platform, you can live your life with it,  Jacobson said in an interview with BuzzFeed News.  You can pay for things. You can do so much more. See Campaign:https://citizenlab.ca/2020/03/censored-contagion-how-information-on-the-coronavirus-is-managed-on-chinese-social-media/Contact Information:By Jay PetersTags:, Artificial Intelligence Newswire, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: March 4, 2020End of Document

The Russell 2000 outperformed with a 1.6% gain after a rough week for the small-cap index.The communication services (+1.3%), consumer discretionary (+1.1%), and materials (+1.0%) sectors led today's gains, helping the S&P 500 rebound from an early 1.3% decline. The utilities (-1.4%) and financials (-0.7%) sectors were Friday's laggards.Early in the day, economic data showed total retail sales decline a record 16.4% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) and industrial production decline 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%). The market wasn't visibly upset by the data, though, likely due to the prevailing view that it can't get any worse.Instead, there was a negative reaction to news that the Trump administration moved to block semiconductor shipments to China's Huawei Technologies. With relations already strained because of the coronavirus outbreak, the move renewed worries about potential Chinese retaliation against U.S. companies.Investors bought buy the dip, though, except in the semiconductor space given the headline negativity. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index declined 2.2%, which included an earnings-related decline in Applied Materials (AMAT 52.04, -2.39, -4.4%).Outside the semiconductor space, oil prices capped a strong week with another solid performance. WTI crude futures rose 7.1%, or $1.94, to $29.38/bbl today to extend its weekly advance to 18.8%.DraftKings (DKNG 29.23, +3.92, +15.5%) was an individual standout after the sports betting company topped EPS estimates and provided positive commentary regarding its outlook.U.S. Treasuries ended the week with modest losses. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.15%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 0.64%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 100.38.Reviewing Friday's economic data:Total retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) while retail sales, excluding autos, declined 17.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment.Industrial production declined 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%), which was the largest monthly drop in the 101-year history of the index. The capacity utilization rate fell from 73.2% to 64.9% (Briefing.com consensus 64.0%), which is 14.9 percentage points below its long-run average and a record-low in a series that dates back to 1967.The key takeaway from the report is that it is a reflection of how industrial production cratered amid shutdown orders designed to contain the spread of COVID-19. On a yr/yr basis, industrial production was down 15.0%.The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 73.7 in the preliminary reading for May (Briefing.com consensus 67.4) from 71.8 in April.The key takeaway from the report is that attitudes about current conditions improved while sentiment surrounding the outlook continued to deteriorate, pinched by concerns about financial prospects that were most notable among upper income households. That is apt to be a headwind for a pickup in consumer spending.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for May checked in at -48.5 (Briefing.com consensus -58.0) following the prior month's reading of -78.2.March job openings decreased to 6.191 mln from a revised 7.004 mln in February (from 6.882 mln). Business inventories decreased 0.2% in March, while the February reading was revised down to -0.5% from -0.4%.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NAHB Housing Market Index for May on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +0.5% YTDS&P 500 -11.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -17.0% YTDRussell 2000 -24.7% YTD16:19WSM Williams-Sonoma extends temporary closure of stores in US and Canada through May 31 in locations where retail restrictions have not been lifted (66.52 +1.36)16:18SUPN Supernus Pharma announces Paragraph IV ANDA filing for Oxtellar XR (23.40 +0.47)On May 14, Supernus Pharma received a Paragraph IV Notice Letter from Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp advising Supernus of the submission by Apotex of an Abbreviated New Drug Application to the FDA seeking approval for oxcarbazepine extended-release tablets.

This approval is based on Part 1a of the Phase 3 CheckMate -227 trial in which Opdivo + Yervoy (n=396) demonstrated superior overall survival (OS) versus chemotherapy regardless of tumor histology with a minimum follow up of 29.3 months. The median OS was 17.1 months versus 14.9 months. In the trial, 63% of patients treated with Opdivo + Yervoy and 56% treated with chemotherapy were alive at one year, and 40% and 33% at two years, respectively.15:59SCANX Large cap notable movers of interest -- DraftKings (DKNG) rises on quarterly financial results -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable large cap movers of interest ($10 bln - $200 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Large Cap GainersDKNG (29.19 +15.33%): Sees volatility after reporting Q1 results; co's revenues rose +30% yr/yr to $88.5 mln on upside EPS, and commented that it continues to progress with its key priorities despite the effects of COVID-19 on the world of sports; co has responded to the lack of major sports events by creating new product offerings to keep customers engaged, including fantasy sports and betting on eNASCAR, Counter Strike, and Rocket League, as well as launching pop culture free-to-play pools contests covering topics ranging from democratic debates to TV shows like Survivor; co does not anticipate an impact to its FY21 or long-term plans due to COVID-19.

The market appeared on track for another day of gains paced by longer tenors after the overnight session saw more signs of deteriorating U.S.-China relations and poor economic data from Europe. The U.S. Senate unanimously voted in favor of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act last night, followed by news that the Commerce Department extended the ban on U.S. companies doing business with Huawei for another year. At the same time, rules for granting special exemptions were tightened. Separate reports of U.S. officials blocking a shipment of chips intended for Huawei suggested that the updated rules were already being enforced. Treasuries extended their starting gains in immediate response to the April Retail Sales report (actual -16.4%; Briefing.com consensus -11.9%), which was even worse than expected. Treasuries backed down from their highs shortly after the post-data spike, spending the rest of the day in a steady pullback as equities fought to reclaim their losses. The long bond paced the early advance, but it also ended up leading the pullback after this week's show of relative strength. The 2s10s spread narrowed by five basis points to 49 bps since last Friday. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.1% to 100.40, narrowing this week's gain to 0.7%.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York will reduce its daily purchases of Treasuries to $6 bln from $7 bln next week. Japan's Finance Minister, Taro Aso, said that the draft for a second extra budget will be prepared on May 27. Germany's government is reportedly open to allowing public debt to exceed 80% of GDP to fund fiscal stimulus. The Italian government will relax lockdown measures on Monday and allow travel between regions on June 3. China's April Industrial Production increased 3.9% yr/yr (expected 1.5%; last -1.1%), April Retail Sales fell 7.5% yr/yr (expected -7.0%; last -15.8%), April Fixed Asset Investment fell 10.3% yr/yr (expected -10.0%; last -16.1%), and April Unemployment Rate ticked up to 6.0% from 5.9%. Hong Kong's Q1 GDP fell 5.3% qtr/qtr, as expected (last -0.3%), contracting 8.9% yr/yr, as expected (last -2.9%). South Korea's April trade deficit totaled $1.39 bln (last deficit of $950 mln). Imports fell 15.8% yr/yr (last -15.9%) while exports fell 25.1% yr/yr (last -24.3%). Eurozone's Q1 GDP contracted 3.8% qtr/qtr, as expected (last -3.8%), falling 3.2% yr/yr (expected -3.3%; last -3.3%). Q1 Employment decreased 0.2% qtr/qtr (expected -0.4%; last 0.3%). Germany's Q1 GDP fell 2.2% qtr/qtr, as expected (last -0.1%), contracting 1.9% yr/yr (expected -1.6%; last 0.2%). Italy's March Industrial New Orders plunged 26.5% m/m (last -4.1%) while Industrial Sales fell 25.8% m/m (last -1.7%). Today's Data: Total retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) while retail sales, excluding autos, declined 17.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%). The sales downturn was extreme with double-digit declines in most categories. The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment. Industrial production declined 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%), which was the largest monthly drop in the 101-year history of the index. The capacity utilization rate fell from 73.2% to 64.9% (Briefing.com consensus 64.0%), which is 14.9 percentage points below its long-run average and a record-low in a series that dates back to 1967. The key takeaway from the report is that it is a reflection of how industrial production cratered amid shutdown orders designed to contain the spread of COVID-19. On a yr/yr basis, industrial production was down 15.0%. The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 73.7 in the preliminary reading for May (Briefing.com consensus 67.4) from 71.8 in April. The key takeaway from the report is that attitudes about current conditions improved while sentiment surrounding the outlook continued to deteriorate, pinched by concerns about financial prospects that were most notable among upper income households. That is apt to be a headwind for a pickup in consumer spending. Business Inventories decreased 0.2% in March (Briefing.com consensus -0.4%) after decreasing a revised 0.5% (from -0.4%) in February. Job Openings decreased to 6.191 mln in March from a revised 7.004 mln (from 6.882 mln) in February.

The sector is down 1.6% for the week, but that is still better than the S&P 500's (-0.1%) 2.7% loss for the week.Today's outperformance comes despite the release of an awful Retail Sales report for April (actual -16.4%; Briefing.com consensus -11.9%), which showed that sales at clothing stores collapsed nearly 80%, sales at electronics at appliance stores plunged over 60%, while sales at furniture stores tumbled nearly 60% last month. This has not stopped several apparel retailers and electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY 79.13, +1.94, +2.5%) from appearing among today's leaders.Notable movers:Royal Caribbean (RCL 37.79, +2.64, +7.5%): leading performer, extending its rebound from a six-week low past its 50-day moving average (36.07).

Co expects to develop STI-1499 as a stand-alone therapy on account of the "high potency it has exhibited in experiments to date." It has a goal of scaling up manufacturing capacities to potentially provide tens of millions of doses within a short time period in order to meet the "vast projected demand." BCEL (19.32 +16.91%): Reported Q1 results and recent business updates; co noted that patients continue to be enrolled and treated in its Phase 1b dose-escalation trial of ATRC-101 in multiple solid tumors, and it noted that it is working closely with its alliance partners to advance R&D as quickly as possible to help address the COVID-19 pandemic.

The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000, however, is up 1.1%.Prior to the open, Reuters reported that the Trump administration was moving to block semiconductor shipments to China's Huawei Technologies, which raised the specter of possible Chinese retaliation on American companies. Shortly thereafter, the Retail Sales report for April showed a record 16.4% m/m decline in total retail sales (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%).The market has been more cognizant of reported tensions, as opposed to the weak data due to a view that the data can't get any worse with reopening efforts underway. Semiconductor companies are among today's weakest performers following the moves in Washington, evidenced by the 2.9% decline in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.Many of these companies, including Applied Materials (AMAT 51.51, -2.92, -5.4%) following its earnings report, have weighed on the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.7%). The utilities (-2.8%) and real estate (-2.0%) sectors are down the most, though.On the other hand, the energy sector (+0.6%) is following the positive move in oil prices ($29.16, +1.28, +4.6%), and the materials (+0.6%) and consumer staples (+0.3%) sectors also show relative strength.DraftKings (DKNG 28.84, +3.56, +14.0%) is an earnings standout, with shares rising 14% after the company topped EPS estimates and said it doesn't expect COVID-19 to impact its sports betting business long-term.Treasury prices have declined since the opening bell, bringing yields off early lows. The 10-yr yield is currently up one basis point to 0.64% after slipping below 0.60% at its low. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 100.40.Reviewing today's economic data:Total retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) while retail sales, excluding autos, declined 17.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment.Industrial production declined 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%), which was the largest monthly drop in the 101-year history of the index.

Approx. one dozen of these antibodies have demonstrated the ability to block the S1 protein's interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor used for viral entrance into human cells. These blocking antibodies were further tested for their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in an in vitro SARS-CoV-2 virus infection model pursuant to a preclinical testing agreement for COVID-19 therapeutic candidates that was previously announced on March 31.One antibody stood out for its ability to completely block SARS-CoV-2 infection of healthy cells in the experiments. STI-1499 completely neutralized the virus infectivity at a very low antibody dose, making it a prime candidate for further testing and development. Initial biochemical and biophysical analyses also indicate STI-1499 is a potentially strong antibody drug candidate.Sorrento has determined STI-1499 will likely be the first antibody in the antibody cocktail (COVI-SHIELD) it is developing. STI-1499 is also expected to be developed as a stand-alone therapy (COVI-GUARD) because of the high potency it has exhibited in experiments to date. Sorrento plans to request priority evaluation and accelerated review from regulators to determine the best pathway to make any potential treatment available as soon as possible. Sorrento's manufacturing facility in San Diego is expected to be able to produce up to two hundred thousand doses per month, and the company intends to produce a million doses at risk while seeking FDA approval for any STI-1499 product candidate. The company is seeking potential government support and pharmaceutical partners to further scale up STI-1499 manufacturing capacity with a goal of potentially providing tens of millions of doses in a short period of time to meet the vast projected demand.11:04TALKX Market Briefing: U.S.-China tension creates some unease and uneven tradingThe stock market is sagging as it confronts another batch of terrible economic data and reports about rising tension between the U.S. and China.Briefly, in April, retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m while industrial production declined a record 11.2%. Consumer sentiment actually improved some in May to 73.7 (from 71.8), yet that belies the fact that attitudes about the outlook actually deteriorated (to 67.7 from 70.1).There is a lot of headline noise surrounding U.S-China relations. The U.S. is moving to block shipments of semiconductors to Huawei and China is said to be entertaining countermeasures, which include restricting or investigating U.S. companies doing business there, if the U.S. follows through.The latter concern has been tempered somewhat by Chinese state media noting China hopes it can meet the U.S. "half way" in trade dealings. Separately, NEC Director Kudlow has denied that the U.S.-China trade deal is falling apart.The uncertain sense of where those relations actually stand has contributed to some uneven trading activity and a modest downward bias for the broader market.A weak showing from the information technology sector (-1.7%), which is feeling the brunt of the angst involving China, is the main drag on the broader market. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is down 3.8%. Other laggards of note include the utilities (-2.3%), real estate (-1.6%), and financial (-1.0%) sectors.Generally speaking, small-cap stocks are faring well, evidenced by the relative strength of the Russell 2000, which is drawing added support from many of its energy sector components. The latter are following crude prices higher ($28.75, +1.19, +4.3%).The Russell 2000 is up 0.7%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 are down 0.9%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.1%.10:18JCP J.

The high-beta group bounced off its 200-day moving average on Thursday, but it finds itself right back at that level today.The SOX index has widened this week's loss to 4.5% versus a 3.0% week-to-date loss in the S&P 500 (-0.4%). Today's weakness is being driven by selling in 29 out of 30 components after the Trump administration extended the ban on sales of chips based on American technology to Huawei for another year.On a side note, the world's largest contract chip foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM 50.85, -1.25, -2.4%), has agreed to build an advanced fabrication facility in Arizona, which will enable high-volume domestic production of processors and microcontrollers.Notable movers:Lam Research (LRCX 254.34, -14.66, -5.5%): weakest performer, falling back below its 200-day moving average (260.63).

These studies, led by Prasad Adusumilli, MD and collaborators at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence of the preclinical safety, improved functional characteristics and enhanced anti-tumor efficacy of ATA2271. Specifically, in vitro, ATA2271 exhibited antigen-specific cytotoxicity, accumulation and effector cytokine secretion, while in vivo results demonstrated that a single dose of ATA2271 led to tumor eradication and superior survival in mice compared to mesothelin-targeted M28z CAR T cells. Mice treated with a single dose of ATA2271 also showed sustained and persistent protection from tumor reestablishment upon 10 additional tumor re-challenges. Results from the study demonstrated the proposed advantages associated with functional persistence and cell-intrinsic PD-1 checkpoint blockade.09:22EDIT Editas Medicine presents data from pre-clinical study supporting use of CRISPR-Cas12a for the development of engineered cell immunotherapies (55.88 )Editas Medicine announced results from a pre-clinical study evaluating multi-gene knockout and transgene knock-in using its proprietary engineered CRISPR-Cas12a (EngCas12a) in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for the development of engineered cell immunotherapy medicines. The results of this study further reinforce Editas Medicine's belief in the transformative potential of iPSC-derived natural killer (iNK) cells as off-the-shelf engineered cell medicines for the treatment of solid tumor cancers.In this study, CRISPR-Cas12a was used to make highly edited iPSC clones. The iPSCs were then differentiated into functional iNK cells. The iNKs derived from the edited iPSC clones had enhanced tumor killing activity relative to iNKs from unedited iPSCs, demonstrating the utility of an edited iPSC platform. The company reported these data today in an oral presentation at the 23rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy, being held virtually.09:17ECONX April Capacity Utilization 64.9% vs 64.0% Briefing.com consensus09:16WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: -27.80.

While they've seen a few studies with sensitivity performance percentages in the 80s, we've also seen other studies with sensitivity at or above 90%, and one as high as 94%.While we understand no test is perfect, test outcomes depend on a number of factors including patient selection, specimen type, collection, handling, storage, transport and conformity to the way the test was designed to be run. ID NOW is intended to be used near the patient with a direct swab test method.It is our responsibility to provide healthcare professionals and the public with accurate information, and that's why we're doing the following:Further clarifying our product information to provide better guidance to healthcare providers that negative results should be considered in the context of a patient's recent exposures, history and the presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Negative results should be presumed negative, but if inconsistent with clinical signs and symptoms or necessary for patient management, should be tested with an alternative molecular assay. We are also reinforcing proper sample collection and handling instructions. We are communicating this to our customers. Continuing to optimize this test as the world learns more about this virus. We're working to incorporate those learnings into the test as we do with all of our diagnostics tests"06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets extend yesterday's rally; Oil and metals on the move higherThe global equity markets are generally higher with US futures extending gains into the overnight session.

The benchmark index was down as much as 1.9% in early action following a relatively disappointing weekly jobless claims report.The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite increased 0.9%. The Russell 2000 underperformed with a 0.4% gain.Total jobless claims for the week ending May 9 totaled 2.981 million (Briefing.com consensus 2.475 million) while continuing claims for the week ending May 2 totaled 22.833 million. The elevated figures raised doubts on a timely economic recovery, but the data might have prodded lawmakers to act more quickly for additional fiscal stimulus.Reports followed that the White House was interested in a bipartisan, fourth coronavirus relief bill (although not the $3 trillion bill proposed by House Democrats). The possibility for more stimulus, coupled with a view that the recent weakness in the market provided a good entry point, helped ignite a buy-the-dip mindset.The S&P 500 financials sector (+2.6%) set the rebound pace amid strength in the bank stocks, including Wells Fargo (WFC 24.06, +1.53, +6.8%) amid speculation that it could merge with Goldman Sachs (GS 174.45, +2.65, +1.5%). The consumer staples sector (-0.3%) was the only sector without a gain today.Sentiment might have also been boosted by an IEA report suggesting oil demand has been a little stronger than expected, The Wall Street Journal reporting that Taiwan Semi (TSM 52.10, +1.18, +2.3%) will announce plans to build an advanced chip factory in Arizona, and news that Connecticut overstated its weekly initial claims count by more than 200,000.The IEA report likely contributed to the 8.3% gain in WTI crude futures ($27.44/bbl, +2.10). Separately, Cisco (CSCO 43.85, +1.90, +4.5%) was an earnings standout after the company issued positive quarterly results and guidance.U.S. Treasuries finished mixed and little changed. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.63%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 100.31.Reviewing Thursday's economic data, which featured the weekly jobless claims report:Total jobless claims for the week ending May 9 were 2,981,000 (Briefing.com consensus 2.475 million). That was a decrease of 195,000 from the prior week, but still an exceedingly high number all things considered. Continuing claims for the week ending May 2 increased by 456,000 to 22.833 million, which is yet another record high.The key takeaway from the report is that the alarmingly high level of initial and continuing claims paints a risk of a slower recovery due to weaker consumer spending activity and the rising potential that temporary job losses become permanent job losses in an elongated recovery process.Import prices declined 2.6% in April, and prices, excluding oil, declined 0.5%. Export prices declined 3.3% in April, and prices, excluding agriculture, also declined 3.3%.Looking ahead, investors will receive a big batch of data on Friday: Retail Sales for April, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for May, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for April, Business Inventories for March, the JOLTS report for March, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for March.Nasdaq Composite -0.3% YTDS&P 500 -11.7% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -17.2% YTDRussell 2000 -25.8% YTD16:24NKE NIKE provides COVID-19 update; 100% of NIKE-owned stores now open across Greater China and South Korea (86.55 +0.53)As of today, 100% of NIKE-owned stores and over 95% of partner stores in Greater China and South Korea are open, with some still operating with reduced hours. In these markets, retail traffic trends are progressing, and while physical store traffic remains below prior year levels, this is largely offset by higher conversion rates and continued strong digital demand.Since mid-March, the vast majority of NIKE-owned and wholesale partner stores outside Greater China and South Korea have been completely closed. In light of store closures, product shipments to wholesale customers have slowed, resulting in significantly lower wholesale revenue and higher inventory. The company continues to expect this to have a material impact on its NIKE Direct and wholesale operations in North America, EMEA, and APLA in the fourth quarter.The company is seeing accelerated new member acquisition and strong digital demand across the global marketplace, with increased traffic and engagement on its mobile commerce and activity apps. It has increased its digital fulfillment capacity to meet higher demand.Store reopening has begun in over 15 countries including Germany, France, the Netherlands, Brazil, and the US. As of today, roughly 40% of NIKE-owned stores in EMEA, 15% in APLA, and 5% in North America are open, with some operating with reduced hours.

The mall business in general and department stores, specifically, have been particularly hard hit. While our balance sheet was already strong, we took decisive, sometimes difficult, actions to preserve liquidity and ensure our long-term viability.

Preliminary results were stronger than 2019 first quarter results due to positive show rotation at GES, partially offset by the impact of COVID-19.Preliminary net loss attributable to Viad was $10.6 million, versus a loss of $17.8 million in the 2019 first quarter. Preliminary adjusted segment operating loss was $8.4 million, versus a loss of $11.0 million in the prior year quarter, and adjusted segment EBITDA was $6.9 million, up $4.7 million from the 2019 first quarter.Commentary: "Based on the very difficult, yet necessary actions we have taken to reduce costs and preserve cash, and as we continue to collect accounts receivable, we anticipate that our cash outflow during the second quarter will approximate $40 million. This leaves us ample liquidity to withstand the near-term impacts of COVID-19.

The utilities (-1.4%) and financials (-0.7%) sectors were Friday's laggards.Early in the day, economic data showed total retail sales decline a record 16.4% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) and industrial production decline 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%). The market wasn't visibly upset by the data, though, likely due to the prevailing view that it can't get any worse.Instead, there was a negative reaction to news that the Trump administration moved to block semiconductor shipments to China's Huawei Technologies. With relations already strained because of the coronavirus outbreak, the move renewed worries about potential Chinese retaliation against U.S. companies.Investors bought buy the dip, though, except in the semiconductor space given the headline negativity. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index declined 2.2%, which included an earnings-related decline in Applied Materials (AMAT 52.04, -2.39, -4.4%).Outside the semiconductor space, oil prices capped a strong week with another solid performance. WTI crude futures rose 7.1%, or $1.94, to $29.38/bbl today to extend its weekly advance to 18.8%.DraftKings (DKNG 29.23, +3.92, +15.5%) was an individual standout after the sports betting company topped EPS estimates and provided positive commentary regarding its outlook.U.S. Treasuries ended the week with modest losses. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.15%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 0.64%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 100.38.Reviewing Friday's economic data:Total retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) while retail sales, excluding autos, declined 17.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment.Industrial production declined 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%), which was the largest monthly drop in the 101-year history of the index. The capacity utilization rate fell from 73.2% to 64.9% (Briefing.com consensus 64.0%), which is 14.9 percentage points below its long-run average and a record-low in a series that dates back to 1967.The key takeaway from the report is that it is a reflection of how industrial production cratered amid shutdown orders designed to contain the spread of COVID-19. On a yr/yr basis, industrial production was down 15.0%.The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 73.7 in the preliminary reading for May (Briefing.com consensus 67.4) from 71.8 in April.The key takeaway from the report is that attitudes about current conditions improved while sentiment surrounding the outlook continued to deteriorate, pinched by concerns about financial prospects that were most notable among upper income households. That is apt to be a headwind for a pickup in consumer spending.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for May checked in at -48.5 (Briefing.com consensus -58.0) following the prior month's reading of -78.2.March job openings decreased to 6.191 mln from a revised 7.004 mln in February (from 6.882 mln). Business inventories decreased 0.2% in March, while the February reading was revised down to -0.5% from -0.4%.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NAHB Housing Market Index for May on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +0.5% YTDS&P 500 -11.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -17.0% YTDRussell 2000 -24.7% YTD16:19WSM Williams-Sonoma extends temporary closure of stores in US and Canada through May 31 in locations where retail restrictions have not been lifted (66.52 +1.36)16:18SUPN Supernus Pharma announces Paragraph IV ANDA filing for Oxtellar XR (23.40 +0.47)On May 14, Supernus Pharma received a Paragraph IV Notice Letter from Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp advising Supernus of the submission by Apotex of an Abbreviated New Drug Application to the FDA seeking approval for oxcarbazepine extended-release tablets.

This approval is based on Part 1a of the Phase 3 CheckMate -227 trial in which Opdivo + Yervoy (n=396) demonstrated superior overall survival (OS) versus chemotherapy regardless of tumor histology with a minimum follow up of 29.3 months. The median OS was 17.1 months versus 14.9 months. In the trial, 63% of patients treated with Opdivo + Yervoy and 56% treated with chemotherapy were alive at one year, and 40% and 33% at two years, respectively.15:59SCANX Large cap notable movers of interest -- DraftKings (DKNG) rises on quarterly financial results -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable large cap movers of interest ($10 bln - $200 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Large Cap GainersDKNG (29.19 +15.33%): Sees volatility after reporting Q1 results; co's revenues rose +30% yr/yr to $88.5 mln on upside EPS, and commented that it continues to progress with its key priorities despite the effects of COVID-19 on the world of sports; co has responded to the lack of major sports events by creating new product offerings to keep customers engaged, including fantasy sports and betting on eNASCAR, Counter Strike, and Rocket League, as well as launching pop culture free-to-play pools contests covering topics ranging from democratic debates to TV shows like Survivor; co does not anticipate an impact to its FY21 or long-term plans due to COVID-19.

VFC (52.04 -6.13%): Missed expectations for Q4 EPS and revs (fell 10.8% yr/yr to $2.1 bln). Revenues weakened as a result of lower consumer demand tied to COVID-19. Currently, all of co's retail stores in the APAC region have re-opened; co is prepared to begin a phased re-opening of North American stores and expects most of its stores to be open by mid-year.

The market appeared on track for another day of gains paced by longer tenors after the overnight session saw more signs of deteriorating U.S.-China relations and poor economic data from Europe. The U.S. Senate unanimously voted in favor of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act last night, followed by news that the Commerce Department extended the ban on U.S. companies doing business with Huawei for another year. At the same time, rules for granting special exemptions were tightened. Separate reports of U.S. officials blocking a shipment of chips intended for Huawei suggested that the updated rules were already being enforced. Treasuries extended their starting gains in immediate response to the April Retail Sales report (actual -16.4%; Briefing.com consensus -11.9%), which was even worse than expected. Treasuries backed down from their highs shortly after the post-data spike, spending the rest of the day in a steady pullback as equities fought to reclaim their losses. The long bond paced the early advance, but it also ended up leading the pullback after this week's show of relative strength. The 2s10s spread narrowed by five basis points to 49 bps since last Friday. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.1% to 100.40, narrowing this week's gain to 0.7%. Yield Check: 2-yr: +1 bp to 0.15% (-1 bp for the week) 3-yr: +2 bps to 0.19% (UNCH for the week) 5-yr: +1 bp to 0.31% (-2 bps for the week) 10-yr: +2 bps to 0.64% (-4 bps for the week) 30-yr: +2 bps to 1.32% (-7 bps for the week)News: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company will establish an advanced chip foundry in Arizona. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York will reduce its daily purchases of Treasuries to $6 bln from $7 bln next week. Japan's Finance Minister, Taro Aso, said that the draft for a second extra budget will be prepared on May 27. Germany's government is reportedly open to allowing public debt to exceed 80% of GDP to fund fiscal stimulus. The Italian government will relax lockdown measures on Monday and allow travel between regions on June 3. China's April Industrial Production increased 3.9% yr/yr (expected 1.5%; last -1.1%), April Retail Sales fell 7.5% yr/yr (expected -7.0%; last -15.8%), April Fixed Asset Investment fell 10.3% yr/yr (expected -10.0%; last -16.1%), and April Unemployment Rate ticked up to 6.0% from 5.9%.

Today's Data: Total retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) while retail sales, excluding autos, declined 17.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%). The sales downturn was extreme with double-digit declines in most categories. The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment. Industrial production declined 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%), which was the largest monthly drop in the 101-year history of the index.

The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000, however, is up 1.1%.Prior to the open, Reuters reported that the Trump administration was moving to block semiconductor shipments to China's Huawei Technologies, which raised the specter of possible Chinese retaliation on American companies. Shortly thereafter, the Retail Sales report for April showed a record 16.4% m/m decline in total retail sales (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%).The market has been more cognizant of reported tensions, as opposed to the weak data due to a view that the data can't get any worse with reopening efforts underway. Semiconductor companies are among today's weakest performers following the moves in Washington, evidenced by the 2.9% decline in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.Many of these companies, including Applied Materials (AMAT 51.51, -2.92, -5.4%) following its earnings report, have weighed on the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.7%). The utilities (-2.8%) and real estate (-2.0%) sectors are down the most, though.On the other hand, the energy sector (+0.6%) is following the positive move in oil prices ($29.16, +1.28, +4.6%), and the materials (+0.6%) and consumer staples (+0.3%) sectors also show relative strength.DraftKings (DKNG 28.84, +3.56, +14.0%) is an earnings standout, with shares rising 14% after the company topped EPS estimates and said it doesn't expect COVID-19 to impact its sports betting business long-term.Treasury prices have declined since the opening bell, bringing yields off early lows. The 10-yr yield is currently up one basis point to 0.64% after slipping below 0.60% at its low. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 100.40.Reviewing today's economic data:Total retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) while retail sales, excluding autos, declined 17.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment.Industrial production declined 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%), which was the largest monthly drop in the 101-year history of the index. The capacity utilization rate fell from 73.2% to 64.9% (Briefing.com consensus 64.0%), which is 14.9 percentage points below its long-run average and a record-low in a series that dates back to 1967.The key takeaway from the report is that it is a reflection of how industrial production cratered amid shutdown orders designed to contain the spread of COVID-19. On a yr/yr basis, industrial production was down 15.0%.The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 73.7 in the preliminary reading for May (Briefing.com consensus 67.4) from 71.8 in April.The key takeaway from the report is that attitudes about current conditions improved while sentiment surrounding the outlook continued to deteriorate, pinched by concerns about financial prospects that were most notable among upper income households. That is apt to be a headwind for a pickup in consumer spending.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for May checked in at -48.5 (Briefing.com consensus -58.0) following the prior month's reading of -78.2.March job openings decreased to 6.191 mln from a revised 7.004 mln in February (from 6.882 mln). Business inventories decreased 0.2% in March, while the February reading was revised down to -0.5% from -0.4%.12:34GLYC GlycoMimetics announces presentation of preclinical research on uproleselan and GMI-1359 at Virtual AACR Annual Meeting (3.14 +0.25)During the June session, GlycoMimetics will present preclinical data that further support the potential of the company's compounds to be used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as well as in the setting of stem cell transplantation.

The sector is down 2.3% for the week versus a 3.6% week-to-date loss in the S&P 500 (-1.0%).More than half of the sector's components trade in the green, which explains the group's outperformance relative to the broader market. Manufacturers of packaged foods and cleaning products are in the lead, reflecting a belief that their products will remain in high demand.Notable movers:McCormick (MKC 178.96, +3.44, +2.0%): leading sector component, rising to a fresh record high. Estee Lauder (EL 166.06, +1.87, +1.1%): reclaiming its 50-day moving average (165.22).

Approx. one dozen of these antibodies have demonstrated the ability to block the S1 protein's interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor used for viral entrance into human cells. These blocking antibodies were further tested for their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in an in vitro SARS-CoV-2 virus infection model pursuant to a preclinical testing agreement for COVID-19 therapeutic candidates that was previously announced on March 31.One antibody stood out for its ability to completely block SARS-CoV-2 infection of healthy cells in the experiments. STI-1499 completely neutralized the virus infectivity at a very low antibody dose, making it a prime candidate for further testing and development. Initial biochemical and biophysical analyses also indicate STI-1499 is a potentially strong antibody drug candidate.Sorrento has determined STI-1499 will likely be the first antibody in the antibody cocktail (COVI-SHIELD) it is developing. STI-1499 is also expected to be developed as a stand-alone therapy (COVI-GUARD) because of the high potency it has exhibited in experiments to date. Sorrento plans to request priority evaluation and accelerated review from regulators to determine the best pathway to make any potential treatment available as soon as possible. Sorrento's manufacturing facility in San Diego is expected to be able to produce up to two hundred thousand doses per month, and the company intends to produce a million doses at risk while seeking FDA approval for any STI-1499 product candidate. The company is seeking potential government support and pharmaceutical partners to further scale up STI-1499 manufacturing capacity with a goal of potentially providing tens of millions of doses in a short period of time to meet the vast projected demand.11:04TALKX Market Briefing: U.S.-China tension creates some unease and uneven tradingThe stock market is sagging as it confronts another batch of terrible economic data and reports about rising tension between the U.S. and China.Briefly, in April, retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m while industrial production declined a record 11.2%. Consumer sentiment actually improved some in May to 73.7 (from 71.8), yet that belies the fact that attitudes about the outlook actually deteriorated (to 67.7 from 70.1).There is a lot of headline noise surrounding U.S-China relations. The U.S. is moving to block shipments of semiconductors to Huawei and China is said to be entertaining countermeasures, which include restricting or investigating U.S. companies doing business there, if the U.S. follows through.The latter concern has been tempered somewhat by Chinese state media noting China hopes it can meet the U.S. "half way" in trade dealings. Separately, NEC Director Kudlow has denied that the U.S.-China trade deal is falling apart.The uncertain sense of where those relations actually stand has contributed to some uneven trading activity and a modest downward bias for the broader market.A weak showing from the information technology sector (-1.7%), which is feeling the brunt of the angst involving China, is the main drag on the broader market. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is down 3.8%. Other laggards of note include the utilities (-2.3%), real estate (-1.6%), and financial (-1.0%) sectors.Generally speaking, small-cap stocks are faring well, evidenced by the relative strength of the Russell 2000, which is drawing added support from many of its energy sector components. The latter are following crude prices higher ($28.75, +1.19, +4.3%).The Russell 2000 is up 0.7%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 are down 0.9%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.1%.10:18JCP J.

The high-beta group bounced off its 200-day moving average on Thursday, but it finds itself right back at that level today.The SOX index has widened this week's loss to 4.5% versus a 3.0% week-to-date loss in the S&P 500 (-0.4%). Today's weakness is being driven by selling in 29 out of 30 components after the Trump administration extended the ban on sales of chips based on American technology to Huawei for another year.On a side note, the world's largest contract chip foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM 50.85, -1.25, -2.4%), has agreed to build an advanced fabrication facility in Arizona, which will enable high-volume domestic production of processors and microcontrollers.Notable movers:Lam Research (LRCX 254.34, -14.66, -5.5%): weakest performer, falling back below its 200-day moving average (260.63).

These studies provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence of the preclinical safety, improved functional characteristics and enhanced anti-tumor efficacy of ATA2271.09:41WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stocks extend weekly losses at openThe major indices start the session extending weekly losses amid increased tensions with China and more weak economic data. The S&P 500 is down 0.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors trade in negative territory, led lower by the financials (-1.2%), real estate (-1.8%), and utilities (-2.0%) sectors. The energy sector has recently turned positive with a 0.5% gain.U.S. Treasuries trade mixed. The 2-yr yield is flat at 0.14%, and the 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 0.60%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.3% to 100.12. WTI crude is up 2.8% to $28.66/bbl.09:41ATRA Atara Biotherapeutics presents an abstract describing the preclinical safety, improved functional characteristics and antitumor efficacy of ATA2271 (9.60 +0.02)Data being presented for the first time at AACR detail results from IND-enabling preclinical studies with ATA2271 technologies, designed to help overcome current CAR T challenges with targeting solid tumors, including the novel 1XX CAR signaling domain and a dominant-negative programmed death-1 receptor (PD1DNR). These studies, led by Prasad Adusumilli, MD and collaborators at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence of the preclinical safety, improved functional characteristics and enhanced anti-tumor efficacy of ATA2271. Specifically, in vitro, ATA2271 exhibited antigen-specific cytotoxicity, accumulation and effector cytokine secretion, while in vivo results demonstrated that a single dose of ATA2271 led to tumor eradication and superior survival in mice compared to mesothelin-targeted M28z CAR T cells. Mice treated with a single dose of ATA2271 also showed sustained and persistent protection from tumor reestablishment upon 10 additional tumor re-challenges. Results from the study demonstrated the proposed advantages associated with functional persistence and cell-intrinsic PD-1 checkpoint blockade.09:22EDIT Editas Medicine presents data from pre-clinical study supporting use of CRISPR-Cas12a for the development of engineered cell immunotherapies (55.88 )Editas Medicine announced results from a pre-clinical study evaluating multi-gene knockout and transgene knock-in using its proprietary engineered CRISPR-Cas12a (EngCas12a) in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for the development of engineered cell immunotherapy medicines. The results of this study further reinforce Editas Medicine's belief in the transformative potential of iPSC-derived natural killer (iNK) cells as off-the-shelf engineered cell medicines for the treatment of solid tumor cancers.In this study, CRISPR-Cas12a was used to make highly edited iPSC clones. The iPSCs were then differentiated into functional iNK cells. The iNKs derived from the edited iPSC clones had enhanced tumor killing activity relative to iNKs from unedited iPSCs, demonstrating the utility of an edited iPSC platform. The company reported these data today in an oral presentation at the 23rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy, being held virtually.09:17ECONX April Capacity Utilization 64.9% vs 64.0% Briefing.com consensus09:16WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: -27.80. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -135.00.Futures point to sharp losses at the open, as tensions with China appear to escalate and data showed a weaker-than-expected retail sales report. The S&P 500 futures trade 28 points, or 1.0%, below fair value.The Trump administration is reportedly looking to block semiconductor shipments to Huawei, which hasn't sat well with China for obvious reasons. The editor for China's Global Times tweeted that possible retaliation on American companies could result if such an action is taken.Regarding the retail sales report, total sales plunged 16.4% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%). The market, though, has been under impression that economic activity will bounce back with reopening efforts. The headline figure sure is awful, though.09:11WIRES On The WiresTCR2 Therapeutics (TCRR) will present an e-poster at the AACR Virtual Annual Meeting II highlighting preclinical data of the company's proprietary T Cell Receptor Fusion Construct (TRuC) T cells that co-express a PD-1:CD28 switch receptor, which acts as a cell-intrinsic mechanism to overcome PD-L1/PD-L2 mediated immunosuppression. Upon repeated antigen stimulation, co-expression of the switch receptor in mesothelin-targeting TC-210 T cells enhanced TCR downstream signaling, prevented PD-L1-mediatied functional T-cell inhibition, significantly increased proliferation, and augmented the production of growth and effector cytokines.

PTI-125 significantly reduced a secondary endpoint, CSF levels of IL1-beta (p<0.035), a core biomarker of neuroinflammation, from baseline to Day 28. Drug was safe and well-tolerated.A post-hoc analysis of biomarker data revealed high variability in levels of CSF biomarkers over 28 days. For example, placebo-treated patients recorded changes in levels of CSF tau and p-tau ranging from -54% to +34% and -49% to +253%, respectively, from baseline to Day 28. Biomarker analysis was conducted by outside labs.The drug effects of PTI-125, if any, may have been masked in this study by high variability in levels of biomarkers of disease.

The benchmark index was down as much as 1.9% in early action following a relatively disappointing weekly jobless claims report.The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite increased 0.9%. The Russell 2000 underperformed with a 0.4% gain.Total jobless claims for the week ending May 9 totaled 2.981 million (Briefing.com consensus 2.475 million) while continuing claims for the week ending May 2 totaled 22.833 million. The elevated figures raised doubts on a timely economic recovery, but the data might have prodded lawmakers to act more quickly for additional fiscal stimulus.Reports followed that the White House was interested in a bipartisan, fourth coronavirus relief bill (although not the $3 trillion bill proposed by House Democrats). The possibility for more stimulus, coupled with a view that the recent weakness in the market provided a good entry point, helped ignite a buy-the-dip mindset.The S&P 500 financials sector (+2.6%) set the rebound pace amid strength in the bank stocks, including Wells Fargo (WFC 24.06, +1.53, +6.8%) amid speculation that it could merge with Goldman Sachs (GS 174.45, +2.65, +1.5%). The consumer staples sector (-0.3%) was the only sector without a gain today.Sentiment might have also been boosted by an IEA report suggesting oil demand has been a little stronger than expected, The Wall Street Journal reporting that Taiwan Semi (TSM 52.10, +1.18, +2.3%) will announce plans to build an advanced chip factory in Arizona, and news that Connecticut overstated its weekly initial claims count by more than 200,000.The IEA report likely contributed to the 8.3% gain in WTI crude futures ($27.44/bbl, +2.10). Separately, Cisco (CSCO 43.85, +1.90, +4.5%) was an earnings standout after the company issued positive quarterly results and guidance.U.S. Treasuries finished mixed and little changed. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.63%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 100.31.Reviewing Thursday's economic data, which featured the weekly jobless claims report:Total jobless claims for the week ending May 9 were 2,981,000 (Briefing.com consensus 2.475 million). That was a decrease of 195,000 from the prior week, but still an exceedingly high number all things considered. Continuing claims for the week ending May 2 increased by 456,000 to 22.833 million, which is yet another record high.The key takeaway from the report is that the alarmingly high level of initial and continuing claims paints a risk of a slower recovery due to weaker consumer spending activity and the rising potential that temporary job losses become permanent job losses in an elongated recovery process.Import prices declined 2.6% in April, and prices, excluding oil, declined 0.5%. Export prices declined 3.3% in April, and prices, excluding agriculture, also declined 3.3%.Looking ahead, investors will receive a big batch of data on Friday: Retail Sales for April, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for May, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for April, Business Inventories for March, the JOLTS report for March, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for March.Nasdaq Composite -0.3% YTDS&P 500 -11.7% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -17.2% YTDRussell 2000 -25.8% YTD16:24NKE NIKE provides COVID-19 update; 100% of NIKE-owned stores now open across Greater China and South Korea (86.55 +0.53)As of today, 100% of NIKE-owned stores and over 95% of partner stores in Greater China and South Korea are open, with some still operating with reduced hours. In these markets, retail traffic trends are progressing, and while physical store traffic remains below prior year levels, this is largely offset by higher conversion rates and continued strong digital demand.Since mid-March, the vast majority of NIKE-owned and wholesale partner stores outside Greater China and South Korea have been completely closed. In light of store closures, product shipments to wholesale customers have slowed, resulting in significantly lower wholesale revenue and higher inventory. The company continues to expect this to have a material impact on its NIKE Direct and wholesale operations in North America, EMEA, and APLA in the fourth quarter.The company is seeing accelerated new member acquisition and strong digital demand across the global marketplace, with increased traffic and engagement on its mobile commerce and activity apps. It has increased its digital fulfillment capacity to meet higher demand.Store reopening has begun in over 15 countries including Germany, France, the Netherlands, Brazil, and the US. As of today, roughly 40% of NIKE-owned stores in EMEA, 15% in APLA, and 5% in North America are open, with some operating with reduced hours.

Preliminary results were stronger than 2019 first quarter results due to positive show rotation at GES, partially offset by the impact of COVID-19.Preliminary net loss attributable to Viad was $10.6 million, versus a loss of $17.8 million in the 2019 first quarter. Preliminary adjusted segment operating loss was $8.4 million, versus a loss of $11.0 million in the prior year quarter, and adjusted segment EBITDA was $6.9 million, up $4.7 million from the 2019 first quarter.Commentary: "Based on the very difficult, yet necessary actions we have taken to reduce costs and preserve cash, and as we continue to collect accounts receivable, we anticipate that our cash outflow during the second quarter will approximate $40 million. This leaves us ample liquidity to withstand the near-term impacts of COVID-19. Additionally, we are in productive discussions with our lender group for longer-term covenant relief, as we evaluate options to help ensure we have adequate liquidity for the future."16:15DENN Denny's beats by $0.07, reports revs in-line; Domestic system-wide same-store sales decreased -6.3% (8.77 +0.00)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.17 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.07 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.10; revenues fell 36.1% year/year to $96.7 mln vs the $96.83 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Domestic system-wide same-store sales decreased -6.3%.Domestic system-wide same-store sales have sequentially improved over the last few weeks of April, as compared to the equivalent weeks of 2019, from the low of -80% experienced in the final week of Q1, which ended on March 25.Average unit volumes of off-premise sales have more than doubled from February 2020 to April 2020, supported by temporarily waived delivery fees, new "Dine-Thru" curbside service programs, and recently launched shareable family meal packs.

The Russell 2000 outperformed with a 1.6% gain after a rough week for the small-cap index.The communication services (+1.3%), consumer discretionary (+1.1%), and materials (+1.0%) sectors led today's gains, helping the S&P 500 rebound from an early 1.3% decline. The utilities (-1.4%) and financials (-0.7%) sectors were Friday's laggards.Early in the day, economic data showed total retail sales decline a record 16.4% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) and industrial production decline 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%). The market wasn't visibly upset by the data, though, likely due to the prevailing view that it can't get any worse.Instead, there was a negative reaction to news that the Trump administration moved to block semiconductor shipments to China's Huawei Technologies. With relations already strained because of the coronavirus outbreak, the move renewed worries about potential Chinese retaliation against U.S. companies.Investors bought buy the dip, though, except in the semiconductor space given the headline negativity. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index declined 2.2%, which included an earnings-related decline in Applied Materials (AMAT 52.04, -2.39, -4.4%).Outside the semiconductor space, oil prices capped a strong week with another solid performance. WTI crude futures rose 7.1%, or $1.94, to $29.38/bbl today to extend its weekly advance to 18.8%.DraftKings (DKNG 29.23, +3.92, +15.5%) was an individual standout after the sports betting company topped EPS estimates and provided positive commentary regarding its outlook.U.S. Treasuries ended the week with modest losses. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.15%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 0.64%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 100.38.Reviewing Friday's economic data:Total retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) while retail sales, excluding autos, declined 17.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment.Industrial production declined 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%), which was the largest monthly drop in the 101-year history of the index. The capacity utilization rate fell from 73.2% to 64.9% (Briefing.com consensus 64.0%), which is 14.9 percentage points below its long-run average and a record-low in a series that dates back to 1967.The key takeaway from the report is that it is a reflection of how industrial production cratered amid shutdown orders designed to contain the spread of COVID-19. On a yr/yr basis, industrial production was down 15.0%.The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 73.7 in the preliminary reading for May (Briefing.com consensus 67.4) from 71.8 in April.The key takeaway from the report is that attitudes about current conditions improved while sentiment surrounding the outlook continued to deteriorate, pinched by concerns about financial prospects that were most notable among upper income households. That is apt to be a headwind for a pickup in consumer spending.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for May checked in at -48.5 (Briefing.com consensus -58.0) following the prior month's reading of -78.2.March job openings decreased to 6.191 mln from a revised 7.004 mln in February (from 6.882 mln).

This approval is based on Part 1a of the Phase 3 CheckMate -227 trial in which Opdivo + Yervoy (n=396) demonstrated superior overall survival (OS) versus chemotherapy regardless of tumor histology with a minimum follow up of 29.3 months. The median OS was 17.1 months versus 14.9 months. In the trial, 63% of patients treated with Opdivo + Yervoy and 56% treated with chemotherapy were alive at one year, and 40% and 33% at two years, respectively.15:59SCANX Large cap notable movers of interest -- DraftKings (DKNG) rises on quarterly financial results -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable large cap movers of interest ($10 bln - $200 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Large Cap GainersDKNG (29.19 +15.33%): Sees volatility after reporting Q1 results; co's revenues rose +30% yr/yr to $88.5 mln on upside EPS, and commented that it continues to progress with its key priorities despite the effects of COVID-19 on the world of sports; co has responded to the lack of major sports events by creating new product offerings to keep customers engaged, including fantasy sports and betting on eNASCAR, Counter Strike, and Rocket League, as well as launching pop culture free-to-play pools contests covering topics ranging from democratic debates to TV shows like Survivor; co does not anticipate an impact to its FY21 or long-term plans due to COVID-19.

TER (56.84 -7,41%): Semiconductors generally underperform on renewed US-China tensions surrounding the Trump administration's latest Huawei trade restrictions. (Related: LRCX, QCOM...) VFC (52.04 -6.13%): Missed expectations for Q4 EPS and revs (fell 10.8% yr/yr to $2.1 bln). Revenues weakened as a result of lower consumer demand tied to COVID-19. Currently, all of co's retail stores in the APAC region have re-opened; co is prepared to begin a phased re-opening of North American stores and expects most of its stores to be open by mid-year. Did not issue formal FY21 financial guidance given COVID-19 uncertainties; expects Q1 revs to be down slightly more than 50%.15:49DCPH Deciphera Pharmaceuticals: FDA approves Qinlock (ripretinib) tablets for treatment of advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (shares remain halted) (51.74 +3.27)The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Qinlock (ripretinib) tablets as the first new drug specifically approved as a fourth-line treatment for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), a type of tumor that originates in the gastrointestinal tract.

The market appeared on track for another day of gains paced by longer tenors after the overnight session saw more signs of deteriorating U.S.-China relations and poor economic data from Europe. The U.S. Senate unanimously voted in favor of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act last night, followed by news that the Commerce Department extended the ban on U.S. companies doing business with Huawei for another year. At the same time, rules for granting special exemptions were tightened. Separate reports of U.S. officials blocking a shipment of chips intended for Huawei suggested that the updated rules were already being enforced. Treasuries extended their starting gains in immediate response to the April Retail Sales report (actual -16.4%; Briefing.com consensus -11.9%), which was even worse than expected. Treasuries backed down from their highs shortly after the post-data spike, spending the rest of the day in a steady pullback as equities fought to reclaim their losses. The long bond paced the early advance, but it also ended up leading the pullback after this week's show of relative strength. The 2s10s spread narrowed by five basis points to 49 bps since last Friday. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.1% to 100.40, narrowing this week's gain to 0.7%.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York will reduce its daily purchases of Treasuries to $6 bln from $7 bln next week. Japan's Finance Minister, Taro Aso, said that the draft for a second extra budget will be prepared on May 27. Germany's government is reportedly open to allowing public debt to exceed 80% of GDP to fund fiscal stimulus. The Italian government will relax lockdown measures on Monday and allow travel between regions on June 3.

Today's Data: Total retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) while retail sales, excluding autos, declined 17.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%). The sales downturn was extreme with double-digit declines in most categories. The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment. Industrial production declined 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%), which was the largest monthly drop in the 101-year history of the index.

That is apt to be a headwind for a pickup in consumer spending. Business Inventories decreased 0.2% in March (Briefing.com consensus -0.4%) after decreasing a revised 0.5% (from -0.4%) in February. Job Openings decreased to 6.191 mln in March from a revised 7.004 mln (from 6.882 mln) in February. The Empire State Manufacturing Survey increased to -48.5 in May (Briefing.com consensus -58.0) from -78.2 in April.

The sector is down 1.6% for the week, but that is still better than the S&P 500's (-0.1%) 2.7% loss for the week.Today's outperformance comes despite the release of an awful Retail Sales report for April (actual -16.4%; Briefing.com consensus -11.9%), which showed that sales at clothing stores collapsed nearly 80%, sales at electronics at appliance stores plunged over 60%, while sales at furniture stores tumbled nearly 60% last month. This has not stopped several apparel retailers and electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY 79.13, +1.94, +2.5%) from appearing among today's leaders.Notable movers:Royal Caribbean (RCL 37.79, +2.64, +7.5%): leading performer, extending its rebound from a six-week low past its 50-day moving average (36.07).

Co expects to develop STI-1499 as a stand-alone therapy on account of the "high potency it has exhibited in experiments to date." It has a goal of scaling up manufacturing capacities to potentially provide tens of millions of doses within a short time period in order to meet the "vast projected demand." BCEL (19.32 +16.91%): Reported Q1 results and recent business updates; co noted that patients continue to be enrolled and treated in its Phase 1b dose-escalation trial of ATRC-101 in multiple solid tumors, and it noted that it is working closely with its alliance partners to advance R&D as quickly as possible to help address the COVID-19 pandemic. Co reported a net loss of $(20.4) mln for the quarter. FSM (3.89 +15.77%): Co reported Q1 results; sales were $47.5 mln while adj. EBITDA for the quarter was $15.9 mln; results were marked by lower production at the San Jose Mine and negative metal price adjustments at the end of March, among other factors. Free cash flow from ongoing operations was $14.2 mln. For May, co looks forward to a gradual resumption of operations at San Jose and a re-commencement of construction at Lindero.

VVI (14.65 -11.96%): Issued upside preliminary results for Q1, seeing revs up +7.1% yr/yr to $306.0 mln due to a positive show rotation of approx. $57 mln at GES, partially offset by show postponements and cancellations due to COVID-19. Co has recently re-opened certain experiences, including FlyOver Iceland, and plans to re-open other Pursuit experiences in June as COVID-19 restrictions ease, but most exhibition and event activity has yet to resume. Co has suspended future dividend payments and share repurchases; it anticipates Q2 cash outflow of approx. $40 mln. Co is in discussions with its lenders for longer-term covenant relief.

The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000, however, is up 1.1%.Prior to the open, Reuters reported that the Trump administration was moving to block semiconductor shipments to China's Huawei Technologies, which raised the specter of possible Chinese retaliation on American companies. Shortly thereafter, the Retail Sales report for April showed a record 16.4% m/m decline in total retail sales (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%).The market has been more cognizant of reported tensions, as opposed to the weak data due to a view that the data can't get any worse with reopening efforts underway. Semiconductor companies are among today's weakest performers following the moves in Washington, evidenced by the 2.9% decline in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.Many of these companies, including Applied Materials (AMAT 51.51, -2.92, -5.4%) following its earnings report, have weighed on the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.7%). The utilities (-2.8%) and real estate (-2.0%) sectors are down the most, though.On the other hand, the energy sector (+0.6%) is following the positive move in oil prices ($29.16, +1.28, +4.6%), and the materials (+0.6%) and consumer staples (+0.3%) sectors also show relative strength.DraftKings (DKNG 28.84, +3.56, +14.0%) is an earnings standout, with shares rising 14% after the company topped EPS estimates and said it doesn't expect COVID-19 to impact its sports betting business long-term.Treasury prices have declined since the opening bell, bringing yields off early lows. The 10-yr yield is currently up one basis point to 0.64% after slipping below 0.60% at its low. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 100.40.Reviewing today's economic data:Total retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) while retail sales, excluding autos, declined 17.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment.Industrial production declined 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%), which was the largest monthly drop in the 101-year history of the index. The capacity utilization rate fell from 73.2% to 64.9% (Briefing.com consensus 64.0%), which is 14.9 percentage points below its long-run average and a record-low in a series that dates back to 1967.The key takeaway from the report is that it is a reflection of how industrial production cratered amid shutdown orders designed to contain the spread of COVID-19. On a yr/yr basis, industrial production was down 15.0%.The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 73.7 in the preliminary reading for May (Briefing.com consensus 67.4) from 71.8 in April.The key takeaway from the report is that attitudes about current conditions improved while sentiment surrounding the outlook continued to deteriorate, pinched by concerns about financial prospects that were most notable among upper income households. That is apt to be a headwind for a pickup in consumer spending.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for May checked in at -48.5 (Briefing.com consensus -58.0) following the prior month's reading of -78.2.March job openings decreased to 6.191 mln from a revised 7.004 mln in February (from 6.882 mln).

Approx. one dozen of these antibodies have demonstrated the ability to block the S1 protein's interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor used for viral entrance into human cells. These blocking antibodies were further tested for their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in an in vitro SARS-CoV-2 virus infection model pursuant to a preclinical testing agreement for COVID-19 therapeutic candidates that was previously announced on March 31.One antibody stood out for its ability to completely block SARS-CoV-2 infection of healthy cells in the experiments. STI-1499 completely neutralized the virus infectivity at a very low antibody dose, making it a prime candidate for further testing and development. Initial biochemical and biophysical analyses also indicate STI-1499 is a potentially strong antibody drug candidate.Sorrento has determined STI-1499 will likely be the first antibody in the antibody cocktail (COVI-SHIELD) it is developing. STI-1499 is also expected to be developed as a stand-alone therapy (COVI-GUARD) because of the high potency it has exhibited in experiments to date. Sorrento plans to request priority evaluation and accelerated review from regulators to determine the best pathway to make any potential treatment available as soon as possible. Sorrento's manufacturing facility in San Diego is expected to be able to produce up to two hundred thousand doses per month, and the company intends to produce a million doses at risk while seeking FDA approval for any STI-1499 product candidate. The company is seeking potential government support and pharmaceutical partners to further scale up STI-1499 manufacturing capacity with a goal of potentially providing tens of millions of doses in a short period of time to meet the vast projected demand.11:04TALKX Market Briefing: U.S.-China tension creates some unease and uneven tradingThe stock market is sagging as it confronts another batch of terrible economic data and reports about rising tension between the U.S. and China.Briefly, in April, retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m while industrial production declined a record 11.2%. Consumer sentiment actually improved some in May to 73.7 (from 71.8), yet that belies the fact that attitudes about the outlook actually deteriorated (to 67.7 from 70.1).There is a lot of headline noise surrounding U.S-China relations. The U.S. is moving to block shipments of semiconductors to Huawei and China is said to be entertaining countermeasures, which include restricting or investigating U.S. companies doing business there, if the U.S. follows through.The latter concern has been tempered somewhat by Chinese state media noting China hopes it can meet the U.S. "half way" in trade dealings. Separately, NEC Director Kudlow has denied that the U.S.-China trade deal is falling apart.The uncertain sense of where those relations actually stand has contributed to some uneven trading activity and a modest downward bias for the broader market.A weak showing from the information technology sector (-1.7%), which is feeling the brunt of the angst involving China, is the main drag on the broader market. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is down 3.8%. Other laggards of note include the utilities (-2.3%), real estate (-1.6%), and financial (-1.0%) sectors.Generally speaking, small-cap stocks are faring well, evidenced by the relative strength of the Russell 2000, which is drawing added support from many of its energy sector components. The latter are following crude prices higher ($28.75, +1.19, +4.3%).The Russell 2000 is up 0.7%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 are down 0.9%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.1%.10:18JCP J.

These studies, led by Prasad Adusumilli, MD and collaborators at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence of the preclinical safety, improved functional characteristics and enhanced anti-tumor efficacy of ATA2271. Specifically, in vitro, ATA2271 exhibited antigen-specific cytotoxicity, accumulation and effector cytokine secretion, while in vivo results demonstrated that a single dose of ATA2271 led to tumor eradication and superior survival in mice compared to mesothelin-targeted M28z CAR T cells. Mice treated with a single dose of ATA2271 also showed sustained and persistent protection from tumor reestablishment upon 10 additional tumor re-challenges. Results from the study demonstrated the proposed advantages associated with functional persistence and cell-intrinsic PD-1 checkpoint blockade.09:22EDIT Editas Medicine presents data from pre-clinical study supporting use of CRISPR-Cas12a for the development of engineered cell immunotherapies (55.88 )Editas Medicine announced results from a pre-clinical study evaluating multi-gene knockout and transgene knock-in using its proprietary engineered CRISPR-Cas12a (EngCas12a) in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for the development of engineered cell immunotherapy medicines. The results of this study further reinforce Editas Medicine's belief in the transformative potential of iPSC-derived natural killer (iNK) cells as off-the-shelf engineered cell medicines for the treatment of solid tumor cancers.In this study, CRISPR-Cas12a was used to make highly edited iPSC clones. The iPSCs were then differentiated into functional iNK cells. The iNKs derived from the edited iPSC clones had enhanced tumor killing activity relative to iNKs from unedited iPSCs, demonstrating the utility of an edited iPSC platform. The company reported these data today in an oral presentation at the 23rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy, being held virtually.09:17ECONX April Capacity Utilization 64.9% vs 64.0% Briefing.com consensus09:16WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: -27.80.

The benchmark index was down as much as 1.9% in early action following a relatively disappointing weekly jobless claims report.The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite increased 0.9%. The Russell 2000 underperformed with a 0.4% gain.Total jobless claims for the week ending May 9 totaled 2.981 million (Briefing.com consensus 2.475 million) while continuing claims for the week ending May 2 totaled 22.833 million. The elevated figures raised doubts on a timely economic recovery, but the data might have prodded lawmakers to act more quickly for additional fiscal stimulus.Reports followed that the White House was interested in a bipartisan, fourth coronavirus relief bill (although not the $3 trillion bill proposed by House Democrats). The possibility for more stimulus, coupled with a view that the recent weakness in the market provided a good entry point, helped ignite a buy-the-dip mindset.The S&P 500 financials sector (+2.6%) set the rebound pace amid strength in the bank stocks, including Wells Fargo (WFC 24.06, +1.53, +6.8%) amid speculation that it could merge with Goldman Sachs (GS 174.45, +2.65, +1.5%). The consumer staples sector (-0.3%) was the only sector without a gain today.Sentiment might have also been boosted by an IEA report suggesting oil demand has been a little stronger than expected, The Wall Street Journal reporting that Taiwan Semi (TSM 52.10, +1.18, +2.3%) will announce plans to build an advanced chip factory in Arizona, and news that Connecticut overstated its weekly initial claims count by more than 200,000.The IEA report likely contributed to the 8.3% gain in WTI crude futures ($27.44/bbl, +2.10). Separately, Cisco (CSCO 43.85, +1.90, +4.5%) was an earnings standout after the company issued positive quarterly results and guidance.U.S. Treasuries finished mixed and little changed. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.63%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 100.31.Reviewing Thursday's economic data, which featured the weekly jobless claims report:Total jobless claims for the week ending May 9 were 2,981,000 (Briefing.com consensus 2.475 million). That was a decrease of 195,000 from the prior week, but still an exceedingly high number all things considered. Continuing claims for the week ending May 2 increased by 456,000 to 22.833 million, which is yet another record high.The key takeaway from the report is that the alarmingly high level of initial and continuing claims paints a risk of a slower recovery due to weaker consumer spending activity and the rising potential that temporary job losses become permanent job losses in an elongated recovery process.Import prices declined 2.6% in April, and prices, excluding oil, declined 0.5%. Export prices declined 3.3% in April, and prices, excluding agriculture, also declined 3.3%.Looking ahead, investors will receive a big batch of data on Friday: Retail Sales for April, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for May, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for April, Business Inventories for March, the JOLTS report for March, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for March.Nasdaq Composite -0.3% YTDS&P 500 -11.7% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -17.2% YTDRussell 2000 -25.8% YTD16:24NKE NIKE provides COVID-19 update; 100% of NIKE-owned stores now open across Greater China and South Korea (86.55 +0.53)As of today, 100% of NIKE-owned stores and over 95% of partner stores in Greater China and South Korea are open, with some still operating with reduced hours. In these markets, retail traffic trends are progressing, and while physical store traffic remains below prior year levels, this is largely offset by higher conversion rates and continued strong digital demand.Since mid-March, the vast majority of NIKE-owned and wholesale partner stores outside Greater China and South Korea have been completely closed. In light of store closures, product shipments to wholesale customers have slowed, resulting in significantly lower wholesale revenue and higher inventory. The company continues to expect this to have a material impact on its NIKE Direct and wholesale operations in North America, EMEA, and APLA in the fourth quarter.The company is seeing accelerated new member acquisition and strong digital demand across the global marketplace, with increased traffic and engagement on its mobile commerce and activity apps. It has increased its digital fulfillment capacity to meet higher demand.Store reopening has begun in over 15 countries including Germany, France, the Netherlands, Brazil, and the US. As of today, roughly 40% of NIKE-owned stores in EMEA, 15% in APLA, and 5% in North America are open, with some operating with reduced hours. Wholesale partners in these countries have also begun to re-open stores.16:20APD Air Products to invest $2 bln in coal-to-methanol project in Indonesia (225.62 -0.22)Air Products has signed a definitive agreement for a long-term on-site contract for a world-scale coal-to-methanol production facility in Bengalon, East Kalimantan, Indonesia.

The mall business in general and department stores, specifically, have been particularly hard hit. While our balance sheet was already strong, we took decisive, sometimes difficult, actions to preserve liquidity and ensure our long-term viability. As we re-open stores, we see positive things happening. We believe people are ready to get out and shop. We are hoping this is the start of better times."16:17GLOB Globant beats by $0.02, beats on revs; guides Q2 EPS above consensus, revs above consensus (111.96 +4.01)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.64 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.62; revenues rose 31.1% year/year to $191.57 mln vs the $189.23 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Preliminary results were stronger than 2019 first quarter results due to positive show rotation at GES, partially offset by the impact of COVID-19.Preliminary net loss attributable to Viad was $10.6 million, versus a loss of $17.8 million in the 2019 first quarter. Preliminary adjusted segment operating loss was $8.4 million, versus a loss of $11.0 million in the prior year quarter, and adjusted segment EBITDA was $6.9 million, up $4.7 million from the 2019 first quarter.Commentary: "Based on the very difficult, yet necessary actions we have taken to reduce costs and preserve cash, and as we continue to collect accounts receivable, we anticipate that our cash outflow during the second quarter will approximate $40 million. This leaves us ample liquidity to withstand the near-term impacts of COVID-19. Additionally, we are in productive discussions with our lender group for longer-term covenant relief, as we evaluate options to help ensure we have adequate liquidity for the future."16:15DENN Denny's beats by $0.07, reports revs in-line; Domestic system-wide same-store sales decreased -6.3% (8.77 +0.00)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.17 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.07 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.10; revenues fell 36.1% year/year to $96.7 mln vs the $96.83 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Domestic system-wide same-store sales decreased -6.3%.Domestic system-wide same-store sales have sequentially improved over the last few weeks of April, as compared to the equivalent weeks of 2019, from the low of -80% experienced in the final week of Q1, which ended on March 25.Average unit volumes of off-premise sales have more than doubled from February 2020 to April 2020, supported by temporarily waived delivery fees, new "Dine-Thru" curbside service programs, and recently launched shareable family meal packs.

The Russell 2000 outperformed with a 1.6% gain after a rough week for the small-cap index.The communication services (+1.3%), consumer discretionary (+1.1%), and materials (+1.0%) sectors led today's gains, helping the S&P 500 rebound from an early 1.3% decline. The utilities (-1.4%) and financials (-0.7%) sectors were Friday's laggards.Early in the day, economic data showed total retail sales decline a record 16.4% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) and industrial production decline 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%). The market wasn't visibly upset by the data, though, likely due to the prevailing view that it can't get any worse.Instead, there was a negative reaction to news that the Trump administration moved to block semiconductor shipments to China's Huawei Technologies. With relations already strained because of the coronavirus outbreak, the move renewed worries about potential Chinese retaliation against U.S. companies.Investors bought buy the dip, though, except in the semiconductor space given the headline negativity. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index declined 2.2%, which included an earnings-related decline in Applied Materials (AMAT 52.04, -2.39, -4.4%).Outside the semiconductor space, oil prices capped a strong week with another solid performance. WTI crude futures rose 7.1%, or $1.94, to $29.38/bbl today to extend its weekly advance to 18.8%.DraftKings (DKNG 29.23, +3.92, +15.5%) was an individual standout after the sports betting company topped EPS estimates and provided positive commentary regarding its outlook.U.S. Treasuries ended the week with modest losses. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.15%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 0.64%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 100.38.Reviewing Friday's economic data:Total retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) while retail sales, excluding autos, declined 17.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment.Industrial production declined 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%), which was the largest monthly drop in the 101-year history of the index. The capacity utilization rate fell from 73.2% to 64.9% (Briefing.com consensus 64.0%), which is 14.9 percentage points below its long-run average and a record-low in a series that dates back to 1967.The key takeaway from the report is that it is a reflection of how industrial production cratered amid shutdown orders designed to contain the spread of COVID-19. On a yr/yr basis, industrial production was down 15.0%.The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 73.7 in the preliminary reading for May (Briefing.com consensus 67.4) from 71.8 in April.The key takeaway from the report is that attitudes about current conditions improved while sentiment surrounding the outlook continued to deteriorate, pinched by concerns about financial prospects that were most notable among upper income households. That is apt to be a headwind for a pickup in consumer spending.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for May checked in at -48.5 (Briefing.com consensus -58.0) following the prior month's reading of -78.2.March job openings decreased to 6.191 mln from a revised 7.004 mln in February (from 6.882 mln). Business inventories decreased 0.2% in March, while the February reading was revised down to -0.5% from -0.4%.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NAHB Housing Market Index for May on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +0.5% YTDS&P 500 -11.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -17.0% YTDRussell 2000 -24.7% YTD16:19WSM Williams-Sonoma extends temporary closure of stores in US and Canada through May 31 in locations where retail restrictions have not been lifted (66.52 +1.36)16:18SUPN Supernus Pharma announces Paragraph IV ANDA filing for Oxtellar XR (23.40 +0.47)On May 14, Supernus Pharma received a Paragraph IV Notice Letter from Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp advising Supernus of the submission by Apotex of an Abbreviated New Drug Application to the FDA seeking approval for oxcarbazepine extended-release tablets.

This approval is based on Part 1a of the Phase 3 CheckMate -227 trial in which Opdivo + Yervoy (n=396) demonstrated superior overall survival (OS) versus chemotherapy regardless of tumor histology with a minimum follow up of 29.3 months. The median OS was 17.1 months versus 14.9 months. In the trial, 63% of patients treated with Opdivo + Yervoy and 56% treated with chemotherapy were alive at one year, and 40% and 33% at two years, respectively.15:59SCANX Large cap notable movers of interest -- DraftKings (DKNG) rises on quarterly financial results -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable large cap movers of interest ($10 bln - $200 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Large Cap GainersDKNG (29.19 +15.33%): Sees volatility after reporting Q1 results; co's revenues rose +30% yr/yr to $88.5 mln on upside EPS, and commented that it continues to progress with its key priorities despite the effects of COVID-19 on the world of sports; co has responded to the lack of major sports events by creating new product offerings to keep customers engaged, including fantasy sports and betting on eNASCAR, Counter Strike, and Rocket League, as well as launching pop culture free-to-play pools contests covering topics ranging from democratic debates to TV shows like Survivor; co does not anticipate an impact to its FY21 or long-term plans due to COVID-19.

Pulp sales volume grew +65% yr/yr. Paper segment sales volumes fell slightly yr/yr, down circa 2%. Adj. EBITDA was R$3.0 bln. Pulls back alongside various Brazilian peers; reports indicate that the country's new health minister resigned today. TER (56.84 -7,41%): Semiconductors generally underperform on renewed US-China tensions surrounding the Trump administration's latest Huawei trade restrictions. (Related: LRCX, QCOM...) VFC (52.04 -6.13%): Missed expectations for Q4 EPS and revs (fell 10.8% yr/yr to $2.1 bln). Revenues weakened as a result of lower consumer demand tied to COVID-19. Currently, all of co's retail stores in the APAC region have re-opened; co is prepared to begin a phased re-opening of North American stores and expects most of its stores to be open by mid-year. Did not issue formal FY21 financial guidance given COVID-19 uncertainties; expects Q1 revs to be down slightly more than 50%.15:49DCPH Deciphera Pharmaceuticals: FDA approves Qinlock (ripretinib) tablets for treatment of advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (shares remain halted) (51.74 +3.27)The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Qinlock (ripretinib) tablets as the first new drug specifically approved as a fourth-line treatment for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), a type of tumor that originates in the gastrointestinal tract.

The market appeared on track for another day of gains paced by longer tenors after the overnight session saw more signs of deteriorating U.S.-China relations and poor economic data from Europe. The U.S. Senate unanimously voted in favor of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act last night, followed by news that the Commerce Department extended the ban on U.S. companies doing business with Huawei for another year. At the same time, rules for granting special exemptions were tightened. Separate reports of U.S. officials blocking a shipment of chips intended for Huawei suggested that the updated rules were already being enforced. Treasuries extended their starting gains in immediate response to the April Retail Sales report (actual -16.4%; Briefing.com consensus -11.9%), which was even worse than expected. Treasuries backed down from their highs shortly after the post-data spike, spending the rest of the day in a steady pullback as equities fought to reclaim their losses. The long bond paced the early advance, but it also ended up leading the pullback after this week's show of relative strength. The 2s10s spread narrowed by five basis points to 49 bps since last Friday. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.1% to 100.40, narrowing this week's gain to 0.7%. Yield Check: 2-yr: +1 bp to 0.15% (-1 bp for the week) 3-yr: +2 bps to 0.19% (UNCH for the week) 5-yr: +1 bp to 0.31% (-2 bps for the week) 10-yr: +2 bps to 0.64% (-4 bps for the week) 30-yr: +2 bps to 1.32% (-7 bps for the week)News: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company will establish an advanced chip foundry in Arizona. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York will reduce its daily purchases of Treasuries to $6 bln from $7 bln next week. Japan's Finance Minister, Taro Aso, said that the draft for a second extra budget will be prepared on May 27. Germany's government is reportedly open to allowing public debt to exceed 80% of GDP to fund fiscal stimulus. The Italian government will relax lockdown measures on Monday and allow travel between regions on June 3. China's April Industrial Production increased 3.9% yr/yr (expected 1.5%; last -1.1%), April Retail Sales fell 7.5% yr/yr (expected -7.0%; last -15.8%), April Fixed Asset Investment fell 10.3% yr/yr (expected -10.0%; last -16.1%), and April Unemployment Rate ticked up to 6.0% from 5.9%. Hong Kong's Q1 GDP fell 5.3% qtr/qtr, as expected (last -0.3%), contracting 8.9% yr/yr, as expected (last -2.9%). South Korea's April trade deficit totaled $1.39 bln (last deficit of $950 mln). Imports fell 15.8% yr/yr (last -15.9%) while exports fell 25.1% yr/yr (last -24.3%). Eurozone's Q1 GDP contracted 3.8% qtr/qtr, as expected (last -3.8%), falling 3.2% yr/yr (expected -3.3%; last -3.3%). Q1 Employment decreased 0.2% qtr/qtr (expected -0.4%; last 0.3%). Germany's Q1 GDP fell 2.2% qtr/qtr, as expected (last -0.1%), contracting 1.9% yr/yr (expected -1.6%; last 0.2%). Italy's March Industrial New Orders plunged 26.5% m/m (last -4.1%) while Industrial Sales fell 25.8% m/m (last -1.7%). Today's Data: Total retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) while retail sales, excluding autos, declined 17.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%). The sales downturn was extreme with double-digit declines in most categories. The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment. Industrial production declined 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%), which was the largest monthly drop in the 101-year history of the index. The capacity utilization rate fell from 73.2% to 64.9% (Briefing.com consensus 64.0%), which is 14.9 percentage points below its long-run average and a record-low in a series that dates back to 1967. The key takeaway from the report is that it is a reflection of how industrial production cratered amid shutdown orders designed to contain the spread of COVID-19. On a yr/yr basis, industrial production was down 15.0%. The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 73.7 in the preliminary reading for May (Briefing.com consensus 67.4) from 71.8 in April. The key takeaway from the report is that attitudes about current conditions improved while sentiment surrounding the outlook continued to deteriorate, pinched by concerns about financial prospects that were most notable among upper income households. That is apt to be a headwind for a pickup in consumer spending. Business Inventories decreased 0.2% in March (Briefing.com consensus -0.4%) after decreasing a revised 0.5% (from -0.4%) in February. Job Openings decreased to 6.191 mln in March from a revised 7.004 mln (from 6.882 mln) in February. The Empire State Manufacturing Survey increased to -48.5 in May (Briefing.com consensus -58.0) from -78.2 in April.

Co expects to develop STI-1499 as a stand-alone therapy on account of the "high potency it has exhibited in experiments to date." It has a goal of scaling up manufacturing capacities to potentially provide tens of millions of doses within a short time period in order to meet the "vast projected demand." BCEL (19.32 +16.91%): Reported Q1 results and recent business updates; co noted that patients continue to be enrolled and treated in its Phase 1b dose-escalation trial of ATRC-101 in multiple solid tumors, and it noted that it is working closely with its alliance partners to advance R&D as quickly as possible to help address the COVID-19 pandemic.

The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000, however, is up 1.1%.Prior to the open, Reuters reported that the Trump administration was moving to block semiconductor shipments to China's Huawei Technologies, which raised the specter of possible Chinese retaliation on American companies. Shortly thereafter, the Retail Sales report for April showed a record 16.4% m/m decline in total retail sales (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%).The market has been more cognizant of reported tensions, as opposed to the weak data due to a view that the data can't get any worse with reopening efforts underway. Semiconductor companies are among today's weakest performers following the moves in Washington, evidenced by the 2.9% decline in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.Many of these companies, including Applied Materials (AMAT 51.51, -2.92, -5.4%) following its earnings report, have weighed on the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.7%). The utilities (-2.8%) and real estate (-2.0%) sectors are down the most, though.On the other hand, the energy sector (+0.6%) is following the positive move in oil prices ($29.16, +1.28, +4.6%), and the materials (+0.6%) and consumer staples (+0.3%) sectors also show relative strength.DraftKings (DKNG 28.84, +3.56, +14.0%) is an earnings standout, with shares rising 14% after the company topped EPS estimates and said it doesn't expect COVID-19 to impact its sports betting business long-term.Treasury prices have declined since the opening bell, bringing yields off early lows. The 10-yr yield is currently up one basis point to 0.64% after slipping below 0.60% at its low. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 100.40.Reviewing today's economic data:Total retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) while retail sales, excluding autos, declined 17.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment.Industrial production declined 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%), which was the largest monthly drop in the 101-year history of the index.

The sector is down 2.3% for the week versus a 3.6% week-to-date loss in the S&P 500 (-1.0%).More than half of the sector's components trade in the green, which explains the group's outperformance relative to the broader market. Manufacturers of packaged foods and cleaning products are in the lead, reflecting a belief that their products will remain in high demand.Notable movers:McCormick (MKC 178.96, +3.44, +2.0%): leading sector component, rising to a fresh record high. Estee Lauder (EL 166.06, +1.87, +1.1%): reclaiming its 50-day moving average (165.22).

Approx. one dozen of these antibodies have demonstrated the ability to block the S1 protein's interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor used for viral entrance into human cells. These blocking antibodies were further tested for their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in an in vitro SARS-CoV-2 virus infection model pursuant to a preclinical testing agreement for COVID-19 therapeutic candidates that was previously announced on March 31.One antibody stood out for its ability to completely block SARS-CoV-2 infection of healthy cells in the experiments. STI-1499 completely neutralized the virus infectivity at a very low antibody dose, making it a prime candidate for further testing and development. Initial biochemical and biophysical analyses also indicate STI-1499 is a potentially strong antibody drug candidate.Sorrento has determined STI-1499 will likely be the first antibody in the antibody cocktail (COVI-SHIELD) it is developing. STI-1499 is also expected to be developed as a stand-alone therapy (COVI-GUARD) because of the high potency it has exhibited in experiments to date. Sorrento plans to request priority evaluation and accelerated review from regulators to determine the best pathway to make any potential treatment available as soon as possible. Sorrento's manufacturing facility in San Diego is expected to be able to produce up to two hundred thousand doses per month, and the company intends to produce a million doses at risk while seeking FDA approval for any STI-1499 product candidate. The company is seeking potential government support and pharmaceutical partners to further scale up STI-1499 manufacturing capacity with a goal of potentially providing tens of millions of doses in a short period of time to meet the vast projected demand.11:04TALKX Market Briefing: U.S.-China tension creates some unease and uneven tradingThe stock market is sagging as it confronts another batch of terrible economic data and reports about rising tension between the U.S. and China.Briefly, in April, retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m while industrial production declined a record 11.2%. Consumer sentiment actually improved some in May to 73.7 (from 71.8), yet that belies the fact that attitudes about the outlook actually deteriorated (to 67.7 from 70.1).There is a lot of headline noise surrounding U.S-China relations. The U.S. is moving to block shipments of semiconductors to Huawei and China is said to be entertaining countermeasures, which include restricting or investigating U.S. companies doing business there, if the U.S. follows through.The latter concern has been tempered somewhat by Chinese state media noting China hopes it can meet the U.S. "half way" in trade dealings. Separately, NEC Director Kudlow has denied that the U.S.-China trade deal is falling apart.The uncertain sense of where those relations actually stand has contributed to some uneven trading activity and a modest downward bias for the broader market.A weak showing from the information technology sector (-1.7%), which is feeling the brunt of the angst involving China, is the main drag on the broader market. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is down 3.8%. Other laggards of note include the utilities (-2.3%), real estate (-1.6%), and financial (-1.0%) sectors.Generally speaking, small-cap stocks are faring well, evidenced by the relative strength of the Russell 2000, which is drawing added support from many of its energy sector components. The latter are following crude prices higher ($28.75, +1.19, +4.3%).The Russell 2000 is up 0.7%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 are down 0.9%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.1%.10:18JCP J.

The high-beta group bounced off its 200-day moving average on Thursday, but it finds itself right back at that level today.The SOX index has widened this week's loss to 4.5% versus a 3.0% week-to-date loss in the S&P 500 (-0.4%). Today's weakness is being driven by selling in 29 out of 30 components after the Trump administration extended the ban on sales of chips based on American technology to Huawei for another year.On a side note, the world's largest contract chip foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM 50.85, -1.25, -2.4%), has agreed to build an advanced fabrication facility in Arizona, which will enable high-volume domestic production of processors and microcontrollers.Notable movers:Lam Research (LRCX 254.34, -14.66, -5.5%): weakest performer, falling back below its 200-day moving average (260.63).

These studies, led by Prasad Adusumilli, MD and collaborators at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence of the preclinical safety, improved functional characteristics and enhanced anti-tumor efficacy of ATA2271. Specifically, in vitro, ATA2271 exhibited antigen-specific cytotoxicity, accumulation and effector cytokine secretion, while in vivo results demonstrated that a single dose of ATA2271 led to tumor eradication and superior survival in mice compared to mesothelin-targeted M28z CAR T cells. Mice treated with a single dose of ATA2271 also showed sustained and persistent protection from tumor reestablishment upon 10 additional tumor re-challenges. Results from the study demonstrated the proposed advantages associated with functional persistence and cell-intrinsic PD-1 checkpoint blockade.09:22EDIT Editas Medicine presents data from pre-clinical study supporting use of CRISPR-Cas12a for the development of engineered cell immunotherapies (55.88 )Editas Medicine announced results from a pre-clinical study evaluating multi-gene knockout and transgene knock-in using its proprietary engineered CRISPR-Cas12a (EngCas12a) in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for the development of engineered cell immunotherapy medicines. The results of this study further reinforce Editas Medicine's belief in the transformative potential of iPSC-derived natural killer (iNK) cells as off-the-shelf engineered cell medicines for the treatment of solid tumor cancers.In this study, CRISPR-Cas12a was used to make highly edited iPSC clones. The iPSCs were then differentiated into functional iNK cells. The iNKs derived from the edited iPSC clones had enhanced tumor killing activity relative to iNKs from unedited iPSCs, demonstrating the utility of an edited iPSC platform. The company reported these data today in an oral presentation at the 23rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy, being held virtually.09:17ECONX April Capacity Utilization 64.9% vs 64.0% Briefing.com consensus09:16WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: -27.80.

PTI-125 significantly reduced a secondary endpoint, CSF levels of IL1-beta (p<0.035), a core biomarker of neuroinflammation, from baseline to Day 28. Drug was safe and well-tolerated.A post-hoc analysis of biomarker data revealed high variability in levels of CSF biomarkers over 28 days. For example, placebo-treated patients recorded changes in levels of CSF tau and p-tau ranging from -54% to +34% and -49% to +253%, respectively, from baseline to Day 28. Biomarker analysis was conducted by outside labs.The drug effects of PTI-125, if any, may have been masked in this study by high variability in levels of biomarkers of disease. In the months ahead the Company plans to re-analyze CSF biomarkers from all study participants.Phase 2b was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of PTI-125 in 64 patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, 50-85 years of age, with MMSE 16 to 26. Participants received PTI-125 100 mg, 50 mg or matching placebo, twice-daily, for 28 continuous days.08:15SUMRX Gapping up/down: NEWR +13%, DENN +12%, JD +5% after earnings, LH +1% after upgrade; CODX -17%, VFC -6% and AMAT -3% after earnings, W and GOOS -4% after downgradesGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:NEWR +12.9%, DENN +11.7%, DDS +6.5%, JD +4.6%, GLOB +3.6%, BLFS +2.6%, PBR +2.3%, SSRM +2%Other news:OCUL +11.5% (amends collaboration agreement with Regeneron)ORGS +4.5% (announces repurchase plan of up to $10 million of the company's common stock) HALO +3% (to receive $15 mln milestone payment from JNJ's Janssen)ODP +2.5% (discloses planned business restructuring)Analyst comments:LH +1.3% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Mizuho)Gapping downIn reaction to disappointing earnings/guidance:CODX -16.8%, FTCH -12.1%, CVET -9.9%, HOLI -7.7%, VFC -6.2%, NLOK -3.2%, AMAT -3.1%, BLBD -2.7%, DKNG -2%, VNET -1.7%Other news:OYST -9.5% (prices 3.75 mln shares of its common stock at $28.00 per share) BLU -4.7% (delays the initiation of its Phase 2 trial of BLU-5937 in chronic pruritus)NK -4.3% (co and ImmunityBio to initiate a Phase 2 study of immunotherapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer)ABT -3% (continued uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 tests) TGTX -2.4% (prices offering of 8.5 mln shares of common stock at $18.00 per share)PRPL -1% (prices secondary public offering of 10,789,372 shares of its common stock to be sold by InnoHold at $10.50 per share)Analyst comments:W -4.3% (downgraded to Sell from Neutral at Citigroup)GOOS -4.2% (downgraded to Underperform from Neutral at BofA/Merrill )BP -2.4% (downgraded to Underweight from Equal-Weight at Morgan Stanley)PYPL -1.5% (downgraded to Market Perform from Outperform at BMO Capital Markets)BEST -1% (downgraded to Neutral from Outperform at Macquarie)08:12SCANX Gapping downGapping downIn reaction to disappointing earnings/guidance:CODX -16.8%, FTCH -12.1%, CVET -9.9%, HOLI -7.7%, VFC -6.2%, NLOK -3.2%, AMAT -3.1%, BLBD -2.7%, DKNG -2%, VNET -1.7%Other news:OYST -9.5% (prices 3.75 mln shares of its common stock at $28.00 per share) BLU -4.7% (delays the initiation of its Phase 2 trial of BLU-5937 in chronic pruritus)NK -4.3% (co and ImmunityBio to initiate a Phase 2 study of immunotherapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer)ABT -3% (continued uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 tests) TGTX -2.4% (prices offering of 8.5 mln shares of common stock at $18.00 per share)PRPL -1% (prices secondary public offering of 10,789,372 shares of its common stock to be sold by InnoHold at $10.50 per share)Analyst comments:W -4.3% (downgraded to Sell from Neutral at Citigroup)GOOS -4.2% (downgraded to Underperform from Neutral at BofA/Merrill )BP -2.4% (downgraded to Underweight from Equal-Weight at Morgan Stanley)PYPL -1.5% (downgraded to Market Perform from Outperform at BMO Capital Markets)BEST -1% (downgraded to Neutral from Outperform at Macquarie)08:08SCANX Gapping upGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:NEWR +12.9%, DENN +11.7%, DDS +6.5%, JD +4.6%, GLOB +3.6%, BLFS +2.6%, PBR +2.3%, SSRM +2%Other news:OCUL +11.5% (amends collaboration agreement with Regeneron)ORGS +4.5% (announces repurchase plan of up to $10 million of the company's common stock) HALO +3% (to receive $15 mln milestone payment from JNJ's Janssen)ODP +2.5% (discloses planned business restructuring)Analyst comments:LH +1.3% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Mizuho)08:07HOLX Hologic receives Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA for its Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay to detect the novel coronavirus (51.41 )The newly authorized test runs on Hologic's Panther system, more than 1,000 of which are already installed in clinical laboratories throughout the United States.

Treasury futures climbed steadily during the Asian session, backtracking from highs as attention turned to Europe. However, the short-lived pullback was followed by a push to fresh highs in recent trade. The market has been focused on the latest series of signs of a deteriorating U.S.-China relationship.

ID NOW is intended to be used near the patient with a direct swab test method.It is our responsibility to provide healthcare professionals and the public with accurate information, and that's why we're doing the following:Further clarifying our product information to provide better guidance to healthcare providers that negative results should be considered in the context of a patient's recent exposures, history and the presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Negative results should be presumed negative, but if inconsistent with clinical signs and symptoms or necessary for patient management, should be tested with an alternative molecular assay.

The benchmark index was down as much as 1.9% in early action following a relatively disappointing weekly jobless claims report.The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite increased 0.9%. The Russell 2000 underperformed with a 0.4% gain.Total jobless claims for the week ending May 9 totaled 2.981 million (Briefing.com consensus 2.475 million) while continuing claims for the week ending May 2 totaled 22.833 million. The elevated figures raised doubts on a timely economic recovery, but the data might have prodded lawmakers to act more quickly for additional fiscal stimulus.Reports followed that the White House was interested in a bipartisan, fourth coronavirus relief bill (although not the $3 trillion bill proposed by House Democrats). The possibility for more stimulus, coupled with a view that the recent weakness in the market provided a good entry point, helped ignite a buy-the-dip mindset.The S&P 500 financials sector (+2.6%) set the rebound pace amid strength in the bank stocks, including Wells Fargo (WFC 24.06, +1.53, +6.8%) amid speculation that it could merge with Goldman Sachs (GS 174.45, +2.65, +1.5%). The consumer staples sector (-0.3%) was the only sector without a gain today.Sentiment might have also been boosted by an IEA report suggesting oil demand has been a little stronger than expected, The Wall Street Journal reporting that Taiwan Semi (TSM 52.10, +1.18, +2.3%) will announce plans to build an advanced chip factory in Arizona, and news that Connecticut overstated its weekly initial claims count by more than 200,000.The IEA report likely contributed to the 8.3% gain in WTI crude futures ($27.44/bbl, +2.10). Separately, Cisco (CSCO 43.85, +1.90, +4.5%) was an earnings standout after the company issued positive quarterly results and guidance.U.S. Treasuries finished mixed and little changed. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.63%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 100.31.Reviewing Thursday's economic data, which featured the weekly jobless claims report:Total jobless claims for the week ending May 9 were 2,981,000 (Briefing.com consensus 2.475 million). That was a decrease of 195,000 from the prior week, but still an exceedingly high number all things considered. Continuing claims for the week ending May 2 increased by 456,000 to 22.833 million, which is yet another record high.The key takeaway from the report is that the alarmingly high level of initial and continuing claims paints a risk of a slower recovery due to weaker consumer spending activity and the rising potential that temporary job losses become permanent job losses in an elongated recovery process.Import prices declined 2.6% in April, and prices, excluding oil, declined 0.5%. Export prices declined 3.3% in April, and prices, excluding agriculture, also declined 3.3%.Looking ahead, investors will receive a big batch of data on Friday: Retail Sales for April, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for May, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for April, Business Inventories for March, the JOLTS report for March, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for March.Nasdaq Composite -0.3% YTDS&P 500 -11.7% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -17.2% YTDRussell 2000 -25.8% YTD16:24NKE NIKE provides COVID-19 update; 100% of NIKE-owned stores now open across Greater China and South Korea (86.55 +0.53)As of today, 100% of NIKE-owned stores and over 95% of partner stores in Greater China and South Korea are open, with some still operating with reduced hours. In these markets, retail traffic trends are progressing, and while physical store traffic remains below prior year levels, this is largely offset by higher conversion rates and continued strong digital demand.Since mid-March, the vast majority of NIKE-owned and wholesale partner stores outside Greater China and South Korea have been completely closed. In light of store closures, product shipments to wholesale customers have slowed, resulting in significantly lower wholesale revenue and higher inventory. The company continues to expect this to have a material impact on its NIKE Direct and wholesale operations in North America, EMEA, and APLA in the fourth quarter.The company is seeing accelerated new member acquisition and strong digital demand across the global marketplace, with increased traffic and engagement on its mobile commerce and activity apps. It has increased its digital fulfillment capacity to meet higher demand.Store reopening has begun in over 15 countries including Germany, France, the Netherlands, Brazil, and the US. As of today, roughly 40% of NIKE-owned stores in EMEA, 15% in APLA, and 5% in North America are open, with some operating with reduced hours.

The mall business in general and department stores, specifically, have been particularly hard hit.

Preliminary results were stronger than 2019 first quarter results due to positive show rotation at GES, partially offset by the impact of COVID-19.Preliminary net loss attributable to Viad was $10.6 million, versus a loss of $17.8 million in the 2019 first quarter. Preliminary adjusted segment operating loss was $8.4 million, versus a loss of $11.0 million in the prior year quarter, and adjusted segment EBITDA was $6.9 million, up $4.7 million from the 2019 first quarter.Commentary: "Based on the very difficult, yet necessary actions we have taken to reduce costs and preserve cash, and as we continue to collect accounts receivable, we anticipate that our cash outflow during the second quarter will approximate $40 million.

The Russell 2000 outperformed with a 1.6% gain after a rough week for the small-cap index.The communication services (+1.3%), consumer discretionary (+1.1%), and materials (+1.0%) sectors led today's gains, helping the S&P 500 rebound from an early 1.3% decline. The utilities (-1.4%) and financials (-0.7%) sectors were Friday's laggards.Early in the day, economic data showed total retail sales decline a record 16.4% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) and industrial production decline 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%). The market wasn't visibly upset by the data, though, likely due to the prevailing view that it can't get any worse.Instead, there was a negative reaction to news that the Trump administration moved to block semiconductor shipments to China's Huawei Technologies. With relations already strained because of the coronavirus outbreak, the move renewed worries about potential Chinese retaliation against U.S. companies.Investors bought buy the dip, though, except in the semiconductor space given the headline negativity. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index declined 2.2%, which included an earnings-related decline in Applied Materials (AMAT 52.04, -2.39, -4.4%).Outside the semiconductor space, oil prices capped a strong week with another solid performance. WTI crude futures rose 7.1%, or $1.94, to $29.38/bbl today to extend its weekly advance to 18.8%.DraftKings (DKNG 29.23, +3.92, +15.5%) was an individual standout after the sports betting company topped EPS estimates and provided positive commentary regarding its outlook.U.S. Treasuries ended the week with modest losses. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.15%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 0.64%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 100.38.Reviewing Friday's economic data:Total retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) while retail sales, excluding autos, declined 17.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment.Industrial production declined 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%), which was the largest monthly drop in the 101-year history of the index. The capacity utilization rate fell from 73.2% to 64.9% (Briefing.com consensus 64.0%), which is 14.9 percentage points below its long-run average and a record-low in a series that dates back to 1967.The key takeaway from the report is that it is a reflection of how industrial production cratered amid shutdown orders designed to contain the spread of COVID-19. On a yr/yr basis, industrial production was down 15.0%.The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 73.7 in the preliminary reading for May (Briefing.com consensus 67.4) from 71.8 in April.The key takeaway from the report is that attitudes about current conditions improved while sentiment surrounding the outlook continued to deteriorate, pinched by concerns about financial prospects that were most notable among upper income households. That is apt to be a headwind for a pickup in consumer spending.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for May checked in at -48.5 (Briefing.com consensus -58.0) following the prior month's reading of -78.2.March job openings decreased to 6.191 mln from a revised 7.004 mln in February (from 6.882 mln). Business inventories decreased 0.2% in March, while the February reading was revised down to -0.5% from -0.4%.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NAHB Housing Market Index for May on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +0.5% YTDS&P 500 -11.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -17.0% YTDRussell 2000 -24.7% YTD16:19WSM Williams-Sonoma extends temporary closure of stores in US and Canada through May 31 in locations where retail restrictions have not been lifted (66.52 +1.36)16:18SUPN Supernus Pharma announces Paragraph IV ANDA filing for Oxtellar XR (23.40 +0.47)On May 14, Supernus Pharma received a Paragraph IV Notice Letter from Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp advising Supernus of the submission by Apotex of an Abbreviated New Drug Application to the FDA seeking approval for oxcarbazepine extended-release tablets.

This approval is based on Part 1a of the Phase 3 CheckMate -227 trial in which Opdivo + Yervoy (n=396) demonstrated superior overall survival (OS) versus chemotherapy regardless of tumor histology with a minimum follow up of 29.3 months. The median OS was 17.1 months versus 14.9 months. In the trial, 63% of patients treated with Opdivo + Yervoy and 56% treated with chemotherapy were alive at one year, and 40% and 33% at two years, respectively.15:59SCANX Large cap notable movers of interest -- DraftKings (DKNG) rises on quarterly financial results -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable large cap movers of interest ($10 bln - $200 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Large Cap GainersDKNG (29.19 +15.33%): Sees volatility after reporting Q1 results; co's revenues rose +30% yr/yr to $88.5 mln on upside EPS, and commented that it continues to progress with its key priorities despite the effects of COVID-19 on the world of sports; co has responded to the lack of major sports events by creating new product offerings to keep customers engaged, including fantasy sports and betting on eNASCAR, Counter Strike, and Rocket League, as well as launching pop culture free-to-play pools contests covering topics ranging from democratic debates to TV shows like Survivor; co does not anticipate an impact to its FY21 or long-term plans due to COVID-19.

TER (56.84 -7,41%): Semiconductors generally underperform on renewed US-China tensions surrounding the Trump administration's latest Huawei trade restrictions. (Related: LRCX, QCOM...) VFC (52.04 -6.13%): Missed expectations for Q4 EPS and revs (fell 10.8% yr/yr to $2.1 bln). Revenues weakened as a result of lower consumer demand tied to COVID-19. Currently, all of co's retail stores in the APAC region have re-opened; co is prepared to begin a phased re-opening of North American stores and expects most of its stores to be open by mid-year. Did not issue formal FY21 financial guidance given COVID-19 uncertainties; expects Q1 revs to be down slightly more than 50%.15:49DCPH Deciphera Pharmaceuticals: FDA approves Qinlock (ripretinib) tablets for treatment of advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (shares remain halted) (51.74 +3.27)The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Qinlock (ripretinib) tablets as the first new drug specifically approved as a fourth-line treatment for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), a type of tumor that originates in the gastrointestinal tract.

There was a slowdown in growth from co's larger markets in Europe and North America coinciding with lockdown implementations toward the end of the quarter.

The market appeared on track for another day of gains paced by longer tenors after the overnight session saw more signs of deteriorating U.S.-China relations and poor economic data from Europe. The U.S. Senate unanimously voted in favor of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act last night, followed by news that the Commerce Department extended the ban on U.S. companies doing business with Huawei for another year. At the same time, rules for granting special exemptions were tightened. Separate reports of U.S. officials blocking a shipment of chips intended for Huawei suggested that the updated rules were already being enforced. Treasuries extended their starting gains in immediate response to the April Retail Sales report (actual -16.4%; Briefing.com consensus -11.9%), which was even worse than expected. Treasuries backed down from their highs shortly after the post-data spike, spending the rest of the day in a steady pullback as equities fought to reclaim their losses. The long bond paced the early advance, but it also ended up leading the pullback after this week's show of relative strength. The 2s10s spread narrowed by five basis points to 49 bps since last Friday. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.1% to 100.40, narrowing this week's gain to 0.7%.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York will reduce its daily purchases of Treasuries to $6 bln from $7 bln next week. Japan's Finance Minister, Taro Aso, said that the draft for a second extra budget will be prepared on May 27. Germany's government is reportedly open to allowing public debt to exceed 80% of GDP to fund fiscal stimulus. The Italian government will relax lockdown measures on Monday and allow travel between regions on June 3.

Today's Data: Total retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) while retail sales, excluding autos, declined 17.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%). The sales downturn was extreme with double-digit declines in most categories. The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment. Industrial production declined 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%), which was the largest monthly drop in the 101-year history of the index.

Co expects to develop STI-1499 as a stand-alone therapy on account of the "high potency it has exhibited in experiments to date." It has a goal of scaling up manufacturing capacities to potentially provide tens of millions of doses within a short time period in order to meet the "vast projected demand." BCEL (19.32 +16.91%): Reported Q1 results and recent business updates; co noted that patients continue to be enrolled and treated in its Phase 1b dose-escalation trial of ATRC-101 in multiple solid tumors, and it noted that it is working closely with its alliance partners to advance R&D as quickly as possible to help address the COVID-19 pandemic. Co reported a net loss of $(20.4) mln for the quarter. FSM (3.89 +15.77%): Co reported Q1 results; sales were $47.5 mln while adj. EBITDA for the quarter was $15.9 mln; results were marked by lower production at the San Jose Mine and negative metal price adjustments at the end of March, among other factors. Free cash flow from ongoing operations was $14.2 mln. For May, co looks forward to a gradual resumption of operations at San Jose and a re-commencement of construction at Lindero.

VVI (14.65 -11.96%): Issued upside preliminary results for Q1, seeing revs up +7.1% yr/yr to $306.0 mln due to a positive show rotation of approx. $57 mln at GES, partially offset by show postponements and cancellations due to COVID-19. Co has recently re-opened certain experiences, including FlyOver Iceland, and plans to re-open other Pursuit experiences in June as COVID-19 restrictions ease, but most exhibition and event activity has yet to resume. Co has suspended future dividend payments and share repurchases; it anticipates Q2 cash outflow of approx. $40 mln. Co is in discussions with its lenders for longer-term covenant relief.

The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000, however, is up 1.1%.Prior to the open, Reuters reported that the Trump administration was moving to block semiconductor shipments to China's Huawei Technologies, which raised the specter of possible Chinese retaliation on American companies. Shortly thereafter, the Retail Sales report for April showed a record 16.4% m/m decline in total retail sales (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%).The market has been more cognizant of reported tensions, as opposed to the weak data due to a view that the data can't get any worse with reopening efforts underway. Semiconductor companies are among today's weakest performers following the moves in Washington, evidenced by the 2.9% decline in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.Many of these companies, including Applied Materials (AMAT 51.51, -2.92, -5.4%) following its earnings report, have weighed on the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.7%). The utilities (-2.8%) and real estate (-2.0%) sectors are down the most, though.On the other hand, the energy sector (+0.6%) is following the positive move in oil prices ($29.16, +1.28, +4.6%), and the materials (+0.6%) and consumer staples (+0.3%) sectors also show relative strength.DraftKings (DKNG 28.84, +3.56, +14.0%) is an earnings standout, with shares rising 14% after the company topped EPS estimates and said it doesn't expect COVID-19 to impact its sports betting business long-term.Treasury prices have declined since the opening bell, bringing yields off early lows. The 10-yr yield is currently up one basis point to 0.64% after slipping below 0.60% at its low. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 100.40.Reviewing today's economic data:Total retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) while retail sales, excluding autos, declined 17.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment.Industrial production declined 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%), which was the largest monthly drop in the 101-year history of the index. The capacity utilization rate fell from 73.2% to 64.9% (Briefing.com consensus 64.0%), which is 14.9 percentage points below its long-run average and a record-low in a series that dates back to 1967.The key takeaway from the report is that it is a reflection of how industrial production cratered amid shutdown orders designed to contain the spread of COVID-19. On a yr/yr basis, industrial production was down 15.0%.The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 73.7 in the preliminary reading for May (Briefing.com consensus 67.4) from 71.8 in April.The key takeaway from the report is that attitudes about current conditions improved while sentiment surrounding the outlook continued to deteriorate, pinched by concerns about financial prospects that were most notable among upper income households. That is apt to be a headwind for a pickup in consumer spending.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for May checked in at -48.5 (Briefing.com consensus -58.0) following the prior month's reading of -78.2.March job openings decreased to 6.191 mln from a revised 7.004 mln in February (from 6.882 mln). Business inventories decreased 0.2% in March, while the February reading was revised down to -0.5% from -0.4%.12:34GLYC GlycoMimetics announces presentation of preclinical research on uproleselan and GMI-1359 at Virtual AACR Annual Meeting (3.14 +0.25)During the June session, GlycoMimetics will present preclinical data that further support the potential of the company's compounds to be used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as well as in the setting of stem cell transplantation.

Approx. one dozen of these antibodies have demonstrated the ability to block the S1 protein's interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor used for viral entrance into human cells. These blocking antibodies were further tested for their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in an in vitro SARS-CoV-2 virus infection model pursuant to a preclinical testing agreement for COVID-19 therapeutic candidates that was previously announced on March 31.One antibody stood out for its ability to completely block SARS-CoV-2 infection of healthy cells in the experiments. STI-1499 completely neutralized the virus infectivity at a very low antibody dose, making it a prime candidate for further testing and development. Initial biochemical and biophysical analyses also indicate STI-1499 is a potentially strong antibody drug candidate.Sorrento has determined STI-1499 will likely be the first antibody in the antibody cocktail (COVI-SHIELD) it is developing. STI-1499 is also expected to be developed as a stand-alone therapy (COVI-GUARD) because of the high potency it has exhibited in experiments to date. Sorrento plans to request priority evaluation and accelerated review from regulators to determine the best pathway to make any potential treatment available as soon as possible. Sorrento's manufacturing facility in San Diego is expected to be able to produce up to two hundred thousand doses per month, and the company intends to produce a million doses at risk while seeking FDA approval for any STI-1499 product candidate. The company is seeking potential government support and pharmaceutical partners to further scale up STI-1499 manufacturing capacity with a goal of potentially providing tens of millions of doses in a short period of time to meet the vast projected demand.11:04TALKX Market Briefing: U.S.-China tension creates some unease and uneven tradingThe stock market is sagging as it confronts another batch of terrible economic data and reports about rising tension between the U.S. and China.Briefly, in April, retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m while industrial production declined a record 11.2%. Consumer sentiment actually improved some in May to 73.7 (from 71.8), yet that belies the fact that attitudes about the outlook actually deteriorated (to 67.7 from 70.1).There is a lot of headline noise surrounding U.S-China relations. The U.S. is moving to block shipments of semiconductors to Huawei and China is said to be entertaining countermeasures, which include restricting or investigating U.S. companies doing business there, if the U.S. follows through.The latter concern has been tempered somewhat by Chinese state media noting China hopes it can meet the U.S. "half way" in trade dealings. Separately, NEC Director Kudlow has denied that the U.S.-China trade deal is falling apart.The uncertain sense of where those relations actually stand has contributed to some uneven trading activity and a modest downward bias for the broader market.A weak showing from the information technology sector (-1.7%), which is feeling the brunt of the angst involving China, is the main drag on the broader market. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is down 3.8%. Other laggards of note include the utilities (-2.3%), real estate (-1.6%), and financial (-1.0%) sectors.Generally speaking, small-cap stocks are faring well, evidenced by the relative strength of the Russell 2000, which is drawing added support from many of its energy sector components. The latter are following crude prices higher ($28.75, +1.19, +4.3%).The Russell 2000 is up 0.7%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 are down 0.9%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.1%.10:18JCP J.

The high-beta group bounced off its 200-day moving average on Thursday, but it finds itself right back at that level today.The SOX index has widened this week's loss to 4.5% versus a 3.0% week-to-date loss in the S&P 500 (-0.4%). Today's weakness is being driven by selling in 29 out of 30 components after the Trump administration extended the ban on sales of chips based on American technology to Huawei for another year.On a side note, the world's largest contract chip foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM 50.85, -1.25, -2.4%), has agreed to build an advanced fabrication facility in Arizona, which will enable high-volume domestic production of processors and microcontrollers.Notable movers:Lam Research (LRCX 254.34, -14.66, -5.5%): weakest performer, falling back below its 200-day moving average (260.63).

These studies, led by Prasad Adusumilli, MD and collaborators at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence of the preclinical safety, improved functional characteristics and enhanced anti-tumor efficacy of ATA2271. Specifically, in vitro, ATA2271 exhibited antigen-specific cytotoxicity, accumulation and effector cytokine secretion, while in vivo results demonstrated that a single dose of ATA2271 led to tumor eradication and superior survival in mice compared to mesothelin-targeted M28z CAR T cells. Mice treated with a single dose of ATA2271 also showed sustained and persistent protection from tumor reestablishment upon 10 additional tumor re-challenges. Results from the study demonstrated the proposed advantages associated with functional persistence and cell-intrinsic PD-1 checkpoint blockade.09:22EDIT Editas Medicine presents data from pre-clinical study supporting use of CRISPR-Cas12a for the development of engineered cell immunotherapies (55.88 )Editas Medicine announced results from a pre-clinical study evaluating multi-gene knockout and transgene knock-in using its proprietary engineered CRISPR-Cas12a (EngCas12a) in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for the development of engineered cell immunotherapy medicines. The results of this study further reinforce Editas Medicine's belief in the transformative potential of iPSC-derived natural killer (iNK) cells as off-the-shelf engineered cell medicines for the treatment of solid tumor cancers.In this study, CRISPR-Cas12a was used to make highly edited iPSC clones. The iPSCs were then differentiated into functional iNK cells. The iNKs derived from the edited iPSC clones had enhanced tumor killing activity relative to iNKs from unedited iPSCs, demonstrating the utility of an edited iPSC platform. The company reported these data today in an oral presentation at the 23rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy, being held virtually.09:17ECONX April Capacity Utilization 64.9% vs 64.0% Briefing.com consensus09:16WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: -27.80.

The benchmark index was down as much as 1.9% in early action following a relatively disappointing weekly jobless claims report.The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite increased 0.9%. The Russell 2000 underperformed with a 0.4% gain.Total jobless claims for the week ending May 9 totaled 2.981 million (Briefing.com consensus 2.475 million) while continuing claims for the week ending May 2 totaled 22.833 million. The elevated figures raised doubts on a timely economic recovery, but the data might have prodded lawmakers to act more quickly for additional fiscal stimulus.Reports followed that the White House was interested in a bipartisan, fourth coronavirus relief bill (although not the $3 trillion bill proposed by House Democrats). The possibility for more stimulus, coupled with a view that the recent weakness in the market provided a good entry point, helped ignite a buy-the-dip mindset.The S&P 500 financials sector (+2.6%) set the rebound pace amid strength in the bank stocks, including Wells Fargo (WFC 24.06, +1.53, +6.8%) amid speculation that it could merge with Goldman Sachs (GS 174.45, +2.65, +1.5%). The consumer staples sector (-0.3%) was the only sector without a gain today.Sentiment might have also been boosted by an IEA report suggesting oil demand has been a little stronger than expected, The Wall Street Journal reporting that Taiwan Semi (TSM 52.10, +1.18, +2.3%) will announce plans to build an advanced chip factory in Arizona, and news that Connecticut overstated its weekly initial claims count by more than 200,000.The IEA report likely contributed to the 8.3% gain in WTI crude futures ($27.44/bbl, +2.10). Separately, Cisco (CSCO 43.85, +1.90, +4.5%) was an earnings standout after the company issued positive quarterly results and guidance.U.S. Treasuries finished mixed and little changed. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.63%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 100.31.Reviewing Thursday's economic data, which featured the weekly jobless claims report:Total jobless claims for the week ending May 9 were 2,981,000 (Briefing.com consensus 2.475 million). That was a decrease of 195,000 from the prior week, but still an exceedingly high number all things considered. Continuing claims for the week ending May 2 increased by 456,000 to 22.833 million, which is yet another record high.The key takeaway from the report is that the alarmingly high level of initial and continuing claims paints a risk of a slower recovery due to weaker consumer spending activity and the rising potential that temporary job losses become permanent job losses in an elongated recovery process.Import prices declined 2.6% in April, and prices, excluding oil, declined 0.5%. Export prices declined 3.3% in April, and prices, excluding agriculture, also declined 3.3%.Looking ahead, investors will receive a big batch of data on Friday: Retail Sales for April, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for May, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for April, Business Inventories for March, the JOLTS report for March, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for March.Nasdaq Composite -0.3% YTDS&P 500 -11.7% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -17.2% YTDRussell 2000 -25.8% YTD16:24NKE NIKE provides COVID-19 update; 100% of NIKE-owned stores now open across Greater China and South Korea (86.55 +0.53)As of today, 100% of NIKE-owned stores and over 95% of partner stores in Greater China and South Korea are open, with some still operating with reduced hours. In these markets, retail traffic trends are progressing, and while physical store traffic remains below prior year levels, this is largely offset by higher conversion rates and continued strong digital demand.Since mid-March, the vast majority of NIKE-owned and wholesale partner stores outside Greater China and South Korea have been completely closed. In light of store closures, product shipments to wholesale customers have slowed, resulting in significantly lower wholesale revenue and higher inventory. The company continues to expect this to have a material impact on its NIKE Direct and wholesale operations in North America, EMEA, and APLA in the fourth quarter.The company is seeing accelerated new member acquisition and strong digital demand across the global marketplace, with increased traffic and engagement on its mobile commerce and activity apps. It has increased its digital fulfillment capacity to meet higher demand.Store reopening has begun in over 15 countries including Germany, France, the Netherlands, Brazil, and the US. As of today, roughly 40% of NIKE-owned stores in EMEA, 15% in APLA, and 5% in North America are open, with some operating with reduced hours. Wholesale partners in these countries have also begun to re-open stores.16:20APD Air Products to invest $2 bln in coal-to-methanol project in Indonesia (225.62 -0.22)Air Products has signed a definitive agreement for a long-term on-site contract for a world-scale coal-to-methanol production facility in Bengalon, East Kalimantan, Indonesia.

The mall business in general and department stores, specifically, have been particularly hard hit. While our balance sheet was already strong, we took decisive, sometimes difficult, actions to preserve liquidity and ensure our long-term viability.

Preliminary adjusted segment operating loss was $8.4 million, versus a loss of $11.0 million in the prior year quarter, and adjusted segment EBITDA was $6.9 million, up $4.7 million from the 2019 first quarter.Commentary: "Based on the very difficult, yet necessary actions we have taken to reduce costs and preserve cash, and as we continue to collect accounts receivable, we anticipate that our cash outflow during the second quarter will approximate $40 million. This leaves us ample liquidity to withstand the near-term impacts of COVID-19.

CITIES IN CHINA USING HEALTH QR CODES TO SPEED REOPENINGStates News ServiceMay 5, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 908 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the International City/County Management Association (ICMA):Balancing the return to work and minimizing the risk of a secondary outbreak calls for big data given China's mobile workforce.By Linda Wang, Director ICMA China Center | May 5, 2020 | BLOG POSTview of building in Shenzhen cityICMA's China Center reports that currently the country is dealing with the pragmatic issue of how to reopen their cities while keeping COVID-19 under control. Given that the initial widespread outbreak has been contained, governments are dealing with how to get the workforce back in place to restore social and economic health. People moving across the country or gathering in groups could contribute to a COVID-19 secondary outbreak without a complete system of effective support measures.To control the risk of COVID-19 infection in the workplace, a health QR codea digital health certificate generated through a smartphone apphas been put into practice throughout China. Hangzhou was the first city in China to employ the health QR code on February 11, 2020, and other provinces soon followed.Color coding and verificationTo get started, an individual enters personal information through a smartphone app, such as WeChat, which is widely used in China. After entering personal information and completing a facial recognition process, the user is issued one of three colorsgreen, yellow, or red.The green code holders are given the green light to return to work across the province. The yellow code holders will not be allowed to travel and will be requested to stay at home for 14 days of observation. The red code indicates that the holder has been to the high-risk region or had close contact with confirmed or suspected patients in the past 14 days. Red code holders must be quarantined and taken for medical observation.Though applicants for the health QR code are required to upload their individual data, location tracking and contact tracing is double-checked, identified, and confirmed through the national identity authentication system, which mandates ID registration for traveling and hotel booking.The codes are issued on the basis of real-time health conditions (such as temperature), places visited, and people contacted. In order to enable people to work and travel across cities efficiently with just one code, the State Council of China is pushing all provinces to establish the mutual recognition mechanism for the health QR code, which will enable wider technology sharing and data aggregation.Cities are also certifiedIn addition to individual certification, the Chinese government has developed a regional risk level evaluation. According to the regulation, cities, counties, and districts with no newly confirmed cases in the last 14 days are categorized as low-risk regions. Those with fewer than 50 cases or those with over 50 but without a concentrated outbreak are classified as medium-risk regions. Those with over 50 cases, as well as a concentrated outbreak, are classified as high-risk regions. Regional risk level information can be easily obtained by accessing the online government services platform and mobile mini-program of the health-tracking app. The regional risk level information feeds into the personal infection risk assessment.The health QR code is being used for people who return to work in many different industries. To speed up the reopening of the manufacturing industry, workers with green codes can enjoy point-to-point transport services provided by the government and enterprises. Enterprises share the responsibility for checking temperatures, and sufficient prevention and control resources must be in place. In personal service industries such as gyms, hair salons, and restaurants, both employees and customers are required to hold a green code, and are subject to on-site verification of their name, mobile phone record, and temperature. By doing this, the work environment and conditions can prevent COVID-19 transmission to the greatest extent.Prior to this big data solution being implemented, it was community workers' door-to-door information collection and confirmation in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemicand the residential area closures, which required accessing apartments with a pass check and temperature checkthat laid a solid foundation for the health QR code implementation. Furthermore, strict workplace disinfection, people's awareness of wearing masks and social distancing, and regular temperature checks contributed greatly to the restoration of city life.Testing plays key roleWork resumption measures in China are supplemented by the widespread availability of testing. Testing capacity in China has been opened up to the public and people are able to do voluntary testing. Meanwhile, some cities require testing for specific groups and activities. In some areas, students were tested upon returning to school. According to Beijing policies, people returning from Wuhan to Beijing are required to be tested before leaving the city and after arriving at their destination.In short, information technology played a dominant role in work resumption in China. More measures and technologies will be developed according to the changing conditions and demands of the COVID-19 epidemic. More importantly, information technology itself cannot be the hero, but needs systemic support measures from all levels of government to make it work.Load-Date: May 6, 2020End of Document

FACT CHECK: Viral Image Claims Smithfield Foods Packages Meat Products In China Before Shipping Them Back To The US; 'All our U.S. products are made in one of our nearly 50 facilities across America'The Daily CallerMay 1, 2020 Friday 02:24 AM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 458 wordsByline: Trevor Schakohl, Fact Check Reporter, trevor@dailycaller.comBodyLink to ImageA viral Facebook post shared more than 1,300 times claims meat processing company Smithfield Foods packages its products in China before shipping them back to the U.S.Verdict: FalseSmithfield Foods states on its website that none of its products have been or will be packaged in China. A spokesperson for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has said the claim that China is processing hogs and shipping them back to the U.S. is “absolutely false.”Fact Check:WH Group, a Hong Kong-based food processing company, acquired Smithfield Foods in 2013. The Facebook post            alleges that Smithfield Foods packages its meat products in China before shipping them back to the U.S for sale.“I will not buy any more Smithfield meats!!” reads the post. “China bought them out... will be packaged in China!! Anyone else with me??” (RELATED: Viral Video Claims To Show People In China Tearing Down A 5G Pole To Stop COVID-19)Smithfield Foods has debunked the claim on its website, however.“Smithfield has not, does not, and will not import any products from China to the United States,” the company states. “No Smithfield products come from animals raised, processed, or packaged in China. All our U.S. products are made in one of our nearly 50 facilities across America.”The North Carolina Pork Council poured water on the claim, noting that “the US Department of Agriculture does not allow any pork or pork products to enter our country from China.” A spokesperson for the FDA also said in an email to            USA Today that the notion of China slaughtering and processing hogs and shipping them back to the U.S. is “absolutely false.”According to Reuters, WH Group is a publicly-traded company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, meaning that anyone can purchase its stock. The Smithfield Foods website            asserts that WH Group has shareholders around the world, not just in China.“In fact, WH Group's shareholders include many large U.S.-based financial institutions,” Smithfield Food says. “It is not a Chinese state-owned enterprise and does not undertake commercial activities on behalf of the Chinese government.”Social media users shared the claim after Smithfield Foods announced on April 12 that their pork processing plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, would be closed indefinitely. 634 of the factory's employees had tested positive for the coronavirus as of April 17, the            Sioux Falls Argus Leader reported.On April 15, Smithfield Food announced it would close its meat-processing plant in Cudahy, Wisconsin, for two weeks and its plant in Martin City, Missouri, indefinitely. A small number of employees at both facilities had tested positive for coronavirus, the company said            in a press release.Graphic Smithfield products are seen at a supermarket in Shanghai, China July 26, 2017.

Trump, President of the United States, The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20500Dear President Trump:I write to urge you to take steps to strengthen and secure the medical and pharmaceutical supply chain in the U.S. The COVID-19 pandemic has made clear how relying upon China for medicine or essential medical equipment is detrimental to our national security and endangers public health. For example, over a third of U.S. imports of antibiotics and more than seventy percent of imports of personal protective equipment are sourced from China. This provides the authoritarian and communist Chinese government with unacceptable influence within our medical supply chains. Additionally, China's obfuscation and efforts to hide the extent of the outbreak has led to the deaths of over a hundred thousand individuals and exacerbated the pandemic.As you know, the U.S. is facing unprecedented challenges to public health and the economy due to COVID-19. I thank you for recently signing the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act into law as it included several important provisions to help support and expand the existing medical supply chain as well as identify gaps and ways to improve upon existing infrastructure. It is critically important to ensure that legislation is fully implemented as quickly as possible and that the U.S. continues to be the world leader in biomedicine, pharmaceutical development, and medical innovation. Ceding this position of global leadership to China or other countries around the world would be detrimental to our national security, impair our ability to combat the current or future public health crises, and have a negative impact on our economy and jobs.I appreciate the decisive actions your administration has taken thus far in response to this pandemic by restricting travel from China and elsewhere, providing our states and hospitals with essential resources, and developing and implementing a whole of government approach to address this pandemic. Moving forward, it is important that we incentivize innovation and the development of essential medical supplies and equipment in the U.S. in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As Congress considers additional measures to address the pandemic, I urge you to utilize your executive powers and existing authorities to take appropriate actions to strengthen the medical and pharmaceutical supply chain in the U.S.I am thankful for your ongoing efforts to defeat this virus and look forward to continuing to work with you to mitigate its impact on Montana and the country as a whole.Sincerely,Steve Daines, United States SenatorCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7085885 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: April 14, 2020End of Document

China car sales begin to recoverCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 31, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 266 wordsBodyMEXICO CITY, March 31.- After China has begun to leave its quarantine, after the coronavirus outbreak that began last December 31, automakers and dealerships around the country are doing everything in their power to lure customers back to showrooms. Last February, car sales in the Asian country fell 80 percent and for the first three weeks of March, they recorded losses of 45 percent. While restrictions are lifted little by little, the offers and promotions of the bouquet were not made to wait. A particular promotion involves the firm Geely, which has begun delivering fully sanitized vehicles to users, and that the car keys are carried to the owners via drones. Another example is in the Guangzhou Automobile Group electric vehicle unit, which has begun to test a system that "perfumes" its Aion LX with the aroma of traditional Chinese medicine. Local social media celebrity "Lipstick King" performed a live stream in order to motivate people to purchase a Cadillac CT4. The General Motors dealership, part of Wuling Motors, offers discounts of up to $550 to customers who purchase a new vehicle, and they will receive a medical mask. However, companies are seeking help from the Chinese government to get their sales back to normal. For example, manufacturers ask the government to apply tax cuts to the purchase of small vehicles while supporting sales in rural areas and reinsiciending current emissions regulations. The Chinese Association of Automotive Dealers has also lobbied for concessional loans, in addition to requesting temporary settlement support, including lines of credit.Load-Date: April 1, 2020End of Document

NY gets 1,100 ventilators with help from China, OregonAssociated Press State & LocalApril 5, 2020 Sunday 2:00 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: STATE AND REGIONALLength: 852 wordsByline: By KAREN MATTHEWS and JENNIFER PELTZDateline: NEW YORK BodyNEW YORK (AP) - New York secured a planeload of ventilators from China on Saturday, and Oregon was sending a shipment of its own to battle the coronavirus pandemic at its U.S. core, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. But the governor's startling plan to force hospitals elsewhere in the state to give spare ventilators to the fight in New York City apparently hadn't yet materialized, a day after he ordered them to surrender 20% of any unused supply to the National Guard for temporary redistribution. The state got 1,000 ventilators after the Chinese government facilitated a donation from billionaires Jack Ma and Joseph Tsai, the co-founders of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, Cuomo said. He added that the state of Oregon had volunteered to send 140 more breathing machines.The influx offered some hope after the governor repeatedly warned that the state's supply of the vital machines would be exhausted in days if the number of critically ill coronavirus patients kept growing at the current rate."It's going to make a significant difference for us," Cuomo said.New York is the pandemic's U.S. epicenter, with over 113,700 confirmed cases as of Saturday morning. More than 3,500 people statewide have died, and about 15,000 coronavirus patients are hospitalized. Over 4,100 are in intensive care - many, if not all, of them needing ventilators.The outbreak is heavily concentrated in the New York City metropolitan area.Cuomo's announcement came a day after he said he would have the National Guard collect and "redeploy" ventilators that some hospitals weren't using.He alluded again Saturday to the plan, but details remained unclear."We find what equipment we have, we use it the best we can," the Democrat said Saturday, saying he'd seek 20% of "unused and available" ventilators, a number he pegged at 500 in all.The idea has alarmed Republican politicians and some hospital leaders upstate. They said it would leave people in their areas vulnerable and pit the state's regions against one another.But two hospital umbrella groups didn't protest. The Greater New York Hospital Association portrayed the idea as ongoing reciprocity among medical centers as the outbreak's hotspots shift, while the Healthcare Association of New York State noted that some hospitals have already, voluntarily sent staff and equipment to harder-hit institutions or accepted patients from them.Both groups, and several upstate hospitals, said Saturday they had gotten no further information on the governor's plan. The state Health Department said no information was available beyond the governor's remarks.Messages were sent to his office seeking details on how the redistribution would work.National Guard spokesman Eric Durr said Saturday that the collection had not yet begun.Governors around the U.S. have been pleading, competing and scouring the global marketplace for needed supplies, especially ventilators, to treat the sick. Cuomo said Saturday that New York at one point made purchase orders for 17,000 of the devices, but only 2,500 came through."You get a call that says, 'We can't fill that order,'" he said.Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, also a Democrat, said last week that the federal government agreed to send about 2,400 ventilators to the city and another 2,000 to the state. The mayor and governor have repeatedly implored the federal government for more help.The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people.

Data on snow depth, weather and wind speed is also being measured to monitor the deterioration of glaciers and other ecological impacts of climate change.China has conducted six major surveys of the mountain locally known as Qomolangma, registering its height at 8,848.13 meters (29,029 feet) in 1975 and 8,844.43 meters (29,017 feet) in 2005.China has also taken advantage of the lack of climbers to collect garbage from Everest and other popular climbing peaks.Last year, too many climbers formed long lines at the summit and some died from lack of oxygen. A total of 876 people climbed the peak in 2019, according to the Himalayan Database.The absence of climbers this year has caused major hardship among Sherpa guides in Nepal, who have virtually no source of income apart from foreign tourists visiting national parks and high-altitude trekking routes.Load-Date: May 17, 2020End of Document

'China Won': Tucker Carlson Details 'Uncomfortable Facts' About Coronavirus Response In 15-Minute Opening MonologueThe Daily CallerMay 22, 2020 Friday 01:17 AM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: MEDIALength: 748 wordsByline: Scott Morefield, Reporter, smorefield@dailycaller.comScott Morefield is a politics and media reporter at The Daily Caller and a weekly columnist at Townhall (Mondays). Additionally, Scott's editorial columns have been featured on National Review, The Federalist, TheBlaze, Breitbart, The Hill, and many other sites. Follow him on Twitter @SKMorefield.Author ImageBodyLink to ImageFox News host Tucker Carlson contended that U.S. leaders' employment of the Chinese lockdown model of coronavirus response has allowed China to win in the end.Opening Thursday night's edition of “Tucker Carlson Tonight” with an almost 15-minute monologue that began with calling Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's “shelter-in-place” order 63 days ago “the beginning of an unprecedented mass quarantine that has changed this country forever,” Carlson observed that the U.S. is now “hard to recognize compared to just two months ago.”The Fox News host ominously explained his desire to “get on tape, for the record, some of what actually happened here” before social media platforms ban “uncomfortable facts” and only allow “one version of the story.”“The first thing to remember is that our leaders didn't simply revoke the country's constitutional rights one day from a cold start. They laid the groundwork first. They softened opposition by sewing fear,” he began.WATCH:“But they were totally wrong,” Carlson said after detailing the scary initial coronavirus death predictions, many given by unqualifed people, that            had so many in a panic. “We now know, thanks to widespread blood testing, that the virus isn't that deadly. An enormous percentage of coronavirus infections produce mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. They're asymptomatic. The death toll is a tiny fraction of what we were told it would be.”The Fox News host cited several studies that showed death ranges at or well below 1 percent, “far below what they told us it would be” before playing clips of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo demanding ventilators or “tens of thousands of Americans would die” and Dr. Anthony Fauci saying the Chinese government was being “transparent.”As the views of “informed and independent-minded Americans who had real questions about the wisdom” of “following the Chinese” lockdown model “began to disappear from Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook,” Tucker argued, they were replaced by “hardened political activists like Zeke Emanuel” who were “allowed” to “pose as experts on the virus' mitigation.”When people tell us “we have no choice,” the Daily Caller founder opined after playing a clip of Emanuel calling for no “return to normalcy until find a vaccine or effective medications” you should “run,” because “we always have a choice.”Other political leaders like Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, on the other hand, chose to “try a different approach,” despite condemnations and dire prognostications, and have seen solid results.“What you almost never saw from these people was a straightforward conversion about whether it was actually working,” he said. “They didn't want to talk about that.” (RELATED: 'More Off Base Than Your Average Epidemiologist': Tucker Cites Dr. Fauci's 'Buffoon Level' Mistakes, Questions 'Powerful' Role)Though there is still much to learn, Carlson cited a few things “you need to know.”“There is, as of tonight, precisely no evidence as of right now that the lockdowns in America saved lives, anywhere. In this country. In fact, it's possible mass quarantines killed people,” he said before quoting a recent report from JP Morgan showing that ending lockdowns was “associated with a slower spread of the virus.”Next, the Daily Caller co-founder contrasted media reaction to South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem's light-handed response with that of California Gov. Gavin Newsom.“The message of all of this of course was unmistakable: California was saving its people, while right-wing old South Dakota was plunging into a calamity,” he said. “That was more than five weeks ago. How did things turn out in the end? ... As of today, about five per 100,000 people in South Dakota have died of thee coronavirus. In California, the death toll is 8.4 per hundred thousand. That's 64 percent higher.”“Bad economies don't just make people poorer, they end lives,” the Fox News host said after pointing out the media's condemnation of President Donald Trump for saying early on in the pandemic that a bad economy can kill people.“For fifty years, America has steadily shipped its manufacturing jobs abroad,” Carlson concluded. “In the age of coronavirus, tens of millions of service jobs have gone away. Many will not return. So only manufacturing is left, but here's the catch - the manufacturers are all in China now. In other words, China won. So no matter what they tell you in coming years, that's what happened. That's what actually happened. Remember it.”Graphic Tucker Carlson explains how 'China won' (Fox News screengrab)Load-Date: May 21, 2020End of Document

Covid-19 has inflamed racism against Asian-Americans. Here's how to fight backCNN.comApril 10, 2020 Friday 8:48 AM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: OPINIONSLength: 1226 wordsByline: Opinion by Emily LiuBody"Cover your face and don't forget your sunglasses!" I sent this text message to my 36-year-old Asian American cousin, who lives in Brooklyn. She has been wearing sunglasses to hide her Asian traits when going outside during the Covid-19 pandemic.While most Americans are staying home, trying to navigate virtual work and worrying about paying bills, Asian Americans are doing all of that while also fearing for our safety.The FBI reported that Chinese and Asian Americans are now experiencing increased hate crimes due to the coronavirus global outbreak.We've seen many cases already on the news. Recently, a 2-year-old and a 6-year-old were stabbed at a Texas Sam's Club because the alleged perpetrator thought, he told police, that the family was Chinese and spreading the disease. A 44-year-old man was charged with aggravated harassment after allegedly harassing and pushing a 47-year-old Asian man in Queens who was walking his son to a bus stop.Even writer Jeff Yang, co-host of a podcast about being Asian in America and frequent contributor to CNN Opinion, says he experienced racist aggression last week when a woman shouted profanities at him and coughed in his direction while shopping in Los Angeles.And it doesn't stop there.This trend also includes minors as alleged perpetrators. Just this week, police said teens attacked a 51-year-old woman on a New York City bus, throwing "anti-Asian statements" against her and accusing her of causing the coronavirus. And, also in New York City, a 13-year-old allegedly kicked a 59-year-old man for the same racist motives.The climate of xenophobia was not helped by the Trump campaign's recent online attack ad, launched Thursday against presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. "During America's crisis, Biden protected China's feelings," the ad says, and shows a montage of images and clips, some of Biden with Chinese officials, including Xi Jinping.The ad also shows Biden with Washington state's Asian American former governor, Gary Locke, appearing to falsely suggest that Locke is a Chinese official, not an American politician. (The campaign defended the ad and said it was meant to target Hunter Biden.)As many Asians are under attack, I've heard very little from my non-Asian networks about this issue. In conversations with non-Asian Americans most were surprised to hear about this surge in hate crimes. Even those who watch the news shared they hadn't heard anything about this. For me, that's something to worry about.The longer we must distance ourselves socially, the more likely individuals will need to go outside for a walk or to the store. Asian Americans should be able to do this without the fear of being bullied, harassed or assaulted. But, to do that, we need active allies.Here are five things you can do to help.Choose your words carefully when explaining Covid-19.Be thoughtful in how you explain the coronavirus to children, especially teens and even college students. President Trump, until recently, referred to Covid-19 as the "Chinese virus" and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to it as "Wuhan virus", both referencing Wuhan, China. This language may well have fueled hatred. We must stop calling this disease the "Chinese virus" and associating it with Chinese/Asian people. This word choice puts the Asian community at risk.I've told my 3-year-old that he can't play with his friends because people are getting sick -- mentioning China is unnecessary. Many kids, and even some adults, cannot distinguish between the Chinese government and Asian Americans. If your kids are old enough to understand, then now is the time to explain the distinction. Equating Asian Americans to the Chinese government robs us of our identity as Americans. Even in 2020, Asian Americans still battle the stigma of being to some "the perpetual foreigner" regardless of the fact that many Asians have called the US home for generations.Business leaders and professionals should make sure to model properly referring to this pandemic as Covid-19 or coronavirus.Be careful with your memes and jokes.Off-handed comments and jokes can have unintended consequences down the line that harm the Asian community. There have been several social media posts "joking" that we are social distancing because someone ate a bat in China. While this may seem harmless --and I even laughed at the meme -- a child who hears that may think it's okay to mock their Asian classmates for causing the virus.There are deeper ramifications when impressionable people are looking for a scapegoat. Like many Asian Americans, growing up I dealt with classmates who accused me of eating cats and dogs because of my race. Three decades later, kids will bully numerous Asian American children for the misconception of eating bats if we don't choose our words carefully.Explain to children that we should treat our Asian friends at school and in the community with respect, and show them compassion, as some of them may be victims of bullying.If your children are old enough to understand, raise awareness of racist bullying and tell them to report it to teachers if they see it happening. While we can't stop racist adults from spewing hate, we can influence teens and college students to prevent more violent incidents from happening.Manjusha Kulkarni, the executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, recounted to a reporter a story about a 12-year-old boy punched in the head 20 times by a classmate who yelled at him to "go back to China." Events like this can be stopped.Demand your elected officials, school leaders, and business leaders denounce racism against Asians and Asian Americans.New York Attorney General Letitia James announced a hotline for residents to report hate crimes and bias incidents against Asian Americans (1-800-771-7755). In comments last month, Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey denounced discrimination against Asian communities saying, "there is a special place in Hell" for those vilifying communities in connection with Covid-19.Leadership around the country --in public and private sectors-- can take action. Contact your local government officials, school administrators, chief diversity officers, human resources representatives and business leaders. Highlight the attacks against the Asian/Asian American community and demand that they take action to publicly denounce this discrimination.When schools start to re-open, it is important that administrators take a tough stance on this topic. It is also important for schools to remind teachers to be on the lookout for discrimination in the classroom.Check in on your Asian friends and loved ones.Even if we have not personally faced anything yet, we in the Asian community are in self-isolation while also processing sad news about coronavirus deaths coupled with news of racially charged attacks. This can be debilitating to mental health. For Asians and non-Asians, we can all check in on each other and offer support.Racism and hate crimes will not go away overnight. Everyone has a role to play in combatting xenophobia. By taking simple actions in shifting our language and checking in on vulnerable populations, we can build a better and kinder world for everyone.Let's hope the next time my cousin puts on her sunglasses it's only because it's a beautiful and sunny day outside.Load-Date: April 11, 2020End of Document

Continue reading The USA s latest trade legislation is more bad news for Huawei phonesThe company just lost its main chip provider.Things are going from bad to worse for Huawei as the US government doubles down on its apparent crusade to prevent the Chinese tech giant from operating in the States. Following the further tightening of export controls on Huawei s access to American equipment and software, one of its biggest providers, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), has stopped taking orders from the company, which means sourcing chips for its devices is set to become a serious challenge.Under the new legislation, foreign chipmakers producing chips from designs by Huawei and using American design tools and hardware will have to apply for a licence from the US Commerce Department   given the ongoing security concerns the US has over Huawei, it s fair to say that such licenses will not be easily obtained. The rule will take effect in 120 days, with any outstanding orders allowed to be fulfilled provided the shipment is completed by September 14th.US officials have taken a dim view of Huawei   and indeed other Chinese tech companies   for a long time. Back in 2008 the company dropped a bid for 3Com after the US revealed it planned to investigate whether the deal would give China access to anti-hacking technology used by the Defense Department. In 2011, those security concerns meant the company was excluded from the creation of the dedicated first responder wireless network, and then in October 2012 a Congress report claimed that Huawei couldn t be trusted, citing dubious connections with the Chinese government, corruption and bribery, among other misdeeds. Huawei denied such accusations.Fast-forward to more recent times, and Huawei remains America s   or at least President Trump s   persona non grata. In 2018, the Defense Authorization Act came into law, preventing US government employees, contactors and agencies from using Huawei tech, and then in 2019, the decisive blow: President Trump signed an executive order declaring a national emergency banning sales and use of telecom equipment that poses  unacceptable  risks to national security, including critical infrastructure and the online economy. In other words, Huawei was banned.The repercussions for the company were immediate. In the wake of the ban, American chipmakers Intel, Qualcomm, Broadcom and Xilinx backed off, as did UK-based chip designer ARM, leaving Huawei without access to vital components. US pressure on its allies meant that other countries followed suit, even when their own investigations suggested Huawei represented little threat. Meanwhile, the likes of Verizon and AT&T dropped Huawei products entirely.At this juncture, Huawei   while vocal about its perceived victimization   remained cautiously optimistic about the situation, signing a deal with TSMC and announcing plans for its own operating system, Hongmeng, which would serve to sidestep the problems resulting from Google s departure from the brand. (China itself, however, did not respond well to the situation, creating its own  unreliable entities list  in retaliation). At one point, it looked like Huawei might even be given some kind of reprieve, after President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed a deal that would remove some restrictions on Huawei in the US. However, this supposed  truce  came amid a wider and rapidly-escalating trade war, the potential ramifications of which could have had major impact on America s economy.But it s now 2020, and it s more apparent than ever that there is no redemption for Huawei. Earlier in the year, Trump signed a bill to help rural carriers replace Huawei gear, while over in Europe carrier Vodafone announced it was removing Huawei equipment from its networks. The company unsurprisingly revealed a very bleak sales forecast for the year (despite its best efforts leveraging technical loopholes), and then last week, Huawei s ban was extended until May 2021. So for Huawei, it must have felt like the US Commerce Department was pouring salt in the wound when just days later, it announced the new rules which has ultimately left it without a chip provider.TSMC had been something of a lifeline for Huawei, although that s not to say the move won t have an impact TSMC, too. Huawei was its second-largest customer, accounting for some 15 to 20 percent of its revenue, according to Nikkei Asian Review. However, it s probably no coincidence that on the very same day that the Commerce Department made its announcement, TSMC   whose number one customer is Apple   revealed that it s opening a new $12 billion chip facility in Arizona, with state and US federal government support. The foundry will allow more of TSMC s American customers to make their chips domestically, so in short, they ll be alright in the long-run.For Huawei, however, the situation is more precarious than ever, and the company is, understandably, more than a little upset. In a statement reported on The Verge, Huawei rotating chairman Guo Ping hit back at the latest developments with a few choice words.  The US government still persists in attacking Huawei, but what will that bring to the world?  he said. The company added in an official statement that,  This decision was arbitrary and pernicious, and threatens to undermine the entire industry worldwide.  The statement concludes in a resigned tone.  We expect that our business will inevitably be affected. We will try all we can to seek a solution. But the company is swiftly running out of potential solutions. The company has previously hinted at switching its chip supply to Samsung   although whether Samsung would enter into such a partnership considering the wider situation is another question. Domestic chip production is another option   China s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) has just received a $2.2 billion investment from the Chinese government. However, compared to the likes of Intel, Qualcomm and indeed TSMC, there s no way SMIC could manage Huawei s large-scale demands. And production volumes aside, its tech is still slightly behind the curve. As The Verge reports, SMIC started mass production of HiSilicon s Kirin 710A processor on its 14nm node just last week, while TSMC is expected to progress to a more advanced 5nm method later this year.Even if Huawei does find a logistical solution to its chip nightmare, the damage this ongoing affair has caused the brand cannot be underestimated, nor can its impact on the global tech landscape   or at least Huawei thinks so. As its statement notes,  In the long run, this will damage the trust and collaboration within the global semiconductor industry which many industries depend on, increasing conflict and loss within these industries. The US is leveraging its own technological strengths to crush companies outside its own borders. This will only serve to undermine the trust international companies place in US technology and supply chains. Ultimately, this will harm US interests. See Campaign:https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/05/commerce-addresses-huaweis-efforts-undermine-entity-list-restrictsContact Information:Rachel EnglandTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: May 19, 2020End of Document

DANGEROUS PARTNERS: BIG TECH AND BEIJINGStates News ServiceMarch 4, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 2651 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the FBI:Clyde E. WallaceDeputy Assistant Director, Cyber DivisionFederal Bureau of InvestigationStatement Before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on Crime and TerrorismWashington, D.C.March 4, 2020Dangerous Partners: Big Tech and BeijingStatement for the RecordChairman, ranking member, and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the current threats to the United States homeland. Our nation continues to face a multitude of serious and evolving threats ranging from homegrown violent extremists (HVEs) to cyber criminals to hostile foreign intelligence services and operatives. Keeping pace with these threats is a significant challenge for the FBI. Our adversariesterrorists, foreign intelligence services, and criminalstake advantage of modern technology to hide their communications; recruit followers; and plan and encourage espionage, cyber-attacks, or terrorism to disperse information on different methods to attack the U.S. homeland, and to facilitate other illegal activities.Cyber ThreatsVirtually every national security threat and crime problem the FBI faces is cyber-based or facilitated. We face threats from state-sponsored hackers, hackers for hire, organized cyber syndicates, and terrorists. On a daily basis, these actors seek to steal our state secrets, our trade secrets, our technology, and our ideasthings of incredible value to all of us and of great importance to the conduct of our government business and our national security. They seek to hold our critical infrastructure at risk and to harm our economy.The FBI is investigating a wider-than-ever range of threat actors, from transnational organized cybercrime to nation-state adversaries to terrorists using social medial for recruiting and radicalization purposes. The scale, scope, speed, and impact of cyber threats is constantly evolving, which may explain why we are also seeing a blending of threats, such as nation state adversaries using criminal actors as proxies to mask their activities. The frequency and severity of malicious cyber activity on our nation's networks have increased dramatically in the past decade when measured by the amount of corporate data stolen or deleted, the volume of personally identifiable information compromised, or the remediation costs incurred by U.S. victims. Companies that hold large amounts of Personally identifiable information (PII) are susceptible to loss of American's personal data to criminal organizations, terrorists, and nation-state cyber actors. Hotel chains, airlines, health care companies, credit bureaus, government agencies, and cleared defense contractors have previously been victims of PII theft.Cyber Criminal TrendsCyber threats are not only increasing in size and scope, but are also becoming increasingly difficult and resource-intensive to investigate. Cyber criminals often operate through online forums, selling illicit goods and services, including tools that lower the barrier to entry for aspiring criminals and that can be used to facilitate malicious cyber activity. These criminals have also increased the sophistication of their schemes, which are more difficult to detect and more resilient to disruption than ever. In addition, whether located at home or abroad, many cyber actors are obfuscating their identities and obscuring their activity by using combinations of leased and compromised infrastructure in domestic and foreign jurisdictions. Such tactics make coordination with all of our partners, including international law enforcement partners, essential.Increasingly sophisticated obfuscation techniques are also enabling actors to stealthily obtain data from victims or re-purpose victim computers into cryptocurrency-mining botnets. Botnets used by cyber criminals have been responsible for billions of dollars in damages over the past several years. The widespread availability of malicious software (malware) that can create botnets allows individuals to leverage the combined bandwidth of thousands, if not millions, of compromised computers, servers, or network-ready devices to disrupt the day-to-day activities of governments, businesses, and individual Americans.Cyber threat actors are conducting ransomware attacks against U.S. systems, encrypting data and rendering systems unusablethereby victimizing individuals, businesses, and even emergency service and public health providers. Our threat reporting has demonstrated that ransomware attacks are becoming more targeted, sophisticated, and costly, even as the overall frequency of ransomware attacks is holding steady or declining. Since early 2018, the incidence of broad, indiscriminate ransomware campaigns has sharply declined, while losses from ransomware attacks have increased significantly. Allow me to restate that for emphasis: while the number of reported attacks has gone down, the effects and impacts of the attacks are going up. Meanwhile, state and local governments have been particularly visible targets for ransomware attacks. However, ransomware campaigns have also heavily impacted health care organizations, industrial companies, and the transportation sector.Business email compromise (BEC) remains a pervasive threat due to its low barrier of entry and maturing social engineering techniques, and cyber criminals almost certainly will continue to use BEC to target industries indiscriminately. BEC threat actors have widened their money laundering networks, including domestic transfers prior to laundering the money overseas, which presents challenges and opportunities for countering this type of fraud. Readily available online personal and business information enhances the reconnaissance capability of actors, providing BEC threat actors with more credible social engineering lures. Spoofed domains are seen in the majority of BEC attempts, and likely will remain a technique used by cyber actors. BEC attacks combining social engineering with network intrusions demonstrate an increase in attack sophistication that can use keyloggers or other malware to identify potential targets, such as business vendors, as well as sell access to or further exploit compromised systems.Actors have learned that BEC is effective and are adapting lures to target human resources departments for PII, such as W-2 tax forms to commit stolen identity return fraud, rather than requesting wire transfers. Additionally, industry partners have observed BEC actors increasingly instruct victims to send automated clearinghouse transfers to prepaid cards in the initial laundering phase.Nation State Activities: ChinaWhile several nation-states pose a cyber threat to U.S. interests, no other country presents a broader and more comprehensive threat to our ideas, innovation, and economic security than the People's Republic of China (PRC) under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The threat takes many different forms. Beijing employs a whole-of-government approach to its intelligence collection strategy. While cyber network operations remain a primary and possibly increasing collection tool, the CCP also relies on techniques such as intellectual property theft, purchases of U.S. corporations, and physical and property theft to acquire U.S. data.For example, less than a month ago, on February 10, the Department of Justice (DOJ), in coordination with the FBI, publicly unsealed an indictment against four Chinese cyber actors who allegedly acted as agents of the People's Republic of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA). All four actors are currently located in China. The alleged crimes occurred between May 13, 2017 and July 30, 2017. The actors targeted a software vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to Equifax's network and ultimately obtain PII for 145 million American citizens, as well as the intellectual property of the U.S. company.The indictment alleges the four individuals named therein reside in Beijing, China and are members of the 54th Research Institute. The 54th Research Institute is a component of the PLA. The indicted individuals gained unauthorized access, via a software vulnerability, to Equifax's internal network, where they allegedly ran approximately 9,000 queries on Equifax's systems and obtained the names, birth dates, and social security numbers for approximately half of all adult American citizens. The defendants also took deliberate steps to evade detection in the system, including routing traffic through approximately 34 servers located in nearly 20 countries to obfuscate their true location, using encrypted channels in order to blend in normal traffic within Equifax's network, and wiping log files on a daily basis to try to eliminate records of their activity.DOJ, the FBI, and our partners will continue to work tirelessly to combat this threat posed by the Chinese government against our nation. Although the PRC continues to modify the ways in which it conducts nefarious cyber activity, including through working with criminal hackers, the cases prosecuted by the DOJ in partnership with the FBI reflect an increasingly sophisticated ability to attribute criminal conduct to the individuals and nation states involved. We will be relentless in our pursuit of such malicious activity against our citizens and our industry.There are other risks. Chinese companies are increasingly acquiring or launching social media applications not housed in mainland China for the global consumer market. These applications generate big data and collect PII, such as biometric information, contact lists, location data, log data, communication metadata, content (text and photographic), bank and credit card details, and financial transactions of U.S. persons. The associated user agreements and privacy policies typically obfuscate the companies' data handling responsibilities or directly state any and all data can be transferred to other locations and associated entities to include the Chinese parent company. These data handling policies create a risk for U.S. big data and PII to be targeted and exploited by PRC actors. More broadly, consumers should be aware of the privacy implications of any application they install, especially applications from foreign countries with weak data protection laws.In June 2017, the PRC introduced a new national cyber security law that requires foreign firms to store data locally and submit to data surveillance measures. Although implementing regulations are still being drafted, Beijing could likely use these authorities and policies to compel access to U.S. commercial and sensitive personal data, including sensitive information stored or transmitted through Chinese systems. U.S.-based subsidiaries of Chinese corporations and entities, or organizations in the U.S. partnering on cooperative research and development efforts, are among the entities affected by this law. The law has raised fears by those concerned with Beijing's control of sensitive company information and increased opportunity to steal intellectual property.Threats Exposing Vulnerabilities on Critical Infrastructure Networks and the PublicVirtually all companies collect and maintain sensitive data either of their own employees or customer information. The overall trend of digitizing data for ease of use or access makes many different industries vulnerable to data breaches. For instance, over recent years the health care industry has moved to centralizing patient data and using Internet-connected devices,which has increased the sector's potential attack surface. Cyber actors benefit from this target-rich environment as the passage of patient data between health care departments and networks is critical to their care, but often levels of cybersecurity vary. Ransomware, denial of service attacks, and data breaches can all impede the ability to provide basic patient care and privacy for protected health information (PHI). Electronic medical records typically contain PII, which, combined with medical record information, is known as PHI.It is also highly likely cyber actors target the IT sector to access their customers' data and networks. IT sector entities manage and store valuable customer data and have unique, privileged access to client networks. These vital services create an environment where IT sector networks are compromised as a means for malicious cyber actors to reach a final target for fraud, hacktivism, and counterintelligence purposes.Entertainment and media companies use Internet-enabled systems for marketing, merchandising, ticketing, and reservations. As a result, owners and operators manage and protect databases of customer and employee data, including personal, financial, and credit card information. Since at least 2015, nation-state and criminal cyber actors have conducted computer network exploitation against the subsector likely to gain unauthorized access to non-public information, although the extent of the access in each case remains unclear.Efforts Used to Combat, Prevent, and Investigate Hacking or the Misuse of this DataIn order to combat cyber threats, the FBI has taken a whole-of-society approach. We actively engage with our private sector partners through the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA), which is a non-profit partnership between private industry, government and academia all working together to identify and disrupt cyber-crime. We recently hosted a ransomware-focused summit, with incident response companies, representatives from the legal and insurance industries as well as other government entities, where we discussed collaborative efforts to address the threats.The FBI also partners with the National Defense Cyber Alliance (NDCA), which is a non-profit organization bringing together the U.S. Intelligence Community and cleared defense contractor community to improve the security of their networks. Similar to how the NCFTA supports the financial/retail sector against criminal threats, the NDCA is designed to support the defense industrial base against national security threats.Through undercover operations and confidential human sources, we are targeting and shutting down dark-net and Clearnet criminal forums where identities are sold and where cyber criminals gather to plan their next attack. We are actively engaging with our international partners through our Cyber Assistant Legal Attach program, through our annual FBI-sponsored International Task Force, and through our participation in the FBI-led International Cyber Crime Operations Summit, as well as the Five Eyes Law Enforcement Group Cyber Crime Working Group.The FBI understands the importance of stressing cybersecurity with individuals, not just with organizations. To do so, we hold a series of events aimed at educating and speaking with individuals about these issues. The FBI regularly takes part in public awareness campaigns,where we coordinate with other agencies on initiatives for engagement with the private sector to prevent threats to critical infrastructure, educate entities on serious cyber threats, and ultimately close intelligence gaps. Additionally, we disseminate Private Industry Notifications, FBI Liaison Alert System reports, and public service announcements to share cyber threat information with the private sector and the general public.ConclusionThe FBI is engaged in myriad efforts to combat cyber threats, from improving threat identification and information sharing inside and outside of the government, to developing and retaining new talent, to examining the way we operate to disrupt and defeat these threats. FBI agents, analysts, and computer scientists are using technical capabilities and traditional investigative techniquessuch as sources, court-authorized electronic surveillance, physical surveillance, and forensicsto counter these threats.Load-Date: March 5, 2020End of Document

Spoofed domains are seen in the majority of BEC attempts, and likely will remain a technique used by cyber actors. BEC attacks combining social engineering with network intrusions demonstrate an increase in attack sophistication that can use keyloggers or other malware to identify potential targets, such as business vendors, as well as sell access to or further exploit compromised systems.Actors have learned that BEC is effective and are adapting lures to target human resources departments for PII, such as W-2 tax forms to commit stolen identity return fraud, rather than requesting wire transfers. Additionally, industry partners have observed BEC actors increasingly instruct victims to send automated clearing house transfers to prepaid cards in the initial laundering phase.Nation State Activities: ChinaWhile several nation-states pose a cyber threat to U.S. interests, no other country presents a broader and more comprehensive threat to our ideas, innovation, and economic security than the People's Republic of China ("PRC") under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party ("CCP"). The threat takes many different forms. Beijing employs a whole-of-government approach to its intelligence collection strategy. While cyber network operations remain a primary and possibly increasing collection tool, the CCP also relies on techniques such as intellectual property theft, purchases of U.S. corporations, and physical and property theft to acquire U.S.data.For example, less than a month ago, on February 10, 2020, the Department of Justice ("DOJ"), in coordination with the FBI, publicly unsealed an indictment against four Chinese cyber actors who allegedly acted as agents of the People's Republic of China's People's Liberation Army ("PLA"). All four actors are currently located in China. The alleged crimes occurred between May 13, 2017 and July 30, 2017. The actors targeted a software vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to Equifax's network and ultimately obtain PII for 145 million American citizens as well as the intellectual property of the U.S. company.The indictment alleges the four individuals named therein reside in Beijing, China and are members of the 54th Research Institute. The 54th Research Institute is a component of the People's Liberation Army. The indicted individuals gained unauthorized access, via a software vulnerability, to Equifax's internal network where they allegedly ran approximately 9,000 queries on Equifax's systems and obtained the names, birth dates, and social security numbers for approximately half of all adult American citizens. The defendants also took deliberate steps to evade detection in the system, including routing traffic through approximately 34 servers located in nearly 20 countries to obfuscate their true location, using encrypted channels in order to blend in normal traffic within Equifax's network, and wiping log files on a daily basis to try to eliminate records of their activity.DOJ, the FBI, and our partners will continue to work tirelessly to combat this threat posed by the Chinese government against our nation. Although the PRC continues to modify the ways in which it conducts nefarious cyber activity, including through working with criminal hackers, the cases prosecuted by the DOJ in partnership with the FBI reflect an increasingly sophisticated ability to attribute criminal conduct to the individuals and nation states involved.We will be relentless in our pursuit of such malicious activity against our citizens and our industry.There are other risks. Chinese companies are increasingly acquiring or launching social media applications not housed in mainland China for the global consumer market. These applications generate big data and collect PII such as biometric information, contact lists, location data, log data, communication metadata, content (text and photographic), bank and credit card details, and financial transactions of U.S. persons. The associated user agreements and privacy policies typically obfuscate the companies' data handling responsibilities or directly state any and all data can be transferred to other locations and associated entities to include the Chinese parent company. These data handling policies create a risk for U.S. big data and PII to be targeted and exploited by PRC actors. More broadly, consumers should be aware of the privacy implications of any application they install, especially applications from foreign countries with weak data protection laws.In June 2017, the PRC introduced a new national cyber security law that requires foreign firms to store data locally and submit to data surveillance measures. Although implementing regulations are still being drafted, Beijing could likely use these authorities and policies to compel access to U.S. commercial and sensitive personal data, including sensitive information stored or transmitted through Chinese systems. U.S.-based subsidiaries of Chinese corporations and entities, or organizations in the U.S. partnering on cooperative research and development efforts, are among the entities affected by this law. The law has raised fears by those concerned with Beijing's control of sensitive company information and increased opportunity to steal intellectual property.Threats Exposing Vulnerabilities on Critical Infrastructure Networks and the PublicVirtually all companies collect and maintain sensitive data either of their own employees or customer information. The overall trend of digitizing data for ease of use or access makes many different industries vulnerable to data breaches. For instance, over recent years the healthcare industry has moved to centralizing patient data and using Internet-connected devices, which has increased the sector's potential attack surface. Cyber actors benefit from this target rich environment as the passage of patient data between healthcare departments and networks is critical to their care, but often levels of cybersecurity vary. Ransomware, denial of service attacks, and data breaches can all impede the ability to provide basic patient care and privacy for protected health information ("PHI"). Electronic medical records typically contain PII, which, combined with medical record information, is known as PHI.It is also highly likely cyber actors target the IT Sector to access their customers' data and networks. IT sector entities manage and store valuable customer data and have unique, privileged access to client networks. These vital services create an environment where IT sector networks are compromised as a means for malicious cyber actors to reach a final target for fraud, hacktivism, and counterintelligence purposes.Entertainment and media companies use Internet-enabled systems for marketing, merchandising, ticketing, and reservations. As a result, owners and operators manage and protect databases of customer and employee data, including personal, financial, and credit card information. Since at least 2015, nation-state and criminal cyber actors have conducted computer network exploitation against the subsector likely to gain unauthorized access to non-public information, although the extent of the access in each case remains unclear.Efforts Used to Combat, Prevent, and Investigate Hacking or the Misuse of this Data In order to combat cyber threats, the FBI has taken a whole-of-society approach. We actively engage with our private sector partners through the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance ("NCFTA"), which is a non-profit partnership between private industry, government and academia all working together to identify and disrupt cyber-crime. We recently hosted a ransomware-focused summit, with incident response companies, representatives from the legal and insurance industries as well as other government entities, where we discussed collaborative efforts to address the threats.The FBI also partners with the National Defense Cyber Alliance ("NDCA"), which is a non-profit organization bringing together the U.S. Intelligence Community and Cleared Defense Contractor community to improve the security of their networks. Similar to how the NCFTA supports the financial/retail sector against criminal threats, the NDCA is designed to support the Defense Industrial Base against national security threats.Through undercover operations and confidential human sources, we are targeting and shutting down dark-net and Clearnet criminal forums where identities are sold and where cybercriminals gather to plan their next attack. We are actively engaging with our international partners through our Cyber Assistant Legal Attache ("ALAT") program, through our annual FBI-sponsored International Task Force and through our participation in the FBI-led International Cyber Crime Operations Summit ("ICCOS") as well as the Five Eyes Law Enforcement Group ("FELEG") Cyber Crime Working Group.The FBI understands the importance of stressing cybersecurity with individuals, not just with organizations. To do so, we hold a series of events aimed at educating and speaking with individuals about these issues. The FBI regularly takes part in Public Awareness Campaigns, where we coordinate with other agencies on initiatives for engagement with the private sector to prevent threats to critical infrastructure, educate entities on serious cyber threats, and ultimately close intelligence gaps. Additionally, we disseminate Private Industry Notifications ("PINs"), FBI Liaison Alert System ("FLASH") reports, and Public Service Announcements ("PSAs") to share cyber threat information with the private sector and the general public.ConclusionThe FBI is engaged in myriad efforts to combat cyber threats, from improving threat identification and information sharing inside and outside of the government, to developing and retaining new talent, to examining the way we operate to disrupt and defeat these threats. FBI agents, analysts, and computer scientists are using technical capabilities and traditional investigative techniques -- such as sources, court-authorized electronic surveillance, physical surveillance, and forensics -- to counter these threats.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7044121 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 6, 2020End of Document

Brutal propaganda war over coronavirus means facts matter more than ever | Trudy RubinPhilly.comApril 9, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Distributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: COMMENTARYLength: 911 wordsByline: Trudy Rubin, The Philadelphia InquirerBodyApril 09--Rarely has accurate information been more vital than at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.Yet a global disinformation war is being waged at full force.China and Russia push conspiracy theories worldwide about the origin of the virus. Autocrats from Cambodia to Saudi Arabia to Turkey censor reporting on the virus.Meantime, President Donald Trump blasts journalists who question his misinformation, while far-right pundits and social media promote reckless claims about the outbreak.Here’s the good news, however: For those of you who seek solid information while sheltering at home there is a surprising amount of it to be found.Where is the testing data we need to get back to work? I Trudy RubinBut first, it’s important to grasp some of the dangerous distortions being promoted about the virus globally – and at home. China tried to distract attention from its early mishandling of the virus by advancing absurd claims – tweeted by a Foreign Ministry spokesperson -- that the U.S. Army brought the epidemic to Wuhan.Meantime, the Chinese government expelled U.S. reporters who did yeoman coverage of the Wuhan outbreak, and muzzled its own media from reporting on its coronavirus failures.And Beijing is harnessing a vast social media campaign of bots, trolls, and state-controlled sites to push a new worldwide narrative stressing its “model” campaign to squelch COVID-19 (making a sharp comparison with the USA). It has done this even as many health experts worldwide question the Chinese statistics.The investigative news site ProPublica has tracked more than 10,000 fake or hijacked Twitter accounts connected to the Chinese government efforts at coronavirus propaganda (with an additional 200,000 frozen by Twitter). The German Marshall Fund’s Alliance for Securing Democracy also tracks Chinese propaganda efforts, along with Russia’s.And, indeed, Russia has also been super active promoting fake coronavirus news while hiding its own statistics. State-controlled TV promotes the thesis at home that COVID-19 was a biological weapon created by the Pentagon to kill as many Chinese as possibleMeantime, after closing Russia’s long border with China, Vladimir Putin did little to address the pandemic until very recently. Doctors are silenced, nearly all national media is controlled, while Moscow currently claims only 76 have died out of a mere 10,000 cases.“Nobody trusts the government figures announced in Russia,” says the respected independent Russian journalist Natalia Gevorkyan. “Everybody questions how it could be that we have such a long border with China, and so many Chinese workers inside Russia, yet we started so late and have so few cases.”That has not stopped the Kremlin from mounting a coordinated effort on social media to spread alarm and misinformation about COVID-19 in other countries. An internal European Union report described this effort as aimed at stoking “confusion, panic and fear” to “subvert European societies from within.” Ditto for America, as we learned after the 2016 election.So it’s easy to understand the goal of Russian and Chinese disinformation. What’s more frustrating is the level of conspiracy theories and misinformation being spewed out in the United States.No need here to reprise President Trump’s weeks of insisting the virus was under control or was a Democratic Party “hoax.” Or the ongoing daily news conferences where he now promotes unproven drug therapies.Equally disturbing are false narratives pushed by far-right pundits, including that the virus was manufactured in a Chinese laboratory. Or that it is spread by 5G wireless networks. (Russian outlets have long promoted the idea that 5G digital signals were harmful.)The ease with which conspiracy theories spread in troubled times makes it all the more vital that Americans have access to fact-based sources. Luckily there are even more such sources available than usual. So let me cite a few that I regularly consult.During the COVID-19 crisis some of America’s best newspapers are putting select coverage outside their paywalls. So, besides The Inquirer, you can read coronavirus coverage in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post. (Given the severe financial hit to newspapers at this time, and the great need for fact-based news, one hopes that those who take advantage of the freebie will ultimately subscribe.)Coronavirus lessons: How South Korea and Germany got it right I Trudy RubinBeyond print media, think tanks in Philadelphia and Washington have switched their many presentations via Zoom, which you can access for free. So you can tune in to fascinating events at Philly’s Foreign Policy Research Institute, the University of Pennsylvania’s Perry World House, the Brookings Institution, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Atlantic Council, and more. They send out the link and all you do is click.For stats on the virus there is the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Research Center.Both ProPublica and the Alliance for Securing Democracy websites report closely on Chinese and Russian disinformation campaigns.I could add many more (and will if asked), but hope this is sufficient while you are confined to quarters. Just remember, when you are free to emerge, how important it is to support news outlets and journalists that give you the facts.___ (c)2020 The Philadelphia Inquirer Visit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.inquirer.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.Load-Date: June 7, 2020End of Document

Europe looks suspiciously at China over virus transparencyCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 17, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 678 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- European governments struggling with the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic are hardening their positions toward China as suspicions about the level of transparency in the coronavirus's home country grow.French President Emmanuel Macron accused Beijing of not being frank about its handling of the epidemic, while in the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plans to involve Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co. on the country's next-generation mobile network may be prey to growing opposition.The European Union's position on China has been relatively measured, but leaders are beginning to call for a more thorough examination of their activities amid accusations that Beijing would have covered up the true scale of the epidemic. U.S. intelligence officials would have concluded that China concealed the extent of the outbreak in their country and reported a smaller number than the actual number of cases and deaths."Let's not be naive enough to say they've handled this much better," Macron told the Financial Times in an interview published Thursday, referring to China. "We don't know, things have clearly happened that we don't know."Revised countChina on Friday reviewed its official coronavirus death count and added about 1,290 deaths in Wuhan City. The Government rejected the accusations of cover-up and foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the revisions were a common practice and that China "has done nothing to be criticized.""China would like to work with all countries, including France and the United Kingdom, to stick to multilateralism, strengthen solidarity and cooperation to jointly safeguard the lives and health of all people," Zhao told journalists in Beijing.But tensions escalated when the French government summoned the Chinese ambassador following the publication of an entry on the embassy's website suggesting that France abandon residents of nursing homes. France's Secretary of State for European Affairs Amelie de Montchalin also accused China and Russia last month of using the delivery of medical equipment to help spread propaganda in Europe.A French official who refused to be identified said France's priority was to secure masks and other medical supplies from China and other countries, adding that the incident was "over."5G networksThere was also tension at one of the key points of China-European Union relations: Huawei's presence on European fifth-generation networks and the suspicion that Beijing could use it for possible sabotage or espionage.In London, Johnson's government hoped to win over conservative party rebels with an information campaign on Huawei before an unscheduled vote in Parliament on the company's involvement in the country's 5G infrastructure.But two people familiar with government thinking now believe that a tightening of positions among basic Conservative parliamentarians will make it difficult, if not impossible, for legislation to be passed. Prominent conservative party members called for a rethink of Britain's relations with China.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who during her tenure has cultivated relations with the key trading partner, has been more cautious about any accusations against China. But German officials have warned that Beijing could take advantage of the crisis in the west and use the power vacuums, as nations turn to curb the spread.Power vacuumThe countries of theEU is already on alert to Chinese companies that may be trying to take advantage of low valuations to take control of European companies. Bankers have recently seen an increase in applications from Chinese companies and funds for proposals on objectives in Europe.Without explicitly naming China, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas warned that U.S. President Donald Trump's order to freeze funding for the World Health Organization may invite powers that prevent liberal democracy from increasing their presence.Original Note:Europe Is Taking a Harder Look at China After Virus SuspicionsFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: April 18, 2020End of Document

The Latest: China sees 108 new virus cases, mostly importedAssociated Press Financial WireApril 13, 2020 Monday 3:23 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 3399 wordsByline: By The Associated PressBodyThe Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.TOP OF THE HOUR:- China reports 108 new cases of coronavirus, including 98 from people returning from other countries- Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe criticized on social media for 'stay home' message- New Zealand reports fifth death, 19 new cases of coronavirus- Chinese mask producer rushing to meet demands from overseas amid stricter inspections- Death toll in France nearly 14,400. But for the fourth day in a row, slightly fewer people were admitted into intensive care.- Italy has its lowest number of new deaths in three weeks, saying 431 people died in the past day to bring its total to 19,899.___BEIJING - China on Monday reported 108 new cases of coronavirus infection, 98 of them imported.Of the new domestic cases, seven were recorded in the province of Heilongjiang bordering on Russia and three in the southern business bub of Guangzhou. Two more deaths were reported in the former epicenter city of Wuhan, bringing China's totals since the illness emerged in December to 3,341 deaths among 82,160 official cases.Most patients in China have recovered and the final travel restrictions in Wuhan were lifted last week. But China has continued to see new cases in travelers arriving from abroad.Social distancing, temperature checks and other measures remain in effect while businesses are reopening and people resume work and other activities.___TOKYO - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's "stay home" message he tweeted Sunday has drawn angry reactions on social networks from those calling him insensitive to people who cannot rest at home because of the government's social distancing measures that do not come with compensation.Some tweets said he acted as if "an aristocrat," and others said "What does he think he is!"A one-minute video shows Abe sitting at home, expressionless, cuddling his dog, reading a book, sipping from a cup and clicking on a remote control. The video, on a split screen, features a popular singer and actor Gen Hoshino strumming on a guitar at home, but later posted on his Instagram that his clip was used without his permission.Abe declared a state of emergency in Tokyo and six other prefectures last Tuesday, asking the people to stay home and reduce human interactions by as much as 80%, but many Japanese companies are slow to switch to remote-working and many people were seen commuting even after the declaration.As of Sunday, Japan had 7,255 confirmed cases, as well as 712 other cases from a cruise ship quarantined earlier this year.___WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand recorded its fifth death from COVID-19 but only 19 new cases Monday as the rate of fresh infections continues to show signs of diminishing.The latest death, of a man in his 80s, was the third connected with a rest home in Christchurch where several residents and staff are infected.Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said 546 people in New Zealand have recovered from the viral illness as the number of people recovering outstrips the number of new infections.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters that New Zealanders cannot expect an early end to the lockdown that includes a ban on public gatherings.Ardern said people who broke social distancing rules over the Easter holiday weekend put lives at risk."It could take one case amongst you to lead to dozens of infections and possibly death," she said.___TOKYO - Japan had 507 new confirmed cases of the virus for a national total of 7,255, plus 712 others from a cruise ship quarantined earlier this year near Tokyo, with 114 deaths. Tokyo alone had 166 cases, with a prefectural total at 2,068 cases, or about a quarter of the nation's total. Tokyo is under a state of emergency declared by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last week, along with six other prefectures.Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike went ahead and asked non-essential businesses such as hostess bars, movie theaters and schools to close until May 6, with some exceptions, beginning Saturday, but most other prefectures have fallen behind. Saitama, north of Tokyo, started non-essential business closures Monday, and its Gov. Motohiro Ono said he planned to ask the central government financial support for the prefecture's planned compensation for the business closures. Abe's government initially issued a stay at home request in the seven prefectures, and broadened it to nationwide on Saturday, but wants non-business closures to wait until effects of the stay home request are evaluated.___SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea has reported 25 new cases of the coronavirus and three more virus-related deaths, bringing its totals to 10,537 infections and 217 fatalities.South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday said at least 929 cases were linked to passengers arriving from abroad, with most of them detected over the past three weeks.South Korea's caseload has slowed from early March, when it was reporting around 500 new cases a day, but officials have raised concerns over a broader "quiet spread," pointing to transmissions at bars and other leisure facilities that supposedly indicate eased attitudes toward social distancing.South Korean Prime Minster Chung Sye-kyun during a meeting on anti-virus strategies on Monday said officials are discussing new public guidelines that would allow for people to engage in "certain levels of economic and social activity" while also maintaining distance to slow the spread of the virus.___BEIJING -- China's foreign ministry says it is working with authorities in the southern province of Guangdong to prevent discriminatory treatment toward people of African heritage amid the coronavirus outbreak.The statement issued Sunday followed a letter of caution from the U.S. Embassy that police in the province have ordered bars and restaurants not to serve clients who appear to be of African origin and that some hotels and companies have refused to do business with them."Moreover, local officials launched a round of mandatory tests for COVID-19, followed by mandatory self-quarantine, for anyone with 'African contacts,' regardless of recent travel history or previous quarantine completion," the notice from the Embassy said. It urged those with African backgrounds to especially avoid the provincial capital of Guangzhou, which has a large African population of migrant traders.In its statement, the foreign ministry said all foreigners were treated equally during the outbreak and the government had "zero tolerance for discrimination."Authorities in Guangdong were "working promptly to improve their working method," the ministry said."African friends can count on getting fair, just, cordial and friendly reception in China. The foreign ministry will stay in close communication with the Guangdong authorities and continue responding to the African side's reasonable concerns and legitimate appeals," the statement said.___WUHAN, China - One mask producer in China says it is rushing to fill orders from overseas while facing stricter quality inspections from Chinese regulators.Wuhan Zonsen, which makes masks and disinfection wipes, says $50 million in orders from European countries and the United States will keep them at full production capacity until June."Now the major demand of masks comes from European countries and the US where the epidemic is severe ... their demand now has increased to 10 times than before because of the epidemic," said Cynthia Ye, global marketing manager of Zonsen.Zonsen plans to add another five production lines to increase their daily production from 200,000 to 700,000 masks, Zonsen's production managers told reporters during a media tour organized by Wuhan government.Chinese customs have announced that ventilators, masks and other supplies being exported to fight the coronavirus will be subject to quality inspections following complaints that substandard goods were being sold abroad. Regulators in Australia, the Netherlands and other countries have complained that masks, virus test kits and other products were faulty or failed to meet quality standards.Ye denied there are any quality issues with the masks they had shipped to Netherlands.Wuhan on Wednesday ended its 76-day lockdown, allowing residents to again travel in and out of the city. Wuhan and China are expected to suffer severe economic costs and tens of millions of job losses from the city closure.Ye said the government of Xinzhou district, where Zonsen is located, offered aid to meet the company's demand for workers. Now more than 60 employees are back to work and live together in a designated hotel to avoid infection."We have to provide hotel rooms for the workers so we have more cost, which is about five to 10 times of our normal cost. The salary for workers is about three or five times of their normal one," said Ye.___PARIS - The overall death toll in France from the coronavirus has risen to nearly 14,400, but for the fourth day in a row, slightly fewer people were admitted into intensive care - 35 fewer - giving health officials a reason to grasp for good news.Sunday's statistics issued by the Health Ministry confirm the country is reaching a "very high plateau" and reflect initial signs that nearly four weeks of confinement and the "drastic reduction in contacts" are producing an effect, a statement said.Strict confinement measures began March 17, were renewed once and are expected to be extended again, with a likely announcement to the nation Monday by President Emmanuel Macron.Since March 1, hospitals and nursing homes have counted 14,393 deaths.Of the 31,836 people currently hospitalized for COVID-19, more than 1,600 were admitted in the past 24 hours, the Health Ministry said.Still, with more than 6,800 patients being treated in intensive care Sunday, that was 35 people fewer than a day earlier, a ray of hope for overworked health workers and authorities looking for small signs of change.Since the start of the epidemic in France, more than 95,400 people have been infected.___ROME - Italy recorded the lowest number of new coronavirus deaths in three weeks, saying 431 people died in the past day to bring its total to 19,899.It was the lowest day-to-day toll since March 19.For the ninth day running, intensive care admissions were down and hospitalizations overall were down, relieving pressure on Italy's over-stressed health care system.More than 4,000 people tested positive as Italy began its fifth week under nationwide lockdown, continuing a general flattening in its infection curve.But officials have noted that Italy has also increased its testing capacity in recent days, yielding more positive cases but allowing for more effective quarantine measures for people once they know they are infected.Italy crossed the 1 million virus test mark on Sunday, doubling the number of tests since the end of March. Overall, 156,363 people have been confirmed as positive, though officials note that the true number of infected could be as much as 10 times that, particularly in hard-hit Lombardy.Officials have also warned that the true number of dead from the virus pandemic is higher, given the hundreds of elderly who have died in nursing homes but were never tested.___JERUSALEM - Hospital officials say Rabbi Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron, a former chief rabbi of Israel, has died from COVID-19.Jerusalem's Shaare Zedek Medical Center said Bakshi-Doron died late Sunday, several days after he was admitted to the hospital with the coronavirus. It said he had suffered from underlying health problems. Israeli media said Bakshi-Doron was 79.Bakshi-Doron served as Israel's chief Sephardic rabbi, representing Jews of Middle Eastern ancestry, from 1993 to 2003. He held a number of other key roles, including the head of Israel's rabbinic court system, and was active in interfaith causes.In 2017, he was fined and sentenced to probation for his role in a scheme that allowed policemen to receive fraudulent educational credentials that enabled them to obtain pay raises. He remained a popular and respected figure with much of the public.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remembered Bakshi-Doron as a warm person and a gifted religious scholar. "His essence was wisdom, tolerance and love for the people and the country," he said.Israel has reported more than 11,000 cases of the coronavirus, and 104 deaths. Israel's ultra-Orthodox religious community has been especially hard hit.___NEW ORLEANS - Archbishop Gregory Aymond led a live streamed Easter Mass in St. Louis Cathedral in New Orleans On Sunday.The pews were empty. Other than the concelebrants, the only other people in the Cathedral were those with official roles in the Mass, a sign language interpreter, a Cathedral maintenance employee, and seven photographers and reporters.Aymond started the Mass noting "We are not in isolation. We are still one family coming together," Aymond said.He said the coronavirus pandemic "has brought great darkness over the earth. Our way of life has changed," and he later acknowledged fear, grief and uncertainty.___NEW ORLEANS - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says an influx of tourists for Mardi Gras may be a reason why Louisiana experienced a higher rate of COVID-19 cases than other Southern states.In a report posted Friday, the CDC says population density might play "a significant role in the acceleration of transmission" of the coronavirus. It said Louisiana experienced a "temporarily high" population density because of Carnival season visitors.It also noted the season ended Feb. 25 - well before federal calls to discourage mass gatherings in mid-March.Louisiana reported 34 newly recorded coronavirus-related deaths Sunday, bringing the death toll in the state to 840.___YEREVAN, Armenia - The Armenian Apostolic Church held Easter services without parishioners because of the coronavirus pandemic.The service at church's seat of Echmiadzin Cathedral included displaying the Spear of Geghard, an important relic that is brought out in special cases such as the country being in danger.The relic is said to be the tip of a lance used by a Roman soldier to prod Jesus Christ after his crucifixion to determine if he was dead. The service was broadcast on national television.___ATHENS, Greece - There were five more fatalities from COVID-19 in the past 24 hours in Greece, all men, raising the total to 98, authorities say.There are now a total of 2,114 confirmed cases of the disease, 33 added since Saturday afternoon.There are 76 people hooked to ventilator machines, while 15 patients that had been in intensive care have recovered, authorities in a statement.The main concern of authorities remains individuals' attempts to flout strict quarantine measures, during the Orthodox Easter, which is celebrated next Sunday.It is usually a time of mass exodus to the countryside and, just over 9 hours on Sunday, 38 people were stopped trying to leave cities and fined 300 euros each.A related concern is church gatherings, now banned; on Sunday, Palm Sunday, the government asked for a prosecutor to indict two priests who provided communion to the faithful despite the ban.One of them, in an Athens neighborhood, was photographed from a nearby building secretly giving communion to faithful through the back door.___SALEM, Oregon - The coronavirus has had a devastating impact on nine long-term care facilities in Oregon, killing at least 24 people among 171 who have tested positive.The fatalities represent almost half the total number of people in Oregon known to have died of COVID-19, according to data from state officials released late Saturday.In one facility alone, Healthcare at Foster Creek in Portland, nine of 35 people who became infected died, according to an announcement from the state coronavirus Joint Information Center.___Though the United States federal government has not been releasing a count of its own, an Associated Press tally from media reports and state health departments indicate at least 2,755 deaths have been linked to coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities nationwide.___WASHINGTON - Washington health officials announced Sunday morning that 97 positive new COVID-19 infections had been identified, bringing the total up to 1,875, with three new deaths for a total of 50.Mayor Muriel Bowser declared a state of emergency on March 11 and issued a stay-home order on March 30 for Washington's approximately 700,000 residents.___ANKARA, Turkey - Turkey saw a daily rise of 4,789 coronavirus cases and 97 deaths on Sunday as a 48-hour lockdown in 31 cities approached its end."This struggle is won by staying at home, not in hospitals," Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said in a statement. Turkey has now recorded 56,956 confirmed cases and 1,198 fatalities since the outbreak emerged on March 11.___COLOMBO, Sri Lanka - Imposing a new regulation, the Sri Lanka government on Sunday ordered that the corpse of a person who has died or is suspected to have died of coronavirus should be cremated.The order comes amid concerns raised by the ethnic minority Muslim leaders in Sri Lanka, saying the cremation of the dead body of a Muslim COVID-19 victim is against the Islamic practice of a burial.A government decree issued on Sunday said that the corpse of a corona victim should be cremated "at the temperature of 800 to 1,200 degrees Celsius for a minimum period of 45 minutes to one hour for complete burning, for the purpose of prevention of any potential biological threat."According to the new regulation, the body of the deceased will be handed over only to those involved in the cremation process, and the ashes of the deceased may be handed over to the next of kin at their request.So far, seven people have died of the virus while 140 are being treated at hospitals while 56 have recovered.Two weeks ago, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress leader Rauff Hakeem said that the second person to die in Sri Lanka infected by coronavirus was not allowed to be buried despite requests by family and political leaders. Hakeem however requested Muslims to be patient considering the extraordinary situation.Sri Lanka is a predominantly Buddhist nation with Muslims comprising about 7 percent of the population.___LONDON - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has posted a video on Twitter in which he hails the staff in the National Health Service for saving his life when it could have "gone either way."Johnson was dressed in a suit and looked and sounded assured in the video made after his discharge from St. Thomas' Hospital in London. He said he did not have the words to properly thank the staff at NHS for"saving my life."He listed a number of the frontline staff who cared for him over a week at St. Thomas' Hospital in London but singled out two nurses who stood by his bedside for 48 hours "when things could have gone either way."He said Jenny from New Zealand and Luis from Portugal were the reason "in the end my body did start to get enough oxygen."Johnson said there are "hundreds of thousands of NHS staff who are acting with the same care and thought and precision as Jenny and Luis."Johnson spent a week at St. Thomas', three days of which were in intensive care. He was given oxygen but was not put on a ventilator.___WASHINGTON - The United States' top infectious disease expert says the economy in parts of the country could be allowed to reopen as early as next month.Dr. Anthony Fauci says there's no light switch that will be clicked to turn everything back on. He says a "rolling re-entry" will be required based on the status of the new coronavirus pandemic in various parts of the country.Fauci says those factors include the region of the country, the nature of the outbreak it already has experienced and the possible threat of an outbreak to come.Social distancing guidelines imposed by President Donald Trump are set to expire April 30.Trump is eager to restart the economy, which has stalled because most Americans are under orders to "stay at home" to help slow the virus' spread.Fauci spoke Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union."___Follow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and            https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreakLoad-Date: April 13, 2020End of Document

The Latest: China sees 108 new virus cases, mostly importedAssociated Press InternationalApril 13, 2020 Monday 3:23 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 3399 wordsByline: By The Associated PressBodyThe Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.TOP OF THE HOUR:- China reports 108 new cases of coronavirus, including 98 from people returning from other countries- Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe criticized on social media for 'stay home' message- New Zealand reports fifth death, 19 new cases of coronavirus- Chinese mask producer rushing to meet demands from overseas amid stricter inspections- Death toll in France nearly 14,400. But for the fourth day in a row, slightly fewer people were admitted into intensive care.- Italy has its lowest number of new deaths in three weeks, saying 431 people died in the past day to bring its total to 19,899.___BEIJING - China on Monday reported 108 new cases of coronavirus infection, 98 of them imported.Of the new domestic cases, seven were recorded in the province of Heilongjiang bordering on Russia and three in the southern business bub of Guangzhou. Two more deaths were reported in the former epicenter city of Wuhan, bringing China's totals since the illness emerged in December to 3,341 deaths among 82,160 official cases.Most patients in China have recovered and the final travel restrictions in Wuhan were lifted last week. But China has continued to see new cases in travelers arriving from abroad.Social distancing, temperature checks and other measures remain in effect while businesses are reopening and people resume work and other activities.___TOKYO - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's "stay home" message he tweeted Sunday has drawn angry reactions on social networks from those calling him insensitive to people who cannot rest at home because of the government's social distancing measures that do not come with compensation.Some tweets said he acted as if "an aristocrat," and others said "What does he think he is!"A one-minute video shows Abe sitting at home, expressionless, cuddling his dog, reading a book, sipping from a cup and clicking on a remote control. The video, on a split screen, features a popular singer and actor Gen Hoshino strumming on a guitar at home, but later posted on his Instagram that his clip was used without his permission.Abe declared a state of emergency in Tokyo and six other prefectures last Tuesday, asking the people to stay home and reduce human interactions by as much as 80%, but many Japanese companies are slow to switch to remote-working and many people were seen commuting even after the declaration.As of Sunday, Japan had 7,255 confirmed cases, as well as 712 other cases from a cruise ship quarantined earlier this year.___WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand recorded its fifth death from COVID-19 but only 19 new cases Monday as the rate of fresh infections continues to show signs of diminishing.The latest death, of a man in his 80s, was the third connected with a rest home in Christchurch where several residents and staff are infected.Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said 546 people in New Zealand have recovered from the viral illness as the number of people recovering outstrips the number of new infections.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters that New Zealanders cannot expect an early end to the lockdown that includes a ban on public gatherings.Ardern said people who broke social distancing rules over the Easter holiday weekend put lives at risk."It could take one case amongst you to lead to dozens of infections and possibly death," she said.___TOKYO - Japan had 507 new confirmed cases of the virus for a national total of 7,255, plus 712 others from a cruise ship quarantined earlier this year near Tokyo, with 114 deaths. Tokyo alone had 166 cases, with a prefectural total at 2,068 cases, or about a quarter of the nation's total. Tokyo is under a state of emergency declared by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last week, along with six other prefectures.Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike went ahead and asked non-essential businesses such as hostess bars, movie theaters and schools to close until May 6, with some exceptions, beginning Saturday, but most other prefectures have fallen behind. Saitama, north of Tokyo, started non-essential business closures Monday, and its Gov. Motohiro Ono said he planned to ask the central government financial support for the prefecture's planned compensation for the business closures. Abe's government initially issued a stay at home request in the seven prefectures, and broadened it to nationwide on Saturday, but wants non-business closures to wait until effects of the stay home request are evaluated.___SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea has reported 25 new cases of the coronavirus and three more virus-related deaths, bringing its totals to 10,537 infections and 217 fatalities.South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday said at least 929 cases were linked to passengers arriving from abroad, with most of them detected over the past three weeks.South Korea's caseload has slowed from early March, when it was reporting around 500 new cases a day, but officials have raised concerns over a broader "quiet spread," pointing to transmissions at bars and other leisure facilities that supposedly indicate eased attitudes toward social distancing.South Korean Prime Minster Chung Sye-kyun during a meeting on anti-virus strategies on Monday said officials are discussing new public guidelines that would allow for people to engage in "certain levels of economic and social activity" while also maintaining distance to slow the spread of the virus.___BEIJING -- China's foreign ministry says it is working with authorities in the southern province of Guangdong to prevent discriminatory treatment toward people of African heritage amid the coronavirus outbreak.The statement issued Sunday followed a letter of caution from the U.S. Embassy that police in the province have ordered bars and restaurants not to serve clients who appear to be of African origin and that some hotels and companies have refused to do business with them."Moreover, local officials launched a round of mandatory tests for COVID-19, followed by mandatory self-quarantine, for anyone with 'African contacts,' regardless of recent travel history or previous quarantine completion," the notice from the Embassy said. It urged those with African backgrounds to especially avoid the provincial capital of Guangzhou, which has a large African population of migrant traders.In its statement, the foreign ministry said all foreigners were treated equally during the outbreak and the government had "zero tolerance for discrimination."Authorities in Guangdong were "working promptly to improve their working method," the ministry said."African friends can count on getting fair, just, cordial and friendly reception in China. The foreign ministry will stay in close communication with the Guangdong authorities and continue responding to the African side's reasonable concerns and legitimate appeals," the statement said.___WUHAN, China - One mask producer in China says it is rushing to fill orders from overseas while facing stricter quality inspections from Chinese regulators.Wuhan Zonsen, which makes masks and disinfection wipes, says $50 million in orders from European countries and the United States will keep them at full production capacity until June."Now the major demand of masks comes from European countries and the US where the epidemic is severe ... their demand now has increased to 10 times than before because of the epidemic," said Cynthia Ye, global marketing manager of Zonsen.Zonsen plans to add another five production lines to increase their daily production from 200,000 to 700,000 masks, Zonsen's production managers told reporters during a media tour organized by Wuhan government.Chinese customs have announced that ventilators, masks and other supplies being exported to fight the coronavirus will be subject to quality inspections following complaints that substandard goods were being sold abroad. Regulators in Australia, the Netherlands and other countries have complained that masks, virus test kits and other products were faulty or failed to meet quality standards.Ye denied there are any quality issues with the masks they had shipped to Netherlands.Wuhan on Wednesday ended its 76-day lockdown, allowing residents to again travel in and out of the city. Wuhan and China are expected to suffer severe economic costs and tens of millions of job losses from the city closure.Ye said the government of Xinzhou district, where Zonsen is located, offered aid to meet the company's demand for workers. Now more than 60 employees are back to work and live together in a designated hotel to avoid infection."We have to provide hotel rooms for the workers so we have more cost, which is about five to 10 times of our normal cost. The salary for workers is about three or five times of their normal one," said Ye.___PARIS - The overall death toll in France from the coronavirus has risen to nearly 14,400, but for the fourth day in a row, slightly fewer people were admitted into intensive care - 35 fewer - giving health officials a reason to grasp for good news.Sunday's statistics issued by the Health Ministry confirm the country is reaching a "very high plateau" and reflect initial signs that nearly four weeks of confinement and the "drastic reduction in contacts" are producing an effect, a statement said.Strict confinement measures began March 17, were renewed once and are expected to be extended again, with a likely announcement to the nation Monday by President Emmanuel Macron.Since March 1, hospitals and nursing homes have counted 14,393 deaths.Of the 31,836 people currently hospitalized for COVID-19, more than 1,600 were admitted in the past 24 hours, the Health Ministry said.Still, with more than 6,800 patients being treated in intensive care Sunday, that was 35 people fewer than a day earlier, a ray of hope for overworked health workers and authorities looking for small signs of change.Since the start of the epidemic in France, more than 95,400 people have been infected.___ROME - Italy recorded the lowest number of new coronavirus deaths in three weeks, saying 431 people died in the past day to bring its total to 19,899.It was the lowest day-to-day toll since March 19.For the ninth day running, intensive care admissions were down and hospitalizations overall were down, relieving pressure on Italy's over-stressed health care system.More than 4,000 people tested positive as Italy began its fifth week under nationwide lockdown, continuing a general flattening in its infection curve.But officials have noted that Italy has also increased its testing capacity in recent days, yielding more positive cases but allowing for more effective quarantine measures for people once they know they are infected.Italy crossed the 1 million virus test mark on Sunday, doubling the number of tests since the end of March. Overall, 156,363 people have been confirmed as positive, though officials note that the true number of infected could be as much as 10 times that, particularly in hard-hit Lombardy.Officials have also warned that the true number of dead from the virus pandemic is higher, given the hundreds of elderly who have died in nursing homes but were never tested.___JERUSALEM - Hospital officials say Rabbi Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron, a former chief rabbi of Israel, has died from COVID-19.Jerusalem's Shaare Zedek Medical Center said Bakshi-Doron died late Sunday, several days after he was admitted to the hospital with the coronavirus. It said he had suffered from underlying health problems. Israeli media said Bakshi-Doron was 79.Bakshi-Doron served as Israel's chief Sephardic rabbi, representing Jews of Middle Eastern ancestry, from 1993 to 2003. He held a number of other key roles, including the head of Israel's rabbinic court system, and was active in interfaith causes.In 2017, he was fined and sentenced to probation for his role in a scheme that allowed policemen to receive fraudulent educational credentials that enabled them to obtain pay raises. He remained a popular and respected figure with much of the public.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remembered Bakshi-Doron as a warm person and a gifted religious scholar. "His essence was wisdom, tolerance and love for the people and the country," he said.Israel has reported more than 11,000 cases of the coronavirus, and 104 deaths. Israel's ultra-Orthodox religious community has been especially hard hit.___NEW ORLEANS - Archbishop Gregory Aymond led a live streamed Easter Mass in St. Louis Cathedral in New Orleans On Sunday.The pews were empty. Other than the concelebrants, the only other people in the Cathedral were those with official roles in the Mass, a sign language interpreter, a Cathedral maintenance employee, and seven photographers and reporters.Aymond started the Mass noting "We are not in isolation. We are still one family coming together," Aymond said.He said the coronavirus pandemic "has brought great darkness over the earth. Our way of life has changed," and he later acknowledged fear, grief and uncertainty.___NEW ORLEANS - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says an influx of tourists for Mardi Gras may be a reason why Louisiana experienced a higher rate of COVID-19 cases than other Southern states.In a report posted Friday, the CDC says population density might play "a significant role in the acceleration of transmission" of the coronavirus. It said Louisiana experienced a "temporarily high" population density because of Carnival season visitors.It also noted the season ended Feb. 25 - well before federal calls to discourage mass gatherings in mid-March.Louisiana reported 34 newly recorded coronavirus-related deaths Sunday, bringing the death toll in the state to 840.___YEREVAN, Armenia - The Armenian Apostolic Church held Easter services without parishioners because of the coronavirus pandemic.The service at church's seat of Echmiadzin Cathedral included displaying the Spear of Geghard, an important relic that is brought out in special cases such as the country being in danger.The relic is said to be the tip of a lance used by a Roman soldier to prod Jesus Christ after his crucifixion to determine if he was dead. The service was broadcast on national television.___ATHENS, Greece - There were five more fatalities from COVID-19 in the past 24 hours in Greece, all men, raising the total to 98, authorities say.There are now a total of 2,114 confirmed cases of the disease, 33 added since Saturday afternoon.There are 76 people hooked to ventilator machines, while 15 patients that had been in intensive care have recovered, authorities in a statement.The main concern of authorities remains individuals' attempts to flout strict quarantine measures, during the Orthodox Easter, which is celebrated next Sunday.It is usually a time of mass exodus to the countryside and, just over 9 hours on Sunday, 38 people were stopped trying to leave cities and fined 300 euros each.A related concern is church gatherings, now banned; on Sunday, Palm Sunday, the government asked for a prosecutor to indict two priests who provided communion to the faithful despite the ban.One of them, in an Athens neighborhood, was photographed from a nearby building secretly giving communion to faithful through the back door.___SALEM, Oregon - The coronavirus has had a devastating impact on nine long-term care facilities in Oregon, killing at least 24 people among 171 who have tested positive.The fatalities represent almost half the total number of people in Oregon known to have died of COVID-19, according to data from state officials released late Saturday.In one facility alone, Healthcare at Foster Creek in Portland, nine of 35 people who became infected died, according to an announcement from the state coronavirus Joint Information Center.___Though the United States federal government has not been releasing a count of its own, an Associated Press tally from media reports and state health departments indicate at least 2,755 deaths have been linked to coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities nationwide.___WASHINGTON - Washington health officials announced Sunday morning that 97 positive new COVID-19 infections had been identified, bringing the total up to 1,875, with three new deaths for a total of 50.Mayor Muriel Bowser declared a state of emergency on March 11 and issued a stay-home order on March 30 for Washington's approximately 700,000 residents.___ANKARA, Turkey - Turkey saw a daily rise of 4,789 coronavirus cases and 97 deaths on Sunday as a 48-hour lockdown in 31 cities approached its end."This struggle is won by staying at home, not in hospitals," Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said in a statement.

The market appeared on track for another day of gains paced by longer tenors after the overnight session saw more signs of deteriorating U.S.-China relations and poor economic data from Europe. The U.S. Senate unanimously voted in favor of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act last night, followed by news that the Commerce Department extended the ban on U.S. companies doing business with Huawei for another year. At the same time, rules for granting special exemptions were tightened. Separate reports of U.S. officials blocking a shipment of chips intended for Huawei suggested that the updated rules were already being enforced. Treasuries extended their starting gains in immediate response to the April Retail Sales report (actual -16.4%; Briefing.com consensus -11.9%), which was even worse than expected. Treasuries backed down from their highs shortly after the post-data spike, spending the rest of the day in a steady pullback as equities fought to reclaim their losses. The long bond paced the early advance, but it also ended up leading the pullback after this week's show of relative strength.

China's April Industrial Production increased 3.9% yr/yr (expected 1.5%; last -1.1%), April Retail Sales fell 7.5% yr/yr (expected -7.0%; last -15.8%), April Fixed Asset Investment fell 10.3% yr/yr (expected -10.0%; last -16.1%), and April Unemployment Rate ticked up to 6.0% from 5.9%. Hong Kong's Q1 GDP fell 5.3% qtr/qtr, as expected (last -0.3%), contracting 8.9% yr/yr, as expected (last -2.9%). South Korea's April trade deficit totaled $1.39 bln (last deficit of $950 mln).

Germany's Q1 GDP fell 2.2% qtr/qtr, as expected (last -0.1%), contracting 1.9% yr/yr (expected -1.6%; last 0.2%). Italy's March Industrial New Orders plunged 26.5% m/m (last -4.1%) while Industrial Sales fell 25.8% m/m (last -1.7%). Today's Data: Total retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) while retail sales, excluding autos, declined 17.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%). The sales downturn was extreme with double-digit declines in most categories. The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment. Industrial production declined 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%), which was the largest monthly drop in the 101-year history of the index.

The key takeaway from the report is that it is a reflection of how industrial production cratered amid shutdown orders designed to contain the spread of COVID-19. On a yr/yr basis, industrial production was down 15.0%. The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 73.7 in the preliminary reading for May (Briefing.com consensus 67.4) from 71.8 in April.

That is apt to be a headwind for a pickup in consumer spending. Business Inventories decreased 0.2% in March (Briefing.com consensus -0.4%) after decreasing a revised 0.5% (from -0.4%) in February.

Co expects to develop STI-1499 as a stand-alone therapy on account of the "high potency it has exhibited in experiments to date."

The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000, however, is up 1.1%.Prior to the open, Reuters reported that the Trump administration was moving to block semiconductor shipments to China's Huawei Technologies, which raised the specter of possible Chinese retaliation on American companies. Shortly thereafter, the Retail Sales report for April showed a record 16.4% m/m decline in total retail sales (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%).The market has been more cognizant of reported tensions, as opposed to the weak data due to a view that the data can't get any worse with reopening efforts underway. Semiconductor companies are among today's weakest performers following the moves in Washington, evidenced by the 2.9% decline in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.Many of these companies, including Applied Materials (AMAT 51.51, -2.92, -5.4%) following its earnings report, have weighed on the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.7%). The utilities (-2.8%) and real estate (-2.0%) sectors are down the most, though.On the other hand, the energy sector (+0.6%) is following the positive move in oil prices ($29.16, +1.28, +4.6%), and the materials (+0.6%) and consumer staples (+0.3%) sectors also show relative strength.DraftKings (DKNG 28.84, +3.56, +14.0%) is an earnings standout, with shares rising 14% after the company topped EPS estimates and said it doesn't expect COVID-19 to impact its sports betting business long-term.Treasury prices have declined since the opening bell, bringing yields off early lows. The 10-yr yield is currently up one basis point to 0.64% after slipping below 0.60% at its low. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 100.40.Reviewing today's economic data:Total retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) while retail sales, excluding autos, declined 17.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment.Industrial production declined 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%), which was the largest monthly drop in the 101-year history of the index.

Approx. one dozen of these antibodies have demonstrated the ability to block the S1 protein's interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor used for viral entrance into human cells. These blocking antibodies were further tested for their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in an in vitro SARS-CoV-2 virus infection model pursuant to a preclinical testing agreement for COVID-19 therapeutic candidates that was previously announced on March 31.One antibody stood out for its ability to completely block SARS-CoV-2 infection of healthy cells in the experiments. STI-1499 completely neutralized the virus infectivity at a very low antibody dose, making it a prime candidate for further testing and development. Initial biochemical and biophysical analyses also indicate STI-1499 is a potentially strong antibody drug candidate.Sorrento has determined STI-1499 will likely be the first antibody in the antibody cocktail (COVI-SHIELD) it is developing. STI-1499 is also expected to be developed as a stand-alone therapy (COVI-GUARD) because of the high potency it has exhibited in experiments to date. Sorrento plans to request priority evaluation and accelerated review from regulators to determine the best pathway to make any potential treatment available as soon as possible. Sorrento's manufacturing facility in San Diego is expected to be able to produce up to two hundred thousand doses per month, and the company intends to produce a million doses at risk while seeking FDA approval for any STI-1499 product candidate. The company is seeking potential government support and pharmaceutical partners to further scale up STI-1499 manufacturing capacity with a goal of potentially providing tens of millions of doses in a short period of time to meet the vast projected demand.11:04TALKX Market Briefing: U.S.-China tension creates some unease and uneven tradingThe stock market is sagging as it confronts another batch of terrible economic data and reports about rising tension between the U.S. and China.Briefly, in April, retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m while industrial production declined a record 11.2%. Consumer sentiment actually improved some in May to 73.7 (from 71.8), yet that belies the fact that attitudes about the outlook actually deteriorated (to 67.7 from 70.1).There is a lot of headline noise surrounding U.S-China relations. The U.S. is moving to block shipments of semiconductors to Huawei and China is said to be entertaining countermeasures, which include restricting or investigating U.S. companies doing business there, if the U.S. follows through.The latter concern has been tempered somewhat by Chinese state media noting China hopes it can meet the U.S. "half way" in trade dealings. Separately, NEC Director Kudlow has denied that the U.S.-China trade deal is falling apart.The uncertain sense of where those relations actually stand has contributed to some uneven trading activity and a modest downward bias for the broader market.A weak showing from the information technology sector (-1.7%), which is feeling the brunt of the angst involving China, is the main drag on the broader market. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is down 3.8%. Other laggards of note include the utilities (-2.3%), real estate (-1.6%), and financial (-1.0%) sectors.Generally speaking, small-cap stocks are faring well, evidenced by the relative strength of the Russell 2000, which is drawing added support from many of its energy sector components. The latter are following crude prices higher ($28.75, +1.19, +4.3%).The Russell 2000 is up 0.7%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 are down 0.9%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.1%.10:18JCP J.

These studies, led by Prasad Adusumilli, MD and collaborators at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence of the preclinical safety, improved functional characteristics and enhanced anti-tumor efficacy of ATA2271. Specifically, in vitro, ATA2271 exhibited antigen-specific cytotoxicity, accumulation and effector cytokine secretion, while in vivo results demonstrated that a single dose of ATA2271 led to tumor eradication and superior survival in mice compared to mesothelin-targeted M28z CAR T cells. Mice treated with a single dose of ATA2271 also showed sustained and persistent protection from tumor reestablishment upon 10 additional tumor re-challenges. Results from the study demonstrated the proposed advantages associated with functional persistence and cell-intrinsic PD-1 checkpoint blockade.09:22EDIT Editas Medicine presents data from pre-clinical study supporting use of CRISPR-Cas12a for the development of engineered cell immunotherapies (55.88 )Editas Medicine announced results from a pre-clinical study evaluating multi-gene knockout and transgene knock-in using its proprietary engineered CRISPR-Cas12a (EngCas12a) in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for the development of engineered cell immunotherapy medicines. The results of this study further reinforce Editas Medicine's belief in the transformative potential of iPSC-derived natural killer (iNK) cells as off-the-shelf engineered cell medicines for the treatment of solid tumor cancers.In this study, CRISPR-Cas12a was used to make highly edited iPSC clones. The iPSCs were then differentiated into functional iNK cells. The iNKs derived from the edited iPSC clones had enhanced tumor killing activity relative to iNKs from unedited iPSCs, demonstrating the utility of an edited iPSC platform. The company reported these data today in an oral presentation at the 23rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy, being held virtually.09:17ECONX April Capacity Utilization 64.9% vs 64.0% Briefing.com consensus09:16WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: -27.80.

While they've seen a few studies with sensitivity performance percentages in the 80s, we've also seen other studies with sensitivity at or above 90%, and one as high as 94%.While we understand no test is perfect, test outcomes depend on a number of factors including patient selection, specimen type, collection, handling, storage, transport and conformity to the way the test was designed to be run. ID NOW is intended to be used near the patient with a direct swab test method.It is our responsibility to provide healthcare professionals and the public with accurate information, and that's why we're doing the following:Further clarifying our product information to provide better guidance to healthcare providers that negative results should be considered in the context of a patient's recent exposures, history and the presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Negative results should be presumed negative, but if inconsistent with clinical signs and symptoms or necessary for patient management, should be tested with an alternative molecular assay. We are also reinforcing proper sample collection and handling instructions. We are communicating this to our customers. Continuing to optimize this test as the world learns more about this virus. We're working to incorporate those learnings into the test as we do with all of our diagnostics tests"06:00SUMRX Overnight Summary -- World markets extend yesterday's rally; Oil and metals on the move higherThe global equity markets are generally higher with US futures extending gains into the overnight session.

The benchmark index was down as much as 1.9% in early action following a relatively disappointing weekly jobless claims report.The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite increased 0.9%. The Russell 2000 underperformed with a 0.4% gain.Total jobless claims for the week ending May 9 totaled 2.981 million (Briefing.com consensus 2.475 million) while continuing claims for the week ending May 2 totaled 22.833 million. The elevated figures raised doubts on a timely economic recovery, but the data might have prodded lawmakers to act more quickly for additional fiscal stimulus.Reports followed that the White House was interested in a bipartisan, fourth coronavirus relief bill (although not the $3 trillion bill proposed by House Democrats). The possibility for more stimulus, coupled with a view that the recent weakness in the market provided a good entry point, helped ignite a buy-the-dip mindset.The S&P 500 financials sector (+2.6%) set the rebound pace amid strength in the bank stocks, including Wells Fargo (WFC 24.06, +1.53, +6.8%) amid speculation that it could merge with Goldman Sachs (GS 174.45, +2.65, +1.5%). The consumer staples sector (-0.3%) was the only sector without a gain today.Sentiment might have also been boosted by an IEA report suggesting oil demand has been a little stronger than expected, The Wall Street Journal reporting that Taiwan Semi (TSM 52.10, +1.18, +2.3%) will announce plans to build an advanced chip factory in Arizona, and news that Connecticut overstated its weekly initial claims count by more than 200,000.The IEA report likely contributed to the 8.3% gain in WTI crude futures ($27.44/bbl, +2.10). Separately, Cisco (CSCO 43.85, +1.90, +4.5%) was an earnings standout after the company issued positive quarterly results and guidance.U.S. Treasuries finished mixed and little changed. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.63%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 100.31.Reviewing Thursday's economic data, which featured the weekly jobless claims report:Total jobless claims for the week ending May 9 were 2,981,000 (Briefing.com consensus 2.475 million). That was a decrease of 195,000 from the prior week, but still an exceedingly high number all things considered. Continuing claims for the week ending May 2 increased by 456,000 to 22.833 million, which is yet another record high.The key takeaway from the report is that the alarmingly high level of initial and continuing claims paints a risk of a slower recovery due to weaker consumer spending activity and the rising potential that temporary job losses become permanent job losses in an elongated recovery process.Import prices declined 2.6% in April, and prices, excluding oil, declined 0.5%. Export prices declined 3.3% in April, and prices, excluding agriculture, also declined 3.3%.Looking ahead, investors will receive a big batch of data on Friday: Retail Sales for April, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for May, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for April, Business Inventories for March, the JOLTS report for March, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for March.Nasdaq Composite -0.3% YTDS&P 500 -11.7% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -17.2% YTDRussell 2000 -25.8% YTD16:24NKE NIKE provides COVID-19 update; 100% of NIKE-owned stores now open across Greater China and South Korea (86.55 +0.53)As of today, 100% of NIKE-owned stores and over 95% of partner stores in Greater China and South Korea are open, with some still operating with reduced hours. In these markets, retail traffic trends are progressing, and while physical store traffic remains below prior year levels, this is largely offset by higher conversion rates and continued strong digital demand.Since mid-March, the vast majority of NIKE-owned and wholesale partner stores outside Greater China and South Korea have been completely closed. In light of store closures, product shipments to wholesale customers have slowed, resulting in significantly lower wholesale revenue and higher inventory. The company continues to expect this to have a material impact on its NIKE Direct and wholesale operations in North America, EMEA, and APLA in the fourth quarter.The company is seeing accelerated new member acquisition and strong digital demand across the global marketplace, with increased traffic and engagement on its mobile commerce and activity apps. It has increased its digital fulfillment capacity to meet higher demand.Store reopening has begun in over 15 countries including Germany, France, the Netherlands, Brazil, and the US. As of today, roughly 40% of NIKE-owned stores in EMEA, 15% in APLA, and 5% in North America are open, with some operating with reduced hours. Wholesale partners in these countries have also begun to re-open stores.16:20APD Air Products to invest $2 bln in coal-to-methanol project in Indonesia (225.62 -0.22)Air Products has signed a definitive agreement for a long-term on-site contract for a world-scale coal-to-methanol production facility in Bengalon, East Kalimantan, Indonesia.

The mall business in general and department stores, specifically, have been particularly hard hit. While our balance sheet was already strong, we took decisive, sometimes difficult, actions to preserve liquidity and ensure our long-term viability. As we re-open stores, we see positive things happening. We believe people are ready to get out and shop. We are hoping this is the start of better times."16:17GLOB Globant beats by $0.02, beats on revs; guides Q2 EPS above consensus, revs above consensus (111.96 +4.01)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.64 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.62; revenues rose 31.1% year/year to $191.57 mln vs the $189.23 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Preliminary results were stronger than 2019 first quarter results due to positive show rotation at GES, partially offset by the impact of COVID-19.Preliminary net loss attributable to Viad was $10.6 million, versus a loss of $17.8 million in the 2019 first quarter. Preliminary adjusted segment operating loss was $8.4 million, versus a loss of $11.0 million in the prior year quarter, and adjusted segment EBITDA was $6.9 million, up $4.7 million from the 2019 first quarter.Commentary: "Based on the very difficult, yet necessary actions we have taken to reduce costs and preserve cash, and as we continue to collect accounts receivable, we anticipate that our cash outflow during the second quarter will approximate $40 million. This leaves us ample liquidity to withstand the near-term impacts of COVID-19. Additionally, we are in productive discussions with our lender group for longer-term covenant relief, as we evaluate options to help ensure we have adequate liquidity for the future."16:15DENN Denny's beats by $0.07, reports revs in-line; Domestic system-wide same-store sales decreased -6.3% (8.77 +0.00)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.17 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.07 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.10; revenues fell 36.1% year/year to $96.7 mln vs the $96.83 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Domestic system-wide same-store sales decreased -6.3%.Domestic system-wide same-store sales have sequentially improved over the last few weeks of April, as compared to the equivalent weeks of 2019, from the low of -80% experienced in the final week of Q1, which ended on March 25.Average unit volumes of off-premise sales have more than doubled from February 2020 to April 2020, supported by temporarily waived delivery fees, new "Dine-Thru" curbside service programs, and recently launched shareable family meal packs.

Demers before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Dec. 12, 2018. "In many of the cases we see, China's strategy is the same: Rob, Replicate, and Replace. Rob the American company of its intellectual property, Replicate the technology, and Replace the American company in the Chinese market and, one day, in the global market," Demers said in his testimony."About 80 percent of all federal economic espionage prosecutions have conduct that would benefit China and around 60 percent of federal trade secret theft cases have some nexus to China," Huber said.Utah has experienced its own China-related espionage case, Huber told those participating in the webinar. Ron Rockwell Hansen, a Syracuse, Utah, resident and former Defense Intelligence Agency officer, was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison in September 2019 after admitting to spying and selling classified information to China.Huber concluded with key takeaways for those involved in the webinar, including identifying trade secrets and valuable intellectual property; instituting protections such as non-disclosure agreements, access controls, and need-to-know rules; employee training; and developing an internal employee reporting mechanism for suspicious activities."Utah companies should take affirmative steps to protect their hard-earned intellectual property and trade secrets," Huber said. "The Department of Justice will respond to the economic aggression and other national security threats from the Chinese government. United States Attorneys will hold accountable, and expose the tactics of those who would steal American innovation."Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7093867 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: April 23, 2020End of Document

Despite this fact and despite obligations under the International Health Regulations (IHR) the Communist Party of China (CCP) went to great lengths to obscure the nature and extent of the threat posed by this novel virus. According to credible independent sources, CCP authorities, including at the national level, ordered research labs to destroy virus samples, arrested and punished doctors who raised the alarm, disappeared multiple journalists, and silenced its citizens. There is evidence to suggest that the CCP delayed releasing the genome sequence. The Chinese government appears to have under-reported cases by failing to include asymptomatic infections in its official counts, misled the international community about transmissibility, and delayed WHO experts access to affected regions for weeks. This concerted effort ultimately contributed to the international spread of a contagion that has now sickened over 2.7 million people and claimed over 186,000 lives as of April 23, 2020.The United States and countries around the world depend upon the WHO as a source of reliable, independent, and scientifically-based information about public health challenges. While we recognize that the WHO itself is highly dependent upon the cooperation of its member states to provide such data, the organization does have both the authority and technical capacity to conduct independent analysis and utilize third-party data, particularly in cases where transparency is in doubt.Despite this authority, the WHO appears to have shown remarkable deference to the Chinese government throughout this pandemic. It took the Chinese government's false reporting at face value at the outset, overlooked obvious efforts by the CCP to silence parties with data that conflicted with the official line, advanced the CCP's false narrative about transmissibility, and praised the CCP's alleged commitment to transparency, long after evidence of the CCP's cover-up emerged.The United States is the single largest donor to the WHO. We strongly support the work of the WHO's front-line health workers in the field and do not want the review to impede their important efforts. We respect the agency's convening authority, and appreciate its work to enable countries around the globe to coalesce around shared global health challenges and best practices. Yet, the faith of the American people and the U.S. Congress in the WHO has been deeply shaken.To restore that faith, we believe it is critically important that an independent panel of experts conduct an immediate, interim assessment of the WHO's response to this pandemic. In particular, the expert panel should evaluate the WHO's interactions with the Chinese government at the outset of the outbreak, up to and following the WHO's acknowledgement of human-to-human transmission, the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and during and following the WHO mission that traveled to the PRC beginning on February 16, 2020. Through this analysis, we expect the panel to weigh both the diplomatic and structural challenges that may have negatively impacted the WHO's performance.In keeping with past practice, including the Interim Assessment Panel that was convened in 2015 to review the WHO's response to the Ebola epidemic that plagued West Africa between 2013 and 2016, it is important that this interim assessment be professional, independent, and unbiased. Similarly, we would also expect this panel to provide recommendations for immediate course corrections that would enhance the WHO's ability to help contain the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as any medium-to-long-term reforms necessary to enable the WHO to more effectively detect, deter, and respond to future infectious disease outbreaks with pandemic potential.Restoring confidence in the WHO as the premier United Nations global health agency committed to sound, scientifically-based global health principles and practices will require greater transparency, accountability, and reform. We want the best for the frontline WHO workers, and this means we need to know all of the facts. Given the unprecedented nature of this pandemic, getting this right is now more important than ever. We look forward to working with you to ensure that this is achieved before the next major global health crisis emerges, and more lives are lost.Load-Date: April 24, 2020End of Document

Baldwin discussed her bipartisan efforts to prevent federal funds from being used by transit agencies to purchase rail cars or buses manufactured by Chinese state-owned, controlled, or subsidized companies.In the hearing, Senator Baldwin said, "Wisconsin manufacturers are happy to compete with anyone in the world, but they need a level playing field. China's non-market economy forces Wisconsin manufacturers to compete with Chinese companies that get free land, free utilities, free RandD, and interest-free loans worth hundreds of millions of dollars."These Chinese government-subsidized rivals would be bad enough, but now these companies are increasingly using their U.S. assembly facilities to win taxpayer-funded contracts from the Federal Transit Administration to procure buses and railcars for American cities."When taxpayer dollars are spent, we must make every effort to ensure they support American workers and businesses."The full video of Senator Baldwin testifying at the Senate Banking Committee hearing is available here.Senators Baldwin and John Cornyn (R-TX), who also gave testimony today, secured an amendment in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 that was signed into law to halt federal transit funds from being used by transit agencies to procure Chinese railcars and buses and ensure transit agencies develop and execute a cybersecurity plan to protect American industries and national security. This amendment was based off the Senators' bipartisan Transit Infrastructure Vehicle Security Act that was introduced last March.Load-Date: March 5, 2020End of Document

Biosurveillance Market To Reach USD 5.62 Billion By 2027 | Reports and Data; The increasing occurrence rate of infectious diseases, the rising emphasis of governments of different nations on strengthening biodefense, and the COVID-19 pandemic are boosting the Biosurveillance market.GlobeNewswireMay 7, 2020 Thursday 2:00 PM PTCopyright 2020 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: FEATURE ARTICLE; HEALTH; MARKET RESEARCH REPORTS; PRESS RELEASES; RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTSLength: 1362 wordsBodyNew York, May  07, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Global Biosurveillance market is forecast to reach USD 5.62 Billion by 2027, according to a new report by Reports and Data. The recent H1N1 Influenza outbreak, SARS outbreak, and anthrax attacks in 2001 have made the government of various nations realize the importance of surveillance methods as an essential element of preparedness for bioterrorism. The resulted increasing investment in the sector is acting as a growth factor for the expansion of the market. After the terrorist attack and release of anthrax in 2001, in just the US, USD 32 Billion have been allocated to biosurveillance & biodefense. Technological advancements are also playing a pivotal role in the expansion of the sector. With the development of internet-based surveillance methods for vector-borne diseases (VBDs) surveillance have been developed with the help of "big data" sources like Twitter and Google, which are supporting the growth of the market.    The COVID-19 Impact: After a long period of the lockdown being implemented in various nations, a number of nations are partially or completely giving relaxation on the lockdown due to its negative impact on the economy of nations and major psychological impact on individuals. Apart from the impact on the economy, it is turning out to be one of the major reasons for depression. Considering the situation, various nations like Hong Kong, have started reopening institutions from mod-March. However, releasing the lockdown is also posing the risk of the second wave of the outbreak. In such a situation, biosurveillance is considered as a way of releasing the lockdown and managing the risk of the second wave of outbreak. It is with the help of the surveillance, and governments can ascertain that individuals who may have or have the virus remain isolated. To ascertain it, conditioning the behavior and monitoring of the entire population is essential, which can be done with the help of such surveillance that would result in fostering the growth of the market. It would be particularly observed in the first three quarters of 2020.Get FREE Sample Copy with TOC of the Report to understand the structure of the complete report@ https://www.reportsanddata.com/sample-enquiry-form/2991Further key findings from the report suggest• In regards to Type, the Syndromic Surveillance segment held a significance share of more than 40.0% the in 2019.

TikTok needs to win over Washington. Hiring a CEO from Disney won't be enoughCNN WireMay 21, 2020 Thursday 5:03 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1437 wordsDateline: HONG KONG (CNN Business) BodyHONG KONG (CNN Business) --  TikTok's hiring of Disney veteran Kevin Mayer was widely seen as a move --- at least in part --- to win over the growing number of US lawmakers who claim the popular short video platform is a threat to America's national security.But analysts say that poaching an executive from an iconic American company likely won't be enough to reassure Washington, especially as the coronavirus pandemic revives long-simmering US-China tensions.Rather than quell concerns that the app could aid Chinese spies, the news this week that Mayer will become the CEO of TikTok --- owned by Beijing-based startup Bytedance --- instead sparked a fresh round of calls for even tougher scrutiny. TikTok "previously told me they couldn't attend hearings and testify because executives were located in #China," Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri tweeted. "But this new executive lives in the USA. I look forward to hearing from him. Under oath."National security concernsByteDance was founded by Zhang Yiming, a 37-year-old tech entrepreneur and former Microsoft employee. People who have worked with Zhang describe him as someone who thinks deeply about technology and spends much of his free time writing code. The company's name refers to 0s and 1s dancing together to form a byte, the binary code used by computers.Hawley and other lawmakers have called TikTok a threat to national security because of its ties to China, and have claimed that the company could be compelled to "support and cooperate with intelligence work controlled by the Chinese Communist Party." TikTok has said that it operates separately from ByteDance. It says its data centers are located entirely outside of China, and that none of that data is subject to Chinese law. US user data is stored in the United States, with a backup in Singapore, according to TikTok."While we think the [national security] concerns are unfounded, we understand them and are continuing to further strengthen our safeguards while increasing our dialogue with lawmakers," a TikTok spokesperson told CNN Business. The company also says it has formed a "Transparency Center" in Los Angeles, which will allow third party experts to look into TikTok's source code, along with the company's work on data privacy, security and content moderation.In addition to his role at TikTok, Mayer will also serve as chief operating officer of ByteDance. He "will be charged with driving the global development of ByteDance, as well as overseeing corporate functions including corporate development, sales, marketing, public affairs, security, moderation, and legal," the company said in a press release on Tuesday.But if ByteDance was hoping Mayer could smooth things over with Hawley and his colleagues, experts say the company will be disappointed. "TikTok will always be considered a threat, no matter who is at the helm, because of what it represents: the emergence of Chinese tech-ecosystems," said Abishur Prakash, co-founder of Center for Innovating the Future, a consulting firm that works on technology and geopolitics. Until now, American companies have dominated when it comes to cloud computing, social media and artificial intelligence, said Prakash. "Now, Chinese firms, like TikTok, are creating their own alternatives, building a new kind of geopolitical footprint for China," he said. An explosion of popularity, followed by controversyTikTok has exploded in popularity in the United States and other western countries, becoming the first Chinese social media platform to gain traction with users outside of its home country. It was downloaded 315 million times in the first three months of this year, more quarterly downloads than any other app in history, according to analytics company Sensor Tower. TikTok is an endless scroll of short videos. Many of them feature users showing off their best dance moves --- or most cringe-worthy ones --- to 15-second snippets of music. Big US brands such as the NBA, Ralph Lauren, and Chipotle have sponsored dance challenges or cartoon filters on the app. And it's beginning to grow beyond its teenage base and attract Instagram influencers.It hardly seems like the kind of content that would alarm US lawmakers. But social media platforms such as TikTok, Facebook and Twitter are always under scrutiny, said Jeffrey Towson, a private equity investor and former professor of investment at Peking University."The business they're in has become politically and culturally sensitive. Forever," he said. In the United States, TikTok has been accused by users and lawmakers of censoring content related to mass protests that caused havoc in Hong Kong for most of last year. It also ran into controversy after a US teenager claimed TikTok suspended her account --- an accusation the company denied --- when she posted a video criticizing the Chinese government and its detention centers, which hold mostly Muslim Uyghurs in the region of Xinjiang. The US military last year banned the use of TikTok by its soldiers, calling it a security threat. Military employees were ordered to uninstall TikTok "to circumvent any exposure of personal information."TikTok has repeatedly said that it does not moderate content due to political sensitivities. In addition to storing data outside of China, the company has also said that it has a "dedicated technical team focused on adhering to robust cybersecurity policies, and data privacy and security practices."The suspicion from US lawmakers, though, could be damaging for TikTok. Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, for example, has called on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, to review TikTok's acquisition of rival app Musical.ly --- a deal that helped add millions of users to its platform.Such an investigation could be a blow to TikTok, because CFIUS has the authority to retroactively review foreign acquisitions of US businesses and force a company to divest its interests. That has happened before. Last year, Chinese company Beijing Kunlun Tech was forced to sell its majority stake in dating app Grindr after a CFIUS review. A US company acquired the app in March. Distancing itself from ChinaTikTok has been trying to separate itself from China and its Beijing-based parent company. Its main office is in Los Angeles County, and it has offices in London, Paris, Berlin, Dubai, Mumbai, Singapore, Jakarta, Seoul and Tokyo. TikTok is also not available in China, although another Bytedance app --- Douyin --- is similar and they share the same logo and branding. A TikTok spokesperson told CNN in an interview earlier this year that it is managed separately from other ByteDance apps, and owned by an entity outside of China. The homepage of ByteDance's website includes a graph illustrating the company's corporate structure. It shows several businesses falling under larger entities listed in the Cayman Islands, the United States and Hong Kong. Towson called TikTok's use of legal structures to distance itself from mainland China and its parent company "nonsense." Tech founders and CEOs are responsible for their companies, much like when Facebook or any of its apps are criticized by officials, Mark Zuckerberg often comes under scrutiny, said Towson. Likewise with Zhang, the founder and CEO of ByteDance. "He owns it, full stop. Legalese is not going to change that," said Towson. A tense political climateThe other problem for TikTok is the current political climate: US-China relations are reaching new lows. Washington last week pushed for a new crackdown on telecom equipment and smartphone maker Huawei by moving to further restrict its ability to work with US companies. The Global Times, a combative state-run media tabloid in China, hinted that Beijing could soon retaliate with a long-rumored blacklist of foreign companies.And President Donald Trump ---- who has claimed, without providing evidence, that the coronavirus originated in a laboratory in Wuhan, China --- could hit the country with more tariffs as punishment for the pandemic.Against that backdrop, hiring Mayer or any other American wouldn't be enough, according to Prakash. "Hiring a local is part of an age old playbook. And, while it might have worked in the past, it won't for TikTok," he said. Because technology is driving geopolitics, Prakash added, the United States will be eyeing Chinese technology firms with increasing scrutiny."Who is in the leadership position won't change the fact that TikTok is going to be in the crosshairs of the US government," he said. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000, however, is up 1.1%.Prior to the open, Reuters reported that the Trump administration was moving to block semiconductor shipments to China's Huawei Technologies, which raised the specter of possible Chinese retaliation on American companies. Shortly thereafter, the Retail Sales report for April showed a record 16.4% m/m decline in total retail sales (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%).The market has been more cognizant of reported tensions, as opposed to the weak data due to a view that the data can't get any worse with reopening efforts underway. Semiconductor companies are among today's weakest performers following the moves in Washington, evidenced by the 2.9% decline in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.Many of these companies, including Applied Materials (AMAT 51.51, -2.92, -5.4%) following its earnings report, have weighed on the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.7%). The utilities (-2.8%) and real estate (-2.0%) sectors are down the most, though.On the other hand, the energy sector (+0.6%) is following the positive move in oil prices ($29.16, +1.28, +4.6%), and the materials (+0.6%) and consumer staples (+0.3%) sectors also show relative strength.DraftKings (DKNG 28.84, +3.56, +14.0%) is an earnings standout, with shares rising 14% after the company topped EPS estimates and said it doesn't expect COVID-19 to impact its sports betting business long-term.Treasury prices have declined since the opening bell, bringing yields off early lows. The 10-yr yield is currently up one basis point to 0.64% after slipping below 0.60% at its low. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 100.40.Reviewing today's economic data:Total retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) while retail sales, excluding autos, declined 17.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment.Industrial production declined 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%), which was the largest monthly drop in the 101-year history of the index. The capacity utilization rate fell from 73.2% to 64.9% (Briefing.com consensus 64.0%), which is 14.9 percentage points below its long-run average and a record-low in a series that dates back to 1967.The key takeaway from the report is that it is a reflection of how industrial production cratered amid shutdown orders designed to contain the spread of COVID-19. On a yr/yr basis, industrial production was down 15.0%.The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 73.7 in the preliminary reading for May (Briefing.com consensus 67.4) from 71.8 in April.The key takeaway from the report is that attitudes about current conditions improved while sentiment surrounding the outlook continued to deteriorate, pinched by concerns about financial prospects that were most notable among upper income households. That is apt to be a headwind for a pickup in consumer spending.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for May checked in at -48.5 (Briefing.com consensus -58.0) following the prior month's reading of -78.2.March job openings decreased to 6.191 mln from a revised 7.004 mln in February (from 6.882 mln). Business inventories decreased 0.2% in March, while the February reading was revised down to -0.5% from -0.4%.12:34GLYC GlycoMimetics announces presentation of preclinical research on uproleselan and GMI-1359 at Virtual AACR Annual Meeting (3.14 +0.25)During the June session, GlycoMimetics will present preclinical data that further support the potential of the company's compounds to be used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as well as in the setting of stem cell transplantation. Additionally, new information will be presented on the ability of transcriptome profiling to identify those tumor types most likely to benefit from targeted E-selectin inhibition, a key mechanism of GlycoMimetics drug candidates, supporting their potential uses in a biomarker-driven approach.Of note, among other findings, data will be presented demonstrating that lethality of the FLT-3 mutation is specifically dependent upon high levels of E-selectin ligand expressed on the surface of AML blasts.Meeting abstracts are available at AACR's website.12:31SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (55.33 mln +65.66%)Materials: VALE (19.06 mln +1.58%)Industrials: GE (52.95 mln -2.72%), DAL (27.42 mln -0.72%), UAL (23.75 mln -0.47%), AAL (22.51 mln -0.33%)Consumer Discretionary: JCP (161.8 mln +26.73%), F (42.9 mln -0.82%), NCLH (26.29 mln +1.48%), JD (23.65 mln +0.94%), CCL (22.72 mln +3.26%)Information Technology: AMD (34.93 mln -1.82%), AAPL (20.37 mln -1.76%)Financials: SQQQ (32.46 mln +2.36%), QQQ (28.87 mln -0.77%), BAC (28.77 mln -1.54%), WFC (24.88 mln -2.74%), TQQQ (21.5 mln -2.3%)Energy: MRO (17.81 mln +1.06%), CPE (16.64 mln +3.59%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: ACB (18.88x +65.66%), PETQ (3.72x +3.01%), ALLO (2.3x +6.84%), TGTX (1.74x -3.04%)Materials: CRH (2.42x -0.8%), MAG (1.65x +10.98%), AG (1.6x +9.75%)Industrials: GTES (2.08x +1.52%)Consumer Discretionary: JCP (5.71x +26.73%), DDS (1.61x +7.97%), JD (1.53x +0.94%)Information Technology: VECO (3.46x +7.61%), NEWR (2.95x +11.26%), LITE (1.82x -8.69%), ACIA (1.69x -1.59%), WIX (1.61x +6.04%)Financials: EFT (2.12x -0.65%), CASH (1.55x +8.12%)Energy: CRK (3.48x +8.33%), GPRK (2.08x +17.51%)12:29SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: ACB (11 +65.66%), NVAX (42.74 +11.59%), RCUS (35.11 +10.44%)Materials: FSM (3.95 +17.41%), CDE (4.94 +13.97%), MAG (12.74 +10.98%), SSRM (20.79 +10.94%), HL (2.93 +10.8%), PAAS (24.15 +9.92%)Consumer Discretionary: JCP (0.25 +26.73%), HZO (15.92 +12.59%), ELY (12.89 +12.09%), SFIX (21.46 +10.39%), DENN (9.68 +10.38%)Information Technology: NEWR (64.84 +11.26%)Financials: TRUP (28.61 +10.55%)Energy: CHK (10.59 +21.53%), GPRK (7.92 +17.51%), CRC (1.41 +12.21%), DNR (0.26 +10.7%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VREX (17.36 -6.77%)Industrials: AFI (2.3 -8.93%)Consumer Discretionary: FTCH (13.68 -13.94%), BBX (1.49 -8.33%), GOOS (19.15 -7.49%), TLRD (0.92 -7.03%), GTX (4.63 -6.65%)Information Technology: IIVI (38.19 -11.77%), HOLI (12.48 -11.36%), SYNA (58.03 -9.91%), LITE (66.83 -8.69%)Financials: ONDK (0.62 -6.72%)Energy: GPOR (1.65 -8.47%), DO (0.22 -7.95%), GLNG (5.54 -7.6%), MDR (0.04 -6.61%)Utilities: JE (0.38 -7.08%)11:59SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (21) outpacing new lows (6) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ALLO, BAND, DOCU, ETSY, FVRR, HUM, IMMU, MKC, MYOK, NEM, OKTA, RGEN, SAM, SHOP, SMG, SRNE, TEAM, TYL, WBC, WIX, WST,Stocks that traded to 52 week lows: AMTB, CNA, EAF, FOSL, RESI, SNCR, WSRETFs that traded to 52 week highs: GDX, IAU, SIL11:55SUMRX Economic summary:Economic Data Summary:May Empire State Manufacturing -48.5 vs Briefing.com consensus of -58.0; prior was -78.2 Apr Retail Sales -16.4% vs Briefing.com consensus of -11.9%; prior was revised to -8.3% from -8.7%The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment.Apr Retail Sales ex-auto -17.2% vs Briefing.com consensus of -8.2%; prior was revised to -4.5% from -4.5% Apr Industrial Production -11.2% vs Briefing.com consensus of -12.1%; prior was revised to 73.2% from -5.4%The key takeaway from the report is that it is a reflection of how industrial production cratered amid shutdown orders designed to contain the spread of COVID-19.

The sector is down 2.3% for the week versus a 3.6% week-to-date loss in the S&P 500 (-1.0%).More than half of the sector's components trade in the green, which explains the group's outperformance relative to the broader market. Manufacturers of packaged foods and cleaning products are in the lead, reflecting a belief that their products will remain in high demand.Notable movers:McCormick (MKC 178.96, +3.44, +2.0%): leading sector component, rising to a fresh record high. Estee Lauder (EL 166.06, +1.87, +1.1%): reclaiming its 50-day moving average (165.22). Kellogg (K 64.47, +0.82, +1.3%): inching back above its 200-day moving average (64.39) after spending the past month near that level. Clorox (CLX 208.33, +2.12, +1.0%): continuing its push toward record high from March (214.26). Colgate-Palmolive (CL 67.75, +0.69, +1.0%): bouncing off a six-week low. Kimberly-Clark (KMB 137.10, +0.51, +0.4%): remaining near its 200-day moving average (136.95), which has been an area of congestion over the past month. Lamb Weston (LW 52.88, -1.64, -3.0%): weakest performer in the sector, approaching yesterday's low.11:05SRNE Sorrento Therapeutics confirms that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody STI-1499 demonstrated ability to inhibit in vitro virus infection in preclinical studies (4.58 +1.97)Sorrento Therapeutics announced today that its anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody, STI-1499, demonstrated 100% inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in an in vitro virus infection experiment at a very low antibody concentration.As recently announced, Sorrento aims to generate an antibody cocktail product that would act as a "protective shield" against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection and remain effective even if virus mutations render a single antibody therapy less effective over time.Sorrento has so far identified hundreds of antibody candidates that bind the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Approx. one dozen of these antibodies have demonstrated the ability to block the S1 protein's interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor used for viral entrance into human cells. These blocking antibodies were further tested for their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in an in vitro SARS-CoV-2 virus infection model pursuant to a preclinical testing agreement for COVID-19 therapeutic candidates that was previously announced on March 31.One antibody stood out for its ability to completely block SARS-CoV-2 infection of healthy cells in the experiments. STI-1499 completely neutralized the virus infectivity at a very low antibody dose, making it a prime candidate for further testing and development. Initial biochemical and biophysical analyses also indicate STI-1499 is a potentially strong antibody drug candidate.Sorrento has determined STI-1499 will likely be the first antibody in the antibody cocktail (COVI-SHIELD) it is developing. STI-1499 is also expected to be developed as a stand-alone therapy (COVI-GUARD) because of the high potency it has exhibited in experiments to date. Sorrento plans to request priority evaluation and accelerated review from regulators to determine the best pathway to make any potential treatment available as soon as possible. Sorrento's manufacturing facility in San Diego is expected to be able to produce up to two hundred thousand doses per month, and the company intends to produce a million doses at risk while seeking FDA approval for any STI-1499 product candidate. The company is seeking potential government support and pharmaceutical partners to further scale up STI-1499 manufacturing capacity with a goal of potentially providing tens of millions of doses in a short period of time to meet the vast projected demand.11:04TALKX Market Briefing: U.S.-China tension creates some unease and uneven tradingThe stock market is sagging as it confronts another batch of terrible economic data and reports about rising tension between the U.S. and China.Briefly, in April, retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m while industrial production declined a record 11.2%. Consumer sentiment actually improved some in May to 73.7 (from 71.8), yet that belies the fact that attitudes about the outlook actually deteriorated (to 67.7 from 70.1).There is a lot of headline noise surrounding U.S-China relations. The U.S. is moving to block shipments of semiconductors to Huawei and China is said to be entertaining countermeasures, which include restricting or investigating U.S. companies doing business there, if the U.S. follows through.The latter concern has been tempered somewhat by Chinese state media noting China hopes it can meet the U.S. "half way" in trade dealings. Separately, NEC Director Kudlow has denied that the U.S.-China trade deal is falling apart.The uncertain sense of where those relations actually stand has contributed to some uneven trading activity and a modest downward bias for the broader market.A weak showing from the information technology sector (-1.7%), which is feeling the brunt of the angst involving China, is the main drag on the broader market. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is down 3.8%. Other laggards of note include the utilities (-2.3%), real estate (-1.6%), and financial (-1.0%) sectors.Generally speaking, small-cap stocks are faring well, evidenced by the relative strength of the Russell 2000, which is drawing added support from many of its energy sector components. The latter are following crude prices higher ($28.75, +1.19, +4.3%).The Russell 2000 is up 0.7%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 are down 0.9%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.1%.10:18JCP J. C. Penney discloses making $17 mln interest payment with respect to term loan facility; continues to evaluate strategic alternatives (remains halted) (0.19 +0.00)On May 14, J. C. Penney made the approx. $17 mln interest payment that was due and payable on May 7 with respect to JCP's senior secured term loan credit facility. Under the credit and guaranty agreement governing the term loan facility, the company had a grace period of five business days to make the interest payment before such non-payment would constitute an "event of default" thereunder. The company had entered into such grace period in order to evaluate certain strategic alternatives, none of which have been implemented at this time and which continue to be considered.10:14OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:LRCX Weekly May29 280 calls are seeing interest following increased China/Huawei tensions with US with 2330 contracts trading vs. open int of 11, pushing implied vol up around 10 points to ~64%.

The high-beta group bounced off its 200-day moving average on Thursday, but it finds itself right back at that level today.The SOX index has widened this week's loss to 4.5% versus a 3.0% week-to-date loss in the S&P 500 (-0.4%). Today's weakness is being driven by selling in 29 out of 30 components after the Trump administration extended the ban on sales of chips based on American technology to Huawei for another year.On a side note, the world's largest contract chip foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM 50.85, -1.25, -2.4%), has agreed to build an advanced fabrication facility in Arizona, which will enable high-volume domestic production of processors and microcontrollers.Notable movers:Lam Research (LRCX 254.34, -14.66, -5.5%): weakest performer, falling back below its 200-day moving average (260.63). KLA Corp (KLAC 167.90, -8.00, -4.6%): falling from its best level since mid-February. Teradyne (TER 58.78, -2.62, -4.3%): trying to stay above its 50-day moving average (57.85). Applied Materials (AMAT 52.55, -1.88, -3.5%): falling back below its 200-day moving average (54.04) after finishing above that level yesterday. Company reported in-line Q2 results yesterday evening.

These studies provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence of the preclinical safety, improved functional characteristics and enhanced anti-tumor efficacy of ATA2271.09:41WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stocks extend weekly losses at openThe major indices start the session extending weekly losses amid increased tensions with China and more weak economic data. The S&P 500 is down 0.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors trade in negative territory, led lower by the financials (-1.2%), real estate (-1.8%), and utilities (-2.0%) sectors. The energy sector has recently turned positive with a 0.5% gain.U.S. Treasuries trade mixed. The 2-yr yield is flat at 0.14%, and the 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 0.60%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.3% to 100.12. WTI crude is up 2.8% to $28.66/bbl.09:41ATRA Atara Biotherapeutics presents an abstract describing the preclinical safety, improved functional characteristics and antitumor efficacy of ATA2271 (9.60 +0.02)Data being presented for the first time at AACR detail results from IND-enabling preclinical studies with ATA2271 technologies, designed to help overcome current CAR T challenges with targeting solid tumors, including the novel 1XX CAR signaling domain and a dominant-negative programmed death-1 receptor (PD1DNR). These studies, led by Prasad Adusumilli, MD and collaborators at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence of the preclinical safety, improved functional characteristics and enhanced anti-tumor efficacy of ATA2271. Specifically, in vitro, ATA2271 exhibited antigen-specific cytotoxicity, accumulation and effector cytokine secretion, while in vivo results demonstrated that a single dose of ATA2271 led to tumor eradication and superior survival in mice compared to mesothelin-targeted M28z CAR T cells. Mice treated with a single dose of ATA2271 also showed sustained and persistent protection from tumor reestablishment upon 10 additional tumor re-challenges. Results from the study demonstrated the proposed advantages associated with functional persistence and cell-intrinsic PD-1 checkpoint blockade.09:22EDIT Editas Medicine presents data from pre-clinical study supporting use of CRISPR-Cas12a for the development of engineered cell immunotherapies (55.88 )Editas Medicine announced results from a pre-clinical study evaluating multi-gene knockout and transgene knock-in using its proprietary engineered CRISPR-Cas12a (EngCas12a) in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for the development of engineered cell immunotherapy medicines. The results of this study further reinforce Editas Medicine's belief in the transformative potential of iPSC-derived natural killer (iNK) cells as off-the-shelf engineered cell medicines for the treatment of solid tumor cancers.In this study, CRISPR-Cas12a was used to make highly edited iPSC clones. The iPSCs were then differentiated into functional iNK cells. The iNKs derived from the edited iPSC clones had enhanced tumor killing activity relative to iNKs from unedited iPSCs, demonstrating the utility of an edited iPSC platform. The company reported these data today in an oral presentation at the 23rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy, being held virtually.09:17ECONX April Capacity Utilization 64.9% vs 64.0% Briefing.com consensus09:16WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: -27.80. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -135.00.Futures point to sharp losses at the open, as tensions with China appear to escalate and data showed a weaker-than-expected retail sales report. The S&P 500 futures trade 28 points, or 1.0%, below fair value.The Trump administration is reportedly looking to block semiconductor shipments to Huawei, which hasn't sat well with China for obvious reasons. The editor for China's Global Times tweeted that possible retaliation on American companies could result if such an action is taken.Regarding the retail sales report, total sales plunged 16.4% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%). The market, though, has been under impression that economic activity will bounce back with reopening efforts. The headline figure sure is awful, though.09:11WIRES On The WiresTCR2 Therapeutics (TCRR) will present an e-poster at the AACR Virtual Annual Meeting II highlighting preclinical data of the company's proprietary T Cell Receptor Fusion Construct (TRuC) T cells that co-express a PD-1:CD28 switch receptor, which acts as a cell-intrinsic mechanism to overcome PD-L1/PD-L2 mediated immunosuppression. Upon repeated antigen stimulation, co-expression of the switch receptor in mesothelin-targeting TC-210 T cells enhanced TCR downstream signaling, prevented PD-L1-mediatied functional T-cell inhibition, significantly increased proliferation, and augmented the production of growth and effector cytokines. As the first major sport to return following coronavirus shutdowns, NASCAR is expanding its partnership with Clean Harbors (CLH) for infectious disease prevention and decontamination needs.

PTI-125 significantly reduced a secondary endpoint, CSF levels of IL1-beta (p<0.035), a core biomarker of neuroinflammation, from baseline to Day 28. Drug was safe and well-tolerated.A post-hoc analysis of biomarker data revealed high variability in levels of CSF biomarkers over 28 days. For example, placebo-treated patients recorded changes in levels of CSF tau and p-tau ranging from -54% to +34% and -49% to +253%, respectively, from baseline to Day 28. Biomarker analysis was conducted by outside labs.The drug effects of PTI-125, if any, may have been masked in this study by high variability in levels of biomarkers of disease. In the months ahead the Company plans to re-analyze CSF biomarkers from all study participants.Phase 2b was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of PTI-125 in 64 patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, 50-85 years of age, with MMSE 16 to 26.

The benchmark index was down as much as 1.9% in early action following a relatively disappointing weekly jobless claims report.The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite increased 0.9%. The Russell 2000 underperformed with a 0.4% gain.Total jobless claims for the week ending May 9 totaled 2.981 million (Briefing.com consensus 2.475 million) while continuing claims for the week ending May 2 totaled 22.833 million. The elevated figures raised doubts on a timely economic recovery, but the data might have prodded lawmakers to act more quickly for additional fiscal stimulus.Reports followed that the White House was interested in a bipartisan, fourth coronavirus relief bill (although not the $3 trillion bill proposed by House Democrats). The possibility for more stimulus, coupled with a view that the recent weakness in the market provided a good entry point, helped ignite a buy-the-dip mindset.The S&P 500 financials sector (+2.6%) set the rebound pace amid strength in the bank stocks, including Wells Fargo (WFC 24.06, +1.53, +6.8%) amid speculation that it could merge with Goldman Sachs (GS 174.45, +2.65, +1.5%). The consumer staples sector (-0.3%) was the only sector without a gain today.Sentiment might have also been boosted by an IEA report suggesting oil demand has been a little stronger than expected, The Wall Street Journal reporting that Taiwan Semi (TSM 52.10, +1.18, +2.3%) will announce plans to build an advanced chip factory in Arizona, and news that Connecticut overstated its weekly initial claims count by more than 200,000.The IEA report likely contributed to the 8.3% gain in WTI crude futures ($27.44/bbl, +2.10). Separately, Cisco (CSCO 43.85, +1.90, +4.5%) was an earnings standout after the company issued positive quarterly results and guidance.U.S. Treasuries finished mixed and little changed. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.63%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 100.31.Reviewing Thursday's economic data, which featured the weekly jobless claims report:Total jobless claims for the week ending May 9 were 2,981,000 (Briefing.com consensus 2.475 million). That was a decrease of 195,000 from the prior week, but still an exceedingly high number all things considered. Continuing claims for the week ending May 2 increased by 456,000 to 22.833 million, which is yet another record high.The key takeaway from the report is that the alarmingly high level of initial and continuing claims paints a risk of a slower recovery due to weaker consumer spending activity and the rising potential that temporary job losses become permanent job losses in an elongated recovery process.Import prices declined 2.6% in April, and prices, excluding oil, declined 0.5%. Export prices declined 3.3% in April, and prices, excluding agriculture, also declined 3.3%.Looking ahead, investors will receive a big batch of data on Friday: Retail Sales for April, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for May, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for April, Business Inventories for March, the JOLTS report for March, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for March.Nasdaq Composite -0.3% YTDS&P 500 -11.7% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -17.2% YTDRussell 2000 -25.8% YTD16:24NKE NIKE provides COVID-19 update; 100% of NIKE-owned stores now open across Greater China and South Korea (86.55 +0.53)As of today, 100% of NIKE-owned stores and over 95% of partner stores in Greater China and South Korea are open, with some still operating with reduced hours. In these markets, retail traffic trends are progressing, and while physical store traffic remains below prior year levels, this is largely offset by higher conversion rates and continued strong digital demand.Since mid-March, the vast majority of NIKE-owned and wholesale partner stores outside Greater China and South Korea have been completely closed. In light of store closures, product shipments to wholesale customers have slowed, resulting in significantly lower wholesale revenue and higher inventory. The company continues to expect this to have a material impact on its NIKE Direct and wholesale operations in North America, EMEA, and APLA in the fourth quarter.The company is seeing accelerated new member acquisition and strong digital demand across the global marketplace, with increased traffic and engagement on its mobile commerce and activity apps. It has increased its digital fulfillment capacity to meet higher demand.Store reopening has begun in over 15 countries including Germany, France, the Netherlands, Brazil, and the US. As of today, roughly 40% of NIKE-owned stores in EMEA, 15% in APLA, and 5% in North America are open, with some operating with reduced hours.

This leaves us ample liquidity to withstand the near-term impacts of COVID-19. Additionally, we are in productive discussions with our lender group for longer-term covenant relief, as we evaluate options to help ensure we have adequate liquidity for the future."16:15DENN Denny's beats by $0.07, reports revs in-line; Domestic system-wide same-store sales decreased -6.3% (8.77 +0.00)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.17 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.07 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.10; revenues fell 36.1% year/year to $96.7 mln vs the $96.83 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Domestic system-wide same-store sales decreased -6.3%.Domestic system-wide same-store sales have sequentially improved over the last few weeks of April, as compared to the equivalent weeks of 2019, from the low of -80% experienced in the final week of Q1, which ended on March 25.Average unit volumes of off-premise sales have more than doubled from February 2020 to April 2020, supported by temporarily waived delivery fees, new "Dine-Thru" curbside service programs, and recently launched shareable family meal packs.

Co expects to develop STI-1499 as a stand-alone therapy on account of the "high potency it has exhibited in experiments to date."

BCEL (19.32 +16.91%): Reported Q1 results and recent business updates; co noted that patients continue to be enrolled and treated in its Phase 1b dose-escalation trial of ATRC-101 in multiple solid tumors, and it noted that it is working closely with its alliance partners to advance R&D as quickly as possible to help address the COVID-19 pandemic.

VVI (14.65 -11.96%): Issued upside preliminary results for Q1, seeing revs up +7.1% yr/yr to $306.0 mln due to a positive show rotation of approx. $57 mln at GES, partially offset by show postponements and cancellations due to COVID-19.

The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000, however, is up 1.1%.Prior to the open, Reuters reported that the Trump administration was moving to block semiconductor shipments to China's Huawei Technologies, which raised the specter of possible Chinese retaliation on American companies. Shortly thereafter, the Retail Sales report for April showed a record 16.4% m/m decline in total retail sales (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%).The market has been more cognizant of reported tensions, as opposed to the weak data due to a view that the data can't get any worse with reopening efforts underway. Semiconductor companies are among today's weakest performers following the moves in Washington, evidenced by the 2.9% decline in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.Many of these companies, including Applied Materials (AMAT 51.51, -2.92, -5.4%) following its earnings report, have weighed on the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.7%). The utilities (-2.8%) and real estate (-2.0%) sectors are down the most, though.On the other hand, the energy sector (+0.6%) is following the positive move in oil prices ($29.16, +1.28, +4.6%), and the materials (+0.6%) and consumer staples (+0.3%) sectors also show relative strength.DraftKings (DKNG 28.84, +3.56, +14.0%) is an earnings standout, with shares rising 14% after the company topped EPS estimates and said it doesn't expect COVID-19 to impact its sports betting business long-term.Treasury prices have declined since the opening bell, bringing yields off early lows. The 10-yr yield is currently up one basis point to 0.64% after slipping below 0.60% at its low. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 100.40.Reviewing today's economic data:Total retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) while retail sales, excluding autos, declined 17.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment.Industrial production declined 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%), which was the largest monthly drop in the 101-year history of the index. The capacity utilization rate fell from 73.2% to 64.9% (Briefing.com consensus 64.0%), which is 14.9 percentage points below its long-run average and a record-low in a series that dates back to 1967.The key takeaway from the report is that it is a reflection of how industrial production cratered amid shutdown orders designed to contain the spread of COVID-19. On a yr/yr basis, industrial production was down 15.0%.The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 73.7 in the preliminary reading for May (Briefing.com consensus 67.4) from 71.8 in April.The key takeaway from the report is that attitudes about current conditions improved while sentiment surrounding the outlook continued to deteriorate, pinched by concerns about financial prospects that were most notable among upper income households. That is apt to be a headwind for a pickup in consumer spending.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for May checked in at -48.5 (Briefing.com consensus -58.0) following the prior month's reading of -78.2.March job openings decreased to 6.191 mln from a revised 7.004 mln in February (from 6.882 mln). Business inventories decreased 0.2% in March, while the February reading was revised down to -0.5% from -0.4%.12:34GLYC GlycoMimetics announces presentation of preclinical research on uproleselan and GMI-1359 at Virtual AACR Annual Meeting (3.14 +0.25)During the June session, GlycoMimetics will present preclinical data that further support the potential of the company's compounds to be used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as well as in the setting of stem cell transplantation. Additionally, new information will be presented on the ability of transcriptome profiling to identify those tumor types most likely to benefit from targeted E-selectin inhibition, a key mechanism of GlycoMimetics drug candidates, supporting their potential uses in a biomarker-driven approach.Of note, among other findings, data will be presented demonstrating that lethality of the FLT-3 mutation is specifically dependent upon high levels of E-selectin ligand expressed on the surface of AML blasts.Meeting abstracts are available at AACR's website.12:31SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (55.33 mln +65.66%)Materials: VALE (19.06 mln +1.58%)Industrials: GE (52.95 mln -2.72%), DAL (27.42 mln -0.72%), UAL (23.75 mln -0.47%), AAL (22.51 mln -0.33%)Consumer Discretionary: JCP (161.8 mln +26.73%), F (42.9 mln -0.82%), NCLH (26.29 mln +1.48%), JD (23.65 mln +0.94%), CCL (22.72 mln +3.26%)Information Technology: AMD (34.93 mln -1.82%), AAPL (20.37 mln -1.76%)Financials: SQQQ (32.46 mln +2.36%), QQQ (28.87 mln -0.77%), BAC (28.77 mln -1.54%), WFC (24.88 mln -2.74%), TQQQ (21.5 mln -2.3%)Energy: MRO (17.81 mln +1.06%), CPE (16.64 mln +3.59%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: ACB (18.88x +65.66%), PETQ (3.72x +3.01%), ALLO (2.3x +6.84%), TGTX (1.74x -3.04%)Materials: CRH (2.42x -0.8%), MAG (1.65x +10.98%), AG (1.6x +9.75%)Industrials: GTES (2.08x +1.52%)Consumer Discretionary: JCP (5.71x +26.73%), DDS (1.61x +7.97%), JD (1.53x +0.94%)Information Technology: VECO (3.46x +7.61%), NEWR (2.95x +11.26%), LITE (1.82x -8.69%), ACIA (1.69x -1.59%), WIX (1.61x +6.04%)Financials: EFT (2.12x -0.65%), CASH (1.55x +8.12%)Energy: CRK (3.48x +8.33%), GPRK (2.08x +17.51%)12:29SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: ACB (11 +65.66%), NVAX (42.74 +11.59%), RCUS (35.11 +10.44%)Materials: FSM (3.95 +17.41%), CDE (4.94 +13.97%), MAG (12.74 +10.98%), SSRM (20.79 +10.94%), HL (2.93 +10.8%), PAAS (24.15 +9.92%)Consumer Discretionary: JCP (0.25 +26.73%), HZO (15.92 +12.59%), ELY (12.89 +12.09%), SFIX (21.46 +10.39%), DENN (9.68 +10.38%)Information Technology: NEWR (64.84 +11.26%)Financials: TRUP (28.61 +10.55%)Energy: CHK (10.59 +21.53%), GPRK (7.92 +17.51%), CRC (1.41 +12.21%), DNR (0.26 +10.7%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VREX (17.36 -6.77%)Industrials: AFI (2.3 -8.93%)Consumer Discretionary: FTCH (13.68 -13.94%), BBX (1.49 -8.33%), GOOS (19.15 -7.49%), TLRD (0.92 -7.03%), GTX (4.63 -6.65%)Information Technology: IIVI (38.19 -11.77%), HOLI (12.48 -11.36%), SYNA (58.03 -9.91%), LITE (66.83 -8.69%)Financials: ONDK (0.62 -6.72%)Energy: GPOR (1.65 -8.47%), DO (0.22 -7.95%), GLNG (5.54 -7.6%), MDR (0.04 -6.61%)Utilities: JE (0.38 -7.08%)11:59SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (21) outpacing new lows (6) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: ALLO, BAND, DOCU, ETSY, FVRR, HUM, IMMU, MKC, MYOK, NEM, OKTA, RGEN, SAM, SHOP, SMG, SRNE, TEAM, TYL, WBC, WIX, WST,Stocks that traded to 52 week lows: AMTB, CNA, EAF, FOSL, RESI, SNCR, WSRETFs that traded to 52 week highs: GDX, IAU, SIL11:55SUMRX Economic summary:Economic Data Summary:May Empire State Manufacturing -48.5 vs Briefing.com consensus of -58.0; prior was -78.2 Apr Retail Sales -16.4% vs Briefing.com consensus of -11.9%; prior was revised to -8.3% from -8.7%The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment.Apr Retail Sales ex-auto -17.2% vs Briefing.com consensus of -8.2%; prior was revised to -4.5% from -4.5% Apr Industrial Production -11.2% vs Briefing.com consensus of -12.1%; prior was revised to 73.2% from -5.4%The key takeaway from the report is that it is a reflection of how industrial production cratered amid shutdown orders designed to contain the spread of COVID-19.

The sector is down 2.3% for the week versus a 3.6% week-to-date loss in the S&P 500 (-1.0%).More than half of the sector's components trade in the green, which explains the group's outperformance relative to the broader market. Manufacturers of packaged foods and cleaning products are in the lead, reflecting a belief that their products will remain in high demand.Notable movers:McCormick (MKC 178.96, +3.44, +2.0%): leading sector component, rising to a fresh record high. Estee Lauder (EL 166.06, +1.87, +1.1%): reclaiming its 50-day moving average (165.22).

Kimberly-Clark (KMB 137.10, +0.51, +0.4%): remaining near its 200-day moving average (136.95), which has been an area of congestion over the past month. Lamb Weston (LW 52.88, -1.64, -3.0%): weakest performer in the sector, approaching yesterday's low.11:05SRNE Sorrento Therapeutics confirms that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody STI-1499 demonstrated ability to inhibit in vitro virus infection in preclinical studies (4.58 +1.97)Sorrento Therapeutics announced today that its anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody, STI-1499, demonstrated 100% inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in an in vitro virus infection experiment at a very low antibody concentration.As recently announced, Sorrento aims to generate an antibody cocktail product that would act as a "protective shield" against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection and remain effective even if virus mutations render a single antibody therapy less effective over time.Sorrento has so far identified hundreds of antibody candidates that bind the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Approx. one dozen of these antibodies have demonstrated the ability to block the S1 protein's interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor used for viral entrance into human cells. These blocking antibodies were further tested for their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in an in vitro SARS-CoV-2 virus infection model pursuant to a preclinical testing agreement for COVID-19 therapeutic candidates that was previously announced on March 31.One antibody stood out for its ability to completely block SARS-CoV-2 infection of healthy cells in the experiments. STI-1499 completely neutralized the virus infectivity at a very low antibody dose, making it a prime candidate for further testing and development. Initial biochemical and biophysical analyses also indicate STI-1499 is a potentially strong antibody drug candidate.Sorrento has determined STI-1499 will likely be the first antibody in the antibody cocktail (COVI-SHIELD) it is developing. STI-1499 is also expected to be developed as a stand-alone therapy (COVI-GUARD) because of the high potency it has exhibited in experiments to date. Sorrento plans to request priority evaluation and accelerated review from regulators to determine the best pathway to make any potential treatment available as soon as possible. Sorrento's manufacturing facility in San Diego is expected to be able to produce up to two hundred thousand doses per month, and the company intends to produce a million doses at risk while seeking FDA approval for any STI-1499 product candidate. The company is seeking potential government support and pharmaceutical partners to further scale up STI-1499 manufacturing capacity with a goal of potentially providing tens of millions of doses in a short period of time to meet the vast projected demand.11:04TALKX Market Briefing: U.S.-China tension creates some unease and uneven tradingThe stock market is sagging as it confronts another batch of terrible economic data and reports about rising tension between the U.S. and China.Briefly, in April, retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m while industrial production declined a record 11.2%. Consumer sentiment actually improved some in May to 73.7 (from 71.8), yet that belies the fact that attitudes about the outlook actually deteriorated (to 67.7 from 70.1).There is a lot of headline noise surrounding U.S-China relations. The U.S. is moving to block shipments of semiconductors to Huawei and China is said to be entertaining countermeasures, which include restricting or investigating U.S. companies doing business there, if the U.S. follows through.The latter concern has been tempered somewhat by Chinese state media noting China hopes it can meet the U.S. "half way" in trade dealings. Separately, NEC Director Kudlow has denied that the U.S.-China trade deal is falling apart.The uncertain sense of where those relations actually stand has contributed to some uneven trading activity and a modest downward bias for the broader market.A weak showing from the information technology sector (-1.7%), which is feeling the brunt of the angst involving China, is the main drag on the broader market. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is down 3.8%. Other laggards of note include the utilities (-2.3%), real estate (-1.6%), and financial (-1.0%) sectors.Generally speaking, small-cap stocks are faring well, evidenced by the relative strength of the Russell 2000, which is drawing added support from many of its energy sector components. The latter are following crude prices higher ($28.75, +1.19, +4.3%).The Russell 2000 is up 0.7%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 are down 0.9%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.1%.10:18JCP J.

The high-beta group bounced off its 200-day moving average on Thursday, but it finds itself right back at that level today.The SOX index has widened this week's loss to 4.5% versus a 3.0% week-to-date loss in the S&P 500 (-0.4%). Today's weakness is being driven by selling in 29 out of 30 components after the Trump administration extended the ban on sales of chips based on American technology to Huawei for another year.On a side note, the world's largest contract chip foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM 50.85, -1.25, -2.4%), has agreed to build an advanced fabrication facility in Arizona, which will enable high-volume domestic production of processors and microcontrollers.Notable movers:Lam Research (LRCX 254.34, -14.66, -5.5%): weakest performer, falling back below its 200-day moving average (260.63).

These studies, led by Prasad Adusumilli, MD and collaborators at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence of the preclinical safety, improved functional characteristics and enhanced anti-tumor efficacy of ATA2271. Specifically, in vitro, ATA2271 exhibited antigen-specific cytotoxicity, accumulation and effector cytokine secretion, while in vivo results demonstrated that a single dose of ATA2271 led to tumor eradication and superior survival in mice compared to mesothelin-targeted M28z CAR T cells. Mice treated with a single dose of ATA2271 also showed sustained and persistent protection from tumor reestablishment upon 10 additional tumor re-challenges. Results from the study demonstrated the proposed advantages associated with functional persistence and cell-intrinsic PD-1 checkpoint blockade.09:22EDIT Editas Medicine presents data from pre-clinical study supporting use of CRISPR-Cas12a for the development of engineered cell immunotherapies (55.88 )Editas Medicine announced results from a pre-clinical study evaluating multi-gene knockout and transgene knock-in using its proprietary engineered CRISPR-Cas12a (EngCas12a) in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for the development of engineered cell immunotherapy medicines. The results of this study further reinforce Editas Medicine's belief in the transformative potential of iPSC-derived natural killer (iNK) cells as off-the-shelf engineered cell medicines for the treatment of solid tumor cancers.In this study, CRISPR-Cas12a was used to make highly edited iPSC clones. The iPSCs were then differentiated into functional iNK cells. The iNKs derived from the edited iPSC clones had enhanced tumor killing activity relative to iNKs from unedited iPSCs, demonstrating the utility of an edited iPSC platform. The company reported these data today in an oral presentation at the 23rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy, being held virtually.09:17ECONX April Capacity Utilization 64.9% vs 64.0% Briefing.com consensus09:16WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: -27.80.

PTI-125 significantly reduced a secondary endpoint, CSF levels of IL1-beta (p<0.035), a core biomarker of neuroinflammation, from baseline to Day 28. Drug was safe and well-tolerated.A post-hoc analysis of biomarker data revealed high variability in levels of CSF biomarkers over 28 days. For example, placebo-treated patients recorded changes in levels of CSF tau and p-tau ranging from -54% to +34% and -49% to +253%, respectively, from baseline to Day 28. Biomarker analysis was conducted by outside labs.The drug effects of PTI-125, if any, may have been masked in this study by high variability in levels of biomarkers of disease. In the months ahead the Company plans to re-analyze CSF biomarkers from all study participants.Phase 2b was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of PTI-125 in 64 patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, 50-85 years of age, with MMSE 16 to 26. Participants received PTI-125 100 mg, 50 mg or matching placebo, twice-daily, for 28 continuous days.08:15SUMRX Gapping up/down: NEWR +13%, DENN +12%, JD +5% after earnings, LH +1% after upgrade; CODX -17%, VFC -6% and AMAT -3% after earnings, W and GOOS -4% after downgradesGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:NEWR +12.9%, DENN +11.7%, DDS +6.5%, JD +4.6%, GLOB +3.6%, BLFS +2.6%, PBR +2.3%, SSRM +2%Other news:OCUL +11.5% (amends collaboration agreement with Regeneron)ORGS +4.5% (announces repurchase plan of up to $10 million of the company's common stock) HALO +3% (to receive $15 mln milestone payment from JNJ's Janssen)ODP +2.5% (discloses planned business restructuring)Analyst comments:LH +1.3% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Mizuho)Gapping downIn reaction to disappointing earnings/guidance:CODX -16.8%, FTCH -12.1%, CVET -9.9%, HOLI -7.7%, VFC -6.2%, NLOK -3.2%, AMAT -3.1%, BLBD -2.7%, DKNG -2%, VNET -1.7%Other news:OYST -9.5% (prices 3.75 mln shares of its common stock at $28.00 per share) BLU -4.7% (delays the initiation of its Phase 2 trial of BLU-5937 in chronic pruritus)NK -4.3% (co and ImmunityBio to initiate a Phase 2 study of immunotherapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer)ABT -3% (continued uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 tests) TGTX -2.4% (prices offering of 8.5 mln shares of common stock at $18.00 per share)PRPL -1% (prices secondary public offering of 10,789,372 shares of its common stock to be sold by InnoHold at $10.50 per share)Analyst comments:W -4.3% (downgraded to Sell from Neutral at Citigroup)GOOS -4.2% (downgraded to Underperform from Neutral at BofA/Merrill )BP -2.4% (downgraded to Underweight from Equal-Weight at Morgan Stanley)PYPL -1.5% (downgraded to Market Perform from Outperform at BMO Capital Markets)BEST -1% (downgraded to Neutral from Outperform at Macquarie)08:12SCANX Gapping downGapping downIn reaction to disappointing earnings/guidance:CODX -16.8%, FTCH -12.1%, CVET -9.9%, HOLI -7.7%, VFC -6.2%, NLOK -3.2%, AMAT -3.1%, BLBD -2.7%, DKNG -2%, VNET -1.7%Other news:OYST -9.5% (prices 3.75 mln shares of its common stock at $28.00 per share) BLU -4.7% (delays the initiation of its Phase 2 trial of BLU-5937 in chronic pruritus)NK -4.3% (co and ImmunityBio to initiate a Phase 2 study of immunotherapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer)ABT -3% (continued uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 tests) TGTX -2.4% (prices offering of 8.5 mln shares of common stock at $18.00 per share)PRPL -1% (prices secondary public offering of 10,789,372 shares of its common stock to be sold by InnoHold at $10.50 per share)Analyst comments:W -4.3% (downgraded to Sell from Neutral at Citigroup)GOOS -4.2% (downgraded to Underperform from Neutral at BofA/Merrill )BP -2.4% (downgraded to Underweight from Equal-Weight at Morgan Stanley)PYPL -1.5% (downgraded to Market Perform from Outperform at BMO Capital Markets)BEST -1% (downgraded to Neutral from Outperform at Macquarie)08:08SCANX Gapping upGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:NEWR +12.9%, DENN +11.7%, DDS +6.5%, JD +4.6%, GLOB +3.6%, BLFS +2.6%, PBR +2.3%, SSRM +2%Other news:OCUL +11.5% (amends collaboration agreement with Regeneron)ORGS +4.5% (announces repurchase plan of up to $10 million of the company's common stock) HALO +3% (to receive $15 mln milestone payment from JNJ's Janssen)ODP +2.5% (discloses planned business restructuring)Analyst comments:LH +1.3% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Mizuho)08:07HOLX Hologic receives Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA for its Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay to detect the novel coronavirus (51.41 )The newly authorized test runs on Hologic's Panther system, more than 1,000 of which are already installed in clinical laboratories throughout the United States.

Treasury futures climbed steadily during the Asian session, backtracking from highs as attention turned to Europe. However, the short-lived pullback was followed by a push to fresh highs in recent trade. The market has been focused on the latest series of signs of a deteriorating U.S.-China relationship.

ID NOW is intended to be used near the patient with a direct swab test method.It is our responsibility to provide healthcare professionals and the public with accurate information, and that's why we're doing the following:Further clarifying our product information to provide better guidance to healthcare providers that negative results should be considered in the context of a patient's recent exposures, history and the presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Negative results should be presumed negative, but if inconsistent with clinical signs and symptoms or necessary for patient management, should be tested with an alternative molecular assay.

The benchmark index was down as much as 1.9% in early action following a relatively disappointing weekly jobless claims report.The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite increased 0.9%. The Russell 2000 underperformed with a 0.4% gain.Total jobless claims for the week ending May 9 totaled 2.981 million (Briefing.com consensus 2.475 million) while continuing claims for the week ending May 2 totaled 22.833 million. The elevated figures raised doubts on a timely economic recovery, but the data might have prodded lawmakers to act more quickly for additional fiscal stimulus.Reports followed that the White House was interested in a bipartisan, fourth coronavirus relief bill (although not the $3 trillion bill proposed by House Democrats). The possibility for more stimulus, coupled with a view that the recent weakness in the market provided a good entry point, helped ignite a buy-the-dip mindset.The S&P 500 financials sector (+2.6%) set the rebound pace amid strength in the bank stocks, including Wells Fargo (WFC 24.06, +1.53, +6.8%) amid speculation that it could merge with Goldman Sachs (GS 174.45, +2.65, +1.5%). The consumer staples sector (-0.3%) was the only sector without a gain today.Sentiment might have also been boosted by an IEA report suggesting oil demand has been a little stronger than expected, The Wall Street Journal reporting that Taiwan Semi (TSM 52.10, +1.18, +2.3%) will announce plans to build an advanced chip factory in Arizona, and news that Connecticut overstated its weekly initial claims count by more than 200,000.The IEA report likely contributed to the 8.3% gain in WTI crude futures ($27.44/bbl, +2.10). Separately, Cisco (CSCO 43.85, +1.90, +4.5%) was an earnings standout after the company issued positive quarterly results and guidance.U.S. Treasuries finished mixed and little changed. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.63%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 100.31.Reviewing Thursday's economic data, which featured the weekly jobless claims report:Total jobless claims for the week ending May 9 were 2,981,000 (Briefing.com consensus 2.475 million). That was a decrease of 195,000 from the prior week, but still an exceedingly high number all things considered. Continuing claims for the week ending May 2 increased by 456,000 to 22.833 million, which is yet another record high.The key takeaway from the report is that the alarmingly high level of initial and continuing claims paints a risk of a slower recovery due to weaker consumer spending activity and the rising potential that temporary job losses become permanent job losses in an elongated recovery process.Import prices declined 2.6% in April, and prices, excluding oil, declined 0.5%. Export prices declined 3.3% in April, and prices, excluding agriculture, also declined 3.3%.Looking ahead, investors will receive a big batch of data on Friday: Retail Sales for April, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for May, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for April, Business Inventories for March, the JOLTS report for March, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for March.Nasdaq Composite -0.3% YTDS&P 500 -11.7% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -17.2% YTDRussell 2000 -25.8% YTD16:24NKE NIKE provides COVID-19 update; 100% of NIKE-owned stores now open across Greater China and South Korea (86.55 +0.53)As of today, 100% of NIKE-owned stores and over 95% of partner stores in Greater China and South Korea are open, with some still operating with reduced hours. In these markets, retail traffic trends are progressing, and while physical store traffic remains below prior year levels, this is largely offset by higher conversion rates and continued strong digital demand.Since mid-March, the vast majority of NIKE-owned and wholesale partner stores outside Greater China and South Korea have been completely closed. In light of store closures, product shipments to wholesale customers have slowed, resulting in significantly lower wholesale revenue and higher inventory. The company continues to expect this to have a material impact on its NIKE Direct and wholesale operations in North America, EMEA, and APLA in the fourth quarter.The company is seeing accelerated new member acquisition and strong digital demand across the global marketplace, with increased traffic and engagement on its mobile commerce and activity apps. It has increased its digital fulfillment capacity to meet higher demand.Store reopening has begun in over 15 countries including Germany, France, the Netherlands, Brazil, and the US. As of today, roughly 40% of NIKE-owned stores in EMEA, 15% in APLA, and 5% in North America are open, with some operating with reduced hours.

The mall business in general and department stores, specifically, have been particularly hard hit.

Preliminary results were stronger than 2019 first quarter results due to positive show rotation at GES, partially offset by the impact of COVID-19.Preliminary net loss attributable to Viad was $10.6 million, versus a loss of $17.8 million in the 2019 first quarter. Preliminary adjusted segment operating loss was $8.4 million, versus a loss of $11.0 million in the prior year quarter, and adjusted segment EBITDA was $6.9 million, up $4.7 million from the 2019 first quarter.Commentary: "Based on the very difficult, yet necessary actions we have taken to reduce costs and preserve cash, and as we continue to collect accounts receivable, we anticipate that our cash outflow during the second quarter will approximate $40 million.

The sector is down 1.6% for the week, but that is still better than the S&P 500's (-0.1%) 2.7% loss for the week.Today's outperformance comes despite the release of an awful Retail Sales report for April (actual -16.4%; Briefing.com consensus -11.9%), which showed that sales at clothing stores collapsed nearly 80%, sales at electronics at appliance stores plunged over 60%, while sales at furniture stores tumbled nearly 60% last month. This has not stopped several apparel retailers and electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY 79.13, +1.94, +2.5%) from appearing among today's leaders.Notable movers:Royal Caribbean (RCL 37.79, +2.64, +7.5%): leading performer, extending its rebound from a six-week low past its 50-day moving average (36.07).

Co expects to develop STI-1499 as a stand-alone therapy on account of the "high potency it has exhibited in experiments to date." It has a goal of scaling up manufacturing capacities to potentially provide tens of millions of doses within a short time period in order to meet the "vast projected demand." BCEL (19.32 +16.91%): Reported Q1 results and recent business updates; co noted that patients continue to be enrolled and treated in its Phase 1b dose-escalation trial of ATRC-101 in multiple solid tumors, and it noted that it is working closely with its alliance partners to advance R&D as quickly as possible to help address the COVID-19 pandemic.

The S&P 500 is down 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000, however, is up 1.1%.Prior to the open, Reuters reported that the Trump administration was moving to block semiconductor shipments to China's Huawei Technologies, which raised the specter of possible Chinese retaliation on American companies. Shortly thereafter, the Retail Sales report for April showed a record 16.4% m/m decline in total retail sales (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%).The market has been more cognizant of reported tensions, as opposed to the weak data due to a view that the data can't get any worse with reopening efforts underway. Semiconductor companies are among today's weakest performers following the moves in Washington, evidenced by the 2.9% decline in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.Many of these companies, including Applied Materials (AMAT 51.51, -2.92, -5.4%) following its earnings report, have weighed on the S&P 500 information technology sector (-0.7%). The utilities (-2.8%) and real estate (-2.0%) sectors are down the most, though.On the other hand, the energy sector (+0.6%) is following the positive move in oil prices ($29.16, +1.28, +4.6%), and the materials (+0.6%) and consumer staples (+0.3%) sectors also show relative strength.DraftKings (DKNG 28.84, +3.56, +14.0%) is an earnings standout, with shares rising 14% after the company topped EPS estimates and said it doesn't expect COVID-19 to impact its sports betting business long-term.Treasury prices have declined since the opening bell, bringing yields off early lows. The 10-yr yield is currently up one basis point to 0.64% after slipping below 0.60% at its low. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 100.40.Reviewing today's economic data:Total retail sales declined a record 16.4% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -11.9%) while retail sales, excluding autos, declined 17.2% m/m (Briefing.com consensus -8.2%).The key takeaway from the report is that the broad-based weakness is a representation of the adverse spending shock that resulted from shutdown measures, announced pay cuts, and the massive jump in unemployment.Industrial production declined 11.2% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -12.1%), which was the largest monthly drop in the 101-year history of the index. The capacity utilization rate fell from 73.2% to 64.9% (Briefing.com consensus 64.0%), which is 14.9 percentage points below its long-run average and a record-low in a series that dates back to 1967.The key takeaway from the report is that it is a reflection of how industrial production cratered amid shutdown orders designed to contain the spread of COVID-19. On a yr/yr basis, industrial production was down 15.0%.The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 73.7 in the preliminary reading for May (Briefing.com consensus 67.4) from 71.8 in April.The key takeaway from the report is that attitudes about current conditions improved while sentiment surrounding the outlook continued to deteriorate, pinched by concerns about financial prospects that were most notable among upper income households. That is apt to be a headwind for a pickup in consumer spending.The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for May checked in at -48.5 (Briefing.com consensus -58.0) following the prior month's reading of -78.2.March job openings decreased to 6.191 mln from a revised 7.004 mln in February (from 6.882 mln). Business inventories decreased 0.2% in March, while the February reading was revised down to -0.5% from -0.4%.12:34GLYC GlycoMimetics announces presentation of preclinical research on uproleselan and GMI-1359 at Virtual AACR Annual Meeting (3.14 +0.25)During the June session, GlycoMimetics will present preclinical data that further support the potential of the company's compounds to be used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as well as in the setting of stem cell transplantation.

Approx. one dozen of these antibodies have demonstrated the ability to block the S1 protein's interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor used for viral entrance into human cells. These blocking antibodies were further tested for their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in an in vitro SARS-CoV-2 virus infection model pursuant to a preclinical testing agreement for COVID-19 therapeutic candidates that was previously announced on March 31.One antibody stood out for its ability to completely block SARS-CoV-2 infection of healthy cells in the experiments. STI-1499 completely neutralized the virus infectivity at a very low antibody dose, making it a prime candidate for further testing and development. Initial biochemical and biophysical analyses also indicate STI-1499 is a potentially strong antibody drug candidate.Sorrento has determined STI-1499 will likely be the first antibody in the antibody cocktail (COVI-SHIELD) it is developing. STI-1499 is also expected to be developed as a stand-alone therapy (COVI-GUARD) because of the high potency it has exhibited in experiments to date. Sorrento plans to request priority evaluation and accelerated review from regulators to determine the best pathway to make any potential treatment available as soon as possible. Sorrento's manufacturing facility in San Diego is expected to be able to produce up to two hundred thousand doses per month, and the company intends to produce a million doses at risk while seeking FDA approval for any STI-1499 product candidate.

Consumer sentiment actually improved some in May to 73.7 (from 71.8), yet that belies the fact that attitudes about the outlook actually deteriorated (to 67.7 from 70.1).There is a lot of headline noise surrounding U.S-China relations. The U.S. is moving to block shipments of semiconductors to Huawei and China is said to be entertaining countermeasures, which include restricting or investigating U.S. companies doing business there, if the U.S. follows through.The latter concern has been tempered somewhat by Chinese state media noting China hopes it can meet the U.S. "half way" in trade dealings. Separately, NEC Director Kudlow has denied that the U.S.-China trade deal is falling apart.The uncertain sense of where those relations actually stand has contributed to some uneven trading activity and a modest downward bias for the broader market.A weak showing from the information technology sector (-1.7%), which is feeling the brunt of the angst involving China, is the main drag on the broader market. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is down 3.8%. Other laggards of note include the utilities (-2.3%), real estate (-1.6%), and financial (-1.0%) sectors.Generally speaking, small-cap stocks are faring well, evidenced by the relative strength of the Russell 2000, which is drawing added support from many of its energy sector components. The latter are following crude prices higher ($28.75, +1.19, +4.3%).The Russell 2000 is up 0.7%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 are down 0.9%; and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.1%.10:18JCP J. C. Penney discloses making $17 mln interest payment with respect to term loan facility; continues to evaluate strategic alternatives (remains halted) (0.19 +0.00)On May 14, J. C. Penney made the approx. $17 mln interest payment that was due and payable on May 7 with respect to JCP's senior secured term loan credit facility. Under the credit and guaranty agreement governing the term loan facility, the company had a grace period of five business days to make the interest payment before such non-payment would constitute an "event of default" thereunder. The company had entered into such grace period in order to evaluate certain strategic alternatives, none of which have been implemented at this time and which continue to be considered.10:14OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:LRCX Weekly May29 280 calls are seeing interest following increased China/Huawei tensions with US with 2330 contracts trading vs. open int of 11, pushing implied vol up around 10 points to ~64%.

These studies, led by Prasad Adusumilli, MD and collaborators at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence of the preclinical safety, improved functional characteristics and enhanced anti-tumor efficacy of ATA2271. Specifically, in vitro, ATA2271 exhibited antigen-specific cytotoxicity, accumulation and effector cytokine secretion, while in vivo results demonstrated that a single dose of ATA2271 led to tumor eradication and superior survival in mice compared to mesothelin-targeted M28z CAR T cells. Mice treated with a single dose of ATA2271 also showed sustained and persistent protection from tumor reestablishment upon 10 additional tumor re-challenges. Results from the study demonstrated the proposed advantages associated with functional persistence and cell-intrinsic PD-1 checkpoint blockade.09:22EDIT Editas Medicine presents data from pre-clinical study supporting use of CRISPR-Cas12a for the development of engineered cell immunotherapies (55.88 )Editas Medicine announced results from a pre-clinical study evaluating multi-gene knockout and transgene knock-in using its proprietary engineered CRISPR-Cas12a (EngCas12a) in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for the development of engineered cell immunotherapy medicines. The results of this study further reinforce Editas Medicine's belief in the transformative potential of iPSC-derived natural killer (iNK) cells as off-the-shelf engineered cell medicines for the treatment of solid tumor cancers.In this study, CRISPR-Cas12a was used to make highly edited iPSC clones. The iPSCs were then differentiated into functional iNK cells. The iNKs derived from the edited iPSC clones had enhanced tumor killing activity relative to iNKs from unedited iPSCs, demonstrating the utility of an edited iPSC platform. The company reported these data today in an oral presentation at the 23rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy, being held virtually.09:17ECONX April Capacity Utilization 64.9% vs 64.0% Briefing.com consensus09:16WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: -27.80.

In addition, the Trump administration will block Huawei from receiving shipments that are a "direct product of certain U.S. software and technology."

The benchmark index was down as much as 1.9% in early action following a relatively disappointing weekly jobless claims report.The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite increased 0.9%. The Russell 2000 underperformed with a 0.4% gain.Total jobless claims for the week ending May 9 totaled 2.981 million (Briefing.com consensus 2.475 million) while continuing claims for the week ending May 2 totaled 22.833 million. The elevated figures raised doubts on a timely economic recovery, but the data might have prodded lawmakers to act more quickly for additional fiscal stimulus.Reports followed that the White House was interested in a bipartisan, fourth coronavirus relief bill (although not the $3 trillion bill proposed by House Democrats). The possibility for more stimulus, coupled with a view that the recent weakness in the market provided a good entry point, helped ignite a buy-the-dip mindset.The S&P 500 financials sector (+2.6%) set the rebound pace amid strength in the bank stocks, including Wells Fargo (WFC 24.06, +1.53, +6.8%) amid speculation that it could merge with Goldman Sachs (GS 174.45, +2.65, +1.5%). The consumer staples sector (-0.3%) was the only sector without a gain today.Sentiment might have also been boosted by an IEA report suggesting oil demand has been a little stronger than expected, The Wall Street Journal reporting that Taiwan Semi (TSM 52.10, +1.18, +2.3%) will announce plans to build an advanced chip factory in Arizona, and news that Connecticut overstated its weekly initial claims count by more than 200,000.The IEA report likely contributed to the 8.3% gain in WTI crude futures ($27.44/bbl, +2.10). Separately, Cisco (CSCO 43.85, +1.90, +4.5%) was an earnings standout after the company issued positive quarterly results and guidance.U.S. Treasuries finished mixed and little changed. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.16%, while the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.63%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 100.31.Reviewing Thursday's economic data, which featured the weekly jobless claims report:Total jobless claims for the week ending May 9 were 2,981,000 (Briefing.com consensus 2.475 million). That was a decrease of 195,000 from the prior week, but still an exceedingly high number all things considered. Continuing claims for the week ending May 2 increased by 456,000 to 22.833 million, which is yet another record high.The key takeaway from the report is that the alarmingly high level of initial and continuing claims paints a risk of a slower recovery due to weaker consumer spending activity and the rising potential that temporary job losses become permanent job losses in an elongated recovery process.Import prices declined 2.6% in April, and prices, excluding oil, declined 0.5%. Export prices declined 3.3% in April, and prices, excluding agriculture, also declined 3.3%.Looking ahead, investors will receive a big batch of data on Friday: Retail Sales for April, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for May, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for April, Business Inventories for March, the JOLTS report for March, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for March.Nasdaq Composite -0.3% YTDS&P 500 -11.7% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -17.2% YTDRussell 2000 -25.8% YTD16:24NKE NIKE provides COVID-19 update; 100% of NIKE-owned stores now open across Greater China and South Korea (86.55 +0.53)As of today, 100% of NIKE-owned stores and over 95% of partner stores in Greater China and South Korea are open, with some still operating with reduced hours. In these markets, retail traffic trends are progressing, and while physical store traffic remains below prior year levels, this is largely offset by higher conversion rates and continued strong digital demand.Since mid-March, the vast majority of NIKE-owned and wholesale partner stores outside Greater China and South Korea have been completely closed. In light of store closures, product shipments to wholesale customers have slowed, resulting in significantly lower wholesale revenue and higher inventory. The company continues to expect this to have a material impact on its NIKE Direct and wholesale operations in North America, EMEA, and APLA in the fourth quarter.The company is seeing accelerated new member acquisition and strong digital demand across the global marketplace, with increased traffic and engagement on its mobile commerce and activity apps. It has increased its digital fulfillment capacity to meet higher demand.Store reopening has begun in over 15 countries including Germany, France, the Netherlands, Brazil, and the US. As of today, roughly 40% of NIKE-owned stores in EMEA, 15% in APLA, and 5% in North America are open, with some operating with reduced hours. Wholesale partners in these countries have also begun to re-open stores.16:20APD Air Products to invest $2 bln in coal-to-methanol project in Indonesia (225.62 -0.22)Air Products has signed a definitive agreement for a long-term on-site contract for a world-scale coal-to-methanol production facility in Bengalon, East Kalimantan, Indonesia.

The mall business in general and department stores, specifically, have been particularly hard hit. While our balance sheet was already strong, we took decisive, sometimes difficult, actions to preserve liquidity and ensure our long-term viability.

Preliminary results were stronger than 2019 first quarter results due to positive show rotation at GES, partially offset by the impact of COVID-19.Preliminary net loss attributable to Viad was $10.6 million, versus a loss of $17.8 million in the 2019 first quarter. Preliminary adjusted segment operating loss was $8.4 million, versus a loss of $11.0 million in the prior year quarter, and adjusted segment EBITDA was $6.9 million, up $4.7 million from the 2019 first quarter.Commentary: "Based on the very difficult, yet necessary actions we have taken to reduce costs and preserve cash, and as we continue to collect accounts receivable, we anticipate that our cash outflow during the second quarter will approximate $40 million.

Wall Street in sharp fall after poor results and Trump's threats to ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 1, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 430 wordsBody       U.S. indexes closed the session down around 3 percent.                                                After the best month in several decades, Wall Street began the month of May on the wrong foot, with major shareholder indexes posting losses of around 3% due to results from Amazon, Apple, Exxon Mobil and other companies and also the Statements of the President of the United States on tariffs on Chinese products. The Dow Jones industrial index closed down 2.56% to 23,723.69 points and the Tech Nasdaq sank 3.2% to 8,604.9 points. The S&P500; was down 2.8%.This drop comes after yesterday's major indexes soared in April. The Dow shot up 11.1 percent and the S&P; 500 climbed 12.7 percent, which was the best monthly gains since January 1987, or more than 33 years. The Nasdaq gained 15.4% in April, its best monthly performance in 20 years - since June 2000. Sentiment reversed at the start of May due mainly to messages of caution conveyed yesterday by technology giants Apple and Amazon about how the new coronavirus pandemic will affect their business. Amazon sank 7.6% to $2,386.04 after it revealed that it posted profits of $2.535 million (2,314 million euros) in the first quarter of the fiscal year, 29% less than in the same period a year earlier. Apple lost 1.61% to $291,042 after it revealed yesterday that it closed its fiscal second quarter with profits of $11.24 billion, or $2.55 per share, above the $2.26 average predicted by market consensus.Exxon Mobil sank 7.17% to $43.14 after announcing the first losses in the last 32 years. Tesla also recorded a day of sharp declines, reacting negatively to the company's CEO's tweets. Elon Musk wrote that the company's shares are "very high," prompting the electric car maker's bonds to sink 10.3% to $701.32. Negative sentiment in the markets worsened after Trump threatened to resume the tariff war with China at a time when the world economy is virtually stalled.In response to a question about whether he planned to cancel part of his debt obligations to the Chinese government, the Us President expressed, "We can do this with tariffs or in other ways."Donald Trump claimed that China could have contained covid-19, but let the disease spread, ensuring he saw evidence that the virus was created in a laboratory in Wuhan, a city in central China where the new coronavirus was spotted in late December."They [China] are a brilliant nation, scientifically and in other things. They could have saved it or stopped [the outbreak of the new coronavirus], but they didn't," Trump said at a press conference.Load-Date: May 2, 2020End of Document

China denies to be the epicenter and suggests other theories of the origin of the coronavirusCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 13, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 365 wordsBodyThe Chinese government quarantined the city of Wuhan because of the Covid-19epidemic, but claims that the new coronavirus does not necessarily come from China,and does not hesitate to draw inspiration from plotist theories.Having recorded more than 80,000 pollution and 3,000 deaths on its territory since December, China has been in sharp retreat from the epidemic for several weeks,which has spread instead to more than a hundred countries, where it has left 1,700 deaths.The communist regime, initially accused of delaying reacting to the epidemic, now counterattacks by implying - without scientific evidence - that the coronavirus could be of foreign origin."Itmay have been the U.S. military that brought the epidemic to Wuhan,"a spokesman for The Chinese Foreign Ministry, Zhao Lijian, said on Twitter Thursday night."America must be transparent! And you must publish your data! The United States owes us an explanation,"he added.Zhao is not based on any scientific study. On Friday, he simply tweeted links to two articles on the Global Research website, known for spreading thesis plotists.CHINA SOURCEHowever, Beijing had clearly designatedat the beginning of the year a Wuhan market as the cradle of the epidemic, when the virus would have been transmitted from one animal species to another, before contaminating man."We now know that live animals sold in a fish market are the source of the virus," said at the end of January, the head of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu,following The quarantine of Wuhan.The virus responsible for Covid-19 "was unknown before the outbreak that began in Wuhan in December 2019," recalls the World Health Organization (WHO).Genetic analysis of samples from the new coronavirus extracted in several countries reveals a common source in China,explains to AFP Christel Donnelly, professor of epidemiology at Imperial College London."It's not about accusing a particular country," he says.But for researcher Yun Jiang of Australia's national university, "by sowing doubts in people's minds about the origin of the virus," China "tries to evade responsibility in the epidemic."The coronavirus already surpasses 5,000 deaths worldwideLoad-Date: March 14, 2020End of Document

Huawei increased its spending with US suppliers by 70% despite sanctionCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 6, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 546 wordsBodyHuawei increased its spending with U.S. suppliers 70% last year, even though the White House blacklisted it, which prohibits U.S. groups from selling to Chinese telecoms.Eric Xu, president of Huawei, mentioned in an interview that the company spent $18.7 billion (mdd) on U.S. companies in 2019, compared to 11,000 mdd in 2018.U.S. officials placed the Chinese company on the sanctions list last May, and lobbied with the UK and Germany to exclude Huawei as a provider for 5G mobile internet networks.However, Huawei purchased software and hardware from US companies such as Google, Microsoft, Broadcom and Qualcomm for their smartphones and tablets, a spokesman said. U.S. companies managed to get the US government to allow them to continue trading with Huawei for limited terms.m{760176}The Chinese company is developing its own software, chips and applications - something Xu called the "Plan B" - to deal with the disruption of not being able to use TECHNOLOGY from the US, such as the Android operating system. "We didn't expect Plan B to become Plan A one day," he said. But he added that Huawei does not want to stop using US suppliers.The US campaign against the Chinese group substantially affected its finances, Xu said, after its annual revenue remained 12,000 mdd below expectations. "The US government's campaign against Huawei in Europe has had a pretty significant impact on our business," Xu added.m{760177}Huawei's president said US pressure slowed growth across all of its business units. The Chinese group found that it was no longer able to sell 5G phones in parts of Europe last year, while some European telecommunications companies, including Telia and TDC, chose to order 5G equipment from Huawei's rivals.The Chinese company also failed to supply customers with Intel-based chips for its servers, reducing the growth of its business division.Huawei projected that its revenue would grow to 135,000 mdd in 2019. Instead reported sales of 123,000 mdd. In 2018, revenue was 109,000 mdd.At the press conference after the results, Xu warned that the Chinese government is likely to retaliate if the US steps up sanctions to prevent taiwan's TSMC from using US chip production equipment and manufacturing them for Huawei."The Chinese government will not stand and watch Huawei be torn apart. I think he's going to take action in response. Why wouldn't the government use similar cybersecurity concerns to ban the use of US 5G chips in the Chinese market?" said Xu.Huawei lowered its expectations for the year, but Xu says the consumer business remains strong. "Our performance in the first quarter of this year was pretty good compared to the same period last year. Even with the pandemic, revenues for the consumer business are on par or growing slightly this year compared to the previous one," he said.Huawei's consumer business grew 34% last year to reach 66,900 mdd, while its business for operators • selling telecommunications equipment to networks like Vodafone• grew by nearly 4% to reach 42,500 mdd.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 2.2%, the Nasdaq Composite declined 1.6%, and the Russell 2000 declined 3.3%.In his speech prior to the open, Fed Chair Powell said the economic outlook remained highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risks, adding that a recovery may take some time to gather momentum. Mr. Powell also said the Fed can do more to help the financial system but dismissed the notion of implementing negative interest rates.The S&P 500 did trade in positive territory for a moment after the open, but sellers quickly regained control with losses broadening out to all 11 S&P 500 sectors. The energy (-4.4%) and financials (-3.0%) sectors took the biggest hits, while the consumer staples (-0.9%) and utilities (-0.9%) sectors declined less than 1.0%.Investors were reminded today that part of the economic uncertainty referenced by Fed Chair Powell included U.S-China tensions and hurdles in COVID-19 testing. The latter was noted by a New York University study that suggested Abbott Lab's (ABT 92.16, -1.64, -1.8%) COVID-19 test is prone to false negatives.Adding to U.S.-China tensions, the FBI confirmed that China-affiliated cyber actors have targeted U.S. organizations conducting COVID-19-related research. Also, a report out of China indicated that Beijing is mulling punitive countermeasure on the U.S. as a result of lawsuits that are seeking COVID-19-related damages.Separately, valuation concerns were voiced by a couple of influential names. Legendary investor Stanley Druckenmiller said the risk-reward for equity is maybe as bad as he's seen it in his career. Appaloosa Management's David Tepper told CNBC that he hasn't seen the market this overvalued since 1999.U.S. Treasuries ended the session slightly higher. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.15%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 0.65%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 100.25. WTI crude declined 1.6%, or $0.42, to $25.34/bbl.Reviewing Wednesday's economic data:The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 1.3% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -0.5%), marking its biggest decrease since records began in December 2009. Most of that decline was attributed to a 3.3% drop in prices for final demand goods.The Producer Price Index for April may not be convincing enough to the Fed to go down the negative interest rate road, yet the key takeaway is that it will certainly keep it on the path at the lower bound.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index increased 0.3% following a 0.1% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report and Export and Import Prices for April on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite -1.2% YTDS&P 500 -12.7% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -18.5% YTDRussell 2000 -26.1% YTD16:23FLO Flowers Foods beats by $0.08, beats on revs; guides FY20 EPS in-line, revs in-line (22.61 +0.16)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.41 per share, $0.08 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.33; revenues rose 6.7% year/year to $1.35 bln vs the $1.32 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

VIB7734 was designed to deplete plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), an important source of inflammatory mediators in autoimmune diseases. This trial includes three cohorts of patients at ascending dose levels. Cohorts 2 and 3 enrolled patients with CLE. Key measures include safety and tolerability, pDC depletion in peripheral blood and skin lesions of patients with CLE, and Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) scores. Interim results include safety data from patients in cohorts 1 and 2 and a subset of patients in cohort 3, pharmacodynamics results from cohort 2, and CLASI results from cohort 2 and a subset of patients in cohort 3. The interim findings indicated safety and tolerability comparable to placebo control across all cohorts, potent depletion of pDC both in peripheral blood and in inflamed CLE skin lesion biopsies in cohort 2, and dose-dependent reduction in CLASI scores of 4 points or more, which is considered a clinically meaningful change, in cohorts 2 and 3.Based on these results, the company intends to advance the program into several Phase 2 clinical studies in indications with high unmet need that are thought to be driven by pDCs.16:19PRO PROS Holdings appoints Les Rechan as COO (30.21 -2.22)In this new role reporting to Andres Reiner, PROS President and CEO, Mr. Rechan is now responsible for all go-to-market and customer experience and engagement functions to further scale and grow these operations globally.

Chair Roger Penske commented, "The decision to suspend the quarterly dividend is consistent with the other measures the company has implemented to mitigate the impact of Covid-19, including a hiring freeze, the deferral of approximately $150 million in capital expenditures, and the furloughing of 57% of its worldwide workforce, among others."16:15CSCO Cisco beats by $0.08, beats on revs; guides JulQ EPS above consensus, revs in-line (41.95 -1.27)Reports Q3 (Apr) earnings of $0.79 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.08 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.71 and vs prior guidance of $0.79-0.81; revenues fell 7.5% year/year to $11.98 bln vs the $11.85 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Non-GAAP operating margin was 34.9%, above prior guidance of 32.5-33.5%.Co issues guidance for Q4 (Jul), sees EPS of $0.72-0.74, excluding non-recurring items, vs. $0.70 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q4 revs being down 8.5-11.5%, which we compute as $11.884-12.287 bln vs. $11.96 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

As previously announced, the company also withdrew its guidance for the fiscal year ending September 27, 2020. The company did not repurchase any shares in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, and as announced on April 15, 2020, temporarily suspended its share repurchase program. In addition to temporarily suspending its share repurchase program, the company announced today that on May 8, 2020, its Board of Directors approved the company's voluntary election to temporarily suspend quarterly dividend payments.16:13BBIO BridgeBio Pharma affiliate provides updates to ongoing RDEB program (30.78 -2.05)Phoenix Tissue Repair, an affiliate company of BridgeBio Pharma, today announced updates to its ongoing Phase 1/2 study of PTR-01 (BridgeBio designation BBP-589), an intravenously-administered recombinant collagen 7 protein replacement therapy for patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by severe blistering and scarring of the skin caused by even minor friction or trauma, among other symptoms. Cohorts 1-3 have completed treatment at escalating dose levels, and an additional fourth cohort to evaluate higher dosing of PTR-01 has begun enrolling patients.Based on an interim review of data from the first three cohorts of trial participants, PTR-01 has been well tolerated in all nine patients, and there have been no treatment-related serious adverse events at any dose. In addition, there has been a dose-dependent increase in collagen 7 skin deposition after just three infusions over 28 days.The company also announced that Sanuj K. Ravindran, M.D. has been appointed to lead PTR as executive chairman, and Hal Landy, M.D., and Deborah Ramsdell have joined PTR as chief medical officer and chief operating officer, respectively.16:12ONEM 1Life Healthcare reports Q1 results, beats on revs; guides Q2 revs in-line (26.54 -0.71)Reports Q1 (Mar) loss of $0.40 per share, may not compare to the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.17); revenues rose 25.1% year/year to $78.8 mln vs the $75 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Co issues in-line guidance for Q2, sees Q2 revs of $56-$66 mln vs. $64.31 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Sees Ending Membership count between 465,000 to 475,000.

First quarter 2020 unique aligner shipments up 12% to 122,751, compared to 109,894 in the first quarter of 2019. Average aligner gross sales price of $1,770 for the first quarter of 2020, compared to $1,767 for the first quarter of 2019. Business Outlook: Since Q1, the Company has seen robust performance in its impression kit business, despite a significant reduction in marketing spend. This demonstrates that investments in brand building and marketing efficiency have begun to pay dividends. Specifically, although marketing spend was reduced by approximately 90% over the past 60 days, kit and scan volume was down by only ~40%. Additionally, because the Company has very few fixed costs and the vast majority of its SmileShops around the world operate on month-to-month leases, it has been able to take decisive action, including the temporary closure of all SmileShops other than those in Hong Kong. Additionally, SmileDirectClub has entered into a new debt facility with HPS Investment Partners. After refinancing the previous debt facility, the Company will have approximately $420 million in cash on its balance sheet, giving the liquidity needed to continue its growth plans and manage potential downsides with COVID-19.16:09RARE Ultragenyx Pharma announces "positive" longer-term data from first three cohorts of Phase 1/2 study of DTX301 in OTC deficiency (64.08 -2.21)Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical announced positive longer-term safety and efficacy data from the first three cohorts of the ongoing Phase 1/2 study of DTX301, an investigational adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy for the treatment of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. Six of nine patients in the study have responded to the gene therapy (three female, three male), including all three patients in Cohort 3, who are now confirmed responders. The three previously disclosed complete responders, who have discontinued all ammonia scavengers and liberalized their diet, remain clinically and metabolically stable after longer-term follow-up.

Co stated that in the first days of the pandemic, it observed in Brazil a significant increase in interest in investments; its Retail Research Platform and InfoMoney portal reached record audiences. Co's active clients totaled 2.0 mln at the end of Q1, up +81% yr/yr, driven by the expansion of co's direct and B2B channels and its three retail brands. Reaches two-month highs.BLK (487.92 +7.37%): Priced the secondary offering of 28,753,248 shares of common stock held by PNC Financial (PNC) at $420/share. The stock rebounds from yesterday's circa 8% drop. ALC (56.43 +6.07%): Topped consensus for Q1 EPS and revs. Widespread shutdowns in March negatively impacted co's results following "strong sales growth" in both of co's franchises during the first two months of the year. Co expects Q2 results to be negatively impacted by the ongoing coronavirus crisis, but given the critical nature of eye care, customer demand is expected to resume as conditions normalize and improve through the back half of the year.Large Cap LosersPODD (194.85 -11.71%): Announced a public offering of $500 mln of its common stock, or 2,369,668 shares priced at $211.00/share; proceeds are expected to be dedicated to general corporate purposes. Co has also been scheduled to present this afternoon at the BofA Securities Virtual Healthcare Conference. Pulls back from recent all-time highs.

OKE (30.49 -7.44%): Underperforms alongside various energy sector peers; the energy space lags the broader market. (Related: ET, LNG, OXY...)15:30JACK Jack In The Box: Earnings Preview (62.72 -3.11)Jack in the Box (JACK) is set to report Q2 (Mar) results today after the close with a call to follow tomorrow morning at 11:30am ET. The current S&P CapitalIQ consensus is for adjusted EPS of $0.69 and revenue of $211.3 mln. JACK previously withdrew its FY20 guidance, so we certainly do not expect any full year guidance. Even before the pandemic, JACK did not typically provide quarterly guidance, so we're also not expecting any JunQ guidance.In terms of key metrics, system same-store comps are clearly important. However, JACK has already announced Q2 comps, which were -4.2%. Comps were running at +5.2% for the seven weeks ending March 8, but the final five weeks of the quarter (March 9-April 12), comps were -17.0%. So this won't be new information, but hopefully we get some directional comp data since the quarter ended on April 12. On April 16, Jack in the Box had some big news as it named Darin Harris as it's new CEO. He will take over no later than June 15. Most recently, Harris served as CEO of North America for IWG PLC, the holding group for several providers of over 1,000 flexible workspaces. Harris is also the former CEO of CiCi's Pizza. Harris takes over from Lenny Comma, who plans to retire. Hopefully, we will get some initial insight in terms of possible changes he may make. In terms of the pandemic impact, the company has had minimal temporary closures, with over 99% of restaurants open on each day during the COVID-19 pandemic. All locations are operating in an off-premise capacity, mostly via drive-thru lanes. In terms of how JACK performs relative to consensus, it can be somewhat volatile. It has reported two EPS misses in a row, including a large $0.21 miss in Q1. On a final note, Wendy's (WEN) recently reported good Q1 results. What jumped off the page to us was Wendy's US weekly comp performance in early Q2, which had returned to nearly flat comps even as its locations are limited to drive-thru/delivery. We will see if JACK saw a similar bullish comp direction in late April and early May.15:17SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- 8x8 (EGHT) pulls back following quarterly earnings press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersSNX (90.97 +8.75%): Guided for Q2 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.00-1.00. Co stated that since March, it has "rapidly enabled additional work-from-home capabilities to support its client base needs" while Technology Solutions has continued to support the at-home requirements of customers; these increased abilities are the main contributors to co's improved Q2 outlook. Co has increased its liquidity position to nearly $2 bln. Co also announced a distribution agreement with cybersecurity company Bitdefender. BRFS (3.79 +8.29%): Rises to its new highest levels for the month, seeing relative strength alongside certain food and grocery industry peers in the consumer staples sector. Among recent items, co reported Q1 earnings earlier this week and today filed an Integrated Report for 2019. Co commented during its Q1 call that it expects to face challenges on the supply side. (Related: UNFI, BGS, FLO...) ALEC (30 +6.23%): Reported Q1 results; revs rose +28.6% yr/yr to $7.17 mln due to an increase in expenses for the AL002 and AL003 programs vs the prior year period. Co stated that it remains on track to advance AL001 into a pivotal Phase 3 study in FTD-GRN patients in 2020; it also noted that ongoing activities for AL003, AL101, and AL014 are continuing as planned and that it plans to initiate a Phase 2 study of AL002 in Alzheimer's patients in 2020. Co believes that its cash and investments as of March 31 will be sufficient to fund its anticipated operations through 2022.Mid Cap LosersEGHT (15.44 -24.39%): Reported Q4 results, topping consensus for EPS and revs. Service revs grew +30.2% yr/yr. Co commented that churn levels are higher than it would like, particularly in legacy small business VoIP customers, impacting co's net dollar retention rate. Guided Q1 revs in-line. During its call, co stated that it expects its service revenue growth rate for FY21 to range from +17-18%. Drops from yesterday's three-month highs.COTY (3.68 -14.78%): Downgraded to Neutral from Outperform and assigned a $5 target at Exane BNP Paribas.

Treasuries started the cash session with modest gains after concerns about a second wave of coronavirus infections weighed on risk tolerance in Asia and Europe. Treasuries climbed to fresh highs in mid-morning trade, responding to the release of Fed Chairman Jay Powell's prepared remarks from a virtual event hosted by the Peterson Institute. The Fed Chairman said that he expects only a gradual economic recovery and he repeated his opposition to a negative interest rate policy in the U.S. Treasuries slipped back to their starting levels well before the conclusion of the event with Chairman Powell and remained in that range into the late morning, when a push to fresh highs took place alongside selling in equities. Treasuries remained near their highs into midday action but made another return toward their starting levels after the completion of a $22 bln 30-yr bond auction, which was met with lukewarm demand. The U.S. Dollar Index retreated toward its 50-day moving average (99.53) in overnight trade but rallied 0.3% to 100.24 as the day went on, reclaiming its loss from yesterday.

A partial lockdown was reportedly implemented in China's Jilin City due to a spike in coronavirus cases. Hong Kong reported its first instance of community coronavirus transmission in nearly a month. Japan's Economy Minister, Yasutoshi Nishimura, said that the Japanese government and the Bank of Japan are determined to prevent deflation from taking hold. Yonhap reported that South Korean officials urged Japan to remove trade restrictions on materials essential for South Korea's production of displays and semiconductors. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand left its official cash rate at 0.25%, as expected, and increased its asset purchase program to NZD60 bln from NZD30 bln. South Korea's April Unemployment Rate remained at 3.8%. Eurozone's March Industrial Production fell 11.3% m/m (expected -12.1%; last -0.1%), contracting 12.9% yr/yr (expected -12.4%; last -2.2%).

March trade deficit totaled GBP12.51 bln (expected deficit of GBP10.00 bln; last deficit of GBP9.83 bln). $22 bln 30-year Treasury bond auction results (prior 12-auction average): High yield: 1.342% (2.225%). Bid-to-cover: 2.30 (2.31). Indirect bid: 65.7% (61.2%). Direct bid: 12.9% (15.5%). Today's Data: The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 1.3% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -0.5%), marking its biggest decrease since records began in December 2009. Most of that decline was attributed to a 3.3% drop in prices for final demand goods. Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus -0.2%), leaving it up just 0.6% yr/yr. The Producer Price Index for April may not be convincing enough to the Fed to go down the negative interest rate road, yet the key takeaway is that it will certainly keep it on the path at the lower bound. The weekly MBA Mortgage Index ticked up 0.3% to follow last week's 0.1% uptick. The Purchase Index jumped 10.6% while the Refinance Index fell 3.3%.

The company has been working aggressively the last few months to repurpose its cell-based vaccine platform targeting solid tumors for use against viral diseases.Orgenesis believes its new vaccine platform offers a unique approach to cell vaccination that holds promise for an affordable and reproducible vaccine for both COVID-19 and other viral diseases. The company is moving forward with planned animal testing for its cell-based vaccine platform in COVID-19 and looks forward to providing a more detailed timeline of activities including plans for initial human testing, assuming clearance from the FDA and/or other non-US regulatory bodies to do so.14:09CSCO Cisco: Earnings Preview -- Will be our first in-depth look at a major tech company that includes the pandemic's impact on April (41.83 -1.39)Cisco Systems (CSCO) is set to report Q3 (Apr) results today after the close with a call to follow at 4:30pm ET. The current S&P CapitalIQ consensus is for adjusted EPS of $0.71 and revenue of $11.85 bln, an -8.6% yr/yr decline. Cisco typically guides for EPS and revenue for the next quarter. The company has been silent in terms of whether it plans to provide guidance going forward, so we'll see.Last quarter, Cisco guided to Q3 adjusted EPS of $0.79-0.81 and a revenue decline of -3.5% to -1.5%. However, with consensus estimates well below this guidance, it seems analysts are skeptical Cisco will hit those numbers. Current guidance for non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 is 32.5-33.5%. Cisco is a particularly important tech name to watch with earnings. Because it's so large and touches so many areas, it's a great barometer to get a general sense for enterprise sending levels on IT. It's also the first big tech name to report that includes the month of April. The pandemic hit in mid-to-late March and while other IT names provided the pandemic's impact on the tail end of their Q1 results, this will be our first in-depth look at a major tech company that includes the impact on April. We should also get some color on how the summer may play out. In terms of how Cisco performs relative to consensus, it typically beats modestly on EPS in the $0.01-0.03 range with modest revenue upside. It has not missed on EPS or revs in the past five years, so if it did so, that would be notable13:48XLP Sector Briefing: Consumer Staples (57.09 -0.46)All eleven sectors trade in negative territory with five groups down 2.0% or more. Growth-sensitive sectors are at the forefront of today's retreat while countercyclical groups have fared a bit better.The consumer staples sector (-0.8%) shows a slimmer loss than most of its peers, continuing this week's trend. The sector is down 1.8% for the week versus a 3.9% week-to-date loss in the S&P 500 (-1.9%).Roughly 2/3 of the sector's components trade in the red while a couple major retailers and a handful of food companies hold gains, resulting in outperformance versus the broader market.Notable movers:General Mills (GIS 63.64, +1.13, +1.8%): leading component, rising to its best level since early 2017.

EBITDA up circa +32% yr/yr. Management commented that consumer demand for its natural and conventional products alike surged early in Q3 and remains elevated. Strong demand has allowed co to leverage fixed costs and capitalize on integration efforts undertaken in connection with the Supervalu acquisition. After hiring over 2,000 new associates in March and April, co continues to recruit additional associates to meet heightened demand. Upgraded to Equal Weight at Wells Fargo. At 52-week highs.PGNY (25.43 +24.11%): Topped expectations for Q1 EPS and revs (+72% yr/yr to $81.0 mln). Adj. EBITDA grew +64% yr/yr. Co commented that volumes were negatively impacted in March by COVID-19 disruptions. American Society for Reproductive Medicine guidelines issued in mid-March recommending the suspension of new treatment cycles resulted in a majority of co's members being unable to complete diagnostics or initiate new treatment cycles; ASRM has more recently updated its guidelines to provide fertility clinics with a path for the gradual resumption of patient care, and co has in the last few weeks begun to see acceleration in the appointment volumes and the dispensing of fertility medications. Co mentioned that it has been "shielded from the worst impacts of the historic levels of unemployment due to the composition of [its] client base." Spiked to two-month highs. PGTI (11.9 +21.75%): Posted upside Q1 EPS and revs (+26.8% yr/yr to $220.2 mln, including contributions from the NewSouth acquisition). Adj. EBITDA grew +39%. Co has withdrawn its annual guidance, but it noted that it expects Q2 consolidated net sales to decline 7-10% yr/yr, primarily as a result of COVID-19 and a related reduction in orders. Co is "seeing a building pipeline of orders in [its] Florida markets in May" and is beginning to build back capacity there to meet recovering demand. Rises to two-month highs.Small Cap LosersVREX (18 -28.88%): Missed expectations for Q2 EPS and revs. In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, co experienced a "substantial shift in mix between and within [its] business segments that lowered [its] overall margins." Co expects uncertainty in demand for certain products for medical and industrial applications and increased variability in supply chain and manufacturing productivity to continue through at least the remainder of the fiscal year. Withdrew its previously-issued FY20 guidance. Downgraded to Neutral from Overweight at JPMorgan. INFN (4.45 -23.36%): Missed expectations for Q1 EPS on upside revs (+12.8% yr/yr to $330.27 mln). Issued in-line guidance for Q2. Co stated that it is on-track for ICE6 delivery this year. Downgraded to Market Perform at Northland Capital. Drops to its lowest levels since late March. RIG (1.38 -18.39%): Sees volatility on above average volume alongside certain peers in the lagging energy sector. Among recent energy industry press and data, US commercial crude oil inventories decreased by 0.7 mln barrels from the previous week, and OPEC stated in a monthly report that it now expects world oil demand to drop by 9.07 mb/d in 2020.

The S&P 500 is down 1.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 2.0%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.6%.Prior to the open, Fed Chair Powell said the economic outlook remains uncertain and is subject to significant downside risks. In addition, Mr. Powell repeated that the central bank is committed to doing more, except tampering with negative interest rates, and said additional fiscal stimulus could be worth it if it helps avoid long-term pain.There was nothing out of the ordinary in Fed Powell's speech, and the S&P 500 even traded positive at one point this morning. Still, the market has had to contend with valuation concerns, growing skepticism against China, and road bumps in COVID-19 progress.At this juncture, all 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading lower with the energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.1%) sectors leading the retreat. The real estate (-0.9%) and consumer staples (-0.4%) sectors are the lone sectors down less than 1.0%.Tensions with China have been stirred by the FBI confirming China-affiliated cyber actors have targeted U.S. organizations conducting COVID-19-related research. On a related note, Bloomberg Law reported that the COVID-19 test from Abbott Labs (ABT 92.47, -1.33, -1.4%) may miss as many as half of positive cases.Investors are seeking some protection against further equity weakness, evidenced by the 9% gain in the CBOE Volatility Index (35.96, +2.94, +8.9%) and have taken some safety in longer-dated U.S. Treasuries. The 10-yr yield is currently down four basis points to 0.64%.Note, the market has come off session lows, helped by a gain in shares of Amazon (AMZN 2377.52, +20.57, +0.9%).Reviewing today's economic data:The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 1.3% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -0.5%), marking its biggest decrease since records began in December 2009.

The R&O was adopted during the FCC's May 13 Open Meeting. The new regulatory framework will allow 900 MHz licensees, like Anterix, to obtain broadband licenses and includes operational and technical rules to minimize interference to narrowband operations. "We applaud the FCC for this bold decision to repurpose under-utilized spectrum, unleashing the power of broadband for utilities and other enterprises to build private LTE communications networks," said Morgan O'Brien, CEO of Anterix. "For the utility sector, grid modernization has been a critical industry priority, but the scarcity of foundational spectrum to support necessary wireless broadband communications had constrained its efforts. This unanimous decision sends a strong signal that the FCC 'walks the walk' of revising its rules to clear scarce spectrum [...] to make way for innovation, efficiency and competition."11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$22 bln 30-year Treasury bond auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.325% Bid-to-cover: 2.35 Indirect bid: 66.4% Direct bid: 11.0% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.225% Bid-to-cover: 2.31 Indirect bid: 61.2% Direct bid: 15.5%11:20XLF Sector Briefing: Financials (20.75 -0.54)Ten out of eleven sectors trade in negative territory today with financials (-2.3%) showing relative weakness. The growth-sensitive sector has fallen 6.8% so far this week and it is down 32.6% for the year, which leaves it only ahead of energy (-3.9%; -40.5% year-to-date) on this year's leaderboard.The market remains concerned that U.S. interest rates will be pressured into negative territory by external factors, which would pose a significant challenge to insurers and banks. Fed Chairman Powell reiterated today that the Fed does not view negative rates as appropriate for the U.S., but the market is also aware that the Fed's hand could be forced by global developments.Asset managers like Blackrock (BLK 474.21, +19.77, +4.4%) and providers of market data represent a small pocket of strength within the sector as they benefit from increased client activity.Notable movers:Harford Financial Services (HIG 32.29, -1.86, -5.5%): weakest performer in the sector, falling to a five-week low. Discover Financial (DFS 37.17, -2.03, -5.2%): sliding to a two-week low after finding resistance near its 50-day moving average (39.51). Citizens Financial (CFG 19.06, -1.08, -5.3%): dipping to a three-week low after finding resistance near its 50-day moving average (20.65) yesterday. Wells Fargo (WFC 22.87, -1.17, -4.8%): weakest performer among major banks, falling to its lowest level since late 2011. AIG (AIG 25.40, -1.15, -4.4%): sliding back below its 50-day moving average (25.56). Bank of America (BAC 20.93, -0.94, -4.3%): trading at its lowest level since early April.

Blackrock (BLK 474.21, +19.77, +4.4%): rising back above its 200-day moving average (469.93).11:11TALKX Market Briefing: Pace of recovery in questionThe major indices are mixed, courtesy in large part of Fed Chair Powell who said in a pre-open speech that the future is highly uncertain and that there are significant downside risks to the outlook. He went on to suggest that the Fed will continue to do what is necessary to help support the recovery but noted that further fiscal support could be needed to help avoid long-term damage to the economy.In brief, he sounded generally cautious about recovery prospects, which has led to an otherwise cautious trading tone in the stock market.That caution has manifested itself in the relative strength of the health care (+0.1%), consumer staples (-0.1%), and information technology (-0.1%) sectors, the latter of which has been heavily influenced by the relative strength of its mega-cap leaders, Microsoft (MSFT 182.29, -0.22, -0.1%) and Apple (AAPL 313.08, +1.67, +0.5%).Similarly, relative strength in Amazon.com (AMZN 2386.61, +29.66, +1.3%), Alphabet (GOOG 1370.89, -4.85, -0.4%), and Facebook (FB 208.70, -1.40, -0.7%) has helped temper today's losses.Today's biggest loser is the energy sector (-3.9%) followed by the financial (-2.2%), industrials (-1.8%), and materials (-1.3%) sectors, which is befitting a market that might be second-guessing the pace of recovery prospects in the wake of the Fed chair's speech and the understanding that Senate Republicans are reportedly balking at a $3 trillion coronavirus relief package unveiled yesterday by House Democrats. Some reports have suggested it has been deemed "dead on arrival."The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%; the S&P 500 is down 0.6%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.0%; and the Russell 2000 is down 1.8%.10:43OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:KDP Jun 26 calls are seeing interest with 3720 contracts trading vs. open int of 200, pushing implied vol up around 4 points to ~34%.

To preserve cash, management acted on a variety of cost-saving measures, including the deferral of heavy maintenance costs and over 6,000 voluntary employee leaves of absence (~40% of its workforce). With limited visibility into the recovery, GOL's current planning scenario assumes (-45)% y/y 2020 capacity, including (-30)% y/y by 4Q20, but it has the flexibility to respond to prevailing demand trends. The Company has grounded 120 aircraft (~92% of its fleet) since March 28 and flights in April were operated from the Guarulhos airport in So Paulo to all of Brazil's state capitals and the federal capital in Brasilia, which represents 7% of the April 2019 schedule. As of April 30, the Company had R$4.0 billion in total liquidity, which implies over 10 months of cash on hand (excluding refunds and restricted cash).

Economic forecasts are uncertain in the best of times, and today the virus raises a new set of questions: How quickly and sustainably will it be brought under control? Can new outbreaks be avoided as social-distancing measures lapse? How long will it take for confidence to return and normal spending to resume? And what will be the scope and timing of new therapies, testing, or a vaccine? The answers to these questions will go a long way toward setting the timing and pace of the economic recovery. Since the answers are currently unknowable, policies will need to be ready to address a range of possible outcomes.""We ought to do what we can to avoid these outcomes, and that may require additional policy measures. At the Fed, we will continue to use our tools to their fullest until the crisis has passed and the economic recovery is well under way. Recall that the Fed has lending powers, not spending powers. A loan from a Fed facility can provide a bridge across temporary interruptions to liquidity, and those loans will help many borrowers get through the current crisis. But the recovery may take some time to gather momentum, and the passage of time can turn liquidity problems into solvency problems. Additional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it if it helps avoid long-term economic damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery. This tradeoff is one for our elected representatives, who wield powers of taxation and spending."Full Speech09:02WIRES On The WiresJohn Stephens, senior EVP and CFO of AT&T (T), spoke today at the MoffettNathanson Media & Communications Summit, where he provided an update to shareholders.

Given the impact of COVID-19, booking volumes for the remainder of 2020 are meaningfully lower than the same time last year at prices that are down low-single digits. Due to the suspension in sailings, booking trends reflect elevated cancellations for 2020 and more typical levels for 2021 and beyond. Although still early in the booking cycle, the booked position for 2021 is within historical ranges when compared to same time last year with 2021 prices up mid-single digits compared to 2020, subject to the uncertainty around the duration of our suspension of sailings and resumption of service. The company has instituted several programs in order to best serve its guests: for cancelled cruises, guests are offered the choice of future cruise credits valued at 125% of the initial cruise fare paid in lieu of providing cash refunds. These future cruise credits can be redeemed on any sailing on or before December 31, 2021. As of April 30, 2020, approximately 45% of the guests have requested cash refunds. For non-cancelled cruises, the company has implemented a "Cruise with Confidence" policy. This policy allows guests to cancel up to 48 hours prior to sailing (for sailings on or before August 1, 2020) and receive a full credit for their fare usable until April 30, 2022. As of March 31, 2020, the company had $2.4 billion in customer deposits. This includes approximately $0.8 billion of future cruise credits related to previously announced voyage cancellations through June 11, 2020. The Company also continues to take future bookings for 2020, 2021 and 2022, and receive new customer deposits and final payments on these bookings.The company estimates its cash burn to be, on average, in the range of approximately $250 million to $275 million per month during a prolonged suspension of operations. This range includes ongoing ship operating expenses, administrative expenses, debt service expense, hedging costs, expected necessary capital expenditures (net of committed financings in the case of newbuilds) and excludes cash refunds of customer deposits as well as cash inflows from new and existing bookings. The company is considering ways to further reduce the average monthly requirement under a further prolonged out-of-service scenario and during start-up of operations. The Company continues to identify and evaluate further actions to improve its liquidity. These include and are not limited to: further reductions in capital expenditures, operating expenses and administrative costs and additional financings.07:48TMO Thermo Fisher expands response to the COVID-19 pandemic by developing a total antibodies test in collaboration with WuXi Diagnostics and Mayo Clinic (331.72 )The new test is the result of ongoing collaboration between all three organizations, including clinical evaluation and support from Mayo Clinic.

At three months, he also had leukocyte enzyme and plasma enzyme activity levels approximately three times higher than the mean activity level of the first three patients in the same trial at the same timepoint.New data will also be presented from the first patient dosed in the investigator-sponsored Phase 1/2 trial of AVR-RD-04 for cystinosis, a progressive disease marked by the accumulation of cystine in cellular organelles known as lysosomes. This buildup can cause debilitating symptoms including kidney failure, corneal damage and thyroid dysfunction, often leading to a shortened lifespan. Currently, more than 90 percent of treated cystinosis patients require a kidney transplant in the second or third decade of life.

Combined net sales for the fiscal months of March and April (the first two months of Q3) were $565.4 mln, a decrease of 7.8% yr/yr.As previously announced, the company experienced an unusually large gap between bookings and what was invoiced in fiscal March 2020. This trend continued through fiscal April 2020, with bookings increasing at a double-digit pace over the prior year period due to the continuing surge in large safety and janitorial orders, scarcity of product and longer lead times. Order backlog increased substantially versus the prior year period and is well above $100 mln. The company anticipates many of these bookings to invoice in fiscal May and Q4. During fiscal April, the company's non-safety and janitorial product lines saw a significant decline versus the prior year due to the impact of prolonged customer shutdowns and world-wide efforts to control COVID-19. The company has seen solid gross margins through fiscal March and fiscal April on strong realization of its mid-year price increase, as well as initial results from the supplier initiatives announced earlier in the fiscal year. The company intends to continue reporting monthly sales trends until the heightened uncertainty caused by COVID-19 diminishes.16:50ERA Era Group and Bristow Group appoint current Era Group CEO Chris Bradshaw as CEO for combined company (4.61 -0.20)Bristow Group and Era Group announced the new global organization structure and the selection of the executive leadership team that will help create a financially stronger industry leader in offshore helicopter transportation and search and rescue services.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial negative effect on the global markets, and has created uncertainty, volatility and dislocation among a wide variety of sectors. The scale, scope and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, revenues and operating results is unpredictable and depends on many factors outside of our control. We note that revenues during the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and we expect it to continue to have an adverse effect on our business, revenues and operating results in the short term. However, while our CF revenues will be adversely impacted for an indeterminable period of time by the economic effects of COVID-19, we have seen an increase in the demand for services in our FR business."16:21WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryThe S&P 500 fell 2.1% on Tuesday, with a bulk of losses coming in afternoon trade and into the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-1.9%) and Nasdaq Composite (-2.1%) declined comparably to the benchmark index, while the Russell 2000 underperformed with a 3.5% decline.There wasn't one specific catalyst driving stocks lower, but profit-taking interest might have been fueled by legislation put forth by Senate Republicans to impose sanctions on China and by Los Angeles reportedly planning to extend the county's stay-at-home order for another three months.News of the Senate proposal did seem to initiate the selling in the market, which had been trading flat beforehand. The LA news also coincided with the late-day selling, as it paid heed to NIAID Director Fauci's Senate testimony in which he cautioned about reopening the economy too soon.It's unclear if the market was truly perturbed by the news or if it provided a good excuse for some overdue selling. In either case, all 11 S&P 500 sectors closed in negative territory, led lower by the real estate (-4.3%), industrials (-2.8%), and financials (-2.7%) sectors. The consumer staples (-0.9%) and utilities (-0.9%) sectors declined the least.Bank and airline stocks were among today's weakest performers, which was made evident in sharp declines in the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE 27.51, -1.45, -5.0%) and the U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS 12.68, -0.57, -4.3%).Bank stocks were pressured by a modest decline in Treasury yields and by President Trump rehashing calls for negative interest rates. Airline stocks were pressured by Boeing (BA 125.22, -3.69, -2.9%) CEO Calhoun telling NBC's "Today" show that a major U.S. airline could go bankrupt because of COVID-19 disruptions.Conversely, shares of Uber (UBER 32.40, +0.76, +2.4%) and GrubHub (GRUB 60.39, +13.60, +29.1%) exhibited strength after it was reported that Uber made a bid to acquire GrubHub.As previously noted, U.S. Treasury yields declined amid an uptick in demand for the safe-haven asset. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.16%, and the 10-yr yield declined five basis points to 0.68%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 99.97. WTI crude rose 5.3%, or $1.30, to $25.76/bbl.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data:The Consumer Price Index declined 0.8% m/m in April, as expected, while core CPI, which excludes food and energy, declined 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus -0.2%). That was the largest drop in total CPI since December 2008 and the largest drop on record going back to 1957 for core CPI.The key takeaway from the report is that it is a telltale reminder that the Federal Reserve isn't moving off the zero bound anytime soon.The Treasury Budget for April showed a deficit of $737.85 billion versus a surplus of $160.3 billion in the same period a year ago. The key takeaway from the report is that the huge swing in the budget was a function of the tax filing deadline being extended, and government spending surging, due to stimulus measures employed in response to the COVID-19 impact.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for April declined to 90.9 from 96.4 in March.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for April and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +0.3% YTDS&P 500 -11.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -16.7% YTDRussell 2000 -23.6% YTD16:21MYL Mylan N.V. confirms agreement to distribute Gilead Sciences' (GILD) remdesivir for the potential treatment of COVID-19 in certain regions (16.23 -0.72)Mylan N.V. announced, as part of its ongoing efforts to support patients and public health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, a global collaboration with Gilead Sciences to expand access to the investigational antiviral remdesivir for the potential treatment of COVID-19.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 2.2%, the Nasdaq Composite declined 1.6%, and the Russell 2000 declined 3.3%.In his speech prior to the open, Fed Chair Powell said the economic outlook remained highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risks, adding that a recovery may take some time to gather momentum. Mr. Powell also said the Fed can do more to help the financial system but dismissed the notion of implementing negative interest rates.The S&P 500 did trade in positive territory for a moment after the open, but sellers quickly regained control with losses broadening out to all 11 S&P 500 sectors. The energy (-4.4%) and financials (-3.0%) sectors took the biggest hits, while the consumer staples (-0.9%) and utilities (-0.9%) sectors declined less than 1.0%.Investors were reminded today that part of the economic uncertainty referenced by Fed Chair Powell included U.S-China tensions and hurdles in COVID-19 testing. The latter was noted by a New York University study that suggested Abbott Lab's (ABT 92.16, -1.64, -1.8%) COVID-19 test is prone to false negatives.Adding to U.S.-China tensions, the FBI confirmed that China-affiliated cyber actors have targeted U.S. organizations conducting COVID-19-related research. Also, a report out of China indicated that Beijing is mulling punitive countermeasure on the U.S. as a result of lawsuits that are seeking COVID-19-related damages.Separately, valuation concerns were voiced by a couple of influential names. Legendary investor Stanley Druckenmiller said the risk-reward for equity is maybe as bad as he's seen it in his career.

Most of that decline was attributed to a 3.3% drop in prices for final demand goods.The Producer Price Index for April may not be convincing enough to the Fed to go down the negative interest rate road, yet the key takeaway is that it will certainly keep it on the path at the lower bound.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index increased 0.3% following a 0.1% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report and Export and Import Prices for April on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite -1.2% YTDS&P 500 -12.7% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -18.5% YTDRussell 2000 -26.1% YTD16:23FLO Flowers Foods beats by $0.08, beats on revs; guides FY20 EPS in-line, revs in-line (22.61 +0.16)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.41 per share, $0.08 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.33; revenues rose 6.7% year/year to $1.35 bln vs the $1.32 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

VIB7734 was designed to deplete plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), an important source of inflammatory mediators in autoimmune diseases. This trial includes three cohorts of patients at ascending dose levels. Cohorts 2 and 3 enrolled patients with CLE. Key measures include safety and tolerability, pDC depletion in peripheral blood and skin lesions of patients with CLE, and Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) scores. Interim results include safety data from patients in cohorts 1 and 2 and a subset of patients in cohort 3, pharmacodynamics results from cohort 2, and CLASI results from cohort 2 and a subset of patients in cohort 3. The interim findings indicated safety and tolerability comparable to placebo control across all cohorts, potent depletion of pDC both in peripheral blood and in inflamed CLE skin lesion biopsies in cohort 2, and dose-dependent reduction in CLASI scores of 4 points or more, which is considered a clinically meaningful change, in cohorts 2 and 3.Based on these results, the company intends to advance the program into several Phase 2 clinical studies in indications with high unmet need that are thought to be driven by pDCs.16:19PRO PROS Holdings appoints Les Rechan as COO (30.21 -2.22)In this new role reporting to Andres Reiner, PROS President and CEO, Mr. Rechan is now responsible for all go-to-market and customer experience and engagement functions to further scale and grow these operations globally.

First quarter 2020 unique aligner shipments up 12% to 122,751, compared to 109,894 in the first quarter of 2019. Average aligner gross sales price of $1,770 for the first quarter of 2020, compared to $1,767 for the first quarter of 2019. Business Outlook: Since Q1, the Company has seen robust performance in its impression kit business, despite a significant reduction in marketing spend. This demonstrates that investments in brand building and marketing efficiency have begun to pay dividends. Specifically, although marketing spend was reduced by approximately 90% over the past 60 days, kit and scan volume was down by only ~40%. Additionally, because the Company has very few fixed costs and the vast majority of its SmileShops around the world operate on month-to-month leases, it has been able to take decisive action, including the temporary closure of all SmileShops other than those in Hong Kong. Additionally, SmileDirectClub has entered into a new debt facility with HPS Investment Partners. After refinancing the previous debt facility, the Company will have approximately $420 million in cash on its balance sheet, giving the liquidity needed to continue its growth plans and manage potential downsides with COVID-19.16:09RARE Ultragenyx Pharma announces "positive" longer-term data from first three cohorts of Phase 1/2 study of DTX301 in OTC deficiency (64.08 -2.21)Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical announced positive longer-term safety and efficacy data from the first three cohorts of the ongoing Phase 1/2 study of DTX301, an investigational adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy for the treatment of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency.

Co stated that in the first days of the pandemic, it observed in Brazil a significant increase in interest in investments; its Retail Research Platform and InfoMoney portal reached record audiences. Co's active clients totaled 2.0 mln at the end of Q1, up +81% yr/yr, driven by the expansion of co's direct and B2B channels and its three retail brands. Reaches two-month highs.BLK (487.92 +7.37%): Priced the secondary offering of 28,753,248 shares of common stock held by PNC Financial (PNC) at $420/share. The stock rebounds from yesterday's circa 8% drop. ALC (56.43 +6.07%): Topped consensus for Q1 EPS and revs. Widespread shutdowns in March negatively impacted co's results following "strong sales growth" in both of co's franchises during the first two months of the year. Co expects Q2 results to be negatively impacted by the ongoing coronavirus crisis, but given the critical nature of eye care, customer demand is expected to resume as conditions normalize and improve through the back half of the year.Large Cap LosersPODD (194.85 -11.71%): Announced a public offering of $500 mln of its common stock, or 2,369,668 shares priced at $211.00/share; proceeds are expected to be dedicated to general corporate purposes.

The current S&P CapitalIQ consensus is for adjusted EPS of $0.69 and revenue of $211.3 mln. JACK previously withdrew its FY20 guidance, so we certainly do not expect any full year guidance. Even before the pandemic, JACK did not typically provide quarterly guidance, so we're also not expecting any JunQ guidance.In terms of key metrics, system same-store comps are clearly important. However, JACK has already announced Q2 comps, which were -4.2%. Comps were running at +5.2% for the seven weeks ending March 8, but the final five weeks of the quarter (March 9-April 12), comps were -17.0%. So this won't be new information, but hopefully we get some directional comp data since the quarter ended on April 12. On April 16, Jack in the Box had some big news as it named Darin Harris as it's new CEO. He will take over no later than June 15. Most recently, Harris served as CEO of North America for IWG PLC, the holding group for several providers of over 1,000 flexible workspaces. Harris is also the former CEO of CiCi's Pizza. Harris takes over from Lenny Comma, who plans to retire. Hopefully, we will get some initial insight in terms of possible changes he may make. In terms of the pandemic impact, the company has had minimal temporary closures, with over 99% of restaurants open on each day during the COVID-19 pandemic. All locations are operating in an off-premise capacity, mostly via drive-thru lanes. In terms of how JACK performs relative to consensus, it can be somewhat volatile. It has reported two EPS misses in a row, including a large $0.21 miss in Q1. On a final note, Wendy's (WEN) recently reported good Q1 results. What jumped off the page to us was Wendy's US weekly comp performance in early Q2, which had returned to nearly flat comps even as its locations are limited to drive-thru/delivery. We will see if JACK saw a similar bullish comp direction in late April and early May.15:17SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- 8x8 (EGHT) pulls back following quarterly earnings press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersSNX (90.97 +8.75%): Guided for Q2 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.00-1.00.

Treasuries started the cash session with modest gains after concerns about a second wave of coronavirus infections weighed on risk tolerance in Asia and Europe. Treasuries climbed to fresh highs in mid-morning trade, responding to the release of Fed Chairman Jay Powell's prepared remarks from a virtual event hosted by the Peterson Institute. The Fed Chairman said that he expects only a gradual economic recovery and he repeated his opposition to a negative interest rate policy in the U.S. Treasuries slipped back to their starting levels well before the conclusion of the event with Chairman Powell and remained in that range into the late morning, when a push to fresh highs took place alongside selling in equities. Treasuries remained near their highs into midday action but made another return toward their starting levels after the completion of a $22 bln 30-yr bond auction, which was met with lukewarm demand. The U.S. Dollar Index retreated toward its 50-day moving average (99.53) in overnight trade but rallied 0.3% to 100.24 as the day went on, reclaiming its loss from yesterday.

Today's Data: The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 1.3% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -0.5%), marking its biggest decrease since records began in December 2009. Most of that decline was attributed to a 3.3% drop in prices for final demand goods. Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus -0.2%), leaving it up just 0.6% yr/yr. The Producer Price Index for April may not be convincing enough to the Fed to go down the negative interest rate road, yet the key takeaway is that it will certainly keep it on the path at the lower bound. The weekly MBA Mortgage Index ticked up 0.3% to follow last week's 0.1% uptick. The Purchase Index jumped 10.6% while the Refinance Index fell 3.3%. Weekly crude oil inventories decreased by 750,000 barrels after increasing by 4.6 mln barrels during the previous week.

The company has been working aggressively the last few months to repurpose its cell-based vaccine platform targeting solid tumors for use against viral diseases.Orgenesis believes its new vaccine platform offers a unique approach to cell vaccination that holds promise for an affordable and reproducible vaccine for both COVID-19 and other viral diseases. The company is moving forward with planned animal testing for its cell-based vaccine platform in COVID-19 and looks forward to providing a more detailed timeline of activities including plans for initial human testing, assuming clearance from the FDA and/or other non-US regulatory bodies to do so.14:09CSCO Cisco: Earnings Preview -- Will be our first in-depth look at a major tech company that includes the pandemic's impact on April (41.83 -1.39)Cisco Systems (CSCO) is set to report Q3 (Apr) results today after the close with a call to follow at 4:30pm ET. The current S&P CapitalIQ consensus is for adjusted EPS of $0.71 and revenue of $11.85 bln, an -8.6% yr/yr decline. Cisco typically guides for EPS and revenue for the next quarter. The company has been silent in terms of whether it plans to provide guidance going forward, so we'll see.Last quarter, Cisco guided to Q3 adjusted EPS of $0.79-0.81 and a revenue decline of -3.5% to -1.5%. However, with consensus estimates well below this guidance, it seems analysts are skeptical Cisco will hit those numbers. Current guidance for non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 is 32.5-33.5%. Cisco is a particularly important tech name to watch with earnings. Because it's so large and touches so many areas, it's a great barometer to get a general sense for enterprise sending levels on IT. It's also the first big tech name to report that includes the month of April. The pandemic hit in mid-to-late March and while other IT names provided the pandemic's impact on the tail end of their Q1 results, this will be our first in-depth look at a major tech company that includes the impact on April. We should also get some color on how the summer may play out. In terms of how Cisco performs relative to consensus, it typically beats modestly on EPS in the $0.01-0.03 range with modest revenue upside. It has not missed on EPS or revs in the past five years, so if it did so, that would be notable13:48XLP Sector Briefing: Consumer Staples (57.09 -0.46)All eleven sectors trade in negative territory with five groups down 2.0% or more. Growth-sensitive sectors are at the forefront of today's retreat while countercyclical groups have fared a bit better.The consumer staples sector (-0.8%) shows a slimmer loss than most of its peers, continuing this week's trend. The sector is down 1.8% for the week versus a 3.9% week-to-date loss in the S&P 500 (-1.9%).Roughly 2/3 of the sector's components trade in the red while a couple major retailers and a handful of food companies hold gains, resulting in outperformance versus the broader market.Notable movers:General Mills (GIS 63.64, +1.13, +1.8%): leading component, rising to its best level since early 2017.

Co commented that volumes were negatively impacted in March by COVID-19 disruptions. American Society for Reproductive Medicine guidelines issued in mid-March recommending the suspension of new treatment cycles resulted in a majority of co's members being unable to complete diagnostics or initiate new treatment cycles; ASRM has more recently updated its guidelines to provide fertility clinics with a path for the gradual resumption of patient care, and co has in the last few weeks begun to see acceleration in the appointment volumes and the dispensing of fertility medications.

Co is "seeing a building pipeline of orders in [its] Florida markets in May" and is beginning to build back capacity there to meet recovering demand. Rises to two-month highs.Small Cap LosersVREX (18 -28.88%): Missed expectations for Q2 EPS and revs. In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, co experienced a "substantial shift in mix between and within [its] business segments that lowered [its] overall margins." Co expects uncertainty in demand for certain products for medical and industrial applications and increased variability in supply chain and manufacturing productivity to continue through at least the remainder of the fiscal year. Withdrew its previously-issued FY20 guidance. Downgraded to Neutral from Overweight at JPMorgan. INFN (4.45 -23.36%): Missed expectations for Q1 EPS on upside revs (+12.8% yr/yr to $330.27 mln).

RIG (1.38 -18.39%): Sees volatility on above average volume alongside certain peers in the lagging energy sector. Among recent energy industry press and data, US commercial crude oil inventories decreased by 0.7 mln barrels from the previous week, and OPEC stated in a monthly report that it now expects world oil demand to drop by 9.07 mb/d in 2020.

The S&P 500 is down 1.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 2.0%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.6%.Prior to the open, Fed Chair Powell said the economic outlook remains uncertain and is subject to significant downside risks. In addition, Mr. Powell repeated that the central bank is committed to doing more, except tampering with negative interest rates, and said additional fiscal stimulus could be worth it if it helps avoid long-term pain.There was nothing out of the ordinary in Fed Powell's speech, and the S&P 500 even traded positive at one point this morning. Still, the market has had to contend with valuation concerns, growing skepticism against China, and road bumps in COVID-19 progress.At this juncture, all 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading lower with the energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.1%) sectors leading the retreat. The real estate (-0.9%) and consumer staples (-0.4%) sectors are the lone sectors down less than 1.0%.Tensions with China have been stirred by the FBI confirming China-affiliated cyber actors have targeted U.S. organizations conducting COVID-19-related research. On a related note, Bloomberg Law reported that the COVID-19 test from Abbott Labs (ABT 92.47, -1.33, -1.4%) may miss as many as half of positive cases.Investors are seeking some protection against further equity weakness, evidenced by the 9% gain in the CBOE Volatility Index (35.96, +2.94, +8.9%) and have taken some safety in longer-dated U.S. Treasuries. The 10-yr yield is currently down four basis points to 0.64%.Note, the market has come off session lows, helped by a gain in shares of Amazon (AMZN 2377.52, +20.57, +0.9%).Reviewing today's economic data:The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 1.3% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -0.5%), marking its biggest decrease since records began in December 2009. Most of that decline was attributed to a 3.3% drop in prices for final demand goods.The Producer Price Index for April may not be convincing enough to the Fed to go down the negative interest rate road, yet the key takeaway is that it will certainly keep it on the path at the lower bound.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index increased 0.3% following a 0.1% increase in the prior week.12:50SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Industrials: GE (135.15 mln -7.75%), DAL (45.34 mln -7.85%), AAL (42.39 mln -7.15%), UAL (36.36 mln -9.66%)Consumer Discretionary: JCP (157.66 mln +18.65%), F (57.58 mln -4.42%), CCL (37.91 mln -8.11%), NCLH (36.01 mln -7.84%)Information Technology: AMD (43.61 mln -3.8%), AAPL (26.86 mln -1.94%)Financials: BAC (69.41 mln -4.87%), SQQQ (60.64 mln +5.91%), WFC (47.84 mln -7.61%), TQQQ (36.14 mln -5.9%), QQQ (34.05 mln -1.92%)Energy: MRO (53.15 mln -8.05%), RIG (44.34 mln -19.53%), CPE (36.44 mln -12.58%), ET (28.74 mln -7.66%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: VREX (4.88x -29.19%), CBAY (3.28x -15.07%), PODD (2.77x -11.06%), MYOK (2.76x -6.31%), ALLK (2.03x -8.05%)Industrials: PGTI (3.68x +22.82%), UPWK (3.21x +1.22%)Consumer Discretionary: JCP (7.91x +18.65%)Information Technology: INFN (3.95x -23.02%), EGHT (3.46x -23.46%), TSEM (3.43x -2.98%), QTWO (2.97x -2.58%), CYBR (2.79x -12.57%), LOGI (2.68x +1.77%), VECO (2.67x -12.46%), CNDT (2.13x -10.28%)Financials: BLK (6.72x +4.35%)Consumer Staples: UNFI (10.52x +43%)12:48SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: MESO (12.71 +11.59%), TAK (18.96 +7.2%), RCUS (30.85 +5.33%), TBIO (14.18 +3.69%), PRAH (89.66 +2.81%)Industrials: PGTI (12 +22.82%), EXPO (64.43 +2.73%)Consumer Discretionary: JCP (0.24 +18.65%), GPRO (3.55 +4.48%), CHGG (64.15 +3.62%)Information Technology: SNX (92.25 +10.28%)Financials: SQQQ (11.64 +5.91%), BLK (474.22 +4.35%)Energy: STNG (17.9 +4.13%)Consumer Staples: UNFI (22.18 +43%), NGVC (14.73 +7.68%), BGS (24.57 +4.53%), BRFS (3.64 +4%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VREX (17.93 -29.19%), SIEN (2.32 -15.33%), TVTY (8.47 -15.22%), CBAY (3.55 -15.07%), ADAP (4.24 -14.1%)Industrials: LDL (9.66 -17.08%), CAR (10.35 -15.58%)Consumer Discretionary: HUD (4.5 -18.12%), CPS (9.25 -16.21%)Information Technology: EGHT (15.63 -23.46%), INFN (4.47 -23.02%)Energy: FTSI (3.76 -22.6%), OMP (4.44 -19.87%), RIG (1.36 -19.53%), AR (2.46 -16.89%), OAS (0.41 -15.15%), CDEV (0.79 -14.87%), XOG (0.29 -14.77%), PTEN (2.91 -14.41%)Consumer Staples: COTY (3.71 -14.36%)12:42SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/ Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: ONEM CSCO FLO JACK NVGS OII SDC STE VRTUTomorrow Morning: AZUL BAM AG GDS KEM NICE NCLH NVMI SPNS SSYS WNC WIX12:14TALKX Market Briefing: Broad-based de-riskingThe stock market has extended its losses in a broad-based sell-off that has connections to an understanding that it has moved too far, too fast.

The R&O was adopted during the FCC's May 13 Open Meeting. The new regulatory framework will allow 900 MHz licensees, like Anterix, to obtain broadband licenses and includes operational and technical rules to minimize interference to narrowband operations. "We applaud the FCC for this bold decision to repurpose under-utilized spectrum, unleashing the power of broadband for utilities and other enterprises to build private LTE communications networks," said Morgan O'Brien, CEO of Anterix. "For the utility sector, grid modernization has been a critical industry priority, but the scarcity of foundational spectrum to support necessary wireless broadband communications had constrained its efforts. This unanimous decision sends a strong signal that the FCC 'walks the walk' of revising its rules to clear scarce spectrum [...] to make way for innovation, efficiency and competition."11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$22 bln 30-year Treasury bond auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.325% Bid-to-cover: 2.35 Indirect bid: 66.4% Direct bid: 11.0% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.225% Bid-to-cover: 2.31 Indirect bid: 61.2% Direct bid: 15.5%11:20XLF Sector Briefing: Financials (20.75 -0.54)Ten out of eleven sectors trade in negative territory today with financials (-2.3%) showing relative weakness. The growth-sensitive sector has fallen 6.8% so far this week and it is down 32.6% for the year, which leaves it only ahead of energy (-3.9%; -40.5% year-to-date) on this year's leaderboard.The market remains concerned that U.S. interest rates will be pressured into negative territory by external factors, which would pose a significant challenge to insurers and banks. Fed Chairman Powell reiterated today that the Fed does not view negative rates as appropriate for the U.S., but the market is also aware that the Fed's hand could be forced by global developments.Asset managers like Blackrock (BLK 474.21, +19.77, +4.4%) and providers of market data represent a small pocket of strength within the sector as they benefit from increased client activity.Notable movers:Harford Financial Services (HIG 32.29, -1.86, -5.5%): weakest performer in the sector, falling to a five-week low.

He went on to suggest that the Fed will continue to do what is necessary to help support the recovery but noted that further fiscal support could be needed to help avoid long-term damage to the economy.In brief, he sounded generally cautious about recovery prospects, which has led to an otherwise cautious trading tone in the stock market.That caution has manifested itself in the relative strength of the health care (+0.1%), consumer staples (-0.1%), and information technology (-0.1%) sectors, the latter of which has been heavily influenced by the relative strength of its mega-cap leaders, Microsoft (MSFT 182.29, -0.22, -0.1%) and Apple (AAPL 313.08, +1.67, +0.5%).Similarly, relative strength in Amazon.com (AMZN 2386.61, +29.66, +1.3%), Alphabet (GOOG 1370.89, -4.85, -0.4%), and Facebook (FB 208.70, -1.40, -0.7%) has helped temper today's losses.Today's biggest loser is the energy sector (-3.9%) followed by the financial (-2.2%), industrials (-1.8%), and materials (-1.3%) sectors, which is befitting a market that might be second-guessing the pace of recovery prospects in the wake of the Fed chair's speech and the understanding that Senate Republicans are reportedly balking at a $3 trillion coronavirus relief package unveiled yesterday by House Democrats. Some reports have suggested it has been deemed "dead on arrival."The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%; the S&P 500 is down 0.6%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.0%; and the Russell 2000 is down 1.8%.10:43OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:KDP Jun 26 calls are seeing interest with 3720 contracts trading vs. open int of 200, pushing implied vol up around 4 points to ~34%.

To preserve cash, management acted on a variety of cost-saving measures, including the deferral of heavy maintenance costs and over 6,000 voluntary employee leaves of absence (~40% of its workforce). With limited visibility into the recovery, GOL's current planning scenario assumes (-45)% y/y 2020 capacity, including (-30)% y/y by 4Q20, but it has the flexibility to respond to prevailing demand trends.

Economic forecasts are uncertain in the best of times, and today the virus raises a new set of questions: How quickly and sustainably will it be brought under control? Can new outbreaks be avoided as social-distancing measures lapse? How long will it take for confidence to return and normal spending to resume? And what will be the scope and timing of new therapies, testing, or a vaccine? The answers to these questions will go a long way toward setting the timing and pace of the economic recovery. Since the answers are currently unknowable, policies will need to be ready to address a range of possible outcomes.""We ought to do what we can to avoid these outcomes, and that may require additional policy measures. At the Fed, we will continue to use our tools to their fullest until the crisis has passed and the economic recovery is well under way. Recall that the Fed has lending powers, not spending powers. A loan from a Fed facility can provide a bridge across temporary interruptions to liquidity, and those loans will help many borrowers get through the current crisis. But the recovery may take some time to gather momentum, and the passage of time can turn liquidity problems into solvency problems. Additional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it if it helps avoid long-term economic damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery. This tradeoff is one for our elected representatives, who wield powers of taxation and spending."Full Speech09:02WIRES On The WiresJohn Stephens, senior EVP and CFO of AT&T (T), spoke today at the MoffettNathanson Media & Communications Summit, where he provided an update to shareholders.

Given the impact of COVID-19, booking volumes for the remainder of 2020 are meaningfully lower than the same time last year at prices that are down low-single digits. Due to the suspension in sailings, booking trends reflect elevated cancellations for 2020 and more typical levels for 2021 and beyond. Although still early in the booking cycle, the booked position for 2021 is within historical ranges when compared to same time last year with 2021 prices up mid-single digits compared to 2020, subject to the uncertainty around the duration of our suspension of sailings and resumption of service. The company has instituted several programs in order to best serve its guests: for cancelled cruises, guests are offered the choice of future cruise credits valued at 125% of the initial cruise fare paid in lieu of providing cash refunds. These future cruise credits can be redeemed on any sailing on or before December 31, 2021. As of April 30, 2020, approximately 45% of the guests have requested cash refunds. For non-cancelled cruises, the company has implemented a "Cruise with Confidence" policy. This policy allows guests to cancel up to 48 hours prior to sailing (for sailings on or before August 1, 2020) and receive a full credit for their fare usable until April 30, 2022. As of March 31, 2020, the company had $2.4 billion in customer deposits. This includes approximately $0.8 billion of future cruise credits related to previously announced voyage cancellations through June 11, 2020. The Company also continues to take future bookings for 2020, 2021 and 2022, and receive new customer deposits and final payments on these bookings.The company estimates its cash burn to be, on average, in the range of approximately $250 million to $275 million per month during a prolonged suspension of operations. This range includes ongoing ship operating expenses, administrative expenses, debt service expense, hedging costs, expected necessary capital expenditures (net of committed financings in the case of newbuilds) and excludes cash refunds of customer deposits as well as cash inflows from new and existing bookings. The company is considering ways to further reduce the average monthly requirement under a further prolonged out-of-service scenario and during start-up of operations. The Company continues to identify and evaluate further actions to improve its liquidity. These include and are not limited to: further reductions in capital expenditures, operating expenses and administrative costs and additional financings.07:48TMO Thermo Fisher expands response to the COVID-19 pandemic by developing a total antibodies test in collaboration with WuXi Diagnostics and Mayo Clinic (331.72 )The new test is the result of ongoing collaboration between all three organizations, including clinical evaluation and support from Mayo Clinic.

At three months, he also had leukocyte enzyme and plasma enzyme activity levels approximately three times higher than the mean activity level of the first three patients in the same trial at the same timepoint.New data will also be presented from the first patient dosed in the investigator-sponsored Phase 1/2 trial of AVR-RD-04 for cystinosis, a progressive disease marked by the accumulation of cystine in cellular organelles known as lysosomes. This buildup can cause debilitating symptoms including kidney failure, corneal damage and thyroid dysfunction, often leading to a shortened lifespan. Currently, more than 90 percent of treated cystinosis patients require a kidney transplant in the second or third decade of life.

The markets outside of the US appear to be catching up to yesterday's afternoon decline on Wall Street. S&P Futures saw some spillover momentum early on, trading as low as 2825.25 last night. Buyers defended that area and spoos have managed to claw back to around the 2865 area. This is just off the overnight high of 2867.00.In Asia, the major markets were mixed with China edging higher, while Japan fell 0.5%. The Shanghai recovered from early losses after the Wuhan province reported no new coronavirus cases on Tuesday. Markets also applauded China's plan to ramp up testing. The Nikkei opened lower but could not muster enough of a rally to get back into positive territory. The index was weighed down by Toyota (-2%), which reported weaker than expected earnings after the Japanese session on Tuesday. In Europe, the major bourses took a dive right out of the gate and have failed to find solid ground. The region has seen broad-based weakness but financials are among the hardest hit sectors.

The new hearing date is February 2, 2021.On January 29, 2018, the Opposition Division of the EPO concluded the oral proceedings concerning the '355 Patent. The Opposition Division revoked the '355 Patent after considering oppositions from several opponents. On May 7, 2018, the company appealed the Opposition Division's decision to the TBA and filed its detailed grounds of appeal on August 1, 2018. The case was scheduled to be heard on June 18, 2020, but on May 12, 2020, the company received notice from the EPO that, as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the appeal would instead be heard by the TBA on February 2, 2021.If the company receives a favorable ruling following the TBA hearing, it is expected that the TBA will remit the case to the Opposition Division. The company is not entitled to any royalty payments from the Settlement and License Agreement by and among the company and two wholly-owned subsidiaries of Biogen (BIIB) until and unless all remaining elements of the original opposition are resolved in the company's favor. The earliest time the company may expect to receive any revenues from the License Agreement, if at all, is 2024.16:55MSM MSC Industrial reports net sales results for April 2020 (58.61 -3.21)MSC Industrial today announced preliminary, unaudited fiscal April 2020 month and first two fiscal months net sales results. Total net sales for the fiscal month of April (the second month of the company's fiscal Q3) were $235.5 mln, a decrease of 10.5% compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Combined net sales for the fiscal months of March and April (the first two months of Q3) were $565.4 mln, a decrease of 7.8% yr/yr.As previously announced, the company experienced an unusually large gap between bookings and what was invoiced in fiscal March 2020. This trend continued through fiscal April 2020, with bookings increasing at a double-digit pace over the prior year period due to the continuing surge in large safety and janitorial orders, scarcity of product and longer lead times. Order backlog increased substantially versus the prior year period and is well above $100 mln. The company anticipates many of these bookings to invoice in fiscal May and Q4. During fiscal April, the company's non-safety and janitorial product lines saw a significant decline versus the prior year due to the impact of prolonged customer shutdowns and world-wide efforts to control COVID-19. The company has seen solid gross margins through fiscal March and fiscal April on strong realization of its mid-year price increase, as well as initial results from the supplier initiatives announced earlier in the fiscal year. The company intends to continue reporting monthly sales trends until the heightened uncertainty caused by COVID-19 diminishes.16:50ERA Era Group and Bristow Group appoint current Era Group CEO Chris Bradshaw as CEO for combined company (4.61 -0.20)Bristow Group and Era Group announced the new global organization structure and the selection of the executive leadership team that will help create a financially stronger industry leader in offshore helicopter transportation and search and rescue services.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial negative effect on the global markets, and has created uncertainty, volatility and dislocation among a wide variety of sectors. The scale, scope and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, revenues and operating results is unpredictable and depends on many factors outside of our control. We note that revenues during the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and we expect it to continue to have an adverse effect on our business, revenues and operating results in the short term. However, while our CF revenues will be adversely impacted for an indeterminable period of time by the economic effects of COVID-19, we have seen an increase in the demand for services in our FR business."16:21WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryThe S&P 500 fell 2.1% on Tuesday, with a bulk of losses coming in afternoon trade and into the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-1.9%) and Nasdaq Composite (-2.1%) declined comparably to the benchmark index, while the Russell 2000 underperformed with a 3.5% decline.There wasn't one specific catalyst driving stocks lower, but profit-taking interest might have been fueled by legislation put forth by Senate Republicans to impose sanctions on China and by Los Angeles reportedly planning to extend the county's stay-at-home order for another three months.News of the Senate proposal did seem to initiate the selling in the market, which had been trading flat beforehand. The LA news also coincided with the late-day selling, as it paid heed to NIAID Director Fauci's Senate testimony in which he cautioned about reopening the economy too soon.It's unclear if the market was truly perturbed by the news or if it provided a good excuse for some overdue selling. In either case, all 11 S&P 500 sectors closed in negative territory, led lower by the real estate (-4.3%), industrials (-2.8%), and financials (-2.7%) sectors. The consumer staples (-0.9%) and utilities (-0.9%) sectors declined the least.Bank and airline stocks were among today's weakest performers, which was made evident in sharp declines in the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE 27.51, -1.45, -5.0%) and the U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS 12.68, -0.57, -4.3%).Bank stocks were pressured by a modest decline in Treasury yields and by President Trump rehashing calls for negative interest rates. Airline stocks were pressured by Boeing (BA 125.22, -3.69, -2.9%) CEO Calhoun telling NBC's "Today" show that a major U.S. airline could go bankrupt because of COVID-19 disruptions.Conversely, shares of Uber (UBER 32.40, +0.76, +2.4%) and GrubHub (GRUB 60.39, +13.60, +29.1%) exhibited strength after it was reported that Uber made a bid to acquire GrubHub.As previously noted, U.S. Treasury yields declined amid an uptick in demand for the safe-haven asset. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.16%, and the 10-yr yield declined five basis points to 0.68%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 99.97. WTI crude rose 5.3%, or $1.30, to $25.76/bbl.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data:The Consumer Price Index declined 0.8% m/m in April, as expected, while core CPI, which excludes food and energy, declined 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus -0.2%). That was the largest drop in total CPI since December 2008 and the largest drop on record going back to 1957 for core CPI.The key takeaway from the report is that it is a telltale reminder that the Federal Reserve isn't moving off the zero bound anytime soon.The Treasury Budget for April showed a deficit of $737.85 billion versus a surplus of $160.3 billion in the same period a year ago. The key takeaway from the report is that the huge swing in the budget was a function of the tax filing deadline being extended, and government spending surging, due to stimulus measures employed in response to the COVID-19 impact.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for April declined to 90.9 from 96.4 in March.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for April and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +0.3% YTDS&P 500 -11.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -16.7% YTDRussell 2000 -23.6% YTD16:21MYL Mylan N.V. confirms agreement to distribute Gilead Sciences' (GILD) remdesivir for the potential treatment of COVID-19 in certain regions (16.23 -0.72)Mylan N.V. announced, as part of its ongoing efforts to support patients and public health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, a global collaboration with Gilead Sciences to expand access to the investigational antiviral remdesivir for the potential treatment of COVID-19.

Exclusive: She's been falsely accused of starting the coronavirus. Her life has been turned upside downCNN WireApril 27, 2020 Monday 10:41 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1478 wordsByline: Story by Donie O'Sullivan, CNN Business Video by Richa Naik and John General, CNN Business Photographs by Heather Fulbright, CNNDateline: () Body () --  Maatje Benassi, a US Army reservist and mother of two, has become the target of conspiracy theorists who falsely place her at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, saying she brought the disease to China. The false claims are spreading across YouTube every day, so far racking up hundreds of thousands of apparent views, and have been embraced by Chinese Communist Party media. Despite never having tested positive for the coronavirus or experienced symptoms, Benassi and her husband are now subjects of discussion on Chinese social media about the outbreak, including among accounts that are known drivers of large-scale coordinated activities by their followers. The claims have turned their lives upside down. The couple say their home address has been posted online and that, before they shut down their accounts, their social media inboxes were overrun with messages from believers of the conspiracy. "It's like waking up from a bad dream going into a nightmare day after day," Maatje Benassi told CNN Business in an exclusive interview, the first time she has spoken publicly since being smeared online. As the coronavirus has spread around the world, so has misinformation about the disease. Technology giants have touted the steps they are taking to combat coronavirus misinformation, but these efforts have failed to help the Benassis. The family's suffering highlights the potential for blatant falsehoods to be rewarded and amplified by social media platforms. It also serves as a powerful reminder that misinformation online, however wild or obviously untrue it may seem, can have real and lasting consequences offline. Maajte and her husband Matt are still active in their government jobs. Maajte is a civilian employee at the US Army's Fort Belvoir in Virginia where she works as a security officer. Matt, a retired Air Force officer, is a civilian employee with the Air Force at the Pentagon. Despite working for the US government, the couple are experiencing the same feelings of helplessness familiar to others who have been the target of harassment and misinformation. "I want everybody to stop harassing me, because this is cyberbullying to me and it's gone way out of hand," Maajte said while fighting back tears. Matt has tried to get the videos taken down from YouTube and to prevent their spread online. The couple said they contacted an attorney, who told them there was little that could be done, and local police, who told them much the same. Origins of a coronavirus conspiracy theory Conspiracy theories are not dissimilar to viruses, in that they evolve and mutate to spread and survive. Before Maatje Benassi became the main protagonist in this conspiracy, variations had circulated online for months. In the early weeks of the coronavirus, conspiracy theorists began claiming, without evidence, that it was a US biological weapon. Later one member of the Chinese government publicly promoted the notion that the US military brought the virus to China. US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said it was "completely ridiculous and it's irresponsible" for someone speaking on behalf of the Chinese government to promote such a claim. It wasn't until March, months after the first reported coronavirus cases in China, that conspiracy theorists turned their focus to Maatje Benassi. The baseless theory began with her participation in October in the Military World Games, essentially the military Olympics, which was hosted by Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus outbreak began last year. Maatje Benassi competed in the cycling competition there, suffering an accident on the final lap that left her with a fractured rib and a concussion. Despite the crash, Benassi still finished the race, but it turned out to be the start of something worse. While hundreds of athletes from the US military took part in the games, Maatje Benassi was plucked out of the group and given a starring role in the conspiracy theory. Perhaps the most prominent cheerleader of the idea that Benassi had a role in the imaginary plot to infect the world is George Webb, a prolific 59-year-old American misinformation peddler. Webb has for years regularly streamed hours of diatribe live on YouTube, where he has amassed more than 27 million views and almost 100,000 followers. In 2017, CNN revealed how Webb was part of a trio of conspiracy theorists that pushed a false rumor about a cargo ship with a "dirty bomb" that was set to arrive at the Port of Charleston in South Carolina. The bomb never materialized, but the claims did lead to parts of the port -- one of the biggest in America -- being shut down for a time as a safety precaution. Until recently, Webb said, his YouTube videos included advertisements -- meaning the platform, which is owned by Google, was making money from Webb's misinformation, as was Webb himself. Webb even claimed that the Italian DJ Benny Benassi, whose 2002 song "Satisfaction" became a worldwide sensation, had the coronavirus and that he, along with Maatje and Matt Benassi, were part of a Benassi plot connected to the virus. (Benny told CNN Business he has never met Maatje and Matt, and they said that as far as they know, they are not related. Benny pointed out that Benassi is a very common last name in Italy.) Benny Benassi told CNN Business he has not been diagnosed with the coronavirus. Like artists around the world, he canceled his concerts because of social distancing and travel restrictions. (Webb previously claimed the DJ is Dutch, he is not.) In a phone interview with CNN Business on Thursday, which he livestreamed to his followers on YouTube, Webb offered no substantive evidence to support his claims about the Benassis and said he considered himself an "investigative reporter," not a conspiracy theorist. He also said that YouTube recently stopped running ads on his videos after he began talking about the coronavirus. Webb said he had normally made a few hundred dollars a month directly from YouTube. YouTube confirmed to CNN that it was not currently running ads on Webb's channel, but it declined to say whether ads appeared there in the past or provide details on how much money his channel may have made. A company spokesperson said YouTube was committed to promoting accurate information about the coronavirus. The company removed some threatening comments about the Benassis that had been posted under Webb's videos when asked about them by CNN Business.

IoT in Healthcare Market to Garner $457.9 Billion, Globally, by 2025 at 31.1% CAGR, Says Infinium Global ResearchPR NewswireMarch 2, 2020 Monday 9:45 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1670 wordsDateline: PUNE, India, March 2, 2020 BodyPR NewswireInfinium Global Research has recently published a global report on "IoT in Healthcare Market-(Technology - WI-FI, NFC, ZigBee, Bluetooth, and Others; Application - Telemedicine, Clinical Operations, and Workflow Management, Connected Imaging, Inpatient Monitoring, Medication Management, and Others; End User - Hospitals, Surgical Centers, and Clinics, Clinical Research Organization (CRO), Government and Defense Institutions, & Research and Diagnostics Laboratories): Global Industry Analysis, Trends, Market Size and Forecasts to 2025", the reported study estimated the market for IoT in Healthcare will reach up to USD 457.9 Billion, with a compound annual growth rate of 31.1%, in the forecast period (2019-2025).The global healthcare industry is starting its transformation owing to the demand for high-quality care, the pressure of healthcare costs, and the patient profile shift toward patients who are more informed, empowered, and who eventually turn out to be partners of healthcare providers rather than being passive observers of their own health journey. The global population is rising while healthcare budgets are declining, and the burden of chronic diseases is rapidly increasing across the world. All these challenges are placing pressure on doctors, healthcare providers, and governments to look for new technologies so that they can continue providing high-quality healthcare while decreasing costs. The healthcare sector, where mindsets and regulations are slow to change, has been refurbished by the digitalization of data and the incredible development of new technologies and apps to allow access to data anywhere and at any time.Download Exclusive Sample Copy of Report: https://www.infiniumglobalresearch.com/reports/sample-request/1512 Remote Device Management and Data Analytics to Gain Traction in IoT in HealthcareThe IoT is a network of physical devices that uses connectivity to allow the exchange of data. Companies that specialize in healthcare or technology tend to severely invest in IoT. Presently, most tech devices come with some form of connectivity, from wearables such as biosensors to X-ray machines with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. IoT-enabled medical devices deliver critical data that assist health practitioners to perform their jobs. Tasks such as remote patient monitoring, treatment progress observation, and the housing of vaccines are all abilities of medical devices with integrated IoT. The global IoT in the healthcare market is driven by technological advancements, the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, collaboration among companies and changing mentality among consumers.The integration of artificial intelligence with IoT in healthcare is providing better detection and treatment capabilities along with better patient experience, which is also endorsing the adoption of technologies such as AI and IoT in the healthcare industry. Some of the prominent internet of things in healthcare market trends contain the introduction of redefined technology for patient care and well-being as well as providing enhanced patient experience with medical robots. Ongoing advancements, development of innovative technologies, and connectivity solutions have augmented the adoption of IoT in the healthcare sector. Such growing trends are likely to propel the global IoT in healthcare market revenue.The IoT Opens Up New Opportunities for the Healthcare IndustryThe IoT has the potential to reinvent the healthcare sector. It has the potential to change traditional paper-based healthcare treatment through access to real-time patient data and remote patient monitoring. The occurrence of digital healthcare technology has delivered solutions to tackle the growing need for better diagnostics and more personalized therapeutic tools. The IoT plays an important role in a broad range of healthcare applications, from managing chronic diseases to preventing disease, but it also works as a fitness and wellness tracker for athletes. The IoT is changing business models in the healthcare industry; patients and providers both stand to benefit from the IoT for multiple reasons.However, concerns regarding data privacy and security issues may hamper the market growth. The adoption of the IoT in the healthcare industry require stringent policies, and technical security measures should be introduced to share health data with authorized users, organizations, and applications. Furthermore, IoT technology can create new safety risks if it is not designed appropriately, implemented carefully, and used thoughtfully.Major Players Along with Healthcare Providers to Invest in Advance Technology-Based Healthcare SolutionsThe key players are investing in integrated IoT technology with other technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning (ML). Moreover, these players are also collaborating with major regional hospitals to help in research and development, diagnosis, and workflow management, among others. Numerous companies are also providing a wide range of devices and software portfolio to provide advanced solutions to their customers. For instance, GE healthcare launched applications and smart devices by integrating technologies such as AI and IoT for the healthcare industry. Microsoft Corporation provides Azure IoT, which will support the healthcare industry to track devices used for improving the well-being of patients, thereby reducing readmissions (using machine learning), etc.Rising Government Initiatives Towards High-Quality Health SolutionsNorth America is projected to continue its dominance in IoT in the healthcare market during the forecast period. Increasing digitization in healthcare management systems across major hospitals, clinics, and healthcare institutions is anticipated to drive the IoT in the healthcare market in the near future. The rising concerns regarding the aging population is one of the disputes for the U.S. government, which is fuelling the demand for remote patient monitoring and wearable devices.The Asia Pacific is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the near future owing to the rising awareness about health monitoring as the detection of chronic diseases in the young population is increased. This is also expected to boost the adoption of IoT enabled healthcare devices. For example, the advanced healthcare facility is not available in remote locations in India. To cater to the wide demography of the nation, the government of India introduced eHealth policies based on the comprehension and guidelines provided by the information technology sector.Additionally, the government of China is promoting the development of IoT in the healthcare sector and offering funds for smart healthcare facilities. With the enactment of smart city projects, the Chinese government aims to offer accessible healthcare solutions in remote locations and cities.Need Assistance?

Reps. Rose, Walker Make Bipartisan Push for DHS to Increase Intel Focus on China's COVID-19 ActionsTargeted News ServiceMay 14, 2020 Thursday 7:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 871 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Max Rose, D-New York, issued the following news release on May 13:Congressman Max Rose (D-NY), Chair of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Intelligence and Counterterrorism, and Congressman Mark Walker (R-NC), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, urged the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Office of Intelligence & Analysis (I&A) to increase its focus on China and provide the subcommittee with details of its intelligence assessments on China's actions related to the pandemic."While the coronavirus pandemic travelled the world and devastated my district, China continues to hide critical information for their own benefit," Rose said. "The Communist Chinese Government cannot be trusted, but I trust our Intelligence Community can help us get the facts in order to help us beat this pandemic and save lives.""China's blatant disregard for humanity during the coronavirus pandemic has endangered the lives of Americans in North Carolina's 6th district and across this nation," Walker said. "Enough is enough. I urge the Department of Homeland Security Office of Intelligence & Analysis to fully investigate these atrocities and get to the bottom of China's apparent malpractice."According to media reports, DHS I&A recently assessed with medium confidence that China was manipulating public knowledge of the extent and severity of COVID-19 in their country in order to stockpile resources for their own pandemic response. Additionally, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), issued a public warning today regarding China's threats to American intellectual property related to the coronavirus."The world continues to learn more about China's efforts to dissemble, obfuscate, and divert information from the key early months of the novel coronavirus outbreak through to the present day," wrote Rose and Walker in a bipartisan letter Brian Murphy, Acting Under Secretary for Intelligence & Analysis. "China's apparent actions create challenges for the efforts to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, to say nothing of the public health ramifications for the entire world."* * *May 13, 2020To: Mr. Brian Murphy, Acting Under Secretary for Intelligence & Analysis, Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC 20520Dear Acting Under Secretary Murphy:The world continues to learn more about China's efforts to dissemble, obfuscate, and divert information from the key early months of the novel coronavirus outbreak through to the present day. Media reports indicate that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Intelligence & Analysis (I&A) recently assessed with medium confidence that China was manipulating public knowledge of the extent and severity of the virus in their country in order to stockpile resources for their own pandemic response./1Earlier today, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), issued a public warning regarding China's threats to American intellectual property related to the coronavirus./2China's apparent actions create challenges for the efforts to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, to say nothing of the public health ramifications for the entire world. In light of these reports and the recent news that leadership at I&A is in transition, we write to inquire about I&A's work with respect to China.As a member of the Intelligence Community (IC), I&A is privy to the intelligence reporting of all IC agencies and contributes valuable classified and open-source material to the IC intelligence picture. In particular, I&A sits in a unique position in the IC given its responsibilities to state, local, tribal and territorial partners, as well as partners in the private sector who rely on DHS reporting to secure the American public. As such, DHS has an essential role to play in ensuring that the American public and the American economy get back to normal as quickly as conditions allow.China's past and present actions with regard to the pandemic implicate issues of cybersecurity, export enforcement, intellectual property, electronic crimes, and other traditional and non- traditional threats. Given these broad-ranging impacts, we urge I&A to take the critical step of increasing its focus on China, including the use of commercial trade data.We also ask that you commit to continuing to share with the Committee all products DHS has produced on China's actions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including any products not already transmitted to the Committee. Please make relevant unclassified DHS products available to Committee staff over official email channels. In addition, we respectfully request a briefing from I&A on China's actions during this pandemic.We look forward to continuing to work with you and your team to ensure that DHS has the resources it needs to protect the American public and aid communities in their return to normalcy at the appropriate time. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.See signatories and footnotes here https://maxrose.house.gov/UploadedFiles/2020.05.13_IA_China_COVID_Letter.pdfCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7111562 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 14, 2020End of Document

"This racism must be stopped": NGO denounces discrimination against foreigners in China. Portuguese among the victimsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 19, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 677 wordsBodyPortuguese living in China complained to Lusa of discrimination by Chinese for fear of covid-19, a reality that affects the foreign community and ignored by Beijing, confirmed the non-governmental organization Human Rights Watch (HRW)."The central government has a duty to protect everyone (...) This racism must be stopped," HRW's deputy director for Asia told Lusa, adding that the non-governmental organization (NGO) has received several complaints from foreigners barred from various services and are suffering xenophobic attacks on the streets and social networks of the country.China has been recording fewer and fewer cases of the disease for several weeks and these have mostly been from abroad, the so-called imported cases. On the contrary, the rest of the world, especially outside Asia, has seen the number of infected rise exponentially.Mistrust of foreigners comes precisely for this reason, Phil Robertson explained, adding that these incidents are sharpened because neither the central government nor provincial authorities are acting to prevent such behavior.In china's Guangdong province, adjacent to Macau, two Portuguese, who asked Lusa not to be identified, reported several discriminatory incidents they have been targeted against.One of the Portuguese said he was prevented from renting sports venues for the simple reason of being a foreigner. The two complain of various discriminatory behaviors. Among some examples, they say that the Chinese purposely leave the elevator when they enter.Although the most serious cases have not happened to them, the two tell several reports they have received from close friends, such as the impediment of entering the store of the American multinational Walmart in the neighboring city of Macau, Zhuhai, or others who were expelled from a hotel.Questioned this Sunday by Lusa, the consul Portuguese in the Chinese city of Guangzhou said he was aware of discriminatory cases towards foreigners, but assured that he was not reported any complaint stemming from Portuguese citizens."The consulate sent a questionnaire to all citizens who are registered here asking if they have had problems," said André Sobral Cordeiro. Of the 203 Portuguese registered at the consulate, only 20 responded and none of them reported having suffered from discriminatory behavior."There have been, in fact, some situations [discriminatory towards foreigners], but in relation to Portuguese citizens, they have to tell us," he said, calling on the Portuguese to communicate these situations so that the consulate can respond and intervene. "Otherwise, we have no way of knowing," he said.André Sobral Cordeiro also explained that "joint action" on how they will act is being discussed among several states, adding that at that time the community will be informed.The group that has suffered the most xenophobia is the African. Photographs and videos broadcast last week on social media showed young people and families of Africans sleeping on the street in Canton, southern China, after being forced to leave homes and hotels by authorities, and banned from entering shops and restaurants.As a result, several African governments called on Chinese ambassadors in their countries to express concern, while African ambassadors to China wrote a joint letter to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and the United Nations Human Rights Council denouncing the "discrimination and stigmatization" of Africans in Guangzhou."Xenophobia and racism have no place in a civilized country," hrw's head said.Ofsimilarly, when the pandemic situation was reversed (with more cases in China than in the rest of the world), Beijing criticized xenophobic and discriminatory acts towards Asians. "You can't look the other way now," Phil Robertson said.Globally, the covid-19 pandemic has claimed more than 157,000 lives and affected more than 2.2 million people in 193 countries and territories. More than 502,000 patients were considered cured.The disease is transmitted by a new coronavirus detected in late December in Wuhan, a city in central China.Load-Date: April 20, 2020End of Document

Exclusive: She's been falsely accused of starting the pandemic. Her life has been turned upside downCNN.comApril 24, 2020 Friday 10:17 AM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: TECHLength: 1459 wordsByline: Story by Donie O'Sullivan, CNN Business Video by Richa Naik and John General, CNN Business Photographs by Heather Fulbright, CNNBodyMaatje Benassi, a US Army reservist and mother of two, has become the target of conspiracy theorists who falsely place her at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, saying she brought the disease to China.The false claims are spreading across YouTube every day, so far racking up hundreds of thousands of apparent views, and have been embraced by Chinese Communist Party media. Despite never having tested positive for the coronavirus or experienced symptoms, Benassi and her husband are now subjects of discussion on Chinese social media about the outbreak, including among accounts that are known drivers of large-scale coordinated activities by their followers.The claims have turned their lives upside down. The couple say their home address has been posted online and that, before they shut down their accounts, their social media inboxes were overrun with messages from believers of the conspiracy."It's like waking up from a bad dream going into a nightmare day after day," Maatje Benassi told CNN Business in an exclusive interview, the first time she has spoken publicly since being smeared online.As the coronavirus has spread around the world, so has misinformation about the disease. Technology giants have touted the steps they are taking to combat coronavirus misinformation, but these efforts have failed to help the Benassis. The family's suffering highlights the potential for blatant falsehoods to be rewarded and amplified by social media platforms. It also serves as a powerful reminder that misinformation online, however wild or obviously untrue it may seem, can have real and lasting consequences offline.Maajte and her husband Matt are still active in their government jobs. Maajte is a civilian employee at the US Army's Fort Belvoir in Virginia where she works as a security officer. Matt, a retired Air Force officer, is a civilian employee with the Air Force at the Pentagon.Despite working for the US government, the couple are experiencing the same feelings of helplessness familiar to others who have been the target of harassment and misinformation. "I want everybody to stop harassing me, because this is cyberbullying to me and it's gone way out of hand," Maajte said while fighting back tears.Matt has tried to get the videos taken down from YouTube and to prevent their spread online. The couple said they contacted an attorney, who told them there was little that could be done, and local police, who told them much the same.Origins of a coronavirus conspiracy theoryConspiracy theories are not dissimilar to viruses, in that they evolve and mutate to spread and survive. Before Maatje Benassi became the main protagonist in this conspiracy, variations had circulated online for months.In the early weeks of the coronavirus, conspiracy theorists began claiming, without evidence, that it was a US biological weapon. Later one member of the Chinese government publicly promoted the notion that the US military brought the virus to China. US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said it was "completely ridiculous and it's irresponsible" for someone speaking on behalf of the Chinese government to promote such a claim.It wasn't until March, months after the first reported coronavirus cases in China, that conspiracy theorists turned their focus to Maatje Benassi. The baseless theory began with her participation in October in the Military World Games, essentially the military Olympics, which was hosted by Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus outbreak began last year.Maatje Benassi competed in the cycling competition there, suffering an accident on the final lap that left her with a fractured rib and a concussion. Despite the crash, Benassi still finished the race, but it turned out to be the start of something worse. While hundreds of athletes from the US military took part in the games, Maatje Benassi was plucked out of the group and given a starring role in the conspiracy theory.Perhaps the most prominent cheerleader of the idea that Benassi had a role in the imaginary plot to infect the world is George Webb, a prolific 59-year-old American misinformation peddler. Webb has for years regularly streamed hours of diatribe live on YouTube, where he has amassed more than 27 million views and almost 100,000 followers.In 2017, CNN revealed how Webb was part of a trio of conspiracy theorists that pushed a false rumor about a cargo ship with a "dirty bomb" that was set to arrive at the Port of Charleston in South Carolina. The bomb never materialized, but the claims did lead to parts of the port -- one of the biggest in America -- being shut down for a time as a safety precaution.Until recently, Webb said, his YouTube videos included advertisements -- meaning the platform, which is owned by Google, was making money from Webb's misinformation, as was Webb himself.Webb even claimed that the Italian DJ Benny Benassi, whose 2002 song "Satisfaction" became a worldwide sensation, had the coronavirus and that he, along with Maatje and Matt Benassi, were part of a Benassi plot connected to the virus. (Benny told CNN Business he has never met Maatje and Matt, and they said that as far as they know, they are not related. Benny pointed out that Benassi is a very common last name in Italy.)Benny Benassi told CNN Business he has not been diagnosed with the coronavirus. Like artists around the world, he canceled his concerts because of social distancing and travel restrictions. (Webb previously claimed the DJ is Dutch, he is not.)In a phone interview with CNN Business on Thursday, which he livestreamed to his followers on YouTube, Webb offered no substantive evidence to support his claims about the Benassis and said he considered himself an "investigative reporter," not a conspiracy theorist.He also said that YouTube recently stopped running ads on his videos after he began talking about the coronavirus. Webb said he had normally made a few hundred dollars a month directly from YouTube.YouTube confirmed to CNN that it was not currently running ads on Webb's channel, but it declined to say whether ads appeared there in the past or provide details on how much money his channel may have made. A company spokesperson said YouTube was committed to promoting accurate information about the coronavirus. The company removed some threatening comments about the Benassis that had been posted under Webb's videos when asked about them by CNN Business. YouTube also said it had removed some videos posted by Webb in the past.False theories online spark real world concernsWhile the allegations about the Benassis may be wildly untrue, the threats they face and the fear they feel are very real.Matt Benassi said he fears this could "turn into another Pizzagate," referencing another baseless conspiracy theory that claimed a pedophilia ring that somehow involved Hillary Clinton, among others, was operating out of a Washington DC pizzeria. The fringe theory didn't receive much mainstream attention until a man showed up at the pizzeria in late 2016 and fired an assault weapon, saying he was there to investigate "Pizzagate.""It's really hard to hold him [Webb] accountable," Matt Benassi said. "Law enforcement will tell you that there's nothing that we can do about it because we have free speech in this country. Then they say, 'Go talk to a civil attorney,' so we did. We talked to an attorney. You quickly realize that for folks like us, it's just too expensive to litigate something like this. We get no recourse from law enforcement. We get no recourse from the courts."Matt Benassi said he has complained to YouTube but even when the company does take videos down it can take days for it to do so. By that time, a video can go viral, and the damage is done. Worse still: videos Webb has posted to YouTube that are removed are often re-uploaded to the platform.In China, the YouTube videos attacking the Benassis are uploaded to popular platforms there such as WeChat, Weibo, and Xigua Video and are translated into Chinese, according to an analysis by Keenan Chen, a researcher at First Draft, a non-profit that researches disinformation.The Benassis' experience is unfortunately not unique, said Danielle Citron, a professor of law at Boston University School of Law and a MacArthur Fellow who studies online harassment. Faced with "cyber mobs," as Citron describes them, law enforcement often can't or won't investigate.As for the likes of YouTube, Citron said the law has to change: "Right now, they're totally immune from legal liability under federal law. And so they can just walk away."Whatever happens next, "the damage is done," according to Maatje Benassi. "I know it [will] never be the same.

Co stated that in the first days of the pandemic, it observed in Brazil a significant increase in interest in investments; its Retail Research Platform and InfoMoney portal reached record audiences. Co's active clients totaled 2.0 mln at the end of Q1, up +81% yr/yr, driven by the expansion of co's direct and B2B channels and its three retail brands. Reaches two-month highs.BLK (487.92 +7.37%): Priced the secondary offering of 28,753,248 shares of common stock held by PNC Financial (PNC) at $420/share. The stock rebounds from yesterday's circa 8% drop. ALC (56.43 +6.07%): Topped consensus for Q1 EPS and revs. Widespread shutdowns in March negatively impacted co's results following "strong sales growth" in both of co's franchises during the first two months of the year. Co expects Q2 results to be negatively impacted by the ongoing coronavirus crisis, but given the critical nature of eye care, customer demand is expected to resume as conditions normalize and improve through the back half of the year.Large Cap LosersPODD (194.85 -11.71%): Announced an offering of $500 mln of its common stock, or 2,369,668 shares priced at $211.00/share; proceeds are expected to be dedicated to general corporate purposes. Co has also been scheduled to present this afternoon at the BofA Securities Virtual Healthcare Conference. Pulls back from recent all-time highs. CARR (16.43 -7.7%): Sees continued volatility, now giving up what remained of a circa +12% advance mounted last Friday. OKE (30.49 -7.44%): Underperforms alongside various energy sector peers; the energy space lags the broader market. (Related: ET, LNG, OXY...)15:30JACK Jack In The Box: Earnings Preview (62.72 -3.11)Jack in the Box (JACK) is set to report Q2 (Mar) results today after the close with a call to follow tomorrow morning at 11:30am ET. The current S&P CapitalIQ consensus is for adjusted EPS of $0.69 and revenue of $211.3 mln. JACK previously withdrew its FY20 guidance, so we certainly do not expect any full year guidance. Even before the pandemic, JACK did not typically provide quarterly guidance, so we're also not expecting any JunQ guidance.In terms of key metrics, system same-store comps are clearly important. However, JACK has already announced Q2 comps, which were -4.2%. Comps were running at +5.2% for the seven weeks ending March 8, but the final five weeks of the quarter (March 9-April 12), comps were -17.0%. So this won't be new information, but hopefully we get some directional comp data since the quarter ended on April 12. On April 16, Jack in the Box had some big news as it named Darin Harris as it's new CEO. He will take over no later than June 15. Most recently, Harris served as CEO of North America for IWG PLC, the holding group for several providers of over 1,000 flexible workspaces. Harris is also the former CEO of CiCi's Pizza. Harris takes over from Lenny Comma, who plans to retire. Hopefully, we will get some initial insight in terms of possible changes he may make. In terms of the pandemic impact, the company has had minimal temporary closures, with over 99% of restaurants open on each day during the COVID-19 pandemic. All locations are operating in an off-premise capacity, mostly via drive-thru lanes. In terms of how JACK performs relative to consensus, it can be somewhat volatile. It has reported two EPS misses in a row, including a large $0.21 miss in Q1. On a final note, Wendy's (WEN) recently reported good Q1 results. What jumped off the page to us was Wendy's US weekly comp performance in early Q2, which had returned to nearly flat comps even as its locations are limited to drive-thru/delivery. We will see if JACK saw a similar bullish comp direction in late April and early May.15:17SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- 8x8 (EGHT) pulls back following quarterly earnings press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersSNX (90.97 +8.75%): Guided for Q2 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.00-1.00. Co stated that since March, it has "rapidly enabled additional work-from-home capabilities to support its client base needs" while Technology Solutions has continued to support the at-home requirements of customers; these increased abilities are the main contributors to co's improved Q2 outlook. Co has increased its liquidity position to nearly $2 bln. Co also announced a distribution agreement with cybersecurity company Bitdefender. BRFS (3.79 +8.29%): Rises to its new highest levels for the month, seeing relative strength alongside certain food and grocery industry peers in the consumer staples sector. Among recent items, co reported Q1 earnings earlier this week and today filed an Integrated Report for 2019. Co commented during its Q1 call that it expects to face challenges on the supply side. (Related: UNFI, BGS, FLO...) ALEC (30 +6.23%): Reported Q1 results; revs rose +28.6% yr/yr to $7.17 mln due to an increase in expenses for the AL002 and AL003 programs vs the prior year period. Co stated that it remains on track to advance AL001 into a pivotal Phase 3 study in FTD-GRN patients in 2020; it also noted that ongoing activities for AL003, AL101, and AL014 are continuing as planned and that it plans to initiate a Phase 2 study of AL002 in Alzheimer's patients in 2020. Co believes that its cash and investments as of March 31 will be sufficient to fund its anticipated operations through 2022.Mid Cap LosersEGHT (15.44 -24.39%): Reported Q4 results, topping consensus for EPS and revs. Service revs grew +30.2% yr/yr. Co commented that churn levels are higher than it would like, particularly in legacy small business VoIP customers, impacting co's net dollar retention rate. Guided Q1 revs in-line. During its call, co stated that it expects its service revenue growth rate for FY21 to range from +17-18%. Drops from yesterday's three-month highs.COTY (3.68 -14.78%): Downgraded to Neutral from Outperform and assigned a $5 target at Exane BNP Paribas. The stock now reaches its lowest levels since mid-March. CLR (12.51 -13.4%): Energy sector generally underperforms. At two-week lows.

Treasuries started the cash session with modest gains after concerns about a second wave of coronavirus infections weighed on risk tolerance in Asia and Europe. Treasuries climbed to fresh highs in mid-morning trade, responding to the release of Fed Chairman Jay Powell's prepared remarks from a virtual event hosted by the Peterson Institute. The Fed Chairman said that he expects only a gradual economic recovery and he repeated his opposition to a negative interest rate policy in the U.S. Treasuries slipped back to their starting levels well before the conclusion of the event with Chairman Powell and remained in that range into the late morning, when a push to fresh highs took place alongside selling in equities. Treasuries remained near their highs into midday action but made another return toward their starting levels after the completion of a $22 bln 30-yr bond auction, which was met with lukewarm demand. The U.S. Dollar Index retreated toward its 50-day moving average (99.53) in overnight trade but rallied 0.3% to 100.24 as the day went on, reclaiming its loss from yesterday. Yield Check: 2-yr: -1 bp to 0.15% 3-yr: UNCH at 0.20% 5-yr: -2 bps to 0.32% 10-yr: -3 bps to 0.65% 30-yr: -4 bps to 1.34%News: Global Times reported that China is ready to impose sanctions on U.S. individuals and entities who pursue COVID-19 damages from the Chinese government. A partial lockdown was reportedly implemented in China's Jilin City due to a spike in coronavirus cases. Hong Kong reported its first instance of community coronavirus transmission in nearly a month. Japan's Economy Minister, Yasutoshi Nishimura, said that the Japanese government and the Bank of Japan are determined to prevent deflation from taking hold. Yonhap reported that South Korean officials urged Japan to remove trade restrictions on materials essential for South Korea's production of displays and semiconductors. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand left its official cash rate at 0.25%, as expected, and increased its asset purchase program to NZD60 bln from NZD30 bln. South Korea's April Unemployment Rate remained at 3.8%. Eurozone's March Industrial Production fell 11.3% m/m (expected -12.1%; last -0.1%), contracting 12.9% yr/yr (expected -12.4%; last -2.2%). U.K.'s Q1 GDP contracted 2.0% qtr/qtr (expected -2.5%; last 0.0%), falling 1.6% yr/yr (expected -2.1%; last 1.1%). Q1 Business Investment was unchanged qtr/qtr (expected -2.5%; last -0.5%), increasing 0.7% yr/yr (last 1.8%). March trade deficit totaled GBP12.51 bln (expected deficit of GBP10.00 bln; last deficit of GBP9.83 bln). $22 bln 30-year Treasury bond auction results (prior 12-auction average): High yield: 1.342% (2.225%). Bid-to-cover: 2.30 (2.31). Indirect bid: 65.7% (61.2%). Direct bid: 12.9% (15.5%). Today's Data: The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 1.3% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -0.5%), marking its biggest decrease since records began in December 2009. Most of that decline was attributed to a 3.3% drop in prices for final demand goods. Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus -0.2%), leaving it up just 0.6% yr/yr. The Producer Price Index for April may not be convincing enough to the Fed to go down the negative interest rate road, yet the key takeaway is that it will certainly keep it on the path at the lower bound. The weekly MBA Mortgage Index ticked up 0.3% to follow last week's 0.1% uptick. The Purchase Index jumped 10.6% while the Refinance Index fell 3.3%. Weekly crude oil inventories decreased by 750,000 barrels after increasing by 4.6 mln barrels during the previous week.

The company has been working aggressively the last few months to repurpose its cell-based vaccine platform targeting solid tumors for use against viral diseases.Orgenesis believes its new vaccine platform offers a unique approach to cell vaccination that holds promise for an affordable and reproducible vaccine for both COVID-19 and other viral diseases. The company is moving forward with planned animal testing for its cell-based vaccine platform in COVID-19 and looks forward to providing a more detailed timeline of activities including plans for initial human testing, assuming clearance from the FDA and/or other non-US regulatory bodies to do so.14:09CSCO Cisco: Earnings Preview -- Will be our first in-depth look at a major tech company that includes the pandemic's impact on April (41.83 -1.39)Cisco Systems (CSCO) is set to report Q3 (Apr) results today after the close with a call to follow at 4:30pm ET. The current S&P CapitalIQ consensus is for adjusted EPS of $0.71 and revenue of $11.85 bln, an -8.6% yr/yr decline. Cisco typically guides for EPS and revenue for the next quarter. The company has been silent in terms of whether it plans to provide guidance going forward, so we'll see.Last quarter, Cisco guided to Q3 adjusted EPS of $0.79-0.81 and a revenue decline of -3.5% to -1.5%. However, with consensus estimates well below this guidance, it seems analysts are skeptical Cisco will hit those numbers. Current guidance for non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 is 32.5-33.5%. Cisco is a particularly important tech name to watch with earnings. Because it's so large and touches so many areas, it's a great barometer to get a general sense for enterprise sending levels on IT. It's also the first big tech name to report that includes the month of April. The pandemic hit in mid-to-late March and while other IT names provided the pandemic's impact on the tail end of their Q1 results, this will be our first in-depth look at a major tech company that includes the impact on April. We should also get some color on how the summer may play out. In terms of how Cisco performs relative to consensus, it typically beats modestly on EPS in the $0.01-0.03 range with modest revenue upside. It has not missed on EPS or revs in the past five years, so if it did so, that would be notable13:48XLP Sector Briefing: Consumer Staples (57.09 -0.46)All eleven sectors trade in negative territory with five groups down 2.0% or more. Growth-sensitive sectors are at the forefront of today's retreat while countercyclical groups have fared a bit better.The consumer staples sector (-0.8%) shows a slimmer loss than most of its peers, continuing this week's trend. The sector is down 1.8% for the week versus a 3.9% week-to-date loss in the S&P 500 (-1.9%).Roughly 2/3 of the sector's components trade in the red while a couple major retailers and a handful of food companies hold gains, resulting in outperformance versus the broader market.Notable movers:General Mills (GIS 63.64, +1.13, +1.8%): leading component, rising to its best level since early 2017. Kroger (KR 33.90, +0.35, +1.0%): touched an eight-week high earlier today.

EBITDA up circa +32% yr/yr. Management commented that consumer demand for its natural and conventional products alike surged early in Q3 and remains elevated. Strong demand has allowed co to leverage fixed costs and capitalize on integration efforts undertaken in connection with the Supervalu acquisition.

Co commented that volumes were negatively impacted in March by COVID-19 disruptions. American Society for Reproductive Medicine guidelines issued in mid-March recommending the suspension of new treatment cycles resulted in a majority of co's members being unable to complete diagnostics or initiate new treatment cycles; ASRM has more recently updated its guidelines to provide fertility clinics with a path for the gradual resumption of patient care, and co has in the last few weeks begun to see acceleration in the appointment volumes and the dispensing of fertility medications. Co mentioned that it has been "shielded from the worst impacts of the historic levels of unemployment due to the composition of [its] client base." Spiked to two-month highs. PGTI (11.9 +21.75%): Posted upside Q1 EPS and revs (+26.8% yr/yr to $220.2 mln, including contributions from the NewSouth acquisition). Adj. EBITDA grew +39%. Co has withdrawn its annual guidance, but it noted that it expects Q2 consolidated net sales to decline 7-10% yr/yr, primarily as a result of COVID-19 and a related reduction in orders. Co is "seeing a building pipeline of orders in [its] Florida markets in May" and is beginning to build back capacity there to meet recovering demand. Rises to two-month highs.Small Cap LosersVREX (18 -28.88%): Missed expectations for Q2 EPS and revs. In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, co experienced a "substantial shift in mix between and within [its] business segments that lowered [its] overall margins." Co expects uncertainty in demand for certain products for medical and industrial applications and increased variability in supply chain and manufacturing productivity to continue through at least the remainder of the fiscal year. Withdrew its previously-issued FY20 guidance. Downgraded to Neutral from Overweight at JPMorgan. INFN (4.45 -23.36%): Missed expectations for Q1 EPS on upside revs (+12.8% yr/yr to $330.27 mln).

The S&P 500 is down 1.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 2.0%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.6%.Prior to the open, Fed Chair Powell said the economic outlook remains uncertain and is subject to significant downside risks. In addition, Mr. Powell repeated that the central bank is committed to doing more, except tampering with negative interest rates, and said additional fiscal stimulus could be worth it if it helps avoid long-term pain.There was nothing out of the ordinary in Fed Powell's speech, and the S&P 500 even traded positive at one point this morning. Still, the market has had to contend with valuation concerns, growing skepticism against China, and road bumps in COVID-19 progress.At this juncture, all 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading lower with the energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.1%) sectors leading the retreat. The real estate (-0.9%) and consumer staples (-0.4%) sectors are the lone sectors down less than 1.0%.Tensions with China have been stirred by the FBI confirming China-affiliated cyber actors have targeted U.S. organizations conducting COVID-19-related research. On a related note, Bloomberg Law reported that the COVID-19 test from Abbott Labs (ABT 92.47, -1.33, -1.4%) may miss as many as half of positive cases.Investors are seeking some protection against further equity weakness, evidenced by the 9% gain in the CBOE Volatility Index (35.96, +2.94, +8.9%) and have taken some safety in longer-dated U.S. Treasuries. The 10-yr yield is currently down four basis points to 0.64%.Note, the market has come off session lows, helped by a gain in shares of Amazon (AMZN 2377.52, +20.57, +0.9%).Reviewing today's economic data:The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 1.3% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -0.5%), marking its biggest decrease since records began in December 2009. Most of that decline was attributed to a 3.3% drop in prices for final demand goods.The Producer Price Index for April may not be convincing enough to the Fed to go down the negative interest rate road, yet the key takeaway is that it will certainly keep it on the path at the lower bound.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index increased 0.3% following a 0.1% increase in the prior week.12:50SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Industrials: GE (135.15 mln -7.75%), DAL (45.34 mln -7.85%), AAL (42.39 mln -7.15%), UAL (36.36 mln -9.66%)Consumer Discretionary: JCP (157.66 mln +18.65%), F (57.58 mln -4.42%), CCL (37.91 mln -8.11%), NCLH (36.01 mln -7.84%)Information Technology: AMD (43.61 mln -3.8%), AAPL (26.86 mln -1.94%)Financials: BAC (69.41 mln -4.87%), SQQQ (60.64 mln +5.91%), WFC (47.84 mln -7.61%), TQQQ (36.14 mln -5.9%), QQQ (34.05 mln -1.92%)Energy: MRO (53.15 mln -8.05%), RIG (44.34 mln -19.53%), CPE (36.44 mln -12.58%), ET (28.74 mln -7.66%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: VREX (4.88x -29.19%), CBAY (3.28x -15.07%), PODD (2.77x -11.06%), MYOK (2.76x -6.31%), ALLK (2.03x -8.05%)Industrials: PGTI (3.68x +22.82%), UPWK (3.21x +1.22%)Consumer Discretionary: JCP (7.91x +18.65%)Information Technology: INFN (3.95x -23.02%), EGHT (3.46x -23.46%), TSEM (3.43x -2.98%), QTWO (2.97x -2.58%), CYBR (2.79x -12.57%), LOGI (2.68x +1.77%), VECO (2.67x -12.46%), CNDT (2.13x -10.28%)Financials: BLK (6.72x +4.35%)Consumer Staples: UNFI (10.52x +43%)12:48SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: MESO (12.71 +11.59%), TAK (18.96 +7.2%), RCUS (30.85 +5.33%), TBIO (14.18 +3.69%), PRAH (89.66 +2.81%)Industrials: PGTI (12 +22.82%), EXPO (64.43 +2.73%)Consumer Discretionary: JCP (0.24 +18.65%), GPRO (3.55 +4.48%), CHGG (64.15 +3.62%)Information Technology: SNX (92.25 +10.28%)Financials: SQQQ (11.64 +5.91%), BLK (474.22 +4.35%)Energy: STNG (17.9 +4.13%)Consumer Staples: UNFI (22.18 +43%), NGVC (14.73 +7.68%), BGS (24.57 +4.53%), BRFS (3.64 +4%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: VREX (17.93 -29.19%), SIEN (2.32 -15.33%), TVTY (8.47 -15.22%), CBAY (3.55 -15.07%), ADAP (4.24 -14.1%)Industrials: LDL (9.66 -17.08%), CAR (10.35 -15.58%)Consumer Discretionary: HUD (4.5 -18.12%), CPS (9.25 -16.21%)Information Technology: EGHT (15.63 -23.46%), INFN (4.47 -23.02%)Energy: FTSI (3.76 -22.6%), OMP (4.44 -19.87%), RIG (1.36 -19.53%), AR (2.46 -16.89%), OAS (0.41 -15.15%), CDEV (0.79 -14.87%), XOG (0.29 -14.77%), PTEN (2.91 -14.41%)Consumer Staples: COTY (3.71 -14.36%)12:42SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/ Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: ONEM CSCO FLO JACK NVGS OII SDC STE VRTUTomorrow Morning: AZUL BAM AG GDS KEM NICE NCLH NVMI SPNS SSYS WNC WIX12:14TALKX Market Briefing: Broad-based de-riskingThe stock market has extended its losses in a broad-based sell-off that has connections to an understanding that it has moved too far, too fast.

The R&O was adopted during the FCC's May 13 Open Meeting. The new regulatory framework will allow 900 MHz licensees, like Anterix, to obtain broadband licenses and includes operational and technical rules to minimize interference to narrowband operations. "We applaud the FCC for this bold decision to repurpose under-utilized spectrum, unleashing the power of broadband for utilities and other enterprises to build private LTE communications networks," said Morgan O'Brien, CEO of Anterix. "For the utility sector, grid modernization has been a critical industry priority, but the scarcity of foundational spectrum to support necessary wireless broadband communications had constrained its efforts. This unanimous decision sends a strong signal that the FCC 'walks the walk' of revising its rules to clear scarce spectrum [...] to make way for innovation, efficiency and competition."11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$22 bln 30-year Treasury bond auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.325% Bid-to-cover: 2.35 Indirect bid: 66.4% Direct bid: 11.0% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.225% Bid-to-cover: 2.31 Indirect bid: 61.2% Direct bid: 15.5%11:20XLF Sector Briefing: Financials (20.75 -0.54)Ten out of eleven sectors trade in negative territory today with financials (-2.3%) showing relative weakness. The growth-sensitive sector has fallen 6.8% so far this week and it is down 32.6% for the year, which leaves it only ahead of energy (-3.9%; -40.5% year-to-date) on this year's leaderboard.The market remains concerned that U.S. interest rates will be pressured into negative territory by external factors, which would pose a significant challenge to insurers and banks. Fed Chairman Powell reiterated today that the Fed does not view negative rates as appropriate for the U.S., but the market is also aware that the Fed's hand could be forced by global developments.Asset managers like Blackrock (BLK 474.21, +19.77, +4.4%) and providers of market data represent a small pocket of strength within the sector as they benefit from increased client activity.Notable movers:Harford Financial Services (HIG 32.29, -1.86, -5.5%): weakest performer in the sector, falling to a five-week low. Discover Financial (DFS 37.17, -2.03, -5.2%): sliding to a two-week low after finding resistance near its 50-day moving average (39.51). Citizens Financial (CFG 19.06, -1.08, -5.3%): dipping to a three-week low after finding resistance near its 50-day moving average (20.65) yesterday.

He went on to suggest that the Fed will continue to do what is necessary to help support the recovery but noted that further fiscal support could be needed to help avoid long-term damage to the economy.In brief, he sounded generally cautious about recovery prospects, which has led to an otherwise cautious trading tone in the stock market.That caution has manifested itself in the relative strength of the health care (+0.1%), consumer staples (-0.1%), and information technology (-0.1%) sectors, the latter of which has been heavily influenced by the relative strength of its mega-cap leaders, Microsoft (MSFT 182.29, -0.22, -0.1%) and Apple (AAPL 313.08, +1.67, +0.5%).Similarly, relative strength in Amazon.com (AMZN 2386.61, +29.66, +1.3%), Alphabet (GOOG 1370.89, -4.85, -0.4%), and Facebook (FB 208.70, -1.40, -0.7%) has helped temper today's losses.Today's biggest loser is the energy sector (-3.9%) followed by the financial (-2.2%), industrials (-1.8%), and materials (-1.3%) sectors, which is befitting a market that might be second-guessing the pace of recovery prospects in the wake of the Fed chair's speech and the understanding that Senate Republicans are reportedly balking at a $3 trillion coronavirus relief package unveiled yesterday by House Democrats. Some reports have suggested it has been deemed "dead on arrival."The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%; the S&P 500 is down 0.6%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.0%; and the Russell 2000 is down 1.8%.10:43OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:KDP Jun 26 calls are seeing interest with 3720 contracts trading vs. open int of 200, pushing implied vol up around 4 points to ~34%.

To preserve cash, management acted on a variety of cost-saving measures, including the deferral of heavy maintenance costs and over 6,000 voluntary employee leaves of absence (~40% of its workforce). With limited visibility into the recovery, GOL's current planning scenario assumes (-45)% y/y 2020 capacity, including (-30)% y/y by 4Q20, but it has the flexibility to respond to prevailing demand trends. The Company has grounded 120 aircraft (~92% of its fleet) since March 28 and flights in April were operated from the Guarulhos airport in So Paulo to all of Brazil's state capitals and the federal capital in Brasilia, which represents 7% of the April 2019 schedule. As of April 30, the Company had R$4.0 billion in total liquidity, which implies over 10 months of cash on hand (excluding refunds and restricted cash).

Economic forecasts are uncertain in the best of times, and today the virus raises a new set of questions: How quickly and sustainably will it be brought under control? Can new outbreaks be avoided as social-distancing measures lapse? How long will it take for confidence to return and normal spending to resume? And what will be the scope and timing of new therapies, testing, or a vaccine? The answers to these questions will go a long way toward setting the timing and pace of the economic recovery. Since the answers are currently unknowable, policies will need to be ready to address a range of possible outcomes.""We ought to do what we can to avoid these outcomes, and that may require additional policy measures. At the Fed, we will continue to use our tools to their fullest until the crisis has passed and the economic recovery is well under way. Recall that the Fed has lending powers, not spending powers. A loan from a Fed facility can provide a bridge across temporary interruptions to liquidity, and those loans will help many borrowers get through the current crisis. But the recovery may take some time to gather momentum, and the passage of time can turn liquidity problems into solvency problems. Additional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it if it helps avoid long-term economic damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery. This tradeoff is one for our elected representatives, who wield powers of taxation and spending."Full Speech09:02WIRES On The WiresJohn Stephens, senior EVP and CFO of AT&T (T), spoke today at the MoffettNathanson Media & Communications Summit, where he provided an update to shareholders.

Given the impact of COVID-19, booking volumes for the remainder of 2020 are meaningfully lower than the same time last year at prices that are down low-single digits. Due to the suspension in sailings, booking trends reflect elevated cancellations for 2020 and more typical levels for 2021 and beyond. Although still early in the booking cycle, the booked position for 2021 is within historical ranges when compared to same time last year with 2021 prices up mid-single digits compared to 2020, subject to the uncertainty around the duration of our suspension of sailings and resumption of service. The company has instituted several programs in order to best serve its guests: for cancelled cruises, guests are offered the choice of future cruise credits valued at 125% of the initial cruise fare paid in lieu of providing cash refunds. These future cruise credits can be redeemed on any sailing on or before December 31, 2021. As of April 30, 2020, approximately 45% of the guests have requested cash refunds. For non-cancelled cruises, the company has implemented a "Cruise with Confidence" policy. This policy allows guests to cancel up to 48 hours prior to sailing (for sailings on or before August 1, 2020) and receive a full credit for their fare usable until April 30, 2022. As of March 31, 2020, the company had $2.4 billion in customer deposits. This includes approximately $0.8 billion of future cruise credits related to previously announced voyage cancellations through June 11, 2020. The Company also continues to take future bookings for 2020, 2021 and 2022, and receive new customer deposits and final payments on these bookings.The company estimates its cash burn to be, on average, in the range of approximately $250 million to $275 million per month during a prolonged suspension of operations. This range includes ongoing ship operating expenses, administrative expenses, debt service expense, hedging costs, expected necessary capital expenditures (net of committed financings in the case of newbuilds) and excludes cash refunds of customer deposits as well as cash inflows from new and existing bookings. The company is considering ways to further reduce the average monthly requirement under a further prolonged out-of-service scenario and during start-up of operations. The Company continues to identify and evaluate further actions to improve its liquidity. These include and are not limited to: further reductions in capital expenditures, operating expenses and administrative costs and additional financings.07:48TMO Thermo Fisher expands response to the COVID-19 pandemic by developing a total antibodies test in collaboration with WuXi Diagnostics and Mayo Clinic (331.72 )The new test is the result of ongoing collaboration between all three organizations, including clinical evaluation and support from Mayo Clinic.

At three months, he also had leukocyte enzyme and plasma enzyme activity levels approximately three times higher than the mean activity level of the first three patients in the same trial at the same timepoint.New data will also be presented from the first patient dosed in the investigator-sponsored Phase 1/2 trial of AVR-RD-04 for cystinosis, a progressive disease marked by the accumulation of cystine in cellular organelles known as lysosomes.

Order backlog increased substantially versus the prior year period and is well above $100 mln. The company anticipates many of these bookings to invoice in fiscal May and Q4. During fiscal April, the company's non-safety and janitorial product lines saw a significant decline versus the prior year due to the impact of prolonged customer shutdowns and world-wide efforts to control COVID-19. The company has seen solid gross margins through fiscal March and fiscal April on strong realization of its mid-year price increase, as well as initial results from the supplier initiatives announced earlier in the fiscal year. The company intends to continue reporting monthly sales trends until the heightened uncertainty caused by COVID-19 diminishes.16:50ERA Era Group and Bristow Group appoint current Era Group CEO Chris Bradshaw as CEO for combined company (4.61 -0.20)Bristow Group and Era Group announced the new global organization structure and the selection of the executive leadership team that will help create a financially stronger industry leader in offshore helicopter transportation and search and rescue services.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-1.9%) and Nasdaq Composite (-2.1%) declined comparably to the benchmark index, while the Russell 2000 underperformed with a 3.5% decline.There wasn't one specific catalyst driving stocks lower, but profit-taking interest might have been fueled by legislation put forth by Senate Republicans to impose sanctions on China and by Los Angeles reportedly planning to extend the county's stay-at-home order for another three months.News of the Senate proposal did seem to initiate the selling in the market, which had been trading flat beforehand. The LA news also coincided with the late-day selling, as it paid heed to NIAID Director Fauci's Senate testimony in which he cautioned about reopening the economy too soon.It's unclear if the market was truly perturbed by the news or if it provided a good excuse for some overdue selling. In either case, all 11 S&P 500 sectors closed in negative territory, led lower by the real estate (-4.3%), industrials (-2.8%), and financials (-2.7%) sectors. The consumer staples (-0.9%) and utilities (-0.9%) sectors declined the least.Bank and airline stocks were among today's weakest performers, which was made evident in sharp declines in the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE 27.51, -1.45, -5.0%) and the U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS 12.68, -0.57, -4.3%).Bank stocks were pressured by a modest decline in Treasury yields and by President Trump rehashing calls for negative interest rates. Airline stocks were pressured by Boeing (BA 125.22, -3.69, -2.9%) CEO Calhoun telling NBC's "Today" show that a major U.S. airline could go bankrupt because of COVID-19 disruptions.Conversely, shares of Uber (UBER 32.40, +0.76, +2.4%) and GrubHub (GRUB 60.39, +13.60, +29.1%) exhibited strength after it was reported that Uber made a bid to acquire GrubHub.As previously noted, U.S. Treasury yields declined amid an uptick in demand for the safe-haven asset. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.16%, and the 10-yr yield declined five basis points to 0.68%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 99.97. WTI crude rose 5.3%, or $1.30, to $25.76/bbl.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data:The Consumer Price Index declined 0.8% m/m in April, as expected, while core CPI, which excludes food and energy, declined 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus -0.2%). That was the largest drop in total CPI since December 2008 and the largest drop on record going back to 1957 for core CPI.The key takeaway from the report is that it is a telltale reminder that the Federal Reserve isn't moving off the zero bound anytime soon.The Treasury Budget for April showed a deficit of $737.85 billion versus a surplus of $160.3 billion in the same period a year ago. The key takeaway from the report is that the huge swing in the budget was a function of the tax filing deadline being extended, and government spending surging, due to stimulus measures employed in response to the COVID-19 impact.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for April declined to 90.9 from 96.4 in March.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for April and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +0.3% YTDS&P 500 -11.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -16.7% YTDRussell 2000 -23.6% YTD16:21MYL Mylan N.V. confirms agreement to distribute Gilead Sciences' (GILD) remdesivir for the potential treatment of COVID-19 in certain regions (16.23 -0.72)Mylan N.V. announced, as part of its ongoing efforts to support patients and public health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, a global collaboration with Gilead Sciences to expand access to the investigational antiviral remdesivir for the potential treatment of COVID-19.

This third expansion further increases the number of high-throughput PCR instruments that labs can use to run tests and also provides new options for reagents and consumables used in sample preparation and extraction to provide greater flexibility in testing workflows.16:09ADPT Adaptive Biotechnologies misses by $0.04, misses on revs; withdraws guidance (38.06 -0.06)Reports Q1 (Mar) loss of $0.25 per share, $0.04 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.21); revenues rose 65.1% year/year to $20.91 mln vs the $21.52 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) was a loss of $28.0 million for the first quarter of 2020, compared to a loss of $15.2 million for the first quarter of the prior year. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was $655.8 million as of March 31, 2020. Given the ongoing uncertainty of the scope, duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Adaptive Biotechnologies is withdrawing its previously announced annual revenue guidance for 2020, which was issued on February 26, 2020.16:09INFN Infinera misses by $0.09, beats on revs; guides Q2 revs in-line (5.80 +0.17)Reports Q1 (Mar) loss of $(0.27) per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.09 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.18); revenues rose 12.8% year/year to $330.27 mln vs the $318.31 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The COVID-19 pandemic reduced IVL catheter sales toward the end of the first quarter of 2020 and is continuing to adversely impact sales in the second quarter of 2020. The pandemic could also significantly impact the financial health of our customers which could pressure hospital spending and impact pricing. As a result of these factors as well as the uncertain scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and uncertain timing of global recovery, we cannot, at this time, reliably estimate the future impact on IVL catheter sales, and in turn, our operations and financial results.16:05NVST Envista misses by $0.07, misses on revs (15.98 -1.50)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.03 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.07 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.10; revenues fell 17.1% year/year to $547.2 mln vs the $569.07 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Co previously withdrew 2020 guidance.16:04EGHT 8x8 signs strategic partnership with Virgin Media Business (20.42 +0.55)8x8 today announced a partnership with Virgin Media Business, one of the UK's largest business data network providers and supplier of business communications solutions to more than 50,000 UK businesses.

Co stated that in the first days of the pandemic, it observed in Brazil a significant increase in interest in investments; its Retail Research Platform and InfoMoney portal reached record audiences. Co's active clients totaled 2.0 mln at the end of Q1, up +81% yr/yr, driven by the expansion of co's direct and B2B channels and its three retail brands. Reaches two-month highs.BLK (487.92 +7.37%): Priced the secondary offering of 28,753,248 shares of common stock held by PNC Financial (PNC) at $420/share. The stock rebounds from yesterday's circa 8% drop. ALC (56.43 +6.07%): Topped consensus for Q1 EPS and revs. Widespread shutdowns in March negatively impacted co's results following "strong sales growth" in both of co's franchises during the first two months of the year. Co expects Q2 results to be negatively impacted by the ongoing coronavirus crisis, but given the critical nature of eye care, customer demand is expected to resume as conditions normalize and improve through the back half of the year.Large Cap LosersPODD (194.85 -11.71%): Announced an offering of $500 mln of its common stock, or 2,369,668 shares priced at $211.00/share; proceeds are expected to be dedicated to general corporate purposes. Co has also been scheduled to present this afternoon at the BofA Securities Virtual Healthcare Conference. Pulls back from recent all-time highs. CARR (16.43 -7.7%): Sees continued volatility, now giving up what remained of a circa +12% advance mounted last Friday. OKE (30.49 -7.44%): Underperforms alongside various energy sector peers; the energy space lags the broader market.

The current S&P CapitalIQ consensus is for adjusted EPS of $0.69 and revenue of $211.3 mln. JACK previously withdrew its FY20 guidance, so we certainly do not expect any full year guidance. Even before the pandemic, JACK did not typically provide quarterly guidance, so we're also not expecting any JunQ guidance.In terms of key metrics, system same-store comps are clearly important. However, JACK has already announced Q2 comps, which were -4.2%. Comps were running at +5.2% for the seven weeks ending March 8, but the final five weeks of the quarter (March 9-April 12), comps were -17.0%. So this won't be new information, but hopefully we get some directional comp data since the quarter ended on April 12. On April 16, Jack in the Box had some big news as it named Darin Harris as it's new CEO. He will take over no later than June 15. Most recently, Harris served as CEO of North America for IWG PLC, the holding group for several providers of over 1,000 flexible workspaces. Harris is also the former CEO of CiCi's Pizza. Harris takes over from Lenny Comma, who plans to retire. Hopefully, we will get some initial insight in terms of possible changes he may make. In terms of the pandemic impact, the company has had minimal temporary closures, with over 99% of restaurants open on each day during the COVID-19 pandemic. All locations are operating in an off-premise capacity, mostly via drive-thru lanes. In terms of how JACK performs relative to consensus, it can be somewhat volatile. It has reported two EPS misses in a row, including a large $0.21 miss in Q1. On a final note, Wendy's (WEN) recently reported good Q1 results. What jumped off the page to us was Wendy's US weekly comp performance in early Q2, which had returned to nearly flat comps even as its locations are limited to drive-thru/delivery. We will see if JACK saw a similar bullish comp direction in late April and early May.15:17SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- 8x8 (EGHT) pulls back following quarterly earnings press -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersSNX (90.97 +8.75%): Guided for Q2 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.00-1.00. Co stated that since March, it has "rapidly enabled additional work-from-home capabilities to support its client base needs" while Technology Solutions has continued to support the at-home requirements of customers; these increased abilities are the main contributors to co's improved Q2 outlook. Co has increased its liquidity position to nearly $2 bln. Co also announced a distribution agreement with cybersecurity company Bitdefender. BRFS (3.79 +8.29%): Rises to its new highest levels for the month, seeing relative strength alongside certain food and grocery industry peers in the consumer staples sector. Among recent items, co reported Q1 earnings earlier this week and today filed an Integrated Report for 2019. Co commented during its Q1 call that it expects to face challenges on the supply side. (Related: UNFI, BGS, FLO...) ALEC (30 +6.23%): Reported Q1 results; revs rose +28.6% yr/yr to $7.17 mln due to an increase in expenses for the AL002 and AL003 programs vs the prior year period. Co stated that it remains on track to advance AL001 into a pivotal Phase 3 study in FTD-GRN patients in 2020; it also noted that ongoing activities for AL003, AL101, and AL014 are continuing as planned and that it plans to initiate a Phase 2 study of AL002 in Alzheimer's patients in 2020. Co believes that its cash and investments as of March 31 will be sufficient to fund its anticipated operations through 2022.Mid Cap LosersEGHT (15.44 -24.39%): Reported Q4 results, topping consensus for EPS and revs. Service revs grew +30.2% yr/yr. Co commented that churn levels are higher than it would like, particularly in legacy small business VoIP customers, impacting co's net dollar retention rate. Guided Q1 revs in-line. During its call, co stated that it expects its service revenue growth rate for FY21 to range from +17-18%. Drops from yesterday's three-month highs.COTY (3.68 -14.78%): Downgraded to Neutral from Outperform and assigned a $5 target at Exane BNP Paribas. The stock now reaches its lowest levels since mid-March. CLR (12.51 -13.4%): Energy sector generally underperforms. At two-week lows.

Treasuries started the cash session with modest gains after concerns about a second wave of coronavirus infections weighed on risk tolerance in Asia and Europe. Treasuries climbed to fresh highs in mid-morning trade, responding to the release of Fed Chairman Jay Powell's prepared remarks from a virtual event hosted by the Peterson Institute. The Fed Chairman said that he expects only a gradual economic recovery and he repeated his opposition to a negative interest rate policy in the U.S. Treasuries slipped back to their starting levels well before the conclusion of the event with Chairman Powell and remained in that range into the late morning, when a push to fresh highs took place alongside selling in equities. Treasuries remained near their highs into midday action but made another return toward their starting levels after the completion of a $22 bln 30-yr bond auction, which was met with lukewarm demand. The U.S. Dollar Index retreated toward its 50-day moving average (99.53) in overnight trade but rallied 0.3% to 100.24 as the day went on, reclaiming its loss from yesterday. Yield Check: 2-yr: -1 bp to 0.15% 3-yr: UNCH at 0.20% 5-yr: -2 bps to 0.32% 10-yr: -3 bps to 0.65% 30-yr: -4 bps to 1.34%News: Global Times reported that China is ready to impose sanctions on U.S. individuals and entities who pursue COVID-19 damages from the Chinese government. A partial lockdown was reportedly implemented in China's Jilin City due to a spike in coronavirus cases. Hong Kong reported its first instance of community coronavirus transmission in nearly a month. Japan's Economy Minister, Yasutoshi Nishimura, said that the Japanese government and the Bank of Japan are determined to prevent deflation from taking hold. Yonhap reported that South Korean officials urged Japan to remove trade restrictions on materials essential for South Korea's production of displays and semiconductors. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand left its official cash rate at 0.25%, as expected, and increased its asset purchase program to NZD60 bln from NZD30 bln. South Korea's April Unemployment Rate remained at 3.8%. Eurozone's March Industrial Production fell 11.3% m/m (expected -12.1%; last -0.1%), contracting 12.9% yr/yr (expected -12.4%; last -2.2%). U.K.'s Q1 GDP contracted 2.0% qtr/qtr (expected -2.5%; last 0.0%), falling 1.6% yr/yr (expected -2.1%; last 1.1%). Q1 Business Investment was unchanged qtr/qtr (expected -2.5%; last -0.5%), increasing 0.7% yr/yr (last 1.8%). March trade deficit totaled GBP12.51 bln (expected deficit of GBP10.00 bln; last deficit of GBP9.83 bln). $22 bln 30-year Treasury bond auction results (prior 12-auction average): High yield: 1.342% (2.225%). Bid-to-cover: 2.30 (2.31). Indirect bid: 65.7% (61.2%). Direct bid: 12.9% (15.5%). Today's Data: The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 1.3% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -0.5%), marking its biggest decrease since records began in December 2009. Most of that decline was attributed to a 3.3% drop in prices for final demand goods. Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, declined 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus -0.2%), leaving it up just 0.6% yr/yr. The Producer Price Index for April may not be convincing enough to the Fed to go down the negative interest rate road, yet the key takeaway is that it will certainly keep it on the path at the lower bound. The weekly MBA Mortgage Index ticked up 0.3% to follow last week's 0.1% uptick. The Purchase Index jumped 10.6% while the Refinance Index fell 3.3%. Weekly crude oil inventories decreased by 750,000 barrels after increasing by 4.6 mln barrels during the previous week.

The company has been working aggressively the last few months to repurpose its cell-based vaccine platform targeting solid tumors for use against viral diseases.Orgenesis believes its new vaccine platform offers a unique approach to cell vaccination that holds promise for an affordable and reproducible vaccine for both COVID-19 and other viral diseases. The company is moving forward with planned animal testing for its cell-based vaccine platform in COVID-19 and looks forward to providing a more detailed timeline of activities including plans for initial human testing, assuming clearance from the FDA and/or other non-US regulatory bodies to do so.14:09CSCO Cisco: Earnings Preview -- Will be our first in-depth look at a major tech company that includes the pandemic's impact on April (41.83 -1.39)Cisco Systems (CSCO) is set to report Q3 (Apr) results today after the close with a call to follow at 4:30pm ET. The current S&P CapitalIQ consensus is for adjusted EPS of $0.71 and revenue of $11.85 bln, an -8.6% yr/yr decline. Cisco typically guides for EPS and revenue for the next quarter. The company has been silent in terms of whether it plans to provide guidance going forward, so we'll see.Last quarter, Cisco guided to Q3 adjusted EPS of $0.79-0.81 and a revenue decline of -3.5% to -1.5%. However, with consensus estimates well below this guidance, it seems analysts are skeptical Cisco will hit those numbers. Current guidance for non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 is 32.5-33.5%. Cisco is a particularly important tech name to watch with earnings. Because it's so large and touches so many areas, it's a great barometer to get a general sense for enterprise sending levels on IT. It's also the first big tech name to report that includes the month of April. The pandemic hit in mid-to-late March and while other IT names provided the pandemic's impact on the tail end of their Q1 results, this will be our first in-depth look at a major tech company that includes the impact on April. We should also get some color on how the summer may play out. In terms of how Cisco performs relative to consensus, it typically beats modestly on EPS in the $0.01-0.03 range with modest revenue upside. It has not missed on EPS or revs in the past five years, so if it did so, that would be notable13:48XLP Sector Briefing: Consumer Staples (57.09 -0.46)All eleven sectors trade in negative territory with five groups down 2.0% or more. Growth-sensitive sectors are at the forefront of today's retreat while countercyclical groups have fared a bit better.The consumer staples sector (-0.8%) shows a slimmer loss than most of its peers, continuing this week's trend. The sector is down 1.8% for the week versus a 3.9% week-to-date loss in the S&P 500 (-1.9%).Roughly 2/3 of the sector's components trade in the red while a couple major retailers and a handful of food companies hold gains, resulting in outperformance versus the broader market.Notable movers:General Mills (GIS 63.64, +1.13, +1.8%): leading component, rising to its best level since early 2017. Kroger (KR 33.90, +0.35, +1.0%): touched an eight-week high earlier today. Clorox (CLX 206.97, +1.29, +0.6%): rising toward its March high (214.26) amid expectations for continued strong demand for cleaning products. Walmart (WMT 124.59, +0.81, +0.7%): touched its best level since mid-March earlier. Kellogg (K 63.82, +0.29, +0.5%): remains bookended by its 50-day (62.75) and 200-day (64.33) moving averages. J.M. Smucker (SJM 118.27, +0.29, +0.3%): seeking its fourth consecutive gain. Coty (COTY 3.70, -0.63, -14.6%): weakest performer in the sector, falling toward its March low (3.02). Exane BNP Paribas downgraded the stock to Neutral from Outperform with a $5 target.13:35COMDX Metals Settlement PricesJun gold settled today's session up $9.10 (0.53%) at $1715.9/oz Jul silver settled today's session $0.05 lower (0.31%) at $15.66/oz Jul copper settled $0.01 lower (0.47%) at $2.348/lb13:24OPTNX Unusual Options ActivityThe following options are exhibiting notable trading, potentially indicating changing sentiment toward the underlying stocks, and/or potentially representing positioning for increased volatility.Bullish Call Activity:AGI May 7.5 calls (volume: 1520, open int: 1380, implied vol: ~92%, prev day implied vol: 68%). 1300 contracts traded in a single transaction.

EBITDA up circa +32% yr/yr. Management commented that consumer demand for its natural and conventional products alike surged early in Q3 and remains elevated. Strong demand has allowed co to leverage fixed costs and capitalize on integration efforts undertaken in connection with the Supervalu acquisition. After hiring over 2,000 new associates in March and April, co continues to recruit additional associates to meet heightened demand. Upgraded to Equal Weight at Wells Fargo. At 52-week highs.PGNY (25.43 +24.11%): Topped expectations for Q1 EPS and revs (+72% yr/yr to $81.0 mln). Adj. EBITDA grew +64% yr/yr. Co commented that volumes were negatively impacted in March by COVID-19 disruptions. American Society for Reproductive Medicine guidelines issued in mid-March recommending the suspension of new treatment cycles resulted in a majority of co's members being unable to complete diagnostics or initiate new treatment cycles; ASRM has more recently updated its guidelines to provide fertility clinics with a path for the gradual resumption of patient care, and co has in the last few weeks begun to see acceleration in the appointment volumes and the dispensing of fertility medications. Co mentioned that it has been "shielded from the worst impacts of the historic levels of unemployment due to the composition of [its] client base." Spiked to two-month highs. PGTI (11.9 +21.75%): Posted upside Q1 EPS and revs (+26.8% yr/yr to $220.2 mln, including contributions from the NewSouth acquisition). Adj. EBITDA grew +39%. Co has withdrawn its annual guidance, but it noted that it expects Q2 consolidated net sales to decline 7-10% yr/yr, primarily as a result of COVID-19 and a related reduction in orders. Co is "seeing a building pipeline of orders in [its] Florida markets in May" and is beginning to build back capacity there to meet recovering demand. Rises to two-month highs.Small Cap LosersVREX (18 -28.88%): Missed expectations for Q2 EPS and revs. In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, co experienced a "substantial shift in mix between and within [its] business segments that lowered [its] overall margins." Co expects uncertainty in demand for certain products for medical and industrial applications and increased variability in supply chain and manufacturing productivity to continue through at least the remainder of the fiscal year. Withdrew its previously-issued FY20 guidance. Downgraded to Neutral from Overweight at JPMorgan. INFN (4.45 -23.36%): Missed expectations for Q1 EPS on upside revs (+12.8% yr/yr to $330.27 mln). Issued in-line guidance for Q2. Co stated that it is on-track for ICE6 delivery this year. Downgraded to Market Perform at Northland Capital. Drops to its lowest levels since late March. RIG (1.38 -18.39%): Sees volatility on above average volume alongside certain peers in the lagging energy sector. Among recent energy industry press and data, US commercial crude oil inventories decreased by 0.7 mln barrels from the previous week, and OPEC stated in a monthly report that it now expects world oil demand to drop by 9.07 mb/d in 2020.

The S&P 500 is down 1.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 2.0%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.6%.Prior to the open, Fed Chair Powell said the economic outlook remains uncertain and is subject to significant downside risks. In addition, Mr. Powell repeated that the central bank is committed to doing more, except tampering with negative interest rates, and said additional fiscal stimulus could be worth it if it helps avoid long-term pain.There was nothing out of the ordinary in Fed Powell's speech, and the S&P 500 even traded positive at one point this morning. Still, the market has had to contend with valuation concerns, growing skepticism against China, and road bumps in COVID-19 progress.At this juncture, all 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading lower with the energy (-4.1%) and financials (-3.1%) sectors leading the retreat. The real estate (-0.9%) and consumer staples (-0.4%) sectors are the lone sectors down less than 1.0%.Tensions with China have been stirred by the FBI confirming China-affiliated cyber actors have targeted U.S. organizations conducting COVID-19-related research.

The R&O was adopted during the FCC's May 13 Open Meeting. The new regulatory framework will allow 900 MHz licensees, like Anterix, to obtain broadband licenses and includes operational and technical rules to minimize interference to narrowband operations. "We applaud the FCC for this bold decision to repurpose under-utilized spectrum, unleashing the power of broadband for utilities and other enterprises to build private LTE communications networks," said Morgan O'Brien, CEO of Anterix. "For the utility sector, grid modernization has been a critical industry priority, but the scarcity of foundational spectrum to support necessary wireless broadband communications had constrained its efforts. This unanimous decision sends a strong signal that the FCC 'walks the walk' of revising its rules to clear scarce spectrum [...] to make way for innovation, efficiency and competition."11:30BONDX New SupplyTreasury Auction Preview$22 bln 30-year Treasury bond auction (results at 13:00 ET) Prior auction results: High yield: 1.325% Bid-to-cover: 2.35 Indirect bid: 66.4% Direct bid: 11.0% Average results of previous 12 auctions: High yield: 2.225% Bid-to-cover: 2.31 Indirect bid: 61.2% Direct bid: 15.5%11:20XLF Sector Briefing: Financials (20.75 -0.54)Ten out of eleven sectors trade in negative territory today with financials (-2.3%) showing relative weakness.

He went on to suggest that the Fed will continue to do what is necessary to help support the recovery but noted that further fiscal support could be needed to help avoid long-term damage to the economy.In brief, he sounded generally cautious about recovery prospects, which has led to an otherwise cautious trading tone in the stock market.That caution has manifested itself in the relative strength of the health care (+0.1%), consumer staples (-0.1%), and information technology (-0.1%) sectors, the latter of which has been heavily influenced by the relative strength of its mega-cap leaders, Microsoft (MSFT 182.29, -0.22, -0.1%) and Apple (AAPL 313.08, +1.67, +0.5%).Similarly, relative strength in Amazon.com (AMZN 2386.61, +29.66, +1.3%), Alphabet (GOOG 1370.89, -4.85, -0.4%), and Facebook (FB 208.70, -1.40, -0.7%) has helped temper today's losses.Today's biggest loser is the energy sector (-3.9%) followed by the financial (-2.2%), industrials (-1.8%), and materials (-1.3%) sectors, which is befitting a market that might be second-guessing the pace of recovery prospects in the wake of the Fed chair's speech and the understanding that Senate Republicans are reportedly balking at a $3 trillion coronavirus relief package unveiled yesterday by House Democrats. Some reports have suggested it has been deemed "dead on arrival."The Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2%; the S&P 500 is down 0.6%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.0%; and the Russell 2000 is down 1.8%.10:43OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:KDP Jun 26 calls are seeing interest with 3720 contracts trading vs. open int of 200, pushing implied vol up around 4 points to ~34%.

To preserve cash, management acted on a variety of cost-saving measures, including the deferral of heavy maintenance costs and over 6,000 voluntary employee leaves of absence (~40% of its workforce). With limited visibility into the recovery, GOL's current planning scenario assumes (-45)% y/y 2020 capacity, including (-30)% y/y by 4Q20, but it has the flexibility to respond to prevailing demand trends. The Company has grounded 120 aircraft (~92% of its fleet) since March 28 and flights in April were operated from the Guarulhos airport in So Paulo to all of Brazil's state capitals and the federal capital in Brasilia, which represents 7% of the April 2019 schedule. As of April 30, the Company had R$4.0 billion in total liquidity, which implies over 10 months of cash on hand (excluding refunds and restricted cash).

Economic forecasts are uncertain in the best of times, and today the virus raises a new set of questions: How quickly and sustainably will it be brought under control? Can new outbreaks be avoided as social-distancing measures lapse? How long will it take for confidence to return and normal spending to resume? And what will be the scope and timing of new therapies, testing, or a vaccine? The answers to these questions will go a long way toward setting the timing and pace of the economic recovery. Since the answers are currently unknowable, policies will need to be ready to address a range of possible outcomes.""We ought to do what we can to avoid these outcomes, and that may require additional policy measures. At the Fed, we will continue to use our tools to their fullest until the crisis has passed and the economic recovery is well under way. Recall that the Fed has lending powers, not spending powers. A loan from a Fed facility can provide a bridge across temporary interruptions to liquidity, and those loans will help many borrowers get through the current crisis. But the recovery may take some time to gather momentum, and the passage of time can turn liquidity problems into solvency problems. Additional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it if it helps avoid long-term economic damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery. This tradeoff is one for our elected representatives, who wield powers of taxation and spending."Full Speech09:02WIRES On The WiresJohn Stephens, senior EVP and CFO of AT&T (T), spoke today at the MoffettNathanson Media & Communications Summit, where he provided an update to shareholders.

Given the impact of COVID-19, booking volumes for the remainder of 2020 are meaningfully lower than the same time last year at prices that are down low-single digits. Due to the suspension in sailings, booking trends reflect elevated cancellations for 2020 and more typical levels for 2021 and beyond. Although still early in the booking cycle, the booked position for 2021 is within historical ranges when compared to same time last year with 2021 prices up mid-single digits compared to 2020, subject to the uncertainty around the duration of our suspension of sailings and resumption of service. The company has instituted several programs in order to best serve its guests: for cancelled cruises, guests are offered the choice of future cruise credits valued at 125% of the initial cruise fare paid in lieu of providing cash refunds. These future cruise credits can be redeemed on any sailing on or before December 31, 2021. As of April 30, 2020, approximately 45% of the guests have requested cash refunds. For non-cancelled cruises, the company has implemented a "Cruise with Confidence" policy. This policy allows guests to cancel up to 48 hours prior to sailing (for sailings on or before August 1, 2020) and receive a full credit for their fare usable until April 30, 2022. As of March 31, 2020, the company had $2.4 billion in customer deposits. This includes approximately $0.8 billion of future cruise credits related to previously announced voyage cancellations through June 11, 2020. The Company also continues to take future bookings for 2020, 2021 and 2022, and receive new customer deposits and final payments on these bookings.The company estimates its cash burn to be, on average, in the range of approximately $250 million to $275 million per month during a prolonged suspension of operations. This range includes ongoing ship operating expenses, administrative expenses, debt service expense, hedging costs, expected necessary capital expenditures (net of committed financings in the case of newbuilds) and excludes cash refunds of customer deposits as well as cash inflows from new and existing bookings. The company is considering ways to further reduce the average monthly requirement under a further prolonged out-of-service scenario and during start-up of operations. The Company continues to identify and evaluate further actions to improve its liquidity. These include and are not limited to: further reductions in capital expenditures, operating expenses and administrative costs and additional financings.07:48TMO Thermo Fisher expands response to the COVID-19 pandemic by developing a total antibodies test in collaboration with WuXi Diagnostics and Mayo Clinic (331.72 )The new test is the result of ongoing collaboration between all three organizations, including clinical evaluation and support from Mayo Clinic.

At three months, he also had leukocyte enzyme and plasma enzyme activity levels approximately three times higher than the mean activity level of the first three patients in the same trial at the same timepoint.New data will also be presented from the first patient dosed in the investigator-sponsored Phase 1/2 trial of AVR-RD-04 for cystinosis, a progressive disease marked by the accumulation of cystine in cellular organelles known as lysosomes. This buildup can cause debilitating symptoms including kidney failure, corneal damage and thyroid dysfunction, often leading to a shortened lifespan. Currently, more than 90 percent of treated cystinosis patients require a kidney transplant in the second or third decade of life. The current standard of care for cystinosis is cysteamine, a burdensome treatment regimen that can require dozens of pills per day and may not prevent overall progression of the disease.07:04VNDA Vanda Pharma reaches agreement with the FDA to resubmit its application for HETLIOZ for the treatment of Smith-Magenis Syndrome (11.38 )As previously disclosed, Vanda received a Refusal to File letter from the FDA on March 12, 2020.

During fiscal April, the company's non-safety and janitorial product lines saw a significant decline versus the prior year due to the impact of prolonged customer shutdowns and world-wide efforts to control COVID-19.

In either case, all 11 S&P 500 sectors closed in negative territory, led lower by the real estate (-4.3%), industrials (-2.8%), and financials (-2.7%) sectors. The consumer staples (-0.9%) and utilities (-0.9%) sectors declined the least.Bank and airline stocks were among today's weakest performers, which was made evident in sharp declines in the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE 27.51, -1.45, -5.0%) and the U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS 12.68, -0.57, -4.3%).Bank stocks were pressured by a modest decline in Treasury yields and by President Trump rehashing calls for negative interest rates. Airline stocks were pressured by Boeing (BA 125.22, -3.69, -2.9%) CEO Calhoun telling NBC's "Today" show that a major U.S. airline could go bankrupt because of COVID-19 disruptions.Conversely, shares of Uber (UBER 32.40, +0.76, +2.4%) and GrubHub (GRUB 60.39, +13.60, +29.1%) exhibited strength after it was reported that Uber made a bid to acquire GrubHub.As previously noted, U.S. Treasury yields declined amid an uptick in demand for the safe-haven asset. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.16%, and the 10-yr yield declined five basis points to 0.68%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 99.97. WTI crude rose 5.3%, or $1.30, to $25.76/bbl.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data:The Consumer Price Index declined 0.8% m/m in April, as expected, while core CPI, which excludes food and energy, declined 0.4% (Briefing.com consensus -0.2%). That was the largest drop in total CPI since December 2008 and the largest drop on record going back to 1957 for core CPI.The key takeaway from the report is that it is a telltale reminder that the Federal Reserve isn't moving off the zero bound anytime soon.The Treasury Budget for April showed a deficit of $737.85 billion versus a surplus of $160.3 billion in the same period a year ago. The key takeaway from the report is that the huge swing in the budget was a function of the tax filing deadline being extended, and government spending surging, due to stimulus measures employed in response to the COVID-19 impact.The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for April declined to 90.9 from 96.4 in March.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for April and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +0.3% YTDS&P 500 -11.2% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -16.7% YTDRussell 2000 -23.6% YTD16:21MYL Mylan N.V. confirms agreement to distribute Gilead Sciences' (GILD) remdesivir for the potential treatment of COVID-19 in certain regions (16.23 -0.72)Mylan N.V. announced, as part of its ongoing efforts to support patients and public health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, a global collaboration with Gilead Sciences to expand access to the investigational antiviral remdesivir for the potential treatment of COVID-19.

THE CORONAVIRUS: KEEP CALM AND CARRY ONStates News ServiceMarch 3, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 4813 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: DENVER, CO BodyThe following information was released by the University of Denver:TranscriptAlyssa Hurst:You're listening to RadioEd, a University of Denver podcast.Lorne Fultonberg:We're your hosts, Lorne Fultonberg,Alyssa Hurst:Alyssa HurstNicole Militello:And I'm Nicole Militello.In today's episode we're talking about the new coronavirus. The mystery strain appeared back in December in China and has since spread to more than 40 countries across the globe, including the United States. So far we've see a scramble to contain the new coronavirus, economic fallout and a wave of xenophobia, but how concerned should we really be about this new virus? I sat down with professor Sandy Johnson, she's the director of the University of Denver's Global Health Affairs Program. We talked about everything from how countries are handling this outbreak to the race to find vaccinations and what she believes is the greatest risk we face in handling this outbreak. Thank you so much for being on the podcast.Sandy Johnson:I am so excited to be here.Nicole Militello:So let's start with what a coronavirus actually is because I was very fascinated to learn it can range from the common cold all the way to a much more serious illness like this current strain.Sandy Johnson:Yes, so coronavirus, you've probably read this in the news reports, they're named that way cause when we look at them under the microscope they look like a little crown. There are seven strains that we know of. Four of those strains are actually really quite mild. You had mentioned they're associated with the common cold. We do see that they are associated about one to 2% of the pneumonia cases in the United States, so it can be mild. They are associated with pneumonia. Now of course we have these three other strains, the first that really got global attention was SARS and that was about 2003. Little more than 800 cases ended up occurring worldwide that was a new strain of the coronavirus that we hadn't seen before and most importantly it behaved differently than the ones that we know of. It was associated with much more severe respiratory illness and what we saw was that it was impacting people that aren't our typical, vulnerable population. The other one that we have that we were concerned with is the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the MERS, so not SARS but MERS and 2014 was when we first saw that. It started in Saudi Arabia and we've seen clusters of that, that was scary because that is a very virulent disease. Case fatality rates with that are about 30%, but it doesn't seem to be as transmissible as other types of coronavirus and that hasn't really resulted in a pandemic. I think that people like you said, they don't realize that corona has been circulating in the U.S., we have four strains. It was interesting I was looking at Web M.D. last night they updated their site with new information and one of the doctors on the site said, "You know probably most of the people in the U.S. "have had a coronavirus and they didn't know it".Nicole Militello:Right. Yes, that's so interesting. So when a new coronavirus come onto the scene, how do we go from one person being diagnosed to suddenly it's a global outbreak?Sandy Johnson:It really depends upon the nature of the virus. How infective it is and how it's transmitted. So with the coronavirus that we're seeing right now the big issue is it's a respiratory virus, so that is the type that is most easy to spread from one person to another and I think that technology helps us and it hinders us. You know if this were 30 years ago, we wouldn't have the technology to be able to say this is a coronavirus, this has a different genetic strain than the other types of coronaviruses we're used to seeing. We'd probably look at this and say, Oh, okay, we're having a weird flu", we wouldn't really be able to differentiate it. Technology helps us because it allows us to say, "OK, we're seeing something a little different, "let's do some testing on this". "Hey, it's a coronavirus." "Hey, let's do the genetic..." "Hey, this isn't what we've seen before." And when you see something new in public health that triggers an immediate response because we want to make sure we don't have kind of that dreaded mutant virus that's going to wipe out the world, you know the thing that Stephen King writes about in his horror novels, and just to be clear that is not what we're seeing. But we have the technology to start to follow these novel viruses to see how they spread. The more data we have the better off we're going to be, not just in understanding what's happening with the current virus, but potentially it's going to help us prepare for that really scary super flu that may never happen, but the more we understand how they spread the better we're able to develop our responses.Nicole Militello:OK, so what changes when the World Health Organization declares something a Global Health Emergency?Sandy Johnson:OK, so with the coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern is actually what the declaration is and that was something that's set up under the International Health Regulations that changed because of SARS, where it's a way to basically trigger a surge response. When the WHO declares a public health emergency of international concern, I don't know how else to say it other than PHEIC, it's basically telling the world we need to work on this together. A coordinated response is going to be best, those countries that have human and fiscal resources you need to harness those and you need to start sharing those with countries that don't have the fiscal or human resources that are going to be necessary and really it is about a surge response. We need to help each other and particularly we need to help countries or health systems prepare and help those that are weaker health systems. So if you think about what's happening with the coronavirus when this was declared we were still seeing really only cases in China, but the concern was this is highly infectious, this is something like a bad flu, we want different countries to heighten their surveillance first and foremost cause we want to see if this is all spreading from contacts that are coming from China, if we're starting to see this kind of appear from unknown sources. We want to see how then it's spreading through the countries and put everyone on alert for the fact that not only do we need heightened surveillance, we need to prepare our medical staff, we need to provide proper training for infection containment, we need to make sure we have appropriate protective gear. When the coronavirus appeared we didn't really know if we had any type of antivirals in our arsenal that would work against it. WHO wanted to get the research community to start focusing on this.Nicole Militello:OK, so it's really just making it a priority on the global stage?Sandy Johnson:Yeah, absolutely and trying to get different actors to work together.Nicole Militello:China has faced a lot of criticism for their transparency on this virus, what do you think about it?Sandy Johnson:I think China's actually done a very good job.Nicole Militello:OK.Sandy Johnson:And this is a huge debate in the public health community, we think that maybe the first cases in China were maybe late November, but we're not entirely sure. What we've seen reported from China was the first confirmed cases they had came in mid-December and China reported this at the end of December; they reported it to the WHO. I'm going to say that that's the appropriate thing because you don't want to have somebody come in that's sick and you immediately push the alarm button. You want to actually figure out are they sick with something we know about or are they sick with something random? Are they sick with kind of this new, mutant virus? If it's only one case, do you pull the international alarm and at least history suggests maybe that's going to cause more panic. So I would argue that China actually did due diligence, they did it quickly and they reported it to the international community quite rapidly. It's always easy I think to criticize, but when you are faced with the type of large, public health problem that China had you have to prioritize. One priority you're taking care of the patients. One priority you're communicating with your population. Another priority you're communicating appropriate information that's going to help other researchers around the world. I would argue that they've done that.Nicole Militello:What do you think about the job the United States has done?Sandy Johnson:I am a little mixed on it. In part because I think we haven't had great health messaging and I just say this: I think if you look at Singapore, at least some of the stuff that I've seen from South Korea, in terms of the public service announcements that have been out there, I think we're just starting to catch up with that. Personally, I've gone to the CDC website every day and I don't find their website particularly helpful. I just have to say we are adults. Let the country know what this is, be clear about what it can and can't do, and provide resources for people to feel a little bit more empowered in what they can do.Nicole Militello:I'm curious how big of a role you think a country's messaging plays into the success of containing an outbreak?Sandy Johnson:Huge. I think it's two things. I think it's the messaging and I think it's also the resources that are put forward. Michael Osterholm who is the head of a group at University of Minnesota that looks at infectious disease, he had an op-ed in the paper the other day and he referenced Singapore and the Singapore government I think I would agree has done a great job with the messaging and with making resources available. Singapore did this with SARS and when you go back to 2003 when we saw SARS spread and we saw cases show up in Singapore the Singapore government I think had a good campaign to educate people and knowledge is power and knowledge can help alleviate some of the fear, not all of that cause there's uncertainty. They told people what to do, they told them where the resources were. Singapore is also a very wealthy, small state. Singapore was able to put a lot of resources in to it and one of the things that the government had done was basically say self-quarantine, stay at home, we're closing marketplaces, but know that there's going to be price stabilization, there's going to be income support. Short answer the message is important, but the resources are also important.Nicole Militello:So North Korea claims to have no cases of the coronavirus. Talk to us about how handling an epidemic in a country like North Korea is different?Sandy Johnson:I'll just say, look at Iran. Iran is an authoritarian country, it is a country where there is a lot of government control of messaging, it is a country that does not have a very strong health system and it is a country that has areas that are pretty much disconnected from whatever health system exists there. Iran had no cases and then all of a sudden it had, I think I calculated it, it had a cluster of cases and that cluster of cases there were 14 deaths out of 60, so all of a sudden, oh Iran has no cases and then we have a 40, 50% death rate?Nicole Militello:Right.Sandy Johnson:OK, that means there's more than 60 cases there and that means it's been there for much longer. Whether it wasn't detected or whether it wasn't reported, it's hard to say, but the problem is when you have that type of secretive government and you have a poor health system, it's going to spread. It's going to spread even if you have a good health system. I have to say that, but it's going to appear much worse than it actually is. To go from zero to 14 dead in a week, that's scary. I think that that is the problem with North Korea. We have no idea how many cases are there given not just the border with China, but given the trade with China you know there are cases there. Does the country have the ability to detect the cases? Not likely, you know even in the U.S. in countries like this we're talking about the shortage of tests to basically confirm that this is the novel coronavirus. You know North Korea given what little we know of their health system, which is that it's not very good and they don't have particularly good surveillance and monitoring. Given that, there maybe cases and the government's like okay, it the flu or okay, looks like a cold that are actually coronavirus and you know the problem is we don't know how hot the area is.Nicole Militello:Right. There has been a big discussion about the economic impacts of the coronavirus, especially with it originating in China, the world's second largest economy, largest exporter of goods. Let's just talk about the fallout. I know this is a lot to unpack, so let's start with the impact on tourism and airlines. The International Air Transport Association estimates that the total global loss revenue due to the coronavirus could be almost $30 billion. What's kind of the fallout that we're seeing there?Sandy Johnson:So, I would say that the travel industry is the easiest industry to look at the impacts. The first things that we saw flights were being canceled to and from China. China in the first four weeks basically shutdown the tourism operators and said, "you cannot book package tours outside of China." We started to see a decreased demand for airlines. We also saw pushback from those who work in the airline industry saying, "We want to protect ourselves," so flights were cut. That's the start of it. You know, we're likely going to see more and more cuts in flights as corona spreads. You know, were already seeing reduced flights to and from Italy and now it's all over Europe. So we're gonna continue to see that. A number of airlines have posted I think fairly dramatic losses or expected losses because of the lack of demand, that's going to continue and we don't really know how bad it's going to be, but that's a direct impact. You think about tourism we're starting to see the impact on hotels, not just because some of the hotels are going into lockdown, but again people aren't traveling, so the demand goes down. People aren't traveling or they can't travel because there are travel bans. You think about the service industry, that's dependent upon tourism, so that's going to play out in restaurants, that's going to play out in shops and there's going to be that multiplier effect through the community, which is not just going to impact income, but it's potentially going to impact employment. When you look at tourism different estimates say tourism is responsible for one in 10 jobs worldwide, so think of the number of people whose jobs are basically threatened. During this period of time how resilient are they? How able are they going to be to weather this? Do they have other employment opportunities? What happens? And that's gonna be both short and long-term that we're going to see that. I think for me the bigger concern is there are some countries that can certainly weather the storm. They have larger economies. I think China will ultimately be OK. Yes it's economy is gonna go down a little bit, but it has a large economy. It will be OK. Same thing with the U.S., not to dismiss what potentially can happen in the U.S. We're probably gonna see the economy shrink a little bit. You know Apple's already talked about reducing their projections, we'll survive that. What about these smaller countries? I was talking to a colleague of mine and he was talking about the impact with Kenyan Airlines. They had announced that they were expecting a loss of $80 million. That's huge. You think of some of these countries that are very heavily dependent on tourism that are much smaller. They're going to feel an impact and tourism is just one small strand.Nicole Militello:Right. So let's move on to trade. Do people need to worry if they did online shopping and they have an order coming from China? What are we seeing there?Sandy Johnson:OK, I think we're still figuring that out. What we're seeing is definitely supply chains are being interrupted and again that goes back to Apple saying our profits are going to be down because some of our parts are coming out of China. We're seeing a lot of conversation with global supply chain tied to essential medicines and tied to medical supplies. That's already been disrupted in part because those lovely little surgical masks that you get when you go to the doctor's office if you have a cold, many of the suppliers are in China. That's cut off. Not just the U.S., but many countries are actually dependent upon Chinese production for medicine. So many, like you have a computer in front of me and it's an Apple computer. You know parts in that computer are produced in China, so there's that potential for the supply chain interruption. We're seeing it with medical supplies, but also because there's a surge demand. The Chinese government is trying to reopen manufacturing plants. You know they're trying to make. It's not like the entire country is shutdown. I do have to say that. There are certain areas, particularly in Wuhan and around Wuhan that were very heavily impacted where I would say yes everything did shutdown, but the entire country didn't shutdown. We're seeing the government put in rules to try to basically introduce social distancing, to try to reduce the spread of the disease, but also keep manufacturing plants and other workplaces open. I think the interesting thing that we're seeing is looking at Korea and Korea is, yes we're going to cancel large events, but we are keeping our businesses open. We're dealing with, I think, a global community that understands how dependent we are upon each other and we want to take action to protect the health of people, but protecting the health of people sometimes means it's not about you getting a cold, it's not about you getting the flu, it's about making sure we have access to vital resources, we have food security. So I'm seeing efforts to try to mitigate the disruption to the global supply chain. What that's going to look like? I don't know. It is clearly going to impact trade, let me be clear on that. We know that's going to happen. Stock markets are all over the place and the supply chain... well go to the drugstore or go to the hardware store right now and try to get a mask.Nicole Militello:Right.Sandy Johnson:And what's interesting if you talk to the floor manager. I was talking to somebody in the store yesterday who's the floor manager and he was like, "Well, we haven't had these for four weeks because they're coming from China." So that's already been disrupted. I tend to think about the economic impact in terms of the direct impacts and then the indirect impacts and the direct impacts. I think of the airlines aren't running flights anymore, what are we spending on the response? What are we spending on our health teams? What are we spending on the medical supplies? What are the opportunity costs that are associated with that? For example, if you look at the U.S. we're still in the process of requisitioning funding for the corona response, but part of the pot of money that's been proposed by Congress was $500 million that was set aside for the Ebola response. That's part of a global health security strategy, so that money's not going to go there, but that doesn't mean Ebola's going away. So in my mind it's much easier to understand what are we spending on this, where is that money coming from? It's much more difficult to think about the indirect effects. The direct effect somebody is not at work, somebody is perhaps not earning income for several days while he or she is in quarantine. The indirect effect, that person now has less money, so they're not going to go spend their money outside.Nicole Militello:What kind of policy conversations have been on the global stage after a pandemic?Sandy Johnson:That's a good question. There is first and foremost, not just a lot of soul searching, there is very critical analysis of what the response was. The problem, of course at the global level you have the WHO, which is the technical expert for health response, you have the World Health Assembly which is made up of member states from the U.N., but then you have the national governments and even if there is consensus with WHO, even if there's consensus with kind of this global actor, that doesn't necessarily translate into national level policies. And I think one of the examples that we're seeing right now first after SARS then after the 2009 pandemic we had changes to the expectation, the roles that nation states are going to play if there's a large international health emergency. Some of the recommendations that came were you don't close borders, you don't cut off trade. OK, the global community has been saying that since 2003, they said it in 2009, they said it in 2014 to 2016 when closing borders and cutting off trade very severely impacting people in kind of the three countries that were experiencing the Ebola epidemic, but we're still doing that.Nicole Militello:Right, so have we really learned from the past enough do you think?Sandy Johnson:There are some things that I think the global community is doing better, but talking about global policy is incredibly complex because of state sovereignty and you know it takes one state to say, "No, I'm not going to do what you tell me to do" or "I'm not going to do what is recommended" to kind of start that domino effect and ultimately it's hard to argue against that because ultimately any national government is going to be responsible for protecting its citizens and what that means is going to be different from state to state.Nicole Militello:When we talk about a global outbreak, vaccinations are a really big part of that conversation and as of right now there is no vaccination for this new strain. Experts warn that a lifesaving vaccination could be years away. Can you talk a little bit about the race to find a vaccination during these situations?Sandy Johnson:So anytime we have a disease, you want tools to decrease the impact. A vaccine is going to prevent it, but there's also the potential for antivirals and antivirals are going to decrease the severity of it, decrease the duration of infectivity. So it's not all about vaccines, and I say this because in the U.S. we actually are seeing experimentation with an antiviral that scientists think will be useful in the current corona outbreak. We'll see what happens over the next few weeks, but 14 of the infected individuals from the Princess cruise ship are participating in this trial, so it's not all about vaccine. That's really important to know. You know if we can prevent a disease that is so much better then coming up with a treatment when somebody already has it. Technology for making vaccines is very complicated, even if you know what I'll call the secret formula and we don't have the secret formula for corona. And you know people were talking about a vaccine when SARS appeared. Different type of coronavirus, but we still don't have a vaccine for that.Nicole Militello:Right.Sandy Johnson:So we tend to see, oh my god there's an outbreak of something, we're going to put a lot of money into vaccine development and then as soon as the disease goes back down, those spikes go away, we forget about it. So right now if we came up today with the magic formula for a vaccine, we still have to test it, we have to make sure that it's safe and then we have to produce it and the production of vaccines is not easy. It might take three months for a batch of vaccines and a batch of vaccines is not going to cover seven billion people. This was something that we saw in the 2008-2009 influenza pandemic, we already knew how to make a vaccine for different influenza strains. We had to tinker with that so that it was responsive to the H1N1, but then it was three to six months to produce it and then when it was produced there wasn't enough to go around and so we had this panic over vaccine shortages. Of course my response is give the vaccines to the people that are most at risk. If we have them first and foremost get them to the healthcare workers because you want to keep them healthy and safe. Next, give them to the people in communities that have high rates of transmission. Here is a situation we don't have that magic recipe for the vaccine, we may or may not develop it and I think it's important that we keep researching it, but important message I think is we can still get through this even without a vaccine.Nicole Militello:A really important part of this conversation when we're talking about coronavirus is the xenophobia that we've seen come with it. What role does that play on the global stage when it comes to education, prevention, containing an outbreak.Sandy Johnson:Oh, it's huge and it's been an issue with every pandemic and I'll just start... I tell my students this. You know, we think of the 1918 influenza, we call it the Spanish Flu, it started in the U.S. The U.S. had better marketing. We had press controls and Spain didn't, but there's an incredible amount of stigma that goes with where a disease starts and of course this comes in to play. We've seen these lovely myths that China created this as a bio-weapon. No, no China didn't create this as a bio-weapon. The sad part is when people are afraid we look for something that's different about what we're afraid of. And, OK, this virus we first see it in China, it comes from China, well that's immediately a difference. We're from the U.S. They're from China. And it's human nature to fear and to blame. Now, we're rational beings and in theory we're enlightened beings, so we should be able to get over that, but going back to your question, we've seen this with every pandemic. I mean going back to 2019 the type A H1N1 it was first discovered in Mexico and for a while it was called the Mexican Swine Flu. And what did we see? We saw the borders with Mexico close. We saw the messaging "Don't go to Mexico and this is just playing into some of the xenophobia that's already there. To me what's really scary is not just in the U.S., but in a number of countries around the world we are in a period of incredibly high levels of nationalism. This is going to play out with coronavirus and all of a sudden we have a reason to take action against the other and in my opinion we're seeing that with some of the policies already. When the U.S. said okay, we're not going to accept anyone into the U.S. who has been in China within the last 14 days. What does that mean? We're not accepting Chinese into the country. I mean how is that not racist, xenophobic. How is that not using the coronavirus as an excuse for fear mongering and for some of this kind of nationalism that we're seeing, but again it's not just in the U.S. The attacks that we saw in Germany, part of the motivation at least that came through in the news is you know foreigners fear of the coronavirus, so we're just protecting ourselves. It's an excuse.Nicole Militello:What is the greatest risk that we face right now in handling this outbreak?Sandy Johnson:Panicking. There have been so many wonderful interviews with medical personnel and they keep saying, "keep calm and carry on" and I think that that is so important. We are probably going to see coronavirus, again that beautiful thing that was on Web M.D. that said, "everyone's probably "already had a coronavirus", if we weren't calling this coronavirus, if this were just something that looked like the flu we wouldn't see the quarantines, we wouldn't see the borders closing. I mean we don't shut down the planes during flu season.Nicole Militello:Right.Sandy Johnson:But we're seeing this because we have a name, so don't panic. Don't panic. The good news is this is a case fatality rate that's not horrible. It's not to say getting sick isn't a problem and that's not to say if you think if everyone in the world were to be infected with this, seven billion people and 2% of them died from this that is horrible. Not everyone's gonna be infected.Nicole Militello:So keep calm and carry on.Sandy Johnson:Keep calm and carry on. And you know, coronavirus, we're learning so much from it and that's going to help us if and when something really, really scary comes along. But let's not be stupid.Nicole Militello:To learn more about the latest on the coronavirus or to hear more about Sandy Johnson's latest work visit our show notes at du.edu/radioed.

The peso is appreciated 1% despite the increase in tension between China and the USCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 15, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 245 wordsBodyThe Mexican peso is appreciated 1% supported by the rise in the price of oil, but the trend for the rest of the session was conditioned on sentiment around tense U.S.-China relations and the evolution of the pandemic.For now, oil behavior counteracted us President Donald Trump's comments, which pointed to a deeper deterioration of his relationship with China by the new coronavirus, and even suggested that he could sever ties to the world's second economy. Lee: Trump strikes China again for his response to the new coronavirusThe local currency is trading at 23,8080 per dollar, with an appreciation of 1.1% against the 24,0680 pesos of Thursday's closing price of Banxico. Investor caution increased in the session, after the U.S. government sought to block semiconductor shipments from global chipmakers to Huawei Technologies, an action that could raise tensions with China."Although no official announcement has been made, it is mentioned that the (US blocking) measure is supported by national security protection and confirmed, there is likely to be a response from the Chinese government," said Gabriela Siller, director of analysis at Banco Base.Oil prices touched a maximum of a month and a half , driven by signs that demand is recovering and then China reported an increase in operations at its refineries. The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) contract rose 65 cents, or 2.36%, to $28.21. Meanwhile, Brent was advancing 81 cents, or 2.6%, to $31.94 per barrel.Load-Date: May 16, 2020End of Document

WHY AMERICA MUST WIN THE RACE TO 5GStates News ServiceMarch 15, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 996 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for the National Interest (former the Nixon Center):The United States has entered another technology duel on par with the space racethe race for the 5G network. It will revolutionize digital interconnectivity through enhanced data processing and storage capacity. The Chinese technology giant Huawei is capturing the 5G telecommunications equipment industry worldwide. Huawei promotes contracts covering every aspect of the 5G network from financing to installation. The United States is concerned that the company's growth amplifies China's political sway and brings security vulnerabilities.Huawei is subservient to the communist government under Chinese law. Multiple governments have indicted Huawei for espionage, theft, bribery, and corruption. The United States has added to these charges obstruction of justice, fraud, and illicit sales to the rogue regimes of Iran and North Korea. As the West and China haggle over the 5G market, several nations face a telling choice. To meet the 5G challenge, the United States should negotiate trade agreements on end-to-end 5G services, create supply chains for upcoming virtualized 5G networks, support alternate suppliers, and invest in domestic research to dampen Huawei's expansion.Through partial trade agreements on end-to-end 5G services, the United States. can empower partners such as Sweden, Finland, and Japan that have equipment providers that rival Huawei. Furthermore, plurilateral trade agreements that forge supply chains for a virtualized 5G network will enrich and extend trade relations. Within the next five years, the 5G network will morph into a software-based system that surpasses Huawei's hardware-based model in functionality, performance, and permanence. The United States can orchestrate this transition by brokering valuable commodity chains in advance.American policy should also include robust investment in domestic research. Because China recognizes that innovation is key to American power, it is feverishly outspending the United States in 5G technology. Research is the source of innovation, a magnet for foreign investment, and an important bridge between countries. Therefore, it will be a determinant in the 5G race.A policy that champions trade agreements and domestic research to counter Huawei will succeed for three reasons:First, trade agreements and domestic research provide incentives to reject Huawei. As a government-subsidized firm, Huawei underprices its competitors. Trade agreements give preferred providers the supply chains, resources, and revenue needed to counterbalance advantages conferred by Huawei's subsidies and immense domestic market. They reinforce political and economic alliances. They offer lasting gains in the form of expanded markets, efficient exchanges, fair competition, and foreign investment. Substantial research programs also increase mutual investment and information sharing.Second, trade agreements and domestic research establish American leadership. With salutary trade conditions, the United States can regain market power in the long term and reorient the 5G market toward its offerings which are integral to virtualized 5G networks. American research contributes to leadership by allowing the United States. to institute standards and shape ancillary product development. Innovation in virtualized network technology presents an excellent prospect for leadership through research. Even states that select Huawei as a vendor, such as the United Kingdom, concede the risks attached to Chinese technology. The United Kingdom anticipates virtualization will be a hedge against its gamble. If the United States can fill this security gap through virtualized technology, it can win the confidence and commerce of other nations.Third, trade agreements and domestic research facilitate a sustainable solution to China's 5G challenge. Trade deals with like-minded countries affirm the free market values that underpin the liberal international order. Domestic research spurs innovation, enabling the United States to contest Chinese technological prowess and preclude its political hegemony.Some may contend that trade practices and domestic research that exclude Huawei will raise the cost of acquiring 5G technologies, hurt American businesses, and exacerbate the trade deficit. While barring Huawei has short-term costs, it will ensure lasting economic security and vibrancy. It will preserve favorable environments for U.S. companies, fuel technological ingenuity, and prevent monetary losses caused by malicious cyber activity. Investment in virtualized 5G network mechanisms will ultimately curb operating costs, heighten network quality, and multiply consumer choices.Others might argue that bypassing Huawei in trade agreements will set the U.S. further behind in the technology race. However, in comparison to Huawei, American-endorsed suppliers such as Ericsson, Nokia, Samsung, and Qualcomm have more substantive patents and match Huawei's capability. There are ample opportunities for the U.S. to regain momentum. Core 5G applications have yet to be released, and the United States has the skilled labor to develop them. Moreover, virtualized network architecture plays to American strengths in software, semiconductors, cloud sharing systems, and advanced computers.Like its predecessor, the race for 5G network deployment has implications for U.S. security, influence, and prosperity. As signals crisscross the world, they will affect the contours of the international order. They will cede power to states that fashion them into systems advancing their national interests. Trade and innovation are instrumental in America's ability to inspire allies to look beyond Huawei's instant benefits toward more profitable future partnerships with the United States.Elizabeth May is pursuing a Master of Arts in International Affairs through the Elliott School at George Washington University.Load-Date: March 16, 2020End of Document

Apple's unprecedented decision to close all stores outside of China because of coronavirus may be a sign of what's to come (AAPL)Business Insider USMarch 14, 2020 Saturday 05:10 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1059 wordsByline: leadicicco@businessinsider.com,  (Lisa Eadicicco)Highlight: Apple's reliance on China means it already has a plan for how to tackle the coronavirus outbreak in other markets around the world.Body• When it comes to combatting the coronavirus outbreak, Apple has a key advantage that other companies may lack: its close ties to China.• While Apple's reliance on China has made the coronavirus particularly troublesome for the company, it also means it has been keeping a close eye on the situation and has likely been preparing for a worst-case scenario far earlier than many other businesses.• Apple took the latest step in its battle to combat the coronavirus outbreak by closing all stores outside of Greater China until March 27. • Apple's actions could serve as a blueprint for how other retailers can contain the outbreak, says Wedbush securities analyst Dan Ives.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.For much of the world, the severity and ongoing ramifications of COVID-19, the coronavirus disease, have come as a shock. For many, the            pandemic has uprooted business operations and social norms, as companies across the United States are grappling with new remote-work policies and the general public adapts to social distancing - disruptions that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention            warned about several weeks ago.But while the ramifications of the virus will undoubtedly have strong impacts to Apple's business, kneecapping its March quarter, the tech giant also has a key advantage that others may lack in this scenario: its close ties to China.Apple's reliance on China, its third-largest market and home to most of its supply chain, has put the company in a unique position when it comes to handling the coronavirus pandemic. Namely, Apple's closeness to the situation from the beginning has left it preparing for a worst-case scenario far earlier than most other businesses.Its responses throughout the outbreak, like announcing late Friday it would temporarily close all retail stores outside of Greater China, are worth watching as a sign of what may be to come for the rest of the world. Last month, the company made the decision to keep its stores in China closed for longer than it had initially intended to on February 7, just days before the number of new daily COVID-19 cases in China peaked, as shown in the chart below. It gradually re-opened stores with limited hours in the country as the outbreak in China began to slow. On February 24, for example, more than half of Apple's stores in China            had reopened, coming as the number new daily cases had dropped from more than 2,000 on February 17 to 415 on February 24. All stores in China            were opened again by March 12, just after the number of new cases in China had dropped to single digits on March 9. Apple's quick response was not isolated to China. The company restricted employee travel to Italy and Korea on March 3, as Bloomberg first reported, just days before the number of new daily cases began to jump significantly in Europe and the rest of Asia. On March 11, Apple            closed all of its stores in Italy as the country            reported its highest death toll in a single day from the virus. Most recently, Apple announced late Friday that it would close all of its retail stores outside of Greater China until March 27 - a move that comes as countries around the globe besides China are struggling to contain the spread.The company's other actions as well, like moving global employees to remote-work arrangements when possible and previously encouraging social distancing at stores, could serve as a blueprint for how to handle the outbreak in other markets. Apple's decision to close all stores in the United States and Europe, in particular, signal that those regions may be at moments of continued escalation. "They're going to use the same playbook that ultimately helped China navigate this unprecedented outbreak," Daniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, told Business Insider.Apple CEO Tim Cook also acknowledged this in a letter announcing the company's latest efforts."What we've learned together has helped us all develop best practices that are assisting enormously in our global response," he wrote.According to Ives, Apple's store closures will likely service as an example for other retailers to follow in the coming days and weeks."By Apple ripping the Band-Aid off sooner rather than later from a containment perspective," he said, "it's going to open up the floodgates for more to do this."  The coronavirus outbreak started in Wuhan, China, before spreading throughout the country and the rest of the world. It has now killed more than 5,400 people worldwide and sickened more than 145,000. In            the US, the virus has killed 50 people and infected 2,300, with cases being reported in at least 49 states and Washington, D.C. The coronavirus has impacted 115 countries and nearly 1,500 people have died outside of mainland China.  The closures will likely have a tremendous impact on Apple's business in the near-term, according to Ives, although he added that most investors have already written-off the March quarter and are looking ahead to the next six to 18 months. Apple will be in a position to deliver its long-anticipated 5G iPhone by the end of the year if its supply chain can be fully recovered by early May, Ives said. That may indeed be the case as conditions are starting to improve in China. In early March, the Chinese government released figures that indicated the outbreak was coming under control in the country, saying that the number of people who had recovered from the sickness had now outnumbered those who had fallen ill."Right now, in the US there's a panic for toilet paper and soup," Ives said. "In China they're buying iPhones today."NOW WATCH: Jeff Bezos reportedly just spent $165 million on a Beverly Hills estate - here are all the ways the world's richest man makes and spends his moneySee Also:• Apple to temporarily close all retail stores outside of China until March 27 to stem coronavirus spread, CEO Tim Cook announced• San Francisco is in a state of emergency as confirmed coronavirus cases hit 18.

Buy 56 mdd of inputs from ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishApril 10, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 513 wordsBody       The Institute of Health for Welfare (Insabi), with Mediation by the Chancellery, purchased protection supplies for medical personnel in China totalling $56.5 million, Marcelo Ebrard, Secretary of Foreign Affairs, reported yesterday. Among the equipment purchased are 11.5 million N95 respirators, which are the protectors for medical and nursing personnel dealing with Covid-19 patients in the areas of intensive care. According to a table presented by the official, these respirators, whose quality is approved to that of N95 masks produced in the United States, cost a total cost of $18 million,66,500, or $1.6 per piece. "Of course, the equivalence between KN95 and N95 was verified. We in Mexico typically use the production that the company 3M, which is American (...) since February the centers for disease prevention and control in the United States established the equivalence between the same standards, that is, the Chinese standard and the North American standard," he explained. 16 million 174,000 surgical masks were also acquired with a unit price of .5 dollars, representing a total disbursement of $7.6 million. In addition, thousands of latex gloves were purchased for medical examination at eight cents. Ebrard presented this information during president Andrés Manuel López Obrador's morning conference at Palacio Nacional, where he said that purchases could be made with the help of the Chinese government, who channeled them with one of his suppliers, called Meheco. The purchase of the inputs, despite the high demand that exists internationally, highlighted the Chancellor, was achieved expeditiously, because on March 26th the quote was made, on 29 the contract was signed, a day later the payment was made and last Monday the first boarding arrived by air. At the express question, Ebrard clarified that the acquisition of this equipment was not a buyback as some social media users have interpreted, as what Mexican companies exported last February to China were inputs as part of the international production chain in which the country participated. "They are very different products. What we are acquiring today is what we need to strengthen the capacity of the health system," he said.  Indispensable  The Chancellor also reported that 5 thousand 272 fans have managed to complete the acquisition on the international market and will be used in covid-19 patient intensive care units. The teams, he said, will start arriving next week and were acquired in different countries. "We've got fans in Denmark, in various parts of the world," he said. Due to the high demand in the world of these equipment, which are indispensable to meet the serious cases of Covid-19, Ebrard recognized that prices were raised and that on average they have been purchased by a million 200 thousand pesos. "Prices, well, what do I tell you? If you want to go out on the market right now to get a fan, you're going to pay it five times more, six or seven times more than it normally is, and the same goes for the headboards. The equipment is exhausted," he said.       Load-Date: April 11, 2020End of Document

CHINA'S CRUDE OIL IMPORTS SURPASSED 10 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2019States News ServiceMarch 23, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 617 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Energy Information Administration (EIA):Source: China General Administration of Customs, based on Bloomberg, L.P.China's annual crude oil imports in 2019 increased to an average of 10.1 million barrels per day (b/d), an increase of 0.9 million b/d from the 2018 average. China remains the world's top crude oil importer, surpassing the United States in 2017. China's new refinery capacity and strategic inventory stockpiling, combined with flat domestic oil production, were the major factors contributing to the increase in China's crude oil imports in 2019.Source: China General Administration of Customs, based on Bloomberg, L.P.In 2019, 55% of China's crude oil imports came from countries within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the smallest share since at least 2005. China's crude oil imports from Saudi Arabia increased by more than 0.5 million b/d in 2019 to 1.7 million b/d, or 16% of total crude oil imports.From 2017 until earlier this year, OPEC members and other partner countries had been voluntarily reducing crude oil production, which resulted in some non-OPEC producers increasing their shares of China's crude oil imports in recent years. In addition, in 2019, sanctions were placed on Iran and Venezuela that significantly affected their ability to export oil, reducing their shares of imports.Source: China General Administration of Customs, based on Bloomberg, L.P.Note: OPEC is the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.Russia remained the largest non-OPEC source of China's crude oil imports in 2019, averaging 1.6 million b/d, or 15% of total crude oil imports. Brazil overtook Oman as the second-highest non-OPEC source of China's crude oil imports, increasing by less than 0.2 million b/d to average 0.8 million b/d for the year. China's crude oil imports from the United States declined in 2019, primarily as a result of trade negotiations that imposed tariffs on many U.S. goods, including crude oil.Several factors contributed to China's increase in crude oil imports in recent years. Although China's domestic crude oil production increased 0.1 million b/d in 2019averaging 4.9 million b/dit has remained essentially flat since 2012, ranging between 4.8 million b/d and 5.2 million b/d. In contrast, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates China's consumption of petroleum and other liquids grew 0.5 million b/d in 2019 to 14.5 million b/d, and China's net imports for crude oil and other liquids grew 0.4 million b/d to 9.6 million b/d in 2019.China's crude oil imports also grew in 2019 because of strategic stockpiling of crude oil and increases in commercial crude oil inventories following refinery expansions, which require increases in storage as refineries begin operations. Last year, China's refinery capacity increased by 1.0 million b/d, primarily because two new refining and petrochemical complexes came online with capacities of 0.4 million b/d each. As a result, the country's refinery processing also increased to an all-time high in 2019, averaging 13.0 million b/d for the year.EIA estimates China's domestic petroleum and other liquids consumption averaged 13.9 million b/d in the first quarter of 2020, a decline of 0.6 million b/d from the 2019 annual average, primarily as a result of the Chinese government's containment measures related to the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The economic and transportation effects from this outbreak are still developing and will likely affect China's crude oil imports, refinery runs, and domestic consumption through the second quarter of 2020.Principal contributor: Jeff BarronLoad-Date: March 23, 2020End of Document

VIDEO, AUDIO, PHOTOS AND RUSH TRANSCRIPT: AMID ONGOING CORONAVIRUS-19 PANDEMIC, GOV. CUOMO ANNOUNCES 1,000 VENTILATORS DONATED TO NEW YORK STATEUS State NewsApril 3, 2020 Friday 2:24 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2461 wordsBodyALBANY, N.Y., April 3 -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo issued the following press release:Earlier today, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced that 1,000 ventilators have been donated to New York by the Joseph and Clara Tsai Foundation. The Joseph and Clara Tsai Foundation and the Jack Ma Foundation have also donated one million surgical masks, one million KN95 masks and more than 100,000 pairs of goggles to the state. The Chinese government and Ambassador Huang Ping, Chinese Consul General, have facilitated these donations. The ventilators arrived at JFK Airport today.The National Basketball Association is also contributing one million surgical masks for New York's essential workers in collaboration with the New York Knicks, Brooklyn Nets and China's New York Consul General Huang Ping.Additionally, Oregon Governor Kate Brown has offered to provide New York with 140 ventilators from Oregon's stockpile.Governor Cuomo will also issue an Executive Order allowing medical students that are slated to graduate to begin practicing immediately to help with the state's surge health care force. To date, 85,000 health professionals, including 22,000 out-of-state individuals, have signed up to volunteer as part of the state's surge healthcare force during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.VIDEO of the Governor's remarks is available on YouTube here and in TV quality (h.264, mp4) format here, with ASL interpretation available on YouTube here and in TV quality format here.AUDIO of today's remarks is available here.PHOTOS will be available on the Governor's Flickr page.A rush transcript of the Governor's remarks is available below:Let's go through some numbers. The increase continues. We're up to 10,482 cases. 23,000 people were tested yesterday, that's the highest number of testing we've ever done. That's good news. 283,000 total tested. Number of new cases, 10,841. New high. Total hospitalizations, 15,000 people currently hospitalized, 4,000 ICU patients. 10,000 patients discharged, right. That's the good news. Number of deaths, all-time increase up to 3,500, 6,500. Most impacted states, you see New York at the top again. New Jersey has a serious problem in New Jersey and a growing problem. Then Michigan, then California, then Massachusetts. Total number of hospitalized is down a blip, but we believe that's not statistically meaningful. You have the number of ICU cases are up. The number of intubations are up.The number of discharges are also up. And this is interesting, two thirds of the people who have been hospitalized have been discharged. Okay? Two thirds of the people who have been hospitalized have been discharged. That's what we've been saying all along. Most people won't be hospitalized. People who are hospitalized will come in, be treated, and leave. That's two thirds. One third of that number has a serious condition which will require continued hospitalization. We're tracking the growth of the number of infections by hospital, and we can see just where the numbers are increasing.We've been talking about hitting the apex. The apex is the point where the number of infections on a daily basis is at the high point, and that is the ultimate challenge for the healthcare system. Can we handle that number of cases at the high point of the curve? I call it the battle of the mountaintop because that's what it's going to be. That's going to be the number one point of engagement of the enemy. By the numbers we're not at the apex. We're getting closer, depending on whose model you'll look at. They'll say four, five, six, seven days. Some people go out 14 days. But our reading of the projections is we're somewhere in the seven-day range, four, five, six seven, eight day range. Nobody can give you a specific number, which makes it very frustrating to plan when they can't give you a specific number or a specific date, but we're in that range. So we're not yet at the apex. Part of me would like to be at the apex and just let's do it, but there's part of me says it's good that we're not at the apex, because we're not yet ready for the apex, either. We're not yet ready for the high point. We're still working on the capacity of the system. The more time we have to improve the capacity of the system is better, and the capacity of the health care system, beds, staff, equipment. We'll be doing a conference call with all the hospitals today to coordinate deployment of the equipment.Watching the spread of the rate of infections is interesting. This chart is what we've been talking about, but you can see it here. The upstate number is the top bar. The rest of New York has been fairly constant, 4%, 5%, 4%, 5%, Westchester, Rockland 8%, 6%, 6%, 7%, 7, 7. Long Island is the area that is growing. You see Long Island goes from 16% to 17% to 18%, to 19 to 20 to 22%. New York City is actually dropping as the number of cases in Long Island increases, as a percentage of cases within the state. For us, this is about tracking the virus, tracking the spread of the virus, and then deploying as the numbers suggest.In terms of beds, the 2,500-ed facility at Javits is going to make a major difference. That has to work. The White House agreed to make that a COVID-positive facility. Remember, originally the Javits Center, which is a state convention center, we worked with the federal government, they constructed a 2500-bed facility, it was supposed to be non-COVID. I spoke to the president, transferred that with his intervention to a COVID facility. The federal government will staff that and the federal government with equip that. That is a big deal because that 2,500-bed facility will relieve a lot of pressure on the downstate system as a significant number of beds and that facility has to make that transition quickly and that's what we're focused on. It's going to be very staff intensive, very equipment intensive but the theory there is the best we can to relieve the entire hospital system downstate by bringing those COVID patients to Javits and from the intake to the treatment and it's going to be very difficult to run that large a facility. But if that works and that works well that changes the numbers dramatically so that's a top focus for us. I spoke to the White House today on planning the logistical operation to get that up and get that running asap, and that's the top operational priority.In terms of staffing, we have 85,000 volunteers, 22,000 out-of-state volunteers. How amazing is that? 85,000 volunteers. I'm also signing an executive order to allow medical students who are slated to graduate to begin practicing. We need doctors, we need nurses, so we're going to expedite that.On ventilators, remember, we ordered 17,000 ventilators. To give you an idea of how many 17,000 is, the federal stockpile was about 10,000 ventilators for the nation. We ordered 17,000 just for the state of New York. When we ordered the ventilators we were paying for the ventilators. So, trust me, you know the financial situation of the state. We were not looking to spend a penny that we didn't have to spend. We placed that order for the ventilators and we were paying for that order. That order never came through. This goes back to the China situation. We had signed documents, we placed the order,Governor Baker talks about this in Massachusetts. But then you get a call that says we can't fill that order because you had all that demand going in. So, what do we do? We find what equipment we have, we use it the best we can. If you ask hospitals today what ventilators do you have that are unused and available that they don't need in the short term and take 20% of that number of available ventilators, that's 500 ventilators. 500 ventilators is a significant number now. China is remarkably the repository for all of these orders. Ventilators, PPE, it all goes back to China. Long term, we have to figure out why we wound up in this situation where we don't have the manufacturing capacity in this country. I understand supply chain issues, I understand the cost of manufacturing, but there's a public health reason, as we've all learned the hard way, why we need the capacity in this country to do this.Anyway, it all comes back to China. New York has been shopping in China. We're not really China experts, here. International relations is not what we do on a daily basis. I've been to China before when I was HUD secretary, I did a trade mission with China. So, I have a basic understanding, but we went to the Asia Society to help us navigate China. I asked the White House to help us navigate China. I spoke to the ambassador and we got really good news today. That the Chinese government is going to facilitate a donation of 1,000 ventilators that will come in to JFK today. I want to thank Joe Tsai and Clara Tsai and Jack Ma from Alibaba, and the Nets, but I'm not stating a preference, for their donation. That's going to be very helpful and I want to thank Ambassador Huang very much for his help in making all of this happen because this is a big deal. It's going to make a significant difference for us.Also, the state of Oregon contacted us and is going to send 140 ventilators, which is, I tell you, just astonishing and unexpected. I want to thank Governor Brown, I want to thank all of the people in the state of Oregon for their thoughtfulness. Again, this was unsolicited. But the 140 ventilators will make a difference. I was thinking about it, on behalf of New York and what it means for our - first it was a kind gesture. I know Governor Brown and she is a kind person, but it's also smart from the point of view of Oregon. Why? Because we're all in the same battle and the battle is stopping the spread of the virus, right? Look at what they did in China. It was in the Wuhan province. First order of business was contain the virus in Wuhan. Why? Because you want to contain the enemy. That's always the first step. Oregon, we're dealing with it now, we don't stop the spread in New York, it continues. And if you look at the projections, Oregon could have a significant problem towards May. Our problem is now. So it's also smart from Oregon's self-interest. They see the fire spreading. Stop the fire where it is before it gets to my home. That was the Wuhan province.Somebody sent me a great quote from FDR, who had such a beautiful way of taking complicated issues and communicating it in common-sense language. FDR was dealing with trying to get the lend-lease program approved and accepted by the public. Why would this country help another country fight its war? That was the lend-lease program. His point was it's a common enemy. We want to contain the enemy. That other country's fight is actually our fight. If we don't stop the spread then it's going to burn down our own country. But this is how he does it, right? The concept is right, but how does he explain that? Suppose my neighbor's home catches fired and I have a length of fire hose 400, 500 feet away. If he can take my garden hose and connect it with his hydrant, I may help him put out his fire. Now what do I do? I don't say before that operation, neighbor, my garden hose cost me $15, you have to pay me $15 for it. What is the transaction that goes on? I don't want the $15. I want my garden hose back after the fire is over. All right, if it goes through the fire all right, intact without any damage to it, he gives it back to me, and thanks me very much for the use of it. But suppose it gets smashed up? Holes in it during the fire. We don't have to do too much formality about it. But I say to him, I was glad to lend you that hose. I see I can't use it anymore. It's all smashed up. He says how many feet of it were there? I tell him 150 feet of it. He says, alright, I will replace. Now, if I get a nice garden hose back I am in pretty good shape.The State of Oregon has lent us 140 ventilators. It was kind, it was smart, stop the virus here. It's better for the state of Oregon, it's better for the nation. Their curve comes after ours. We'll return their 140 ventilators, and there's never been a discussion, but frankly I know New Yorkers and I know New Yorkers' generosity. We will turn it double fold, because that's who we are and that's what we believe. So, stop the fire in New York, kind, generous, also smart.Personal opinion, look I want this to be all over. It's only gone on for 30 days since our first case. It feels like an entire lifetime. I think we all feel the same. This stresses this country, this state, in a way that nothing else has frankly, in my lifetime. It stresses us on every level. The economy is stressed, the social fabric is stressed, the social systems are stressed, transportation is stressed. It's right across the board, but the most difficult level is the human level. It is for me, anyway. It's every day, and it's everywhere. My brother catches the virus. That's stressful. My mother is worried about my brother, and she's concerned. We have a birthday party yesterday for Stephanie, was standing around a cake. Everybody's six feet from each other in this bizarre supposed to be just a fun usual celebration of a birthday. My daughter's cousin has a tragedy and that's just emotionally very painful. They can't hug each other and hold each other. They can't even grieve together. The cyberchats, I mean, this is so emotionally taxing that you can't even begin to -- you can't quantify the effect on society and the effect on individuals. And the burden that we're dealing with.So, yes, I want it over. If there was anything I could do to accelerate getting it over, I would. In some ways I want to get to that apex, I want to get on the other side of the apex and let's just slide down that mountain. On the other hand, we have to be ready for the fight and we have to handle that fight. That's where we are. So, what do we do? You have to get through it. You have to get through it. There is no simple answer here. You're not going to wish this away. You have to get through it. You have to get through it intelligently, saving as many lives as you can. That's hard work, and that's perseverance, and that's mutuality and that's community, and that's finding your better self, and that's finding inner strength and dealing with a situation that is almost unmanageable on every level. Because you are out of control. This is a painful, disorienting experience, but we find our best self, our strongest self. This day will end and we will get through it and we will get to the other side of the mountain. And we will be the better for it. But we have to do what we have to do between now and then. That's just what we're doing here.

Back at Harvard Seeking Truth and Justice for My BrotherThe Harvard Crimson: Harvard UniversityMay 31, 2020 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OP EDS; Pg. 1Length: 945 wordsBodyI was shaking at my core to return to Harvard this time. Since graduating from Harvard Law School in 2016, I have returned several times to speak to students about my practice as an anti-corruption lawyer. But on March 9, I returned to share a deeply personal story about my brother Ekpar Asat, a prominent Uighur tech entrepreneur who has been arbitrarily detained since returning to China from the United States in spring 2016.Making myself vulnerable at a time when academic freedom is under constant attack concerned me. But I couldn't think of a better venue to share my brother's story by the side of my mentor, Law School Professor William P. Alford, who is well known for his genuine care for students and colleagues. In some ways, it was therapeutic as the faculty and students were rooting for me. It felt like my homecoming.Harvard's motto, Veritas, means truth. I returned to my alma mater to speak the truth, even if my voice shook.The hero of this story is my brother, Ekpar Asat. My anchor, my mentor, the greatest man that I have ever known. It all began almost four years ago when I was a student at the Law School. Around late January 2016, my brother told me that he would be coming to the U.S. He had been accepted to the State Department's International Visitor Leadership Program - whose alumni include New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and the United Nations Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, among other world leaders. Many Han Chinese have also benefited from similar State Department programs, including Xie Feng, the Foreign Ministry's commissioner in Hong Kong.My brother is a tech entrepreneur and philanthropist. While in college, he founded a large social media platform for Uighurs. He was aware of the risks of doing media business in China, and he has been very cautious with the content published and strictly complied with the government's censorship policies. Chinese state media praised him as a positive force, bright star, and bridge-builder between different cultures.I was beyond excited for him that he got into such a prestigious program. Never would I have thought this nomination would not be a blessing but a curse! Within weeks after returning from this trip, my brother was detained, and his whereabouts remain unknown. One thing became clear to me after my brother disappeared - as long as you are Uighur, none of your contributions matter. The Chinese government can make you vanish as if you are nobody and no one can seek ownership of you. It pains me that I cannot even ask my family if my brother is alive!Many of you know Professor Michael J. Sandel's famous course "Justice," in which he analyzes questions of morality, such as whether sacrificing one life in order to save another five is right. I have thought about this question when, over the past few years, I chose not to speak out, fearing retribution against my other family members. Obviously, there is a difference in my case, as it was the state that unjustly took my brother away. Nevertheless, despite my Harvard Law background and my experience as an attorney, I chose them over my brother and left him hopeless.Yet just like my brother, I have been committed to the betterment of the world. In particular, I hoped to promote the relationships between China and Turkey. In 2012, I co-organized a landmark conference that brought Chinese lawyers and academics to Istanbul to engage with my Turkish colleagues. Featured speakers included the Chinese General Consul in Istanbul and the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey. While I worked as an attorney in Istanbul, I was also committed to my own pro-bono work and desired to improve the lives of Syrian refugees. That is the beauty of being an attorney - you can change lives. However, when it came to my own brother, I felt so powerless. As an attorney who lives and breathes to find a solution, I feel so helpless in the face of injustice committed by such a powerful and authoritarian country against my own brother.Furthermore, over the past few years, I have used other forms of advocacy, such as meeting with officials from the State Department, to fight for him. None of these efforts have yielded a positive result. I realized that speaking out is the only powerful form to raise awareness and bring change. My brother will continue and has already become one of the human faces of the Chinese government's ongoing atrocities in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region.I am sharing my brother's story, a story of courage, to send a message to my Harvard and fellow Harvardians. Many of you will be shapers and movers of our society. Your words carry weight. Therefore, I ask you: Join the fight, be the light, be the integrity, be the voice for my brother, and my people. Because you are my people too. .css-12m1k7q{display:block;margin:0px auto;width:100%;max-width:100%;background:transparent;padding:10px 0px;}.css-12m1k7q .ad-tag{font-family:'Colaborate Light','Lucida Sans Unicode',sans-serif;color:#333333;text-align:center;font-size:0.7em;text-transform:uppercase;display:block;}.css-12m1k7q .ad-body{width:-webkit-fit-content;width:-moz-fit-content;width:fit-content;margin:0px auto;text-align:center;}AdvertisementRayhan Asat is a graduate of Harvard Law School. .css-nuva7n-Is{font-size:16.5px;line-height:26px;box-sizing:content-box;max-width:600px;padding:0px 20px;margin:0px auto;margin:1em auto;}.css-nuva7n-Is a{color:#ba0600;}Want to keep up with breaking news?

Center for Strategic & International Studies: An Open Alliance for Digital TradeTargeted News ServiceMay 28, 2020 Thursday 9:51 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1257 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Center for Strategic and International Studies issued the following commentary by Sam duPont, deputy director of the GMF Digital at the German Marshall Fund of the U.S., as a part of the Strategic Trade series supported by the Atlas Network:Like the last great power rivalry, the emergent competition between the United States and China is a competition between two different economic systems, and two very different political ideologies. This time, much of the competition will play out in digital space and over rules to govern our digital world. Just as the allies gathered at Bretton Woods in 1944 to chart a path for the post-war global economy, governments are now negotiating at the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and other forums on policies, standards, and guidelines for the digital economy and digital trade. Who writes these rules--and whether they favor an open, liberal digital economy or one that is top-down, closed, and government-controlled--will have an outsized impact on power and governance in the twenty-first century.Digital trade is, first and foremost, about the movement of data across borders. It's a cloud computing company storing and processing data for a foreign client; it's a farmer getting insight into environmental conditions and agricultural markets through artificial-intelligence-driven data analytics services; it's an aircraft engine producing data streams that are shot around the world and back again to identify necessary maintenance before anything breaks down. The economic value of these data flows is immense. In 2016, the consulting firm McKinsey found that cross-border data flows already generated more value for the global economy than trade in goods. That value continues to grow, and the importance of international rules to govern that trade has grown commensurately.The United States has used its recent trade negotiations to promote an open global digital economy in which data can flow freely. The United States participated in the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations that broke new ground on digital trade, and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement include rules guaranteeing that firms can move data freely across borders and prohibiting mandates to store or process data on local servers. In contrast with the Trump administration's broader trade policy, which has rejected multilateralism and pumped the brakes on seven decades of liberalization, the United States continues to prioritize rules promoting the free flow of data in digital trade negotiations at the WTO and elsewhere.China's approach to digital trade reflects its own vision for the global digital economy, emphasizing its "cyber sovereignty." In WTO digital trade negotiations, China promotes a regime that empowers governments to restrict data flows, filter the internet, and block foreign digital services. This approach protects its domestic system: China's Great Firewall prohibits many foreign firms from reaching Chinese customers, and its cybersecurity law restricts the outbound transfer of wide range of data and requires the local storage of all "important" information. Such measures would violate U.S.-style rules on digital trade, so China advocates for weaker alternatives--or none at all.China's advocacy for a closed approach to digital trade is also part of a strategic effort to build a coalition of countries with separate, sovereign internets characterized by greater government control over information and data. The growth of this bloc validates China's domestic approach and enhances its global influence. What is more, where this strategy succeeds, Chinese firms are well-positioned to compete. One of the competitive advantages of Chinese internet companies is that they have grown up in a restrictive, state-centric economy. Censorship and control are the default settings for these firms, and they are primed to succeed under similarly restrictive systems. Where its firms flourish, the Chinese government can leverage its control over domestic companies to facilitate surveillance, propaganda, and disinformation campaigns that boost its strategic interests.The alternative is a digital environment that defaults toward free commerce, the free exchange of ideas, and the free flow of data. Openness, of course, comes with its own challenges. An unconstrained information environment can be fertile ground for disinformation, and unconditional data flows can put privacy at risk. To address such challenges, the United States should regulate its domestic digital economy more assertively in the coming years. Following its allies abroad and domestic public opinion, the U.S. Congress is inching toward national privacy legislation; a new law should constrain the transfer of sensitive personal data to jurisdictions that lack the transparency, accountability, and due process necessary to guarantee privacy. Similarly, the United States has, in narrow cases, limited the free flow of data for national security reasons.But such constraints should remain narrow and exceptional, and the United States should address these challenges without adopting authoritarian methods of censorship, control, and discrimination. Even with discrete conditions for the free flow of data, the overwhelming interest of the United States will continue to lie in advancing digital trade rules that reject China's top-down vision for the internet. An authoritarian approach that controls speech and limits political activity isn't just bad for U.S. exports and anathema to democratic values, it also creates very real barriers to coordinating internationally and responding to the global threats that face the world today--such as a global pandemic. An open information ecosystem, on the other hand, does not just benefit U.S. exporters and consumers: it is essential to democratic institutions and the success of democratic governments in competition with China.Trade is just one area in which this competition will play out, but it is an important one. Having concluded high-standard digital trade rules with Canada, Mexico, and Japan, the United States should focus on working with its largest trading partner: the European Union. Digital trade has been a stumbling block in transatlantic negotiations, and the European Union's recent emphasis on bolstering its own "technological sovereignty" has lent unhelpful rhetorical support for Beijing's far more restrictive model of data governance. For its part, the United States' continued failure to enact a federal privacy law is an obstacle to bridging the substantive divide.But with shared democratic values and a commitment to market-based economics, the United States and Europe each have much to gain from finding consensus on rules that promote an open global digital economy. A shared approach would present a democratic alternative to China's approach and a clear model for the many other governments that are weighing their options. Given the centrality of the digital economy to politics, power, and life, building this coalition of support for free digital trade will be central to building a democratic bloc that can compete effectively in the twenty-first century. The alternative--continued transatlantic divergence on digital trade--only opens the door wider for authoritarian approaches to prevail, and for China's relative strength to grow.[Category: Political]Copyright Targeted News ServicesT40-MgEditor-7124730 T40-MgEditorLoad-Date: May 28, 2020End of Document

EMRATI PRINCESS HEND FAISAL AL QASSIMI VOICES RARE MUSLIM SUPPORT FOR PERSECUTED UYGHURSStates News ServiceApril 27, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 915 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Princess Hend Faisal Al Qassimi, a member of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) royal family, took to Twitter on Sunday to issue a rare voice of support from the Muslim world for ethnic Uyghurs enduring persecution in northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR). The author and fashion editor who has spoken out against Islamophobia, including by recently shaming Indian nationals living in Dubai who had posted anti-Muslim tweets, was responding to a call by Uyghur activist Arslan Hidayat on social media for Muslims to post images of themselves marking Ramadan to show solidarity with Uyghurs, who are largely prevented from participating in the religious activities of the holy month by Chinese authorities.In her video, Al Qassimi greets her fellow Muslims observing Ramadan and expresses her hope that authorities will release the up to 1.8 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities accused of harboring 'strong religious views' and 'politically incorrect' ideas who are believed to have been detained in a vast network of internment camps in the XUAR since April 2017. She also calls on adherents of Islam to 'stand together against this Muslim Holocaust that's happening in China.' Al Qassimi's response prompted Hidayat to post a tweet calling on 'royalty in the Arabian gulf and #Muslim influencers around the world' to follow her lead and 'publicly voice their solidarity with the #Uyghur Muslims who are suffering in #China's #ConcentrationCamps.'Al Qassimi's video came days after the Munich-based World Uyghur Congress exile group issued a statement for Ramadan noting that the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the leaders of Muslim-majority nations in the Middle East have been 'shamefully silent' on the persecution of Uyghurs in the XUAR, and calling for pressure on China to 'stop its crimes against humanity' in the region. It also follows a July 2019 meeting in Beijing between Chinese President Xi Jinping and UAE Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, during which the Emrati royal backed Beijing's crackdown on the Uyghurs, citing security concerns.Speaking to RFA's Uyghur Service, Al Qassimi acknowledged that the Muslim and Arab world has been largely unaware of the situation in the XUAR citing language barriers and ongoing wars in many Muslim-majority nations, but said she hopes to help highlight the plight of the Uyghurs.I stumbled upon [the campaign] on Twitter, and I had no idea that this was happening. I visited China and I liked it very much. I love the culture, I like the food, I love the fashion. I like how a country that was a farming nation became a superpower. I was very happy for them. But later on, when I saw what they were doing to the Uyghurs, I didn't like it and I hope that we can do something to stop it. Maybe we can speak to the Chinese government and tell them to stop.I posted a video today and, in that video, they show that China did this against the Uyghurs [in part] because there were 33 killings [during an incident of Uyghur unrest] in a train station, but one person doesn't represent 11 million [Uyghur] people. And I know they were concerned because they didn't want to become another spot for terrorism. But even us Muslim countries, sometimes suffer from these extremists. And extremists can come from any religion or even a political side. It doesn't have to be a Muslimit can be an extremist Christian or an extremist Hindu, like we see today in India.What I don't understand is how can [Beijing] allow this to continue? How can they afford to put people into camps? This is not good for business for China. I think they should simply spread the message of peace between the people that they're scared of, but this is not a solution. Killing people or putting them inside these camps is not a solution.'You'd be fighting for your life'You don't know this about the Arab world. They're going through a crisis themselves. We just finished a war, so when people are fighting for their lives here, they can only take care of so many things. If you are living in Turkey and you have a war with Russia and somebody comes and tells you, "We have a war in Africa, come help us, we're Muslims," would you turn around? You'd be fighting for your life.There's war in Libya, there's war in Yemen, there's war in Syria. People are dying by the hundreds of thousands. In Lebanon, in Palestine, in Iraqthey have ISIS, they have Al Qaeda. It's horrible, it's a nightmare. I know a family that was richthey don't have food to eat. They're being starved to death ... So, do you think people like this have time to go on the internet and check out what's happening in Uyghur country? No. They're not bad, but they're also suffering. The whole world is suffering. Everyone is carrying a burden, but the Arab world especially is famous for [this] ... These countries are going through a war. They don't have time to go learn about the Chinese. They don't speak their language and they don't know about them.This is a responsible thing we should do. I'm hoping that by simply speaking about what China is doing in a polite way, maybe they will turn. I'm not doing it in an aggressive way because if you do it in an aggressive way, they will attack, and they will not listen ... We should stand together and approach the Chinese government about ending the camps.Reported by Nuriman Abdurashid for RFA's Uyghur Service.

House Passes Rep. Spanberger's Legislation to Ban TikTok on TSA Phones, Protect Airport Security PersonnelTargeted News ServiceMarch 6, 2020 Friday 6:56 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 799 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Virginia, issued the following news release on March 5:A bipartisan majority of the U.S. House of Representatives voted to pass U.S. Representative Abigail's Spanberger's legislation to ban the Chinese video app "TikTok" on Transportation Security Administration (TSA) phones.Last month, the TSA announced that it would prohibit its employees from using the TikTok app on federally issued devices following concerns from the U.S. intelligence community regarding the app's lack of transparency about potential security vulnerabilities. As a Chinese-owned company, TikTok is required by law in China to comply with information and data requests from the Chinese government.Spanberger's amendment would codify TSA's policy to prohibit employees from downloading or using TikTok on government-issued devices. The amendment was included as part of the bipartisan Rights for Transportation Security Officers Act, which Spanberger cosponsored.On the floor of the U.S. House today, Spanberger spoke in support of her legislation, and she highlighted the significant security risks TikTok poses to U.S. security systems, TSA personnel, and American travelers. Click here to watch and download her remarks. A full transcript of her remarks is below:I'd like to begin by thanking Chairman Thompson for his leadership on this important legislation and for his commitment to the men and women who keep our airports and travelers safe.I am proud to cosponsor this bipartisan bill, because I share the Chairman's commitment to ensuring that the TSA workforce receives the rights that they've earned.I am also proud to lead this amendment, which would codify the administration's ban on TSA employees using or installing the app "TikTok" on their government-issued phones.While to some TikTok may seem like a harmless app, TikTok presents a significant counter-intelligence threat.Our intelligence experts are rightly concerned about the use of the TikTok app, especially on U.S. government-issued devices.As many of my colleagues know, TikTok, like other Chinese companies is required under Chinese law to share information with the government and its institutions.There are real concerns that this app could also collect information on users in the United States to advance Chinese counter-intelligence efforts. And because it could become a tool for surveilling U.S. citizens or federal personnel, TikTok has no business being on U.S. government-issued devices.While entrusted with keeping Americans safe, our security personnel should not use apps that could compromise federal government data.There is always the threat that TikTok could be used to compromise government devices, including those used in our airports and among our airport personnel. That is why this amendment is so important, and why we should pass it without delay.Recently, the TSA announced a prohibition on employees using or downloading TikTok on their government-issued work phones--and my amendment would make this ban law.Other government agencies and departments have instituted a prohibition on the use of TikTok on government-issued phones--including the U.S. Army, the State Department, and the Department of Homeland Security.TSA is right to institute this policy, especially as TikTok refuses to provide more transparency into some of its more controversial practices and use.I urge my colleagues to vote yes on my amendment and to keep our government devices and our airports safe from potential foreign surveillance.The prohibition on TikTok would not apply to the personal phones of TSA personnel.The passage of Spanberger's legislation builds on her work to identify and combat threats posed by Chinese technologies to U.S. consumers and businesses. Yesterday, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed Spanberger's bipartisan legislation to build a national strategy to protect 5G telecommunications systems in the United States and among U.S. allies.The Spanberger-led Secure 5G and Beyond Act would require the administration to develop an unclassified, national strategy to protect U.S. consumers and assist allies in maximizing the security of their 5G telecommunications systems. This strategy would also identify additional ways to spur research and development by U.S. companies in a way that maintains reliable internet access. In January 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 413 to 3 to pass the House version of Spanberger's Secure 5G and Beyond Act.Video (https://spanberger.house.gov/UploadedFiles/CSPAN_03-05-2020_09.49.21.mp4): On Floor of the U.S. House, Spanberger Highlights National Security Threat Posed by TikTok, Urges Her Colleagues to Protect Airport Personnel from Foreign-Based Counterintelligence Activities.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7044192 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 6, 2020End of Document

Chung: Utah Needs to Create a Task Force to Ensure Minorities' SafetyThe Daily Utah Chronicle: University of UtahMay 25, 2020 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1014 wordsByline: Stacy ChungBodyMay is Asian Pacific American Heritage month - a month of festive moods and vibrant gatherings to celebrate this community. But ever since the outbreak of COVID-19, anxiety and prohibitions on community gatherings have been at the front of everyone's minds. The impact of the pandemic has been devastating to all - people have lost their jobs, their loved ones and their lifestyles. We are all suffering together, but this pandemic has lead to additional threats for Asian American communities in particular and Utah has a responsibility to prevent such violence.COVID-19 Related Racism is on the RiseSince the news broke months ago that the novel coronavirus was first detected in China, Asian American communities almost immediately began experiencing racial slurs, shunning on public transit and both online and offline harassments associated with the outbreak of COVID-19. In six weeks alone, over 1,700 reports of anti-Asian racist incidents were submitted to the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council. The FBI anticipated this back in March: "hate crime incidents against Asian Americans likely will surge across the United States, due to the coronavirus disease ... endangering Asian American communities."Almost two months have passed since the FBI's assessment, yet little had been done by the federal government to ensure the safety of the Asian American communities. Rather, White House officials continue to use inflammatory racist language by referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" and suggesting that the Chinese government sent travelers to the United States to spread the virus. In March, an assailant reportedly tried to kill an Asian family at a Texas Sam's Club because "he thought the family was Chinese and infecting people with the coronavirus."Such rampant ignorance and repeated use of harmful rhetoric about COVID-19 from public officials contributes to the spread of misinformation, xenophobia and anti-Asian hate crimes. American citizens should be protected from such violence. We need to take action to ensure safety in our communities.Utah is No ExceptionSome might think that Utahns will be exempt from this trend but in reality, Utah is no exception to racist threats and discrimination. In March, our own Utah legislator and Congressional candidate Rep. Kim Coleman was accused of racism for blaming COVID-19 on "Chinese communists." Her blog post clearly reflects Trump's "Chinese virus" rhetoric, "Let's be clear: the coronavirus plague facing us comes exclusively as a courtesy of the Chinese Communist Party . No Communist China, no crisis." Coleman's post is exacerbating erroneous perceptions about China and implicitly contributing to anti-Asian sentiment. This issue is bigger than partisan politics. The use of such aggressive rhetoric by President Trump and Rep. Coleman poses a danger to the safety of the Asian American community.Besides the racist commentary of government officials, do not forget that Utah experienced a horrific, racially-motivated hate crime just over a year ago, when Jose and Luis Lopez's were reportedly attacked by a man outside a tire shop yelling, "I hate Mexicans." The father and the son were beaten with a pole to the point where Luis' cheekbone and eye socket were shattered and a his sinus collapsed. The Lopez family attributed some of the motive behind the attack to Trump's use of racial generalizations and slurs about immigrants coming from Mexico.These incidents in Texas and Utah bear striking resemblances. The assailants' use of slurs reflect government officials' labeling of specific ethnic groups and the physical attacks were fueled by racist and misinformed views of these communities.In 2017, a Utah man was indicted for shouting racial slurs at his African American neighbor and then striking him with a "stun cane." After the man was found guilty of a federal hate crime, U.S. Attorney John W. Huber said, "There is no place in Utah for race-motivated hatred and violence." His message remains true today.Utah Can and Should Do Its PartDespite living in one of the safest states in the country, there is no guarantee that minorities will be safe in Utah. The division of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion at the University of Utah made an announcement entitled "No Time for Hate: COVID-19" to address "concerns of discrimination and bias related to the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19." Even college students are playing a part in the fight against COVID-19 fueled verbal, written and physical violence.We need government intervention and proactive enforcement to secure the safety of Asian American communities. The Utah State Legislature did an excellent job in 2019 when they passed a law to increase criminal penalties for hate crimes. Now is the time to continue this work.Utah must step up to the plate and do its part to prevent an increase in violence against minority populations. The legislature should establish a task force to study how Utah can combat racial bias fueled by the pandemic. The task force should be designed to offer guidelines for addressing racial profiling, preventing discrimination and dispelling racial stigma. Utah needs state leaders to provide the protection and guidance that the federal government has failed to supply.[email protected]@StacyChung_Editor's note: Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, tiredness and shortness of breath.

US adds new sanction on Chinese tech giant HuaweiAssociated Press InternationalMay 16, 2020 Saturday 00:18 GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 599 wordsByline: By FRANK BAJAK, Associated PressDateline: BOSTON BodyBOSTON (AP) - The U.S. government imposed new restrictions on Chinese tech giant Huawei on Friday, severely limiting its ability to use American technology to design and manufacture semiconductors produced for it abroad.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Friday that the move aims to prevent Huawei from making a run around existing U.S. sanctions."There has been a very highly technical loophole through which Huawei has been able to in effect use U.S. technology," Ross told Fox Business. "We never intended that loophole to be there."Adam Segal, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the move "looks like a victory for the people who really want to drive the nail, or what they think will be the nail, in Huawei's coffin," saidThe new restrictions elicited an angry response from China, which threatened retaliation against U.S. companies.Chip design and manufacturing equipment used in the world's semiconductor plants is mostly U.S. made, so the new rule aims to impact multiple foreign producers that sell to Huawei and affiliates including HiSilicon, which makes chips used in supercomputers with scientific and military uses. The Commerce Department said foreign foundries would be granted a 120-day grace period for chips already in production.Under the new rules, foreign semiconductor makers must obtain a license from U.S. officials in order to ship Huawei-designed semiconductors to the Chinese company that were produced using U.S. technology.Last year, the Trump administration barred U.S. firms from using Huawei technology or providing technology to the Chinese firm without government approval, deeming it a national security risk. The Commerce Department exempted a narrow list of products and services and has continuously extended that limited waiver, largely to lessen the impact on U.S. wireless carriers that use Huawei technology in their networks. This week, it added another 90 days.The new restrictions are separate from those exemptions, but loopholes have allowed U.S. companies to continue to supply Huawei with chips made outside the U.S.The Commerce Department said in a statement Friday that the new restrictions would "narrowly and strategically" target Huawei's acquisition of semiconductors that it designs built in overseas foundries that use U.S. software and technology. Kevin Wolf, an attorney at Akin Gump who oversaw export administration at the Commerce Department during the Obama administration, noted the narrow scope of the rules."If a foreign foundry makes a chip based on a Huawei design and U.S. equipment is used to make a chip then it's controlled, but if a chip is not made from a Huawei design then it is not controlled," he said.Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But China's official Global Times newspaper threatened countermeasures on Friday. It said Beijing that could include restrictions on U.S. companies including Qualcomm, Cisco and Apple. It also threatened to suspend purchases of Boeing aircraft.Global Times noted that the new Commerce rules would block companies such as TSMC, a Taiwainese chip maker, from providing semiconductors to Huawei. TSMC announced plans this week to build a chip plant in Arizona. It did not immediately respond to an Associated Press query on whether the new rules might alter those plans."It seems the U.S. is ratcheting up efforts to pinch China's high-tech companies," the editorial read, calling it more than just an element of President Donald Trump's re-election strategy. "U.S. suppression has become the No. 1 challenge to China's development."Load-Date: May 16, 2020End of Document

The coronavirus is hidden in broad daylight: the importance of increasing the number of scansCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 17, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 578 wordsBodyScientists tracking the spread of coronavirus reported on Monday that, for each confirmed case, there are most likely five or ten people in the community with undetected infections. These often milder cases are on average 50% less contagious than confirmed cases, but are responsible for nearly 80% of new cases, according to the report, which was based on data from China.Researchers created a model of the natural spread of the virus in China before the government imposed a travel ban and an aggressive policy of analysis. During that period, from December last year to the end of January, about 6 out of 7 cases were not detected. The situation is analogous to the current state of affairs in the United States and other Western countries, where analyses are not readily available,the researchers said."If we have 3,500 confirmed cases in the U.S., we could actually be in front of 35,000," said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University and lead author of the new report, which was published online by the journal Science."If we have 3,500 confirmed cases in the U.S., we could actually be facing 35,000""Jeffrey ShamanEpidemiologistThe report is one of the first to address two of the most pressing questions about the pandemic: How many people walk around the city with unrecognized infections and how contagious they are? While U.S. officials have begun to take more aggressive steps to curb transmission, such as cancelling events and closing restaurants, access to virus testing has been difficult or non-existent in much of the country.On Monday, in a conference call with journalists, scientists representing more than a dozen institutions that track the disease highlighted the importance of increasing the number of analyses."It's crucial to implement large-scale analytics," said Dr. Elizabeth Halloran, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Washington and a senior researcher at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. "And it's important to develop inexpensive tests so that people can be subjected to them when they need them."How many people walk around the city with unrecognized infections and how contagious they are?The new analysis was based on documented contagions in China and mobility data, as well as a population-wide model of social interaction, to calculate the number of undocumented cases, as well as the rate of contagion. He concluded that, after the Chinese government closed the epicenter of the outbreak on 23 January and began widespread analysis, the picture changed dramatically. Over time, analyses identified approximately 60% of positive cases, exceeding the previous 14%.The work was attended by authors from five institutions, including Imperial College London, Tsinghua University in Beijing and the University of Hong Kong."Just because we get the disease from someone with mild symptoms doesn't mean ours is going to be mild"Jeffrey ShamanEpidemiologistScientists said the number of undetected cases per confirmed could have a two-fold variation from country to country. In China, unidentified cases that proliferated before the blockade, although on average were less contagious than those confirmed, do not necessarily cause milder cases in newly infected, the researchers said."Just because we get the disease of someone with mild symptoms doesn't mean ours is going to bemild, " said Shaman.

CORONAVIRUS: RUMOR CONTROLStates News ServiceMarch 27, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1575 wordsByline: States News ServiceBodyThe following information was released by the Joint Chiefs of Staff:As the Defense Department assists in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it's also important to help distinguish between rumors and facts.Rumors can easily circulate within communities during a crisis, and we can stop the spread of disinformation by always choosing trusted sources of information such as:www.coronavirus.govwww.cdc.gov/coronaviruswww.usa.gov/coronaviruswww.defense.gov/coronavirusState and local government official websites or social media accounts are also good sources for instruction and information specific to your community. Check out the myth-busting section below to separate fact from fiction.Myth: The U.S. military has been slow to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak.Fact: In mid-January U.S. military bases in the Indo-Pacific region began coordinating with local authorities as the outbreak unfolded. DOD issued Force Protection Guidance for the Novel Coronavirus Outbreak on January 30 and in late January began assisting when the Department of Health and Human Services requested military facilities to help house the first groups of civilians evacuated from overseas. (See January 30 news conference).Myth: U.S. service members visiting China were the source of the coronavirus outbreak.Fact: Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper, along with senior U.S. Administration officials, have repeatedly denounced the Chinese government's efforts to deflect responsibility for downplaying the threat early on, as well as its lack of transparency during the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak, as being irresponsible and unhelpful with combating the pandemic the world is facing today. "No. That's -- that's completely absurd. You know, look, if the Chinese government had been more transparent early on -- and we're talking late fall, December at least -- we would all -- all of us, all the nations in the world would have been able to get our arms around this and contain it in China where it began, and prevent its propagation around the world. But to have somebody like that from the Chinese government come out and make a statement like that's completely ridiculous and it's irresponsible, and it doesn't get us to where we need to be," said Dr. Mark T. Esper, Secretary of Defense, in response to questions about U.S. service members being responsible for the coronavirus outbreak in China.Myth: The U.S. government is instituting a mandatory national lockdown.Fact: As Vice President Pence stated in the virtual town hall, March 24, at no point has the White House Coronavirus Task Force discussed a national lockdown or stay-at-home order. However, national and state governments have published guidance to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Guidelines include following CDC hygiene recommendations, avoiding groups of 10 or more and avoiding discretionary travel.Within the Department of Defense, we are practicing social distancing, minimizing person-to-person interaction, making accommodations for working offsite and, wherever possible, conducting virtual meetings. In addition, to enable mission assurance and force health protection, DOD has announced travel restrictions for service members, DOD civilians and families.Myth: Some people tout the benefits of a certain toothpaste or hot drinks as the cure to coronavirus and say to stay away from cold drinks.Fact: While we don't have a cure for COVID-19, we caution against people buying into so-called cures. Sometimes, they can do more harm than good.Myth: Military hospitals and clinics are not isolating COVID-19 patients.Fact: All military medical facilities have infection prevention and control protocols in place, not just for COVID-19 but for any infectious disease. Patients who test positive are isolated from the general population in designated isolation rooms or sent home to self-isolate.Myth: All routine appointments at military hospitals and clinics are cancelled.Fact: It is recommended that you call your provider if you have a routine appointment scheduled. Some appointments are being transitioned to virtualappointments while others are being postponed.Myth: All military pharmacies are closed.Fact: There are currently no plans to close all military pharmacies, but each MTF may make decisions based on local guidance. It is recommended that you call to verify hours of operation before leaving home, and follow social distancing guidelines.Myth: It is unsafe to donate blood at military blood donor centers.Fact: All donors and donor center staff undergo a thorough health screening, and donor stations are practicing all social distancing guidelines.Myth: Military family members can go to a military treatment facility for COVID-19 testing.Fact: Military family members should call the Nurse Advice Line or their own provider to be screened first. If it's determined they need to be tested, they will be directed to the nearest testing location.Myth: The U.S. Navy hospital ships USNS Comfort and USNS Mercy will treat COVID-19 patients.Fact: The U.S. Navy hospital ships USNS Mercy (T-AH 19) and USNS Comfort (T-AH 20) will be used to handle urgent care for non-COVID-19 cases so that local health professionals can focus on treating COVID-19 patients and shore-based hospitals can use their Intensive Care Units and ventilators for those patients. (Commander, U.S. 3rd Fleet Public Affairs Press Release, March 23, 2020)Myth: The U.S. military has federalized the National Guard.Facts: The president has not, as of March 25, federalized, or placed under his control, members of the National Guard in the effort to combat COVID-19. There are nearly 10,000 members of the National Guard who have been called up to support, and some are even federally funded, but even they are all under the control of their respective state governors. They are performing several services for their states; however, none are involved in law or quarantine enforcement. "There's no plan to use the National Guard in Title 32 or state active duty status or in any other status to do quarantine [enforcement] or enforce shelter-in-place operations," said Air Force Gen. Joseph L. Lengyel, the chief of the National Guard Bureau.Myth: The U.S. military is implementing martial law.Facts: Remarks by Secretary Esper in a press briefing on the COVID-19 response, March 23, 2020: "In New York, Washington and California, the president has approved mobilizing National Guard troops under Title 32 status, which provides them full access to federal resources, but still allows them to be managed by the state government. To be clear, this is not a move toward martial law, as some have erroneously claimed. Our great National Guard troops are performing tasks such as supporting drive-through testing sites, conducting food delivery to protect vulnerable populations, and helping states plan and coordinate their local responses. Allowing states to maintain control over their National Guard forces is the most effective way to manage their efforts, as it permits each governor to tailor the Guard's activities to best support the needs of their state."Chief of the National Guard Bureau Air Force Gen. Joseph L. Lengyel press teleconference on the COVID-19 response, March 22, 2020: "There is no truth to this rumor that people are conspiring, that governors are planning, that anyone is conspiring to use the National Guard, mobilized or not, Title 32 or state, to do military action to enforce shelter in place or quarantines."Myth: Social distancing is only for high-risk populations.Fact: Social distancing protects everyone, especially the most vulnerable, by slowing down the transmission of COVID-19. Stay away from crowded places, reduce contact with others and avoid people who are coughing or sneezing.Myth: Everyone becomes seriously ill from the virus that causes COVID-19.Fact: Most people with COVID-19 have not become seriously ill, but older adults and people with underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, lung disease or heart disease, are at greater risk of severe illness form the virus that causes COVID-19.Myth: You should wear a face mask when outside the home.Fact: If you're healthy, you only need to wear a mask when taking care of someone with a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. Also, if you are coughing and sneezing, in which case, you should be self-isolating.Myth: There are no symptoms for COVID-19.Fact: Common signs and symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.Myth: There's nothing I can do to prevent infection.Fact: While there isn't a vaccine, you can take everyday precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19.Myth: Since my pharmacy might run out of medications, I should start taking half doses to make my prescription last longer.Fact: Military pharmacies are staying stocked with the medications you need. Cutting your dose in half, without the advice of your doctor, could make you very sick. Take your medications as prescribed so you can stay healthy and out of crowded hospitals.Myth: Certain medication combinations can prevent or treat COVID-19.Fact: There is no FDA-approved medication combination to prevent or treat COVID-19. Don't take any medications without your doctor's advice.Latest Guidance and InformationCoronavirus: DOD ResponseThe Defense Department is working closely with the Department of Health and Human Services and State Department to provide support in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak.Load-Date: March 31, 2020End of Document

Biological weapons: from "rabbit fever" to surprising coronavirus theoriesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 9, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 2477 wordsBodyEvery time a new disease arises, and even more so when it becomes an epidemic or, as in the case of Coronavirus infection that causes Covid-19, in a pandemic, the versions, hypotheses, theories and rumors that it is a biological weapon – used intentionally or accidentally disseminated by some dark laboratory – run like wildfire.In recent decades, it occurred with the pandemic of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, which causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), and then with so-called bird flu and swine flu. In all these cases, more rigorous scientific research ruled out the possibility, although beliefs remained active.In the case of coronavirus, fear and uncertainty, coupled with the vast amount of information circulating these days about the virus – part of it arising from unreliable sources –, have been generating a breeding ground conducive to the creation of assumptions, conjectures and conspiracy theories.Murcielago Soup (Photo: Twitter@Viethmichell)The nature of coronavirusConfusion about the cause of Covid-19 – often intentionally enhanced in the context of political and economic conflicts that have nothing to do with health – has expanded at the same rate as the pandemic, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to warn of the dangers of what has been defined as "infodemics" , i.e. a stream of misinformation that is spreading faster even than the virus itself.Scientific research says otherwise about Covid-19 and has demonstrated the natural origin of the virus that causes it, Coronavirus. In a paper published on March 20 by the prestigious journal Nature, an international team of scientists made it clear that the characteristics of the virus "rule out laboratory manipulation as a source" of the disease.The authors of the publication point out two possible scenarios of the origin of the virus: in the first, the pathogen evolved to its current state transmitting between animal hosts before infecting patient zero; the other, on the other hand, assumes that the coronavirus evolved directly into the human organism before the outbreak began.An illustration, created at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), shows the new coronavirus, Atlanta, USA, 29 January 2020.Alissa Eckert, MS; Dan Higgins, MAM/CDC/Delivered via REUTERS. (Delivered/)The surprising theories about the origin of CoronavirusIn the face of the results of the research published in Nature and the statements of the Scientific Committee of the World Health Organization, hypotheses and theories can be found that say otherwise.The most relevant – for the prestige of the figure - is that presented by Luc Montagnier, winner of the Nobel Prize for his work on HIV-AIDS but at the same time a very controversial figure in the scientific community.The French researcher argues that the coronavirus "was created. There has been a manipulation of the virus: at least part, not the whole. There's a model, which is the viruswhich comes mainly from bats, but to which HIV sequences have been added. In any case, it's not natural. It's the work of professionals, molecular biologists. A very meticulous job. For what purpose? I don't know."In this sense, some claim that the virus came out of a Chinese laboratory, more precisely from the Wuhan Microbiology Laboratory, the city where patient zero of the pandemic was detected.Paying that theory, the president of the Population Institute, american Steven Mosher, wrote in The New York Post: "How many 'microbiology labs' working with 'advanced viruses like the new coronavirus' are there in China? Turns out there's only one across the country. And that unique laboratory is located in the Chinese city of Wuhan, which is precisely... the epicenter of the epidemic."A view shows cardboard cardboard cutouts, displaying images of U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with protective masks widely used as a preventive measure against coronavirus disease (COVID-19), near a gift shop in Moscow, Russia March 23, 2020. REUTERS/Evgenia Novozhenina (EVGENIA NOVOZHENINA/)In the same direction points to the documentary "The Origin of Wuhan Coronavirus", by journalist Joshua Philipp, in one of whose parts rely on the theory of chinese scientist Shi Zhengli, who has been working with synthetic viruses since 2015. According to Philipp, this research "strongly tests or supports the hypothesis that it is not possible that [COVID-19-causing coronavirus] was generated in a natural zoonotic transmission, but had to come from a hospital, laboratory environment, almost certainly biosecurity-level 4 research facilities in Wuhan."Virology in political keyMost theories about the artificial origin of Coronavirus can be read in the context of the growing economic and geopolitical confrontation between the United States and China.Just a few days ago, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo again targeted China for the origin of the new coronavirus. "There's a huge amount of evidence that's where it started," he told ABC, about Wuhan Lab. He added that China "did everything it could to make sure the world didn't find out in time. It was a classic effort of communist misinformation."China's response was not expected, albeit indirectly, in an editorial in the state-owned Global Times newspaper. "Given that Pompeo said his claims are backed by 'huge evidence', then he should present this alleged evidence to the world, and especially to the American public he continually tries to deceive. The truth is that Pompeo has no evidence," he said.Further away was the official Xinhua news agency – which holds the official position of the Chinese government – with the online publication of an animation where a Chinese terracotta warrior, stocked with a beard, and the Statue of Liberty, dialogue. Ironic, the video aims to debunk the U.S. government's accusations and holds it accountable for the harsh health situation in that country.(Hector RETAMAL / AFP) (HECTOR RETAMAL/)In this context, the debate on whether Covid-19 is a laboratory product or, moreover, a biological weapon and not a product of nature remains active.It is not simply the circulation of controversial versions, many of them with false or incomprobable information. Covid-19's belief could be a biological weapon reinforced in the social imagination by the very history of humanity, during which there were war conflicts in which "pests" were used as weapons of war.Reconstruction of the life of hittites (Shutterstock)The Hittites and rabbit feverThe oldest record of a biological agent that was used to harm the enemy in the war during a war comes from a series of Hittite texts dating back to about 1,500 years BC.These tablets, found in the ruins of Hattusa, tell how, during imperial expansion, people who were victims of fellaremia, known as rabbit fever or wild hare fever, a disease caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis, were sent to enemy lands to spread the disease to the locals.It's the first documented biological weapon in history.The innovative ingenuity of Hittites in the art of war was not limited only to the use of a biological weapon. Around the same time, they invented the two-wheeled light tank, pulled by two horses. Their occupants fired arrows before the charge, during which they used spears.The Assyrian precedentAlthough there are no documents to prove it, some historians argue that a thousand years before the Hittites, the Assyrians used a toxin, ergotamine, to contaminate the water wells where their enemies were supplied.Ergotamine causes ergotism, a disease that many years later would be called San Antonio Fever – or San Antonio fire – whose clinical picture begins with hallucinations, seizures and contraction of the arteries. Victims begin to feel an intense cold in the limbs, which soon becomes a burning sensation. The picture leads to a necrosis of the tissues, the appearance of gangrene and intense abdominal pains. If the affected person does not die, he is usually mutilated, often losing all his limbs.Pirro's TarantulasAnother very little case documenting but which some historians consider probable was the use of tarantulas by Pirro, king of Epirus, a Hellenic kingdom of the SECOND century BC located in the mountainous region of what is now the north and west of Greece.The story goes that after a fierce battle against the Romans, where he lost almost all of his army (hence the expression "Pyrrhic victory), Pirro returned to Epirus willing to take revenge on his enemies. He did so by sending hundreds of agents carrying venomous spiders to different cities in the Roman Empire, including Taranta, which was virtually invaded by those arachnids, whose bites cause, among other symptoms, uncontrollable leg tremors. The poison, in not a few cases, is fatal.Of thosemovements caused by the poison comes from the name of the traditional Italian dance known as "the tarantela", as it was believed that moving "crazy" limited pain and counteracted the effects of the sting.The bombings of medieval "the plague"For nearly a century, until the early 14th century, the Mongol chiefs of what was called "The Golden Horde" allowed Italian traders – especially Genoese – to settle in the south of the Crimean peninsula, in present-day Feodosia, then called Caffa, a city that quickly transformed into a mercantile pole.However, soon a religious phenomenon would change peaceful coexistence in the region. The conversion to Islam of much of the empire's population made the presence of Christian merchants and warriors undesirable.Infected human bodies and animals were launched in catapults (Shutterstock)In 1343, Yanibeg, the Khan of Kipchak, ordered the expelling all Europeans from the peninsula. He managed to occupy the city of Tana (on the coast of the Sea of Azov, where the Italians had built a consulate and abundant trading posts), but failed in their attempt to surrender Caffa.The city resisted for three years and the situation of the Mongol troops bese embed it became critical when many of its warriors were victims of the plague. According to the account of the Italian notary Gabriel de Mussis , locked in Caffa, the Mongols were gasoping their skin and dying like flies, victims of fever and the rotten bubbs that grew in the English and armpits.In the midst of that plague that seemed to force him to lift the siege of the city and flee that region of death, The Kan Yanibeg found a solution that allowed him, even at the cost of continuing to lose his troops, to break the defense of the city.The notary of Mussis tells it thus: "The Tatars, exhausted by that pestilence disease and knocked down everywhere as struck by lightning, checking that they lost hopelessly, ordered the corpses to be placed on the siege machines and thrown them into the city of Caffa. Thus, the bodies of the dead were thrown over the walls, so Christians, despite having taken as many deaths as possible and thrown them into the sea, could not hide or protect themselves from that danger. Soon all the air became infected and the water was poisoned, and such pestilence developed that it barely managed to escape one in a thousand."The effect was devastating, as the populations of the Middle East, although they were still dying from the plague, had natural defenses formed after centuries of living the disease. Instead, Europeans, without natural defences, died like flies. In the following years, the bubonic plague spread throughout Europe and killed a third of the population.In France tooAround the same time that the Tatars besieged Caffa, in the north of France, troops besieging Thun L'Eveque Castle in Hainault also did not find how to break the resistance of their occupants.After months of fruitless attacks with conventional weapons of the time, they decided to make the occupants of the castle sick by throwing dead horses and cows, and even some corpses of soldiers, over the walls, using catapults.After a few days the unbearable smell and an infectious outbreak caused the French to open the castle gates and decide to sign a very disadvantageous treaty.Nearly a centurylater, in 1422, in Karlsten, Bohemia, the forces besieging the castle used the same resource, using the corpses of soldiers killed in battle. The citadel lasted almost five months, but eventually had to surrender, when very few defenders had remained who had not fallen victim to the infection.Medieval image of smallpox (Photo: Wikipedia)Smallpox and yellow feverFrom the Middle Ages onwards there are also abounds where armies used biological weapons to defeat their enemies. During the American War for Independence, the British tried to disperse smallpox among American troops. They were unsuccessful because the infected were quickly quarantined.Years later, during the Civil War, the Confederates used two biological resources, also with little luck. On the one hand, they infected the water wells with corpses; on the other, through agents operating behind enemy ranks, they attempted to contaminate the clothes and sheets provided to the U.S. army with yellow smallpox and fever.Japanese soldiers celebrate Shanghai fall in Second Sino-Japanese WarJapan v ChinaCongshan, a tiny city in southeastern China, is the only place where the use of a biological weapon has been documented during World War II, committed by secret units of Japanese invasion forces that occupied much of China between 1931 and 1945. They were tests with the intention of using them on a larger scale.In August 1942, a plane threw over the village "a kind of smoke," as described by the local Jin Xianglan. Two weeks later, the rats began to die en masse. The fever spread among the population, as the first sign of an outbreak of bubonic plague that killed 392 of the 1,200 villagers.When the Japanese took the place, on November 18, they burned all the houses touched by the plague. "You buried the dead knowing that the next day you would be buried," Wang Peigen, one of the few survivors of the attack, who was then 10 years old, would tell you.Facts and infodemiaAmong others, these historical facts where biological agents were actually used as weapons of war are what today serve to pay for the false belief that the current Covid-19 pandemic is a result in a laboratory product.There is no scientific evidence that this is the case, but quite the opposite: coronavirus is a product of nature and its dissemination has not been manipulated. However, infodemia about coronavirus infection feeds its credibility in stories like these and elaborates the most surprising theories.I kept reading:A documentary about the origin of the coronavirus says the Chinese Communist Party concealed that it is synthetic and leaked from a laboratoryWHO believes coronavirus "has an animal origin" and that there is no evidence that it was tampered with in a Chinese laboratoryLoad-Date: May 10, 2020End of Document

ROSE, WALKER MAKE BIPARTISAN PUSH FOR DHS TO INCREASE INTEL FOCUS ON CHINA'S COVID-19 ACTIONSStates News ServiceMay 13, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 414 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of New York Rep. Max Rose:Following reports of China threatening American intellectual property and obfuscating coronavirus information in order to stockpile supplies, Chair and Ranking Member of Homeland Security Subcommittee on Intelligence and Counterterrorism seek answers, action from DHSCongressman Max Rose (D-NY), Chair of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Intelligence and Counterterrorism, and Congressman Mark Walker (R-NC), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, today urged the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Office of Intelligence and Analysis (IandA) to increase its focus on China and provide the subcommittee with details of its intelligence assessments on China's actions related to the pandemic."While the coronavirus pandemic travelled the world and devastated my district, China continues to hide critical information for their own benefit," Rose said. "The Communist Chinese Government cannot be trusted, but I trust our Intelligence Community can help us get the facts in order to help us beat this pandemic and save lives.""China's blatant disregard for humanity during the coronavirus pandemic has endangered the lives of Americans in North Carolina's 6th district and across this nation," Walker said. "Enough is enough. I urge the Department of Homeland Security Office of Intelligence and Analysis to fully investigate these atrocities and get to the bottom of China's apparent malpractice."According to media reports, DHS IandA recently assessed with medium confidence that China was manipulating public knowledge of the extent and severity of COVID-19 in their country in order to stockpile resources for their own pandemic response. Additionally, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), issued a public warning today regarding China's threats to American intellectual property related to the coronavirus."The world continues to learn more about China's efforts to dissemble, obfuscate, and divert information from the key early months of the novel coronavirus outbreak through to the present day," wrote Rose and Walker in a bipartisan letter Brian Murphy, Acting Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis. "China's apparent actions create challenges for the efforts to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, to say nothing of the public health ramifications for the entire world."Full text of letter HERE .Load-Date: May 13, 2020End of Document

Book Launch by Cary Krosinsky, Lecturer, Yale College and the Yale School of Management; "Modern China: Financial Cooperation for Solving Sustainability Challenges" (May 18, 2020)PR NewswireMarch 30, 2020 Monday 2:03 PM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 397 wordsDateline: NEW HAVEN, Conn., March 30, 2020 BodyPR Newswire"Trusted relationships placed front and center for the future of economies and the betterment of global society" is one of the themes of a new book that details how if we don't come together to solve larger societal challenges on the environment and on inequality, we will continue to struggle.To be launched on May 18, 2020, "Modern China: Financial Cooperation for Solving Sustainability Challenges" builds the case for applying Guanxi on a global basis, building trusted partnerships which can then work together on new ideas and solution categories and then share in the benefits both financially and to each of our societies.The author outlines in the book how the West can invest alongside China to dramatically improve renewable energy and other lower carbon solutions across the developing world. The West can also invest in China to help with its transition, which it should, as it has outsourced its pollution, in effect, to China and other parts of Asia. The West needs to help enable solutions to problems caused by its consumption.The author makes the case that China has actually been at the forefront of several things that might surprise some people. This includes not only becoming a leader over the past few years issuing green bonds but also creating financial incentives for banks to become increasingly incentivized to focus on green finance, and to issue more green financial instruments, as well as creating and leading a global network of central banks to accelerate action among much else that includes innovation on energy storage and electric transportation.But China continues to face many issues. Can the Chinese government deliver a transformed China, fixing problems such as climate, pollution, inequality and food/water security?  If it does that, it can thrive for its people and help Asia more generally, so this is also China's greatest opportunity."Modern China: Financial Cooperation for Solving Sustainability Challenges" by Cary Krosinsky will be available via Amazon.com at:https://www.amazon.com/Modern-China-Cooperation-Sustainability-Challenges/dp/3030392031/ref=mp_s_a_1_7?dchild=1&qid=1585588825&refinements=p_27%3ACary+Krosinsky&s=books&sr=1-7 View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/book-launch-by-cary-krosinsky-lecturer-yale-college-and-the-yale-school-of-management-301031899.htmlSOURCE Cary KrosinskyCONTACT: Joyee Lin, press@JMchaseconsulting.comLoad-Date: March 30, 2020End of Document

Hai is especially concerned with generating guides to Artificial Intelligence that maintain basic principles of protection for human integrity, it is a multidisciplinary body, this suggests that it is made up of people who practice in different areas. Fei-Fei sits doctors with lawyers, psychologists with engineers and puts them discussing basic concepts of construction ethics, how should a robot feel? This type of cognitive-moral development applies to technology such as methods of mass social surveillance, whether it should be decided between privacy and security. What's the most ethical thing? They are approaches that generate arduous debates, I would pay any amount of money in my possession for sitting down to hear these contemporary geniuses talk about nuts and software (I leave in my Twitter lecture yuval Noah Harari and Fei-Fei Li to Stanford). Today the streets are deserted and the only roar of hope rumbles against concrete when they give 20:00 hours; humanity is facing one of the toughest battles of the century. Merkel from Berlin says the pandemic is as severe as World War II itself and millions of people are confined to their homes. While the strategy in the West is precarious and has unleashed the largest pockets of infection (Italy and Spain), in East Asia, thanks to the use of Artificial Intelligence and biometric inspection platforms, this pandemic has been contained. The first case of Covid-19 was recorded 11 days apart in Taiwan and Italy, so far, the island located on the coast of Southeast Asia has had 169 cases and only 2 deaths, while in Italy contagions exceed 40 thousand and deaths , 4 thousand (even more than China). In Beijing, autonomous infrastructure is sufficient to detect a public transport passenger, measure his body temperature through cameras, and have public administration agents stopping him at his home at the time of the event, while sterilize its streets with drones. Moreover, the lack of human rights prerogatives - which is prevalent in Asian countries - is surprisingly useful in containing an epidemiological crisis, restricting individual freedoms to "sdaining" such as Xi Jinping, or murdering infected quarantine-breaking, as Kim Jong Un does, ensures considerable margin of success in prevention and containment policies. In Mexico, the President protects himself with amulets and the U.S. says it's "all part of a hoax." In China, a gigantic brain watches over them, an Artificial Intelligence so shrewd that it can track citizens' latest physical or virtual connections to warn them of possible contagion. The development of AI, autonomous infrastructure and dictatorial measures saved the most densely populated countries in the world from the total Covid-19 massacre. While the Chinese government develops and applies Artificial Intelligence freely, without ethical scrutiny, with totalitarian tints and invests millions of dollars in infrastructure to support the scale of data being analyzed, Fei-Fei had to suspend Palo Alto because California could not contain a virus that came to them late. It is not that the West does not have the technology, but it does have a legal order that protects people's biometric data and constantly delays technological and AI development. While the West juggles the rights of privacy, free speech and the common good in a circus that has only brought themmisfortunes in the face of this virus, China puts a heavy hand and saves its citizens from a fatal fate. At what cost? Fei-Fei was born in 1976 in Beijing and came to the United States chasing the "American dream" today, from the lockdown at home in California, you'll think about the values that need to be programmed to the AI of the future.  @DaniSanBern       Load-Date: March 24, 2020End of Document

Mexican peso trades slight rising attentive to China-US trade tension, profiles weekly fallCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 15, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 206 wordsBodyMEXICO CITY, May 15 (Reuters) - The Mexican peso traded with moderate gain on Friday as investors remained vigilant about rising trade tensions between China and the United States, as well as weak U.S. consumer data.The local currency was trading at 23,8080 per dollar, with a moderate gain of 0.22% compared to 23,8600 pesos in Thursday's Reuters reference price.Investor caution increased in the session, after the U.S. government sought to block semiconductor shipments from global chip manufacturers to Huawei Technologies, an action that could raise tensions with China."While no official announcement has been made, it is mentioned that the (US blocking) measure is supported by national security protection and confirmed, there is likely to be a response from the Chinese government," said Gabriela Siller, director of analysis at Banco Base.Additionally, the U.S. commerce department revealed retail sales figures, which fell 16.4% in April, above consensus, increasing fears of a slow economic recovery.If the current trend continues in the day, the Mexican peso would break a two-week win streak, accumulating a loss in the last five days of just over 0.7%%, according to data from Refinitiv Eikon.

Nonetheless, the company cannot rule out future business impacts and will, if necessary, provide further updates on business performance when reporting financial results for the first quarter of 2020. Co continues to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on its ongoing clinical trials. Co is working closely with the study centers to understand the potential impact of COVID-19 on trial enrollment. Recently, Yale-New Haven Hospital (YNHH) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), both sites in Arvinas' ARV-110 study, as well as the University of California -- Los Angeles (UCLA), a site in Arvinas' ARV-471 study, all have publicly announced pauses in patient enrollment for clinical trials, including Arvinas' trials. The pause at UCLA has already been lifted and new patients for the ARV-471 trial are permitted to enroll. Co does not expect COVID-19 to have any impact to the planned timing of clinical data releases for ARV-110 (at the 2020 annual meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology) and ARV-471 (in the second half of 2020).16:54AMK AssetMark issues March report; platform assets increased yr/yr to $56.0 bln (20.29 -1.73)Company highlights for the month of March 2020 include:Platform assets of $56.0 bln at the end of March, up 12.7% yr/yr. Net flows were $659 mln in the month of March, up 27.2% yr/yr. AssetMark Trust Company client cash increased 112.1% yr/yr. Average client cash for the first quarter was $2.0 bln, on which AssetMark received a blended annualized yield of 1.36%. Given recent rate actions by the Fed, the company expects this yield to decline materially in the second quarter. Number of households increased 28.3% yr/yr to 176,681 at the end of March.16:52LMAT Lemaitre Vascular sees in-line Q1 but withdraws annual guidance (26.94 -0.53)Co sees Q1 (Mar) EPS of $0.15-0.16 vs. $0.16 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $30.4-30.6 mln vs. $30.45 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.The COVID-19 pandemic began to negatively impact sales in the second half of March. Due to the unpredictable magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company is withdrawing its previously announced annual guidance for 2020.16:52AMRN Amarin guides Q1 revs above consensus (6.39 +0.34)Co issues upside guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees Q1 (Mar) revs of approx $150 mln vs. $128.97 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Co says revs have the potential to increase modestly when finalized as a result of international revenue, licensing revenue and other considerations. This preliminary estimate predominantly reflects VASCEPA sales in the United States. Co also says cash/investments were more than $620 million and less than $50 million remained due on its royalty-like debt instrument.16:49ROKU Roku sees Q1 revs above consensus but withdraws 2020 outlook due to COVID-19 uncertainty (96.56 +4.11)Co sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $307-317 mln vs. $299.88 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; Adjusted EBITDA of ($23)-(18) mln; and other metrics generally in-line with prior outlook. Roku estimates 39.8 million Active Accounts as of March 31, 2020, a net increase of nearly 3 million since December 31, 2019. Roku also expects first quarter Streaming Hours will be 13.2 billion, a 49% year-over-year increase. In early Q1, Roku completed the rollout of its "Are you still watching" feature which exits video playback after long periods of user inactivity. As previously noted, the roll out of this feature will moderate streaming hour growth; however, beginning in late Q1 Roku started to see the effects of large numbers of people "sheltering at home." For Roku, this has resulted in an acceleration in new account growth and an increase in viewing.Roku ended the first quarter with an estimated $587 million of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments. This includes a $70 million draw-down from its revolving credit facility16:44DGX Quest Diagnostics provides update on impact of COVID-19 (86.43 -3.34)Excerpts from an email to colleagues from CEO and Chairman Steve Rusckowski include:"To date Quest has performed nearly 800,000 tests, or about 40% of all testing by commercial labs. We are now preparing to offer antibody blood testing to identify people who have been exposed and built immunity. However, as we reported on March 31, the increase in our COVID-19 testing has not nearly been enough to offset the significant reductions we have seen to Quest's overall testing volumes, which declined by more than 40% in the last two weeks of March.""My base pay as CEO will be reduced by 25% for the next 12 weeks, and each of the members of the company's Board of Directors will forgo 25% of their cash compensation over the same period. Quest exempt employees also will take a temporary pay cut for 12 weeks, ranging from 20% for the most senior executives down to 5%, depending on level.""Other temporary changes include [...] [a]pproving furloughs for employees with diminished work who have indicated interest to be at home [...]; to date, more than 4,000 colleagues, or 9% of our workforce, have been enrolled." "Importantly, none of these changes will impact our ability to deliver critical COVID-19 testing."16:40CLLS Cellectis appoints Carrie Brownstein, M.D. to the role of Chief Medical Officer (10.48 +0.78)Dr. Brownstein joins Cellectis from Celgene, where she most recently served as VP, Global Clinical Research and Development, Therapeutic Area Head for myeloid diseases.16:37CNK Cinemark to host call to discuss liquidity strategy and COVID-19 impact on April 15 at 11:30 a.m. ET (10.80 -1.70)Mark Zoradi, Cinemark's CEO commented, "Cinemark was well-positioned with approximately $0.5B in cash and 2x net leverage heading into this global pandemic and we are taking prudent steps to further safeguard our liquidity position during this unprecedented time. We believe the Senior Secured Notes we priced today, along with our current cash balance and proactive cash management actions, will provide us sufficient liquidity to endure the COVID-19 crisis, even if it is prolonged. We look forward to once again opening our theatres and welcoming moviegoers to experience the magic of cinematic storytelling on our big screens in the not-too-distant future."16:36CLF Cleveland-Cliffs will be temporarily idling production at two of its iron ore mining operations (4.44 -0.19)Based on current market conditions, co will be temporarily idling production at two of its iron ore mining operations, Northshore Mining in Minnesota and Tilden Mine in Michigan. Co will work down current inventory levels from these two operations and will continue to ship iron ore to fulfill its commercial agreements with steel customers. "As our steel customers rationalize their operations' capacities, we made the decision to adjust our iron ore production during the first half of the year and not continue to build additional iron ore inventory until market conditions improve. Once the North American steel market improves, Cleveland-Cliffs will be able to quickly restart and ramp up production."16:35BRKS Brooks Automation issues upside Q2 guidance (30.60 +0.10)Co sees Q2 (Mar) EPS of $0.24-0.26, excluding non-recurring items, vs. $0.24 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q2 (Mar) revs of ~$220 mln vs. $213.37 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Co also reported that all of its facilities remained operational during the COVID-19 crisis with only required personnel on site, and the balance of employees working from home. The Company has implemented CDC social distancing guidelines and other best practices to ensure the health and safety of its employees. In the Life Sciences business, GENEWIZ and Sample Management operations are taking orders for all its offerings while fast tracking those in support of research and development related to the COVID-19 virus.

Due to component supplier constraints, the stoppage at Navistar's truck assembly plant in Springfield, Ohio has been extended through early May.The company is implementing a series of temporary cost reduction measures to further preserve financial flexibility. Actions include:A postponement of 30% of capital expenditures and of 30% of information technology project spend; A deferral of $162 mln in pension contributions until 2021 as well as a deferral of employer payroll tax payments and certain Employee Retention Tax Credits under provisions of the CARES Act as guidance becomes available; A deferral of 35% to the base salary of the CEO and board compensation and a deferral of 10-30% to the base salary of U.S.-based, salaried exempt, non-represented employees; and A reduced workweek by 20% for contractors.16:26ABR Arbor Realty Trust provides COVID update (7.05 -0.76)Co reports that it currently has approximately $350 million in cash and available liquidity. "Our balance sheet portfolio is approximately $4.8 billion as of March 31, 2020 with $3.4 billion of debt financing those assets. Approximately $2.6 billion, or 76% of that debt, is in non-recourse CLOs and approximately $800 million is financed through warehouse and repurchase facilities with eight different banks that we have long standing relationships with. Additionally, the majority of the loans being financed in these bank lines are also rated and CLO eligible.""to date we have received forbearance requests from approximately 2% of our borrowers related to April payments that we are currently evaluating."Co originated $1.1 billion in agency loans in the first quarter, which is up from $850 million in originations for the first quarter of 2019, and its agency pipeline is up to $1.6 billion compared to $1.2 billion at the same time last year.16:25CMCO Columbus McKinnon sees prelim Q4 sales below consensus; search for a permanent CEO continues (25.26 -1.26)Co sees Q4 (Mar) revs of $185-190 mln vs. $195.98 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

As a result, backlog at March 31, 2020 increased to approximately $131.0 million from $125.3 million at December 31, 2019."We are taking aggressive actions to reduce costs and provide liquidity in what we expect will be a very challenged macro environment during the next several months. While there are a few pockets of strength such as the utilities and government verticals, several industries, such as entertainment, automotive and aerospace, are being negatively impacted. We believe that we can continue to generate cash even as revenue declines due to the immediate cost reduction and working capital management actions we are taking combined with the results of our Blueprint for Growth strategy. Our strategy enabled us to simplify the business during the last few years through the 80/20 Process, reduce our cost structure and improve efficiencies. We believe that we will be well positioned for the inevitable recovery when it comes. In the meantime, we are focused on optimizing our results in this current challenging environment."16:24AB AllianceBernstein reports that preliminary month-end assets under management decreased to $542 bln during March 2020 from $614 bln at the end of February (20.24 -1.72)The 11.7% decrease resulted predominantly from sharp market declines as well as net outflows from all three client channels -- Retail, Institutions, and Private Wealth.16:22INSP Inspire Medical Systems announces public offering of $75.0 mln of shares of its common stock (63.39 -1.22)16:20MTDR Matador Resources announces initial Rodney Robinson well results, improves hedging protection and provides operational update (3.38 +0.17)Key highlights of this release include the following: Rodney Robinson wells achieve Matador record 24-hour initial potential test results from all three formations tested and are expected to contribute 8 to 10% of Company's total production for the remainder of 2020; Restructured 2020 oil hedges now cover 75 to 80% of anticipated oil production at $35 per barrel or above for remainder of 2020; and Recent actions taken by Matador should save or cause the Company to receive a sum approaching $340 million in 2020, as compared to its original 2020 estimates, including reductions of $250 million in capital expenditures for drilling, completing and equipping well and $40 million in operating expenses, in particular lease operating and general and administrative expenses.16:19SWIR Sierra Wireless appoints Samuel Cochrane as CFO, effective May 6 (6.92 +0.29)Samuel Cochrane will join as CFO starting May 6.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4%, and the Russell 2000 fell 2.8%.There wasn't much conviction in today's session ahead of the Q1 earnings reports from the leading U.S. banks this week. Perhaps some skittishness regarding the loan-loss reserves these banks are accruing contributed to the influential drag from the S&P 500 financials sector (-3.6%).Sellers were kept in check, though, as stocks drifted sideways for most of the session and closed well off intraday lows after a brief tumble after the open. The S&P 500 real estate sector (-4.6%) declined the most, while the consumer discretionary sector (+1.1%) finished comfortably in positive territory.Interestingly, a multinational agreement to cut oil production was unable to stir much enthusiasm within the energy sector (-0.4%). Specifically, OPEC and other non-OPEC members agreed to cut production by 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, then 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31, and then 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022.WTI crude futures struggled for direction and ultimately settled the session down 2.0%, or $0.45, to $22.42/bbl, suggesting that investors were not convinced that the production cuts alone would save an industry still facing demand problems caused by COVID-19. The economy is expected to gradually reopen in May, but the speed and scope of a recovery remained uncertain.Investors' appetite for growth, meanwhile, continued to lead buyers toward technology companies, including Amazon (AMZN 2168.87, +126.11, +6.2%), Apple (AAPL 273.25, +5.26, +2.0%), and Netflix (NFLX 396.72, +26.00, +7.0%). Amazon stepped up efforts to meet strong customer demand, while Netflix benefited from a positive note in Barron's.Separately, shares of Caterpillar (CAT 114.14, -10.89, -8.7%) dropped nearly 9% after the stock was downgraded to Underperform from Neutral at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.U.S. Treasuries ended the quiet session on a lower note. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.23%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 0.75%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 99.42.Investors did not receive any economic data on Monday. Looking ahead, investors will receive Import and Export Prices for March on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite -8.7% YTDS&P 500 -14.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -18.0% YTDRussell 2000 -27.4% YTD16:17XENT Intersect ENT issues downside Q1 revs guidance and withdraws 2020 guidance; taken pre-emptive actions to curtail spending (11.76 +0.03)Co sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $19.5-19.8 mln vs. $26.53 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. "Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, our efforts to enhance commercial execution and improve market access infrastructure were beginning to yield benefits as our first quarter 2020 sales were tracking to prior year and in-line with our expectations. However, sales trailed off throughout March as the various COVID-19 restrictions were implemented. While our business has and will be impacted by hospitals suspending elective surgical procedures and reduced ENT office visits, we are maintaining our customer-focus and taking the necessary actions to maintain continuity. To that end, we proactively implemented initiatives to reduce costs, maintain liquidity and preserve our cash to enable us to navigate this challenge and return to growth." Due to the rapidly evolving environment and continued uncertainties resulting from the impact of COVID-19, the Company is withdrawing its previously announced annual guidance for 2020, which was issued on February 24, 2020. At this date, the Company cannot predict the extent or duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its financial and operating results, but believes current government policies, including the suspension of elective procedures worldwide, will substantially impact its revenues in the second quarter of 2020 and potentially longer. While the financial impact will certainly impact near term results, the Company believes the actions it has taken will enable it to maintain its ability to return to growth as the current crisis subsides.16:14STRL Sterling Construction was awarded "significant" projects and increases to the scope on existing projects totaling ~$100 million during Q1 2020 (9.03 -0.27)The site development projects included distribution centers for the e-commerce platform and retail grocers, a major children's hospital expansion and an industrial location. The majority of these awards commenced work during the quarter.16:13BGNE BeiGene announces that Phase 3 trial of tislelizumab in combination with chemotherapy in patients with first-line NSCLC met its primary endpoint of PFS at interim analysis (148.51 -1.89)BeiGene announced that the Phase 3 trial evaluating its anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared to pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy alone at the planned interim analysis, as assessed by independent review committee. Key secondary endpoints included overall survival and safety. The safety profile of tislelizumab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy was consistent with the known risks of each study treatment, and no new safety signals were identified.BeiGene plans to discuss its plans for filing a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for tislelizumab as a first-line treatment for non-squamous NSCLC with the Center for Drug Evaluation at the National Medical Products Administration in China and to present detailed data at upcoming medical conferences.16:12TMDX TransMedics Group guides Q1 revs slightly above consensus; withdraws 2020 guidance (14.51 -0.54)Co issues upside guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $7.4-7.5 mln vs. $6.87 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Co has taken preemptive measures to reduce near-term expenses, including reducing all non-essential discretionary expenses across the organization, and deferring a portion of executive and employee compensation.

"Prior to the impacts from COVID-19 spreading across the globe, FIS achieved strong revenue growth. As U.S. and foreign governmental authorities imposed social distancing, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders, spending declined, most notably in travel, restaurants, entertainment, and retail, resulting in a rapid deterioration in payments volume and transaction trends on a worldwide basis beginning in March, 2020 which adversely impacted revenue in our payments businesses that earn transaction based fees... We had previously projected revenue of $3,180 to $3,210 million during the first quarter of 2020, representing an increase of approximately 55% to 56% over the prior year period. Organic revenue growth was previously estimated to be 5% to 6% during the first quarter of 2020, including approximately $10 million in anticipated negative foreign exchange impact.""In response to COVID-19, we are taking several actions to manage discretionary expenses and achieve cost synergies, including limiting travel, reducing incentive compensation and decreasing third-party spending as well as accelerating automation and functional alignment across the organization."16:11FIVE Five Below announces additional actions in response to COVID-19 (79.77 -3.21)As previously announced on March 31, Five Below extended the temporary closures of its stores and will reopen stores as soon as federal, state and local authorities allow, targeting May 1.

Weber, Jr. will resume the role of Vice Chairman, CFO, effective April 13 (62.12 -6.10)Robert F. Weber, Jr., will resume the role of Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer, effective April 13, in response to the ongoing global economic challenges and uncertainties attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impact on the broader macroeconomic environment and its business. Concurrently, Jonathan W. Thayer, the company's current CFO, will depart the company. Mr. Weber served as CFO from August 2005 until September 2019 and as Vice Chairman since October 2011.

The new test also has been CE marked to the IVD Directive (98/79/EC).

The majority of the investment includes transforming its Hartsville, S.C., corrugated medium machine (No. 10 machine) into a state-of-the-art URB machine with annual production capacity of approximately 180,000 tons. As a result of the Hartsville No. 10 machine conversion, Sonoco will be exiting the corrugated medium market by the end of 2021, and the expected efficiency of the converted machine will give the Company the opportunity to rationalize some of the higher cost assets in its mill system.15:58SCANX Large cap notable movers of interest -- Caterpillar (CAT) pulls back following analyst downgrade -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable large cap movers of interest ($10 bln - $200 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Large Cap GainersTSLA (648.33 +3.15%): Spikes to one-month highs.

Treasuries started the cash session on a modestly lower note after overnight action saw a weak start from Asian markets while European indices remained closed for Easter. The coronavirus situation continued improving in closely watched places like New York, which supported the growing belief that parts of the U.S. economy will begin reopening soon. However, Minneapolis Fed President, Neel Kashkari, who appeared on CBS on Sunday, had a different view, saying that he expects 18 months of rolling shutdowns unless a medical breakthrough takes place. Meanwhile, Fed Vice Chair, Richard Clarida, acknowledged this morning that the coronavirus will have a disinflationary impact, but he said that the Fed has tools to avoid deflation. Treasuries began the day with modest losses and the 10-yr note remained near its starting level until the close. The long bond underperformed, finishing near its morning low, while shorter tenors underperformed intraday, but narrowed their losses ahead of the close. Gold had another good day, climbing to a level not seen since October 2012. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.2% to 99.37. Yield Check: 2-yr: +1 bp to 0.23% 3-yr: +1 bp to 0.31% 5-yr: +2 bps to 0.43% 10-yr: +2 bps to 0.75% 30-yr: +4 bps to 1.39%News: Senator Bernie Sanders endorsed Joe Biden's candidacy for president. China's March New Loans totaled CNY2.85 trln (expected CNY1.80 trln; last CNY905.70 bln) while Total Social Financing reached CNY5.15 trln (expected CNY2.80 trln; last CNY855.00 bln). Outstanding loans grew 12.7% yr/yr (expected 12.1%; last 12.1%) in March. The Australian government may underwrite domestic flights operated by major carriers in order to maintain links between large cities. Japan's Finance Minister, Taro Aso, said that a sales tax cut is not being considered at this time. Greek Finance Minister, Christos Staikouras, said that Greek GDP will contract between 5% and 10% in 2020. The Italian government is reportedly considering using EUR10 bln of EU funds in a relief package, which would represent a deviation from the EU's deficit rules.

[...] This has in turn significantly reduced global economic activity and resulted in airlines dramatically cutting back on flights and a decrease in motor vehicle use at a time when seasonal driving patterns typically result in an increase of consumer demand for gasoline. As a result, there has also been a decline in the demand for, and thus also the market prices of, crude oil and certain of our products, particularly our refined petroleum products and most notably gasoline and jet fuel.""In addition, recent events concerning the dispute over production levels between Russia and the members of [OPEC], particularly Saudi Arabia, [...] have exacerbated the decline in crude oil prices and have contributed to an increase in crude oil price volatility.""The decrease in the demand for refined petroleum products coupled with the decline in the price of crude oil has resulted in a significant decrease in the price of the refined petroleum products manufactured by our refining segment. Because ethanol is primarily blended into gasoline, ethanol demand has declined along with the decline in the demand for gasoline, and the price of the products manufactured by our ethanol segment have also decreased. Essential businesses [...] continue to operate, blunting the decrease in the demand for diesel. Demand for renewable diesel is consistent with the demand for diesel as a whole; therefore, our renewable diesel segment has not been impacted as significantly as our refining and ethanol segments.""In late March and through early April 2020, we started reducing the amount of crude oil processed at most of our refineries in response to the decreased demand for our products, we temporarily idled various gasoline-making units at certain of our refineries to further limit gasoline production, and we took measures to reduce jet fuel production. We also temporarily idled eight of our ethanol plants, and we reduced the amount of corn feedstock processed at our remaining six ethanol plants to address the decreased demand for ethanol.""We expect to defer or delay certain capital expenditures which we had expected to make in 2020 related to our refining and ethanol segments. [...] We have not purchased any shares of our common stock since mid-March 2020, and will evaluate the timing of repurchases when appropriate.""Furthermore, as a result of the uncertainties concerning COVID-19 and global oil markets, we have withdrawn our prior financial and operational guidance with respect to the first quarter 2020 and fiscal year 2020 and such prior guidance should no longer be relied on."Co issues guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $20.1-22.2 bln vs. $17.76 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Net loss attributable to Valero Energy stockholders is expected to be $(2.1)-(1.83) bln.14:32COMDX Energy Settlement PricesMay Crude Oil futures fell $0.03 (-0.13%) to $22.73/barrel May Natural Gas $0.03 lower (-1.67%) at $1.704/MMBtu May RBOB Gasoline settled $0.03 higher (4.24%) at $0.706/gallon May Heating oil futures settled $0.03 higher (3.18%) at $1.0035/gallon13:57SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/ Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: noneTomorrow Morning: CONN FAST FRC INFY JNJ JPM OGI WFC13:44XLRE Sector Briefing: Real Estate (34.00 -1.53)Ten sectors trade in negative territory this afternoon, with the real estate sector (-4.6%) sitting at the bottom of the leaderboard.Real estate has been among the hardest hit sectors during the market's recent bout with historical volatility.

ATHX (3.44 +18.11%): The FDA authorized co to initiate a Phase 2/3 study to assess the safety and efficacy of MultiStem therapy in subjects with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by the novel coronavirus disease; a new IND will not need to be filed for the program, and co plans to open the first clinical sites for recruitment of this MACOVIA study this quarter.Small Cap LosersSABR (5.55 -20.79%): Pulls back on more than 2x average volume, moderating last week's circa +63% gains. Among recent items, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority put out a notice late last week in which it announced that following an in-depth investigation, the CMA is blocking co's proposed takeover of Farelogix; per the CMA's statement, the CMA "found that Sabre's purchase of Farelogix could result in less innovation in their services, leading to fewer new features that may be released more slowly" and that such a purchase could also drive up fees for certain products, leaving "airlines, travel agents and UK passengers [...] worse off" as a result. The US District Court of Delaware had decided to clear the deal several days earlier. Mizuho commented in a note that it views the CMA's decision as a positive for co's shares, as it believes that the acquisition "would have significantly reduced SABR's financial flexibility at a crucial time"; Mizuho raised co's target to $5 from $3. AMC (2.09 -19.81%): Reports suggest that co is hiring a law firm to explore a potential bankruptcy filing. Hearing downgraded to Sell at B. Riley FBR.

During its Q4 report in January, the company guided for 2020, estimating that reported adjusted EPS for 2020 will be between $8.95-9.10 and that operational sales will increase 4.5-5.5% yr/yr to $85.8-86.6 bln. S&P Capital IQ consensus now calls for EPS of $8.17 and revenues of $79.80 bln for the current fiscal year. The company does not typically issue guidance on a quarterly basis. In the last four quarters, Johnson & Johnson topped expectations for EPS four times while issuing generally in-line or upside revenues in each quarter; revenues for Q4 were slightly below consensus, impacted by a deceleration in sales growth for the company's largest segment, Pharmaceutical, and by a decline in Baby Care products globally within the Consumer segment. The company commented in mid-March that its supply chain was holding steady amid COVID-19 disruptions and that it was taking measures to maximize the availability of its over-the-counter medicine portfolio during the crisis. Meanwhile, the company's Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies unit has been engaged in attempting to combat the outbreak by collaborating with BARDA and other agencies to fund and conduct vaccine research, development, and clinical testing; at the end of March, it announced that it had selected a lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate and that it expected to initiate human clinical studies of the candidate by September at latest.JNJ has a market cap of circa $365 bln and trades at roughly 17x forward earnings estimates. After experiencing significant volatility in recent weeks alongside the broader market, the stock currently trades lower by circa 7% since the company's Q4 earnings release in January.13:00SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (41.47 mln -14.4%)Industrials: GE (54.4 mln -3.85%), DAL (53.04 mln -6.6%), AAL (48.67 mln -7.59%), UAL (24.26 mln -7.29%)Consumer Discretionary: F (59.19 mln -5.59%), CCL (55.43 mln -7.25%), NIO (24.52 mln +9.37%), NCLH (23.48 mln -12.5%)Information Technology: AMD (39.17 mln +2.88%)Financials: MFA (46.41 mln -5.56%), BAC (39.43 mln -3.46%), SQQQ (37.68 mln +0.6%), TQQQ (29.52 mln -0.44%)Energy: CHK (74.64 mln -5.65%), MRO (36.98 mln +3.69%), OXY (30.5 mln -0.91%), ET (25.13 mln +3.87%), APA (24.82 mln +0.91%), CPE (24.12 mln -0.59%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: BCRX (2.65x +12.8%), NTRA (1.65x -8.38%), TXMD (1.64x -10.06%), MESO (1.34x -2.95%)Consumer Discretionary: NLS (3.91x +23.4%), AGS (1.47x -2.04%), TUP (1.46x -6.3%), NEW (1.37x +10.7%)Information Technology: DOMO (1.94x +16.98%), SABR (1.55x -23.14%)Financials: VRIG (2.04x -0.4%), VTIP (1.63x +0.18%), ESGE (1.53x -0.56%), MITT (1.47x -3.2%)Energy: FET (2.51x +16.91%), PVAC (1.63x +21.34%), SM (1.49x +19.43%), HLX (1.46x +3.64%), OIS (1.35x +15.98%)12:58SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: LXRX (2.14 +13.83%), BCRX (2.34 +12.8%)Materials: NGD (0.66 +12.59%)Consumer Discretionary: NLS (4.64 +23.4%), CVNA (70.6 +15.07%), GME (4.47 +14.91%), NEW (4.76 +10.7%)Information Technology: DOMO (13.71 +16.98%)Energy: ENBL (3.35 +23.62%), PVAC (3.81 +21.34%), SM (2.09 +19.43%), LPI (0.47 +18.73%), FET (0.27 +16.91%), ENLC (1.25 +16.82%), OIS (2.8 +15.98%), OMP (5.3 +11.81%), USAC (7.96 +11.71%), GPOR (0.72 +10.83%), BTU (3.7 +10.78%), NBLX (5.04 +10.77%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: CYH (3.23 -16.32%), ACB (0.75 -14.4%)Materials: VNTR (1.46 -13.39%)Industrials: WBT (4.46 -13.4%)Consumer Discretionary: EXPR (2.12 -17.83%), CCS (16.04 -15.4%), RCL (34.47 -14.31%), HZO (10.4 -13.88%), FOXF (43.47 -13.85%), EAT (14.92 -13.71%), LGIH (47.52 -13.19%), NCLH (11.47 -12.5%), KBH (19.75 -12.49%)Information Technology: SABR (5.38 -23.14%), BDC (32.66 -12.51%)Energy: FTSI (0.35 -17.36%), SDRL (0.76 -12.8%)12:56WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stocks trade lower midday, weakness in financial and industrial sectorsThe stock market is retracing some of its historic gains from last week, but the major indices are currently trading off session lows. The S&P 500 is down 1.5% after being down 2.5% today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-1.7%) has followed a similar path, while the Nasdaq Composite outperforms with a 0.5% decline.From a sector perspective, the real estate sector (-4.0%) is down the most, but weakness in the financials (-3.2%) and industrials (-3.0%) sectors is having an influential drag on the broader market. Bank stocks are faltering ahead of their Q1 earnings results this week, while an analyst downgrade of Caterpillar (CAT 114.36, -10.65, -8.5%) weighs on the industrials group.Interestingly, the energy sector (-0.4%) trades lower despite a multinational agreement to cut oil production, while the consumer discretionary sector (+0.1%) bucks the broader trend amid strength in shares of Amazon (AMZN 2133.37, +90.61, +4.4%). Amazon is ramping up efforts to meet strong customer demand.Specifying the production agreement, OPEC and other non-OPEC members agreed to cut production by 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, which will then taper to 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31 and 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022. WTI crude futures are only up 1.8% to $23.16/bbl amid unresolved demand problems.Separately, talk has shifted to how the U.S. should proceed with reopening the economy, which could start to reopen as soon as May 1. The consensus is that less-infected parts of the country will get back to work before urban areas, but worries remain about potential mishaps. President Trump said earlier today that a coordinated decision with governors will be made "shortly."U.S. Treasuries have been relatively quiet today with the benchmark 10-yr yield currently down one basis point to 0.73%.

However, the influential sector has been able to stay ahead of the broader market, thanks to a show of relative strength from several chipmakers. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is down 0.3%, narrowing its April gain to 5.7%.The chipmaker group is resisting the bulk of the pressure that is weighing on the broader market, partly due to an understanding that the sudden shift toward remote work should increase demand for computers and other networking products. Intel (INTC 58.11, +0.97, +1.7%) CEO, Bob Swann, confirmed late last week that demand for the company's processors increased in Q1.Notable movers:AMD (AMD 49.46, +1.08, +2.2%): best performer in the group, trading near last week's high with its 50-day moving average (47.46) looming just below. Intel (INTC 58.11, +0.97, +1.7%): trading above its 50-day moving average (57.68) after the company's CEO confirmed higher demand in Q1.

Texas Instruments (TXN 106.78, -0.91, -0.9%): downgraded to Underweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley.10:43TALKX Market Briefing: Slipping on recovery edgeThe stock market is coming off its best week since 1974, so it will be forgiven somewhat for starting today's trading with a pullback edge. Every sector is down, except the energy sector (+0.1%) which is drawing support from a bump in oil prices ($23.32, +0.56, +2.5%) that has followed news of a production cut agreement.OPEC and other non-OPEC members said they would cut 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, then 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31, and then 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022. Some think the cut is still not enough to offset the demand destruction from COVID-19. That consideration, and underlying concerns about compliance, help explain why oil prices aren't popping more on the news.The stock market, meanwhile, is grappling with doubts about the pace and shape of the economic recovery in spite of the generous fiscal and monetary policy stimulus actions. That is giving way to broad-based selling interest led by the real estate (-3.8%), financial (-3.7%), utilities (-3.5%), industrials (-3.1%), and materials (-2.6%) sectors.Worries about the shape of things to come are also wrapped up in some angst tied to the Q1 earnings results that will be heard this week from the banks. In particular, market participants are bracing for sizable increases in loan-loss provisions that will weigh on full-year earnings potential.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%; the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 2.0%; and the Russell 2000 is down 2.7%.10:35JPM JPMorgan Chase First Quarter Earnings Preview (99.81 -2.92)JP Morgan (JPM) will report first quarter earnings tomorrow before the open. There is a conference call scheduled for 8:30. Q1 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.20 (-14% yr/yr) on revenue of $29.5 bln (+1% yr/yr). As its most recent investor day on February 25 (which occurred prior to COVID-19 related shutdowns), the company said it expected FY20 net interest income of $57 bln and FY21 of $60 bln or higher and FY20 net revenue build. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank will consider suspending dividend only during "extremely adverse conditions."JPM shares are down by over 25% from its highs as the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the banking industry. Banks like JPM are expected to see increased loan loss provisions due to coronavirus. In addition, lower interest rates spreads are expected to negatively impact probability.Looking back, the company beat on EPS and revenues every quarter since Q4 of 2018. Looking back at Q4, some encouraging takeaways from the report include. An 8.4% yr/yr increase in reported Q4 revenue, a 21% increase in net income, and a 30% yr/yr increase in EPS of $2.57, which handily topped the consensus estimate.JPM has a $305.0 bln valuation and trades at ~14 FY20 EPS estimates.Based on the weekly JPM Apr $100 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~7% in either direction by April expiration (Friday, April 17).10:14OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:MRO Apr 5 calls are seeing interest with 1520 contracts trading vs. open int of 7580, pushing implied vol up around 28 points to ~166%.

WTI crude is currently up $0.65, or 2.9%, at $23.41/bbl after enduring a volatile finish to last week.

The company has not yet calculated its tax rate for the first quarter and is not able to provide its preliminary net loss or loss per share, but anticipates valuation allowance adjustments against deferred-tax assets of about $0.9 billion.In March, Ford suspended its $0.6 billion regular quarterly dividend and antidilutive share repurchase program. Stone said the company is taking other steps to preserve cash, including by lowering operating costs, reducing capital expenditures and deferring portions of executive salaries. As of April 9, the company had about $30 billion in cash on its balance sheet, including$15.4 billion of proceeds from borrowings last month against two existing credit lines. Presently, only Ford's joint ventures in China, where coronavirus risks developed earlier and are now moderating, are producing and wholesaling vehicles. The company is considering a scenario for a phased restart of its manufacturing plants, supply network and other dependent functions beginning in the second quarter, with enhanced safety standards in place to protect workers.

[Co's guidance was $350-370 mln in revenues. Q1 Capital IQ consensus calls for revenue of $358.2 mln.] While the business was trending at or above the high end of our guidance range for the first 10 weeks of the quarter, like most businesses, we experienced a swift change in customer behavior in the middle of March when the pandemic took hold across the country." "Initially, we observed a decrease in orders across our entire business as the news upended typical routines and there was considerable uncertainty about what day-to-day life would be like. In particular, our corporate business, which accounted for a mid-single digit percentage of our orders in the fourth quarter, was dramatically impacted in mid-March as virtually all of our corporate clients shifted to work-from-home models.""Exiting the first quarter and in the beginning of the second quarter, we have seen trends improve significantly -- so far in April our overall year-over-year DAG growth has been approximately 10%. In markets less affected by the outbreak, diner ordering has returned to, and in many cases exceeded, our pre-COVID-19 expectations. We are also seeing record numbers of new diners and new restaurants on the platform.""While we are confident we could generate meaningful profits in the second quarter that would keep us comfortably on the previously announced path to deliver at least $100 million of Adjusted EBITDA in 2020, we are instead planning to reinvest most of the profits we expect to generate during the second quarter into programs that directly drive more business to our restaurant partners. [...] As a result, we plan to intentionally manage the business to approximately $5 million of Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter to continue to support our ecosystem. To be clear, this is a completely discretionary short-term business decision designed to support our industry. We are proud that our consistent profitability, highly variable cost structure and strong balance sheet afford us ample liquidity (approximately $600 million as of March 31, including $175 million we added from our revolver) and flexibility during times like these." "We are confident that our ability to manage our business profitably while competing aggressively has not changed, but because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of when and how the COVID-19 outbreak will resolve, we believe it's prudent to withdraw our full year 2020 revenue and EBITDA guidance."09:05GLRE Greenlight Capital reports prelim Q1 results (6.42 )The company expects its results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 to reflect:A net loss of $38 million to $43 million or ($1.05) to ($1.19) per fully diluted share.Net premiums written of $107 million to $112 millionNet premiums earned of $109 million to $114 millionThe company expects a fully diluted book value per share as of March 31, 2020 of $11.56 to $11.69.09:04EBAY eBay names Jamie Iannone CEO, effective April 27 (33.83 )Most recently Mr. Iannone was Chief Operating Officer of Walmart eCommerce (WMT).

Since co believes the pandemic will have a continuing negative impact on co for 2020, it does not expect to be able to achieve the 2020 financial results targeted in guidance provided in January of 2020.

This transition combined with a strong balance sheet has allowed the company to avoid any meaningful deterioration of its liquidity position resulting from the COVID-19 crisis at this time.DaVita commends the swift and bold action by the federal government through HHS to support healthcare providers, like DaVita, in this time of crisis. While the details of the program have not been announced, the expressed intent of the CARES Act is to help defray the significant healthcare-related expenses and lost revenue attributable to COVID-19. DaVita expects that the short-term financial impact of COVID-19 resulting from its increased costs, lost revenue and its increase in the treatment of the uninsured, may be offset by the CARES Act payment DaVita received of approximately $ 240 million.Because of the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, DaVita's future results could vary materially from the guidance we have provided. DaVita believes the long-term impact of COVID-19 will be primarily driven by the severity and duration of the pandemic, the pandemic's impact on the U.S. and global economies and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses.06:04JELD JELD-WEN: Steves wins preliminary injunction against JELD in new lawsuit, requiring JELD to comply with Doorskin supply agreement (11.53 )Judge cited "substantial likelihood, amounting to a near certainty, that steves will succeed on the merits" at trial.In the first suit filed in June 2016, Steves claimed that JELD-WEN violated the federal antitrust laws in 2012 when it merged with a competitor.

The S&P 500 gained 1.5%, extending this week's advance to 12.1% while the Nasdaq (+0.8%) underperformed but still gained 10.6% for the week.The market climbed out of the gate after the release of another horrific weekly initial claims report was masked by news of more unprecedented action from the Fed to help none of the 16 million people who got fired over the past three weeks. Of course, the Fed would protest that direct support is not in its mandate, but neither is the ability to purchase junk bond ETFs or collateralized debt obligations, which can now be acquired by the Fed. The central bank also added another $2.30 trln in emergency lending capacity for businesses and municipalities. Fed Chairman, Jay Powell, said that the central bank will continue using its powers forcefully, proactively, and aggressively.In Europe, the Bank of England announced that it will begin directly financing the U.K.'s fiscal needs while German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, rejected Italy's demand for the issuance of joint euro debt.Also of note, the Japanese government will reportedly spend up to $2.20 bln to help Japanese manufacturers move their production facilities out of China.Equities backpedaled from their highs in the afternoon, but ten out of eleven sectors were able to finish in the green.

That volatility followed conflicting headlines from the OPEC+ meeting, where producers struggled to agree to a large output cut.

Crude oil ended the day lower by $2.30, or 9.1%, at $22.87/bbl.Treasuries finished near their highs, sending the 10-yr yield lower by four basis points to 0.73%.The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.6% to 99.50, widening this week's loss to 1.0%.Reviewing today's economic data:It was another dismal initial claims report, with 6.606 million jobless claims filed for the week ending April 4 (Briefing.com consensus 5.000 million), bringing the three-week total to 13,476,307 after revisions. Continuing claims for the week ending March 28 hit a record high 7.455 millionThe key takeaway from the jobless claims data is that the number of filings is simply astounding and a true sign of the vast impact of the sudden economic stop.

This preliminary estimate predominantly reflects VASCEPA sales in the United States. Co also says cash/investments were more than $620 million and less than $50 million remained due on its royalty-like debt instrument.16:49ROKU Roku sees Q1 revs above consensus but withdraws 2020 outlook due to COVID-19 uncertainty (96.56 +4.11)Co sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $307-317 mln vs. $299.88 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; Adjusted EBITDA of ($23)-(18) mln; and other metrics generally in-line with prior outlook.

While there are a few pockets of strength such as the utilities and government verticals, several industries, such as entertainment, automotive and aerospace, are being negatively impacted. We believe that we can continue to generate cash even as revenue declines due to the immediate cost reduction and working capital management actions we are taking combined with the results of our Blueprint for Growth strategy. Our strategy enabled us to simplify the business during the last few years through the 80/20 Process, reduce our cost structure and improve efficiencies.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4%, and the Russell 2000 fell 2.8%.There wasn't much conviction in today's session ahead of the Q1 earnings reports from the leading U.S. banks this week. Perhaps some skittishness regarding the loan-loss reserves these banks are accruing contributed to the influential drag from the S&P 500 financials sector (-3.6%).Sellers were kept in check, though, as stocks drifted sideways for most of the session and closed well off intraday lows after a brief tumble after the open. The S&P 500 real estate sector (-4.6%) declined the most, while the consumer discretionary sector (+1.1%) finished comfortably in positive territory.Interestingly, a multinational agreement to cut oil production was unable to stir much enthusiasm within the energy sector (-0.4%). Specifically, OPEC and other non-OPEC members agreed to cut production by 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, then 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31, and then 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022.WTI crude futures struggled for direction and ultimately settled the session down 2.0%, or $0.45, to $22.42/bbl, suggesting that investors were not convinced that the production cuts alone would save an industry still facing demand problems caused by COVID-19. The economy is expected to gradually reopen in May, but the speed and scope of a recovery remained uncertain.Investors' appetite for growth, meanwhile, continued to lead buyers toward technology companies, including Amazon (AMZN 2168.87, +126.11, +6.2%), Apple (AAPL 273.25, +5.26, +2.0%), and Netflix (NFLX 396.72, +26.00, +7.0%). Amazon stepped up efforts to meet strong customer demand, while Netflix benefited from a positive note in Barron's.Separately, shares of Caterpillar (CAT 114.14, -10.89, -8.7%) dropped nearly 9% after the stock was downgraded to Underperform from Neutral at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.U.S. Treasuries ended the quiet session on a lower note. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.23%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 0.75%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 99.42.Investors did not receive any economic data on Monday. Looking ahead, investors will receive Import and Export Prices for March on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite -8.7% YTDS&P 500 -14.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -18.0% YTDRussell 2000 -27.4% YTD16:17XENT Intersect ENT issues downside Q1 revs guidance and withdraws 2020 guidance; taken pre-emptive actions to curtail spending (11.76 +0.03)Co sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $19.5-19.8 mln vs. $26.53 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. "Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, our efforts to enhance commercial execution and improve market access infrastructure were beginning to yield benefits as our first quarter 2020 sales were tracking to prior year and in-line with our expectations. However, sales trailed off throughout March as the various COVID-19 restrictions were implemented. While our business has and will be impacted by hospitals suspending elective surgical procedures and reduced ENT office visits, we are maintaining our customer-focus and taking the necessary actions to maintain continuity.

Treasuries started the cash session on a modestly lower note after overnight action saw a weak start from Asian markets while European indices remained closed for Easter. The coronavirus situation continued improving in closely watched places like New York, which supported the growing belief that parts of the U.S. economy will begin reopening soon. However, Minneapolis Fed President, Neel Kashkari, who appeared on CBS on Sunday, had a different view, saying that he expects 18 months of rolling shutdowns unless a medical breakthrough takes place. Meanwhile, Fed Vice Chair, Richard Clarida, acknowledged this morning that the coronavirus will have a disinflationary impact, but he said that the Fed has tools to avoid deflation. Treasuries began the day with modest losses and the 10-yr note remained near its starting level until the close. The long bond underperformed, finishing near its morning low, while shorter tenors underperformed intraday, but narrowed their losses ahead of the close. Gold had another good day, climbing to a level not seen since October 2012. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.2% to 99.37.

[...] This has in turn significantly reduced global economic activity and resulted in airlines dramatically cutting back on flights and a decrease in motor vehicle use at a time when seasonal driving patterns typically result in an increase of consumer demand for gasoline. As a result, there has also been a decline in the demand for, and thus also the market prices of, crude oil and certain of our products, particularly our refined petroleum products and most notably gasoline and jet fuel.""In addition, recent events concerning the dispute over production levels between Russia and the members of [OPEC], particularly Saudi Arabia, [...] have exacerbated the decline in crude oil prices and have contributed to an increase in crude oil price volatility.""The decrease in the demand for refined petroleum products coupled with the decline in the price of crude oil has resulted in a significant decrease in the price of the refined petroleum products manufactured by our refining segment. Because ethanol is primarily blended into gasoline, ethanol demand has declined along with the decline in the demand for gasoline, and the price of the products manufactured by our ethanol segment have also decreased. Essential businesses [...] continue to operate, blunting the decrease in the demand for diesel. Demand for renewable diesel is consistent with the demand for diesel as a whole; therefore, our renewable diesel segment has not been impacted as significantly as our refining and ethanol segments.""In late March and through early April 2020, we started reducing the amount of crude oil processed at most of our refineries in response to the decreased demand for our products, we temporarily idled various gasoline-making units at certain of our refineries to further limit gasoline production, and we took measures to reduce jet fuel production. We also temporarily idled eight of our ethanol plants, and we reduced the amount of corn feedstock processed at our remaining six ethanol plants to address the decreased demand for ethanol.""We expect to defer or delay certain capital expenditures which we had expected to make in 2020 related to our refining and ethanol segments. [...] We have not purchased any shares of our common stock since mid-March 2020, and will evaluate the timing of repurchases when appropriate.""Furthermore, as a result of the uncertainties concerning COVID-19 and global oil markets, we have withdrawn our prior financial and operational guidance with respect to the first quarter 2020 and fiscal year 2020 and such prior guidance should no longer be relied on."Co issues guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $20.1-22.2 bln vs. $17.76 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Net loss attributable to Valero Energy stockholders is expected to be $(2.1)-(1.83) bln.14:32COMDX Energy Settlement PricesMay Crude Oil futures fell $0.03 (-0.13%) to $22.73/barrel May Natural Gas $0.03 lower (-1.67%) at $1.704/MMBtu May RBOB Gasoline settled $0.03 higher (4.24%) at $0.706/gallon May Heating oil futures settled $0.03 higher (3.18%) at $1.0035/gallon13:57SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/ Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: noneTomorrow Morning: CONN FAST FRC INFY JNJ JPM OGI WFC13:44XLRE Sector Briefing: Real Estate (34.00 -1.53)Ten sectors trade in negative territory this afternoon, with the real estate sector (-4.6%) sitting at the bottom of the leaderboard.Real estate has been among the hardest hit sectors during the market's recent bout with historical volatility.

During its Q4 report in January, the company guided for 2020, estimating that reported adjusted EPS for 2020 will be between $8.95-9.10 and that operational sales will increase 4.5-5.5% yr/yr to $85.8-86.6 bln. S&P Capital IQ consensus now calls for EPS of $8.17 and revenues of $79.80 bln for the current fiscal year. The company does not typically issue guidance on a quarterly basis. In the last four quarters, Johnson & Johnson topped expectations for EPS four times while issuing generally in-line or upside revenues in each quarter; revenues for Q4 were slightly below consensus, impacted by a deceleration in sales growth for the company's largest segment, Pharmaceutical, and by a decline in Baby Care products globally within the Consumer segment. The company commented in mid-March that its supply chain was holding steady amid COVID-19 disruptions and that it was taking measures to maximize the availability of its over-the-counter medicine portfolio during the crisis. Meanwhile, the company's Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies unit has been engaged in attempting to combat the outbreak by collaborating with BARDA and other agencies to fund and conduct vaccine research, development, and clinical testing; at the end of March, it announced that it had selected a lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate and that it expected to initiate human clinical studies of the candidate by September at latest.JNJ has a market cap of circa $365 bln and trades at roughly 17x forward earnings estimates.

Bank stocks are faltering ahead of their Q1 earnings results this week, while an analyst downgrade of Caterpillar (CAT 114.36, -10.65, -8.5%) weighs on the industrials group.Interestingly, the energy sector (-0.4%) trades lower despite a multinational agreement to cut oil production, while the consumer discretionary sector (+0.1%) bucks the broader trend amid strength in shares of Amazon (AMZN 2133.37, +90.61, +4.4%). Amazon is ramping up efforts to meet strong customer demand.Specifying the production agreement, OPEC and other non-OPEC members agreed to cut production by 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, which will then taper to 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31 and 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022. WTI crude futures are only up 1.8% to $23.16/bbl amid unresolved demand problems.Separately, talk has shifted to how the U.S. should proceed with reopening the economy, which could start to reopen as soon as May 1. The consensus is that less-infected parts of the country will get back to work before urban areas, but worries remain about potential mishaps. President Trump said earlier today that a coordinated decision with governors will be made "shortly."U.S. Treasuries have been relatively quiet today with the benchmark 10-yr yield currently down one basis point to 0.73%.

However, the influential sector has been able to stay ahead of the broader market, thanks to a show of relative strength from several chipmakers. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is down 0.3%, narrowing its April gain to 5.7%.The chipmaker group is resisting the bulk of the pressure that is weighing on the broader market, partly due to an understanding that the sudden shift toward remote work should increase demand for computers and other networking products.

Every sector is down, except the energy sector (+0.1%) which is drawing support from a bump in oil prices ($23.32, +0.56, +2.5%) that has followed news of a production cut agreement.OPEC and other non-OPEC members said they would cut 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, then 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31, and then 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022. Some think the cut is still not enough to offset the demand destruction from COVID-19. That consideration, and underlying concerns about compliance, help explain why oil prices aren't popping more on the news.The stock market, meanwhile, is grappling with doubts about the pace and shape of the economic recovery in spite of the generous fiscal and monetary policy stimulus actions. That is giving way to broad-based selling interest led by the real estate (-3.8%), financial (-3.7%), utilities (-3.5%), industrials (-3.1%), and materials (-2.6%) sectors.Worries about the shape of things to come are also wrapped up in some angst tied to the Q1 earnings results that will be heard this week from the banks. In particular, market participants are bracing for sizable increases in loan-loss provisions that will weigh on full-year earnings potential.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%; the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 2.0%; and the Russell 2000 is down 2.7%.10:35JPM JPMorgan Chase First Quarter Earnings Preview (99.81 -2.92)JP Morgan (JPM) will report first quarter earnings tomorrow before the open. There is a conference call scheduled for 8:30. Q1 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.20 (-14% yr/yr) on revenue of $29.5 bln (+1% yr/yr). As its most recent investor day on February 25 (which occurred prior to COVID-19 related shutdowns), the company said it expected FY20 net interest income of $57 bln and FY21 of $60 bln or higher and FY20 net revenue build. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank will consider suspending dividend only during "extremely adverse conditions."JPM shares are down by over 25% from its highs as the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the banking industry. Banks like JPM are expected to see increased loan loss provisions due to coronavirus. In addition, lower interest rates spreads are expected to negatively impact probability.Looking back, the company beat on EPS and revenues every quarter since Q4 of 2018. Looking back at Q4, some encouraging takeaways from the report include. An 8.4% yr/yr increase in reported Q4 revenue, a 21% increase in net income, and a 30% yr/yr increase in EPS of $2.57, which handily topped the consensus estimate.JPM has a $305.0 bln valuation and trades at ~14 FY20 EPS estimates.Based on the weekly JPM Apr $100 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~7% in either direction by April expiration (Friday, April 17).10:14OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:MRO Apr 5 calls are seeing interest with 1520 contracts trading vs. open int of 7580, pushing implied vol up around 28 points to ~166%.

The group has already gained 17.6% since the end of March, which puts the sector well ahead of its peers.The growth-sensitive group outperforms today thanks to a rally in crude oil. WTI crude is currently up $0.65, or 2.9%, at $23.41/bbl after enduring a volatile finish to last week. Today's advance follows news of an OPEC+ agreement to reduce oil output between May 1 and June 30 by 9.7 mln barrels per day.Notable movers:Marathon Oil (MRO 4.39, +0.27, +6.7%) Cabot Oil & Gas (COG 19.92, +1.04, +5.5%)Apache (APA 8.62, +0.64, +5.2%) Cimarex (XEC 18.66, +0.70, +3.8%) Devon Energy (DVN 10.02, +0.35, +3.5%) National Oilwell Varco (NOV 12.01, +0.41, +3.5%) Pioneer Resources (PXD 77.98, +2.50, +3.3%)09:42F Ford Motor sees Q1 revs above consensus; is considering a scenario for a phased restart of its manufacturing plants, supply network and other dependent functions beginning in Q2 (5.11 )Co issues upside guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $34 bln vs. $31.87 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.He added that Ford's first-quarter vehicle wholesales were down 21 percent from a year ago, largely as a result of lower production and demand related to the coronavirus. Ford currently expects to report revenue of about $34 billion and first-quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of about negative $0.6 billion, which excludes about $0.3 billion of special-item charges. The company has not yet calculated its tax rate for the first quarter and is not able to provide its preliminary net loss or loss per share, but anticipates valuation allowance adjustments against deferred-tax assets of about $0.9 billion.In March, Ford suspended its $0.6 billion regular quarterly dividend and antidilutive share repurchase program. Stone said the company is taking other steps to preserve cash, including by lowering operating costs, reducing capital expenditures and deferring portions of executive salaries. As of April 9, the company had about $30 billion in cash on its balance sheet, including$15.4 billion of proceeds from borrowings last month against two existing credit lines. Presently, only Ford's joint ventures in China, where coronavirus risks developed earlier and are now moderating, are producing and wholesaling vehicles. The company is considering a scenario for a phased restart of its manufacturing plants, supply network and other dependent functions beginning in the second quarter, with enhanced safety standards in place to protect workers. Any decisions on resumptions will be made in cooperation with local unions, suppliers, dealers and other stakeholders.09:42WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens session slightly lowerThe major indices start the session in negative territory with the S&P 500 down 0.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.2%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the energy sector (+0.9%) bucking the broader trend after OPEC+ and the U.S. agreed to cut oil production.

[Co's guidance was $350-370 mln in revenues. Q1 Capital IQ consensus calls for revenue of $358.2 mln.] While the business was trending at or above the high end of our guidance range for the first 10 weeks of the quarter, like most businesses, we experienced a swift change in customer behavior in the middle of March when the pandemic took hold across the country." "Initially, we observed a decrease in orders across our entire business as the news upended typical routines and there was considerable uncertainty about what day-to-day life would be like. In particular, our corporate business, which accounted for a mid-single digit percentage of our orders in the fourth quarter, was dramatically impacted in mid-March as virtually all of our corporate clients shifted to work-from-home models.""Exiting the first quarter and in the beginning of the second quarter, we have seen trends improve significantly -- so far in April our overall year-over-year DAG growth has been approximately 10%. In markets less affected by the outbreak, diner ordering has returned to, and in many cases exceeded, our pre-COVID-19 expectations. We are also seeing record numbers of new diners and new restaurants on the platform.""While we are confident we could generate meaningful profits in the second quarter that would keep us comfortably on the previously announced path to deliver at least $100 million of Adjusted EBITDA in 2020, we are instead planning to reinvest most of the profits we expect to generate during the second quarter into programs that directly drive more business to our restaurant partners. [...] As a result, we plan to intentionally manage the business to approximately $5 million of Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter to continue to support our ecosystem. To be clear, this is a completely discretionary short-term business decision designed to support our industry. We are proud that our consistent profitability, highly variable cost structure and strong balance sheet afford us ample liquidity (approximately $600 million as of March 31, including $175 million we added from our revolver) and flexibility during times like these." "We are confident that our ability to manage our business profitably while competing aggressively has not changed, but because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of when and how the COVID-19 outbreak will resolve, we believe it's prudent to withdraw our full year 2020 revenue and EBITDA guidance."09:05GLRE Greenlight Capital reports prelim Q1 results (6.42 )The company expects its results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 to reflect:A net loss of $38 million to $43 million or ($1.05) to ($1.19) per fully diluted share.Net premiums written of $107 million to $112 millionNet premiums earned of $109 million to $114 millionThe company expects a fully diluted book value per share as of March 31, 2020 of $11.56 to $11.69.09:04EBAY eBay names Jamie Iannone CEO, effective April 27 (33.83 )Most recently Mr. Iannone was Chief Operating Officer of Walmart eCommerce (WMT).

While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during this period has been significant in general, co believes that the first quarter 2020 results will not yet significantly reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic given that the quarantine in Mexico only began after the second week of March 2020. Co expects that results in the remainder of 2020 will likely be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the extent of the pandemic's impact dependent in part on how long quarantine and social distancing requirements and practices and resulting restrictions on the Mexican and international global economy remain in place. Since co believes the pandemic will have a continuing negative impact on co for 2020, it does not expect to be able to achieve the 2020 financial results targeted in guidance provided in January of 2020.

This transition combined with a strong balance sheet has allowed the company to avoid any meaningful deterioration of its liquidity position resulting from the COVID-19 crisis at this time.DaVita commends the swift and bold action by the federal government through HHS to support healthcare providers, like DaVita, in this time of crisis. While the details of the program have not been announced, the expressed intent of the CARES Act is to help defray the significant healthcare-related expenses and lost revenue attributable to COVID-19. DaVita expects that the short-term financial impact of COVID-19 resulting from its increased costs, lost revenue and its increase in the treatment of the uninsured, may be offset by the CARES Act payment DaVita received of approximately $ 240 million.Because of the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, DaVita's future results could vary materially from the guidance we have provided. DaVita believes the long-term impact of COVID-19 will be primarily driven by the severity and duration of the pandemic, the pandemic's impact on the U.S. and global economies and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses.06:04JELD JELD-WEN: Steves wins preliminary injunction against JELD in new lawsuit, requiring JELD to comply with Doorskin supply agreement (11.53 )Judge cited "substantial likelihood, amounting to a near certainty, that steves will succeed on the merits" at trial.In the first suit filed in June 2016, Steves claimed that JELD-WEN violated the federal antitrust laws in 2012 when it merged with a competitor.

The S&P 500 gained 1.5%, extending this week's advance to 12.1% while the Nasdaq (+0.8%) underperformed but still gained 10.6% for the week.The market climbed out of the gate after the release of another horrific weekly initial claims report was masked by news of more unprecedented action from the Fed to help none of the 16 million people who got fired over the past three weeks. Of course, the Fed would protest that direct support is not in its mandate, but neither is the ability to purchase junk bond ETFs or collateralized debt obligations, which can now be acquired by the Fed. The central bank also added another $2.30 trln in emergency lending capacity for businesses and municipalities. Fed Chairman, Jay Powell, said that the central bank will continue using its powers forcefully, proactively, and aggressively.In Europe, the Bank of England announced that it will begin directly financing the U.K.'s fiscal needs while German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, rejected Italy's demand for the issuance of joint euro debt.Also of note, the Japanese government will reportedly spend up to $2.20 bln to help Japanese manufacturers move their production facilities out of China.Equities backpedaled from their highs in the afternoon, but ten out of eleven sectors were able to finish in the green. The gains were paced by groups like financials (+5.2%), real estate (+5.2%), and utilities (+4.8%).The top-weighted technology sector (UNCH) lagged, which was also the case earlier in the week. The sector climbed 10.6% for the week while chipmakers also underperformed today. The PHLX Semiconductor Index lost 2.3%, narrowing this week's gain to 11.0%.Costco (COST 300.01, -5.96, -2.0%) reported a 12.1% jump in domestic comparable sales in March, but its stock finished lower since the market had already priced in strong March sales.The energy sector (-1.1%) turned negative in the afternoon amid volatility in crude oil. That volatility followed conflicting headlines from the OPEC+ meeting, where producers struggled to agree to a large output cut. The Wall Street Journal reported in the late afternoon that daily output in May and June will be reduced by ten million barrels. Crude oil ended the day lower by $2.30, or 9.1%, at $22.87/bbl.Treasuries finished near their highs, sending the 10-yr yield lower by four basis points to 0.73%.The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.6% to 99.50, widening this week's loss to 1.0%.Reviewing today's economic data:It was another dismal initial claims report, with 6.606 million jobless claims filed for the week ending April 4 (Briefing.com consensus 5.000 million), bringing the three-week total to 13,476,307 after revisions. Continuing claims for the week ending March 28 hit a record high 7.455 millionThe key takeaway from the jobless claims data is that the number of filings is simply astounding and a true sign of the vast impact of the sudden economic stop. Unfortunately, it likely still doesn't capture the fullness of the impact as it's reasonable to assume that the system for filing claims is overwhelmed and not facilitating every effort to file for jobless benefitsThe preliminary reading for the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index for April plummeted to 71.0 (Briefing.com consensus 79.3) from 89.1 in March.

Core PPI was up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus -0.1%) The key takeaway from the report is that it doesn't fully reflect the impact of the COVID-19 shutdown measures as the pricing date for the survey was March 10 Wholesale inventories decreased by 0.7% in February (Briefing.com consensus -0.4%) after decreasing a revised 0.6% (from -0.4%) in JanuaryThere is no data scheduled for Monday.Nasdaq Composite -9.1% YTD S&P 500 -13.7% YTD Dow Jones Industrial Average -16.9% YTD Russell 2000 -25.3% YTD16:20WCC Wesco: Anixter shareholders vote to approve previously-announced merger (26.47 +1.64)WCC provides update regarding its previously announced merger with Anixter (AXE).Earlier today, Anixter held a special meeting of stockholders; The merger was approved by approximately 99.42% of the votes cast at the special meeting, which represented approximately 82.26% of the total outstanding shares of Anixter common stock.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4%, and the Russell 2000 fell 2.8%.There wasn't much conviction in today's session ahead of the Q1 earnings reports from the leading U.S. banks this week. Perhaps some skittishness regarding the loan-loss reserves these banks are accruing contributed to the influential drag from the S&P 500 financials sector (-3.6%).Sellers were kept in check, though, as stocks drifted sideways for most of the session and closed well off intraday lows after a brief tumble after the open. The S&P 500 real estate sector (-4.6%) declined the most, while the consumer discretionary sector (+1.1%) finished comfortably in positive territory.Interestingly, a multinational agreement to cut oil production was unable to stir much enthusiasm within the energy sector (-0.4%). Specifically, OPEC and other non-OPEC members agreed to cut production by 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, then 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31, and then 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022.WTI crude futures struggled for direction and ultimately settled the session down 2.0%, or $0.45, to $22.42/bbl, suggesting that investors were not convinced that the production cuts alone would save an industry still facing demand problems caused by COVID-19. The economy is expected to gradually reopen in May, but the speed and scope of a recovery remained uncertain.Investors' appetite for growth, meanwhile, continued to lead buyers toward technology companies, including Amazon (AMZN 2168.87, +126.11, +6.2%), Apple (AAPL 273.25, +5.26, +2.0%), and Netflix (NFLX 396.72, +26.00, +7.0%). Amazon stepped up efforts to meet strong customer demand, while Netflix benefited from a positive note in Barron's.Separately, shares of Caterpillar (CAT 114.14, -10.89, -8.7%) dropped nearly 9% after the stock was downgraded to Underperform from Neutral at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.U.S. Treasuries ended the quiet session on a lower note. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.23%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 0.75%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 99.42.Investors did not receive any economic data on Monday. Looking ahead, investors will receive Import and Export Prices for March on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite -8.7% YTDS&P 500 -14.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -18.0% YTDRussell 2000 -27.4% YTD16:17XENT Intersect ENT issues downside Q1 revs guidance and withdraws 2020 guidance; taken pre-emptive actions to curtail spending (11.76 +0.03)Co sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $19.5-19.8 mln vs. $26.53 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. "Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, our efforts to enhance commercial execution and improve market access infrastructure were beginning to yield benefits as our first quarter 2020 sales were tracking to prior year and in-line with our expectations. However, sales trailed off throughout March as the various COVID-19 restrictions were implemented. While our business has and will be impacted by hospitals suspending elective surgical procedures and reduced ENT office visits, we are maintaining our customer-focus and taking the necessary actions to maintain continuity. To that end, we proactively implemented initiatives to reduce costs, maintain liquidity and preserve our cash to enable us to navigate this challenge and return to growth." Due to the rapidly evolving environment and continued uncertainties resulting from the impact of COVID-19, the Company is withdrawing its previously announced annual guidance for 2020, which was issued on February 24, 2020. At this date, the Company cannot predict the extent or duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its financial and operating results, but believes current government policies, including the suspension of elective procedures worldwide, will substantially impact its revenues in the second quarter of 2020 and potentially longer. While the financial impact will certainly impact near term results, the Company believes the actions it has taken will enable it to maintain its ability to return to growth as the current crisis subsides.16:14STRL Sterling Construction was awarded "significant" projects and increases to the scope on existing projects totaling ~$100 million during Q1 2020 (9.03 -0.27)The site development projects included distribution centers for the e-commerce platform and retail grocers, a major children's hospital expansion and an industrial location.

Key secondary endpoints included overall survival and safety. The safety profile of tislelizumab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy was consistent with the known risks of each study treatment, and no new safety signals were identified.BeiGene plans to discuss its plans for filing a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for tislelizumab as a first-line treatment for non-squamous NSCLC with the Center for Drug Evaluation at the National Medical Products Administration in China and to present detailed data at upcoming medical conferences.16:12TMDX TransMedics Group guides Q1 revs slightly above consensus; withdraws 2020 guidance (14.51 -0.54)Co issues upside guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $7.4-7.5 mln vs. $6.87 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Co has taken preemptive measures to reduce near-term expenses, including reducing all non-essential discretionary expenses across the organization, and deferring a portion of executive and employee compensation.

"Prior to the impacts from COVID-19 spreading across the globe, FIS achieved strong revenue growth. As U.S. and foreign governmental authorities imposed social distancing, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders, spending declined, most notably in travel, restaurants, entertainment, and retail, resulting in a rapid deterioration in payments volume and transaction trends on a worldwide basis beginning in March, 2020 which adversely impacted revenue in our payments businesses that earn transaction based fees... We had previously projected revenue of $3,180 to $3,210 million during the first quarter of 2020, representing an increase of approximately 55% to 56% over the prior year period.

As a result of the Hartsville No. 10 machine conversion, Sonoco will be exiting the corrugated medium market by the end of 2021, and the expected efficiency of the converted machine will give the Company the opportunity to rationalize some of the higher cost assets in its mill system.15:58SCANX Large cap notable movers of interest -- Caterpillar (CAT) pulls back following analyst downgrade -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable large cap movers of interest ($10 bln - $200 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Large Cap GainersTSLA (648.33 +3.15%): Spikes to one-month highs.

Treasuries started the cash session on a modestly lower note after overnight action saw a weak start from Asian markets while European indices remained closed for Easter. The coronavirus situation continued improving in closely watched places like New York, which supported the growing belief that parts of the U.S. economy will begin reopening soon. However, Minneapolis Fed President, Neel Kashkari, who appeared on CBS on Sunday, had a different view, saying that he expects 18 months of rolling shutdowns unless a medical breakthrough takes place. Meanwhile, Fed Vice Chair, Richard Clarida, acknowledged this morning that the coronavirus will have a disinflationary impact, but he said that the Fed has tools to avoid deflation. Treasuries began the day with modest losses and the 10-yr note remained near its starting level until the close. The long bond underperformed, finishing near its morning low, while shorter tenors underperformed intraday, but narrowed their losses ahead of the close. Gold had another good day, climbing to a level not seen since October 2012. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.2% to 99.37.

[...] This has in turn significantly reduced global economic activity and resulted in airlines dramatically cutting back on flights and a decrease in motor vehicle use at a time when seasonal driving patterns typically result in an increase of consumer demand for gasoline. As a result, there has also been a decline in the demand for, and thus also the market prices of, crude oil and certain of our products, particularly our refined petroleum products and most notably gasoline and jet fuel.""In addition, recent events concerning the dispute over production levels between Russia and the members of [OPEC], particularly Saudi Arabia, [...] have exacerbated the decline in crude oil prices and have contributed to an increase in crude oil price volatility.""The decrease in the demand for refined petroleum products coupled with the decline in the price of crude oil has resulted in a significant decrease in the price of the refined petroleum products manufactured by our refining segment. Because ethanol is primarily blended into gasoline, ethanol demand has declined along with the decline in the demand for gasoline, and the price of the products manufactured by our ethanol segment have also decreased. Essential businesses [...] continue to operate, blunting the decrease in the demand for diesel. Demand for renewable diesel is consistent with the demand for diesel as a whole; therefore, our renewable diesel segment has not been impacted as significantly as our refining and ethanol segments.""In late March and through early April 2020, we started reducing the amount of crude oil processed at most of our refineries in response to the decreased demand for our products, we temporarily idled various gasoline-making units at certain of our refineries to further limit gasoline production, and we took measures to reduce jet fuel production. We also temporarily idled eight of our ethanol plants, and we reduced the amount of corn feedstock processed at our remaining six ethanol plants to address the decreased demand for ethanol.""We expect to defer or delay certain capital expenditures which we had expected to make in 2020 related to our refining and ethanol segments. [...] We have not purchased any shares of our common stock since mid-March 2020, and will evaluate the timing of repurchases when appropriate.""Furthermore, as a result of the uncertainties concerning COVID-19 and global oil markets, we have withdrawn our prior financial and operational guidance with respect to the first quarter 2020 and fiscal year 2020 and such prior guidance should no longer be relied on."Co issues guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $20.1-22.2 bln vs. $17.76 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Net loss attributable to Valero Energy stockholders is expected to be $(2.1)-(1.83) bln.14:32COMDX Energy Settlement PricesMay Crude Oil futures fell $0.03 (-0.13%) to $22.73/barrel May Natural Gas $0.03 lower (-1.67%) at $1.704/MMBtu May RBOB Gasoline settled $0.03 higher (4.24%) at $0.706/gallon May Heating oil futures settled $0.03 higher (3.18%) at $1.0035/gallon13:57SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/ Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: noneTomorrow Morning: CONN FAST FRC INFY JNJ JPM OGI WFC13:44XLRE Sector Briefing: Real Estate (34.00 -1.53)Ten sectors trade in negative territory this afternoon, with the real estate sector (-4.6%) sitting at the bottom of the leaderboard.Real estate has been among the hardest hit sectors during the market's recent bout with historical volatility.

During its Q4 report in January, the company guided for 2020, estimating that reported adjusted EPS for 2020 will be between $8.95-9.10 and that operational sales will increase 4.5-5.5% yr/yr to $85.8-86.6 bln. S&P Capital IQ consensus now calls for EPS of $8.17 and revenues of $79.80 bln for the current fiscal year. The company does not typically issue guidance on a quarterly basis. In the last four quarters, Johnson & Johnson topped expectations for EPS four times while issuing generally in-line or upside revenues in each quarter; revenues for Q4 were slightly below consensus, impacted by a deceleration in sales growth for the company's largest segment, Pharmaceutical, and by a decline in Baby Care products globally within the Consumer segment.

The S&P 500 is down 1.5% after being down 2.5% today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-1.7%) has followed a similar path, while the Nasdaq Composite outperforms with a 0.5% decline.From a sector perspective, the real estate sector (-4.0%) is down the most, but weakness in the financials (-3.2%) and industrials (-3.0%) sectors is having an influential drag on the broader market. Bank stocks are faltering ahead of their Q1 earnings results this week, while an analyst downgrade of Caterpillar (CAT 114.36, -10.65, -8.5%) weighs on the industrials group.Interestingly, the energy sector (-0.4%) trades lower despite a multinational agreement to cut oil production, while the consumer discretionary sector (+0.1%) bucks the broader trend amid strength in shares of Amazon (AMZN 2133.37, +90.61, +4.4%). Amazon is ramping up efforts to meet strong customer demand.Specifying the production agreement, OPEC and other non-OPEC members agreed to cut production by 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, which will then taper to 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31 and 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022. WTI crude futures are only up 1.8% to $23.16/bbl amid unresolved demand problems.Separately, talk has shifted to how the U.S. should proceed with reopening the economy, which could start to reopen as soon as May 1. The consensus is that less-infected parts of the country will get back to work before urban areas, but worries remain about potential mishaps. President Trump said earlier today that a coordinated decision with governors will be made "shortly."U.S. Treasuries have been relatively quiet today with the benchmark 10-yr yield currently down one basis point to 0.73%.

However, the influential sector has been able to stay ahead of the broader market, thanks to a show of relative strength from several chipmakers. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is down 0.3%, narrowing its April gain to 5.7%.The chipmaker group is resisting the bulk of the pressure that is weighing on the broader market, partly due to an understanding that the sudden shift toward remote work should increase demand for computers and other networking products.

Every sector is down, except the energy sector (+0.1%) which is drawing support from a bump in oil prices ($23.32, +0.56, +2.5%) that has followed news of a production cut agreement.OPEC and other non-OPEC members said they would cut 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, then 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31, and then 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022. Some think the cut is still not enough to offset the demand destruction from COVID-19. That consideration, and underlying concerns about compliance, help explain why oil prices aren't popping more on the news.The stock market, meanwhile, is grappling with doubts about the pace and shape of the economic recovery in spite of the generous fiscal and monetary policy stimulus actions. That is giving way to broad-based selling interest led by the real estate (-3.8%), financial (-3.7%), utilities (-3.5%), industrials (-3.1%), and materials (-2.6%) sectors.Worries about the shape of things to come are also wrapped up in some angst tied to the Q1 earnings results that will be heard this week from the banks. In particular, market participants are bracing for sizable increases in loan-loss provisions that will weigh on full-year earnings potential.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%; the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 2.0%; and the Russell 2000 is down 2.7%.10:35JPM JPMorgan Chase First Quarter Earnings Preview (99.81 -2.92)JP Morgan (JPM) will report first quarter earnings tomorrow before the open. There is a conference call scheduled for 8:30. Q1 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.20 (-14% yr/yr) on revenue of $29.5 bln (+1% yr/yr). As its most recent investor day on February 25 (which occurred prior to COVID-19 related shutdowns), the company said it expected FY20 net interest income of $57 bln and FY21 of $60 bln or higher and FY20 net revenue build. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank will consider suspending dividend only during "extremely adverse conditions."JPM shares are down by over 25% from its highs as the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the banking industry. Banks like JPM are expected to see increased loan loss provisions due to coronavirus. In addition, lower interest rates spreads are expected to negatively impact probability.Looking back, the company beat on EPS and revenues every quarter since Q4 of 2018. Looking back at Q4, some encouraging takeaways from the report include. An 8.4% yr/yr increase in reported Q4 revenue, a 21% increase in net income, and a 30% yr/yr increase in EPS of $2.57, which handily topped the consensus estimate.JPM has a $305.0 bln valuation and trades at ~14 FY20 EPS estimates.Based on the weekly JPM Apr $100 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~7% in either direction by April expiration (Friday, April 17).10:14OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:MRO Apr 5 calls are seeing interest with 1520 contracts trading vs. open int of 7580, pushing implied vol up around 28 points to ~166%.

The group has already gained 17.6% since the end of March, which puts the sector well ahead of its peers.The growth-sensitive group outperforms today thanks to a rally in crude oil. WTI crude is currently up $0.65, or 2.9%, at $23.41/bbl after enduring a volatile finish to last week. Today's advance follows news of an OPEC+ agreement to reduce oil output between May 1 and June 30 by 9.7 mln barrels per day.Notable movers:Marathon Oil (MRO 4.39, +0.27, +6.7%) Cabot Oil & Gas (COG 19.92, +1.04, +5.5%)Apache (APA 8.62, +0.64, +5.2%) Cimarex (XEC 18.66, +0.70, +3.8%) Devon Energy (DVN 10.02, +0.35, +3.5%) National Oilwell Varco (NOV 12.01, +0.41, +3.5%) Pioneer Resources (PXD 77.98, +2.50, +3.3%)09:42F Ford Motor sees Q1 revs above consensus; is considering a scenario for a phased restart of its manufacturing plants, supply network and other dependent functions beginning in Q2 (5.11 )Co issues upside guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $34 bln vs. $31.87 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.He added that Ford's first-quarter vehicle wholesales were down 21 percent from a year ago, largely as a result of lower production and demand related to the coronavirus. Ford currently expects to report revenue of about $34 billion and first-quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of about negative $0.6 billion, which excludes about $0.3 billion of special-item charges. The company has not yet calculated its tax rate for the first quarter and is not able to provide its preliminary net loss or loss per share, but anticipates valuation allowance adjustments against deferred-tax assets of about $0.9 billion.In March, Ford suspended its $0.6 billion regular quarterly dividend and antidilutive share repurchase program. Stone said the company is taking other steps to preserve cash, including by lowering operating costs, reducing capital expenditures and deferring portions of executive salaries. As of April 9, the company had about $30 billion in cash on its balance sheet, including$15.4 billion of proceeds from borrowings last month against two existing credit lines. Presently, only Ford's joint ventures in China, where coronavirus risks developed earlier and are now moderating, are producing and wholesaling vehicles. The company is considering a scenario for a phased restart of its manufacturing plants, supply network and other dependent functions beginning in the second quarter, with enhanced safety standards in place to protect workers. Any decisions on resumptions will be made in cooperation with local unions, suppliers, dealers and other stakeholders.09:42WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens session slightly lowerThe major indices start the session in negative territory with the S&P 500 down 0.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.2%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the energy sector (+0.9%) bucking the broader trend after OPEC+ and the U.S. agreed to cut oil production.

[Co's guidance was $350-370 mln in revenues. Q1 Capital IQ consensus calls for revenue of $358.2 mln.] While the business was trending at or above the high end of our guidance range for the first 10 weeks of the quarter, like most businesses, we experienced a swift change in customer behavior in the middle of March when the pandemic took hold across the country." "Initially, we observed a decrease in orders across our entire business as the news upended typical routines and there was considerable uncertainty about what day-to-day life would be like. In particular, our corporate business, which accounted for a mid-single digit percentage of our orders in the fourth quarter, was dramatically impacted in mid-March as virtually all of our corporate clients shifted to work-from-home models.""Exiting the first quarter and in the beginning of the second quarter, we have seen trends improve significantly -- so far in April our overall year-over-year DAG growth has been approximately 10%. In markets less affected by the outbreak, diner ordering has returned to, and in many cases exceeded, our pre-COVID-19 expectations. We are also seeing record numbers of new diners and new restaurants on the platform.""While we are confident we could generate meaningful profits in the second quarter that would keep us comfortably on the previously announced path to deliver at least $100 million of Adjusted EBITDA in 2020, we are instead planning to reinvest most of the profits we expect to generate during the second quarter into programs that directly drive more business to our restaurant partners. [...] As a result, we plan to intentionally manage the business to approximately $5 million of Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter to continue to support our ecosystem. To be clear, this is a completely discretionary short-term business decision designed to support our industry. We are proud that our consistent profitability, highly variable cost structure and strong balance sheet afford us ample liquidity (approximately $600 million as of March 31, including $175 million we added from our revolver) and flexibility during times like these." "We are confident that our ability to manage our business profitably while competing aggressively has not changed, but because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of when and how the COVID-19 outbreak will resolve, we believe it's prudent to withdraw our full year 2020 revenue and EBITDA guidance."09:05GLRE Greenlight Capital reports prelim Q1 results (6.42 )The company expects its results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 to reflect:A net loss of $38 million to $43 million or ($1.05) to ($1.19) per fully diluted share.Net premiums written of $107 million to $112 millionNet premiums earned of $109 million to $114 millionThe company expects a fully diluted book value per share as of March 31, 2020 of $11.56 to $11.69.09:04EBAY eBay names Jamie Iannone CEO, effective April 27 (33.83 )Most recently Mr. Iannone was Chief Operating Officer of Walmart eCommerce (WMT).

Given the difficultly in predicting how long this pandemic will persist and its full impact, we continue to look at all opportunities to preserve liquidity. This includes taking advantage of our vertically integrated business model to adjust production schedules to match current demand and tightly manage labor costs, including furloughing roughly 35% of our permanent workforce. We also have the ability to immediately adjust our significant discretionary online advertising spend in response to any changes in DTC trends as they develop. In addition to the previously announced cash compensation deferments for senior executives and directors of the board and 5% paid-in-kind interest deferral for the first two quarters of 2020 under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we are temporarily reducing our capital spend by delaying all non-maintenance related projects and investments in non-essential initiatives and headcount additions until we have better visibility into when conditions normalize. We believe the strength of our digital business, along with these cash-preserving efforts, combined with our cash balance of more than $26 million at March 31, 2020, will set us up to weather this crisis."07:33BDC Belden lowers Q1 EPS and revenue guidasnce (37.33 )Co issues lowered guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees EPS of $0.64-0.69 from $0.70-0.85 vs. $0.72 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $460-465 mln from $485-505 mln vs. $484.40 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus."Our first quarter results were tracking in line with our expectations through February, but some of our facilities, along with our customers and suppliers, are now experiencing varying levels of disruption related to the global pandemic.

DaVita expects that the short-term financial impact of COVID-19 resulting from its increased costs, lost revenue and its increase in the treatment of the uninsured, may be offset by the CARES Act payment DaVita received of approximately $ 240 million.Because of the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, DaVita's future results could vary materially from the guidance we have provided. DaVita believes the long-term impact of COVID-19 will be primarily driven by the severity and duration of the pandemic, the pandemic's impact on the U.S. and global economies and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses.06:04JELD JELD-WEN: Steves wins preliminary injunction against JELD in new lawsuit, requiring JELD to comply with Doorskin supply agreement (11.53 )Judge cited "substantial likelihood, amounting to a near certainty, that steves will succeed on the merits" at trial.In the first suit filed in June 2016, Steves claimed that JELD-WEN violated the federal antitrust laws in 2012 when it merged with a competitor.

The S&P 500 gained 1.5%, extending this week's advance to 12.1% while the Nasdaq (+0.8%) underperformed but still gained 10.6% for the week.The market climbed out of the gate after the release of another horrific weekly initial claims report was masked by news of more unprecedented action from the Fed to help none of the 16 million people who got fired over the past three weeks. Of course, the Fed would protest that direct support is not in its mandate, but neither is the ability to purchase junk bond ETFs or collateralized debt obligations, which can now be acquired by the Fed. The central bank also added another $2.30 trln in emergency lending capacity for businesses and municipalities. Fed Chairman, Jay Powell, said that the central bank will continue using its powers forcefully, proactively, and aggressively.In Europe, the Bank of England announced that it will begin directly financing the U.K.'s fiscal needs while German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, rejected Italy's demand for the issuance of joint euro debt.Also of note, the Japanese government will reportedly spend up to $2.20 bln to help Japanese manufacturers move their production facilities out of China.Equities backpedaled from their highs in the afternoon, but ten out of eleven sectors were able to finish in the green.

That volatility followed conflicting headlines from the OPEC+ meeting, where producers struggled to agree to a large output cut. The Wall Street Journal reported in the late afternoon that daily output in May and June will be reduced by ten million barrels. Crude oil ended the day lower by $2.30, or 9.1%, at $22.87/bbl.Treasuries finished near their highs, sending the 10-yr yield lower by four basis points to 0.73%.The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.6% to 99.50, widening this week's loss to 1.0%.Reviewing today's economic data:It was another dismal initial claims report, with 6.606 million jobless claims filed for the week ending April 4 (Briefing.com consensus 5.000 million), bringing the three-week total to 13,476,307 after revisions. Continuing claims for the week ending March 28 hit a record high 7.455 millionThe key takeaway from the jobless claims data is that the number of filings is simply astounding and a true sign of the vast impact of the sudden economic stop. Unfortunately, it likely still doesn't capture the fullness of the impact as it's reasonable to assume that the system for filing claims is overwhelmed and not facilitating every effort to file for jobless benefitsThe preliminary reading for the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index for April plummeted to 71.0 (Briefing.com consensus 79.3) from 89.1 in March.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4%, and the Russell 2000 fell 2.8%.There wasn't much conviction in today's session ahead of the Q1 earnings reports from the leading U.S. banks this week. Perhaps some skittishness regarding the loan-loss reserves these banks are accruing contributed to the influential drag from the S&P 500 financials sector (-3.6%).Sellers were kept in check, though, as stocks drifted sideways for most of the session and closed well off intraday lows after a brief tumble after the open. The S&P 500 real estate sector (-4.6%) declined the most, while the consumer discretionary sector (+1.1%) finished comfortably in positive territory.Interestingly, a multinational agreement to cut oil production was unable to stir much enthusiasm within the energy sector (-0.4%). Specifically, OPEC and other non-OPEC members agreed to cut production by 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, then 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31, and then 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022.WTI crude futures struggled for direction and ultimately settled the session down 2.0%, or $0.45, to $22.42/bbl, suggesting that investors were not convinced that the production cuts alone would save an industry still facing demand problems caused by COVID-19. The economy is expected to gradually reopen in May, but the speed and scope of a recovery remained uncertain.Investors' appetite for growth, meanwhile, continued to lead buyers toward technology companies, including Amazon (AMZN 2168.87, +126.11, +6.2%), Apple (AAPL 273.25, +5.26, +2.0%), and Netflix (NFLX 396.72, +26.00, +7.0%). Amazon stepped up efforts to meet strong customer demand, while Netflix benefited from a positive note in Barron's.Separately, shares of Caterpillar (CAT 114.14, -10.89, -8.7%) dropped nearly 9% after the stock was downgraded to Underperform from Neutral at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.U.S. Treasuries ended the quiet session on a lower note. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.23%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 0.75%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 99.42.Investors did not receive any economic data on Monday. Looking ahead, investors will receive Import and Export Prices for March on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite -8.7% YTDS&P 500 -14.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -18.0% YTDRussell 2000 -27.4% YTD16:17XENT Intersect ENT issues downside Q1 revs guidance and withdraws 2020 guidance; taken pre-emptive actions to curtail spending (11.76 +0.03)Co sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $19.5-19.8 mln vs. $26.53 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. "Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, our efforts to enhance commercial execution and improve market access infrastructure were beginning to yield benefits as our first quarter 2020 sales were tracking to prior year and in-line with our expectations. However, sales trailed off throughout March as the various COVID-19 restrictions were implemented. While our business has and will be impacted by hospitals suspending elective surgical procedures and reduced ENT office visits, we are maintaining our customer-focus and taking the necessary actions to maintain continuity. To that end, we proactively implemented initiatives to reduce costs, maintain liquidity and preserve our cash to enable us to navigate this challenge and return to growth." Due to the rapidly evolving environment and continued uncertainties resulting from the impact of COVID-19, the Company is withdrawing its previously announced annual guidance for 2020, which was issued on February 24, 2020. At this date, the Company cannot predict the extent or duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its financial and operating results, but believes current government policies, including the suspension of elective procedures worldwide, will substantially impact its revenues in the second quarter of 2020 and potentially longer. While the financial impact will certainly impact near term results, the Company believes the actions it has taken will enable it to maintain its ability to return to growth as the current crisis subsides.16:14STRL Sterling Construction was awarded "significant" projects and increases to the scope on existing projects totaling ~$100 million during Q1 2020 (9.03 -0.27)The site development projects included distribution centers for the e-commerce platform and retail grocers, a major children's hospital expansion and an industrial location.

Treasuries started the cash session on a modestly lower note after overnight action saw a weak start from Asian markets while European indices remained closed for Easter. The coronavirus situation continued improving in closely watched places like New York, which supported the growing belief that parts of the U.S. economy will begin reopening soon. However, Minneapolis Fed President, Neel Kashkari, who appeared on CBS on Sunday, had a different view, saying that he expects 18 months of rolling shutdowns unless a medical breakthrough takes place. Meanwhile, Fed Vice Chair, Richard Clarida, acknowledged this morning that the coronavirus will have a disinflationary impact, but he said that the Fed has tools to avoid deflation. Treasuries began the day with modest losses and the 10-yr note remained near its starting level until the close. The long bond underperformed, finishing near its morning low, while shorter tenors underperformed intraday, but narrowed their losses ahead of the close. Gold had another good day, climbing to a level not seen since October 2012. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.2% to 99.37.

[...] This has in turn significantly reduced global economic activity and resulted in airlines dramatically cutting back on flights and a decrease in motor vehicle use at a time when seasonal driving patterns typically result in an increase of consumer demand for gasoline. As a result, there has also been a decline in the demand for, and thus also the market prices of, crude oil and certain of our products, particularly our refined petroleum products and most notably gasoline and jet fuel.""In addition, recent events concerning the dispute over production levels between Russia and the members of [OPEC], particularly Saudi Arabia, [...] have exacerbated the decline in crude oil prices and have contributed to an increase in crude oil price volatility.""The decrease in the demand for refined petroleum products coupled with the decline in the price of crude oil has resulted in a significant decrease in the price of the refined petroleum products manufactured by our refining segment. Because ethanol is primarily blended into gasoline, ethanol demand has declined along with the decline in the demand for gasoline, and the price of the products manufactured by our ethanol segment have also decreased. Essential businesses [...] continue to operate, blunting the decrease in the demand for diesel. Demand for renewable diesel is consistent with the demand for diesel as a whole; therefore, our renewable diesel segment has not been impacted as significantly as our refining and ethanol segments.""In late March and through early April 2020, we started reducing the amount of crude oil processed at most of our refineries in response to the decreased demand for our products, we temporarily idled various gasoline-making units at certain of our refineries to further limit gasoline production, and we took measures to reduce jet fuel production. We also temporarily idled eight of our ethanol plants, and we reduced the amount of corn feedstock processed at our remaining six ethanol plants to address the decreased demand for ethanol.""We expect to defer or delay certain capital expenditures which we had expected to make in 2020 related to our refining and ethanol segments. [...] We have not purchased any shares of our common stock since mid-March 2020, and will evaluate the timing of repurchases when appropriate.""Furthermore, as a result of the uncertainties concerning COVID-19 and global oil markets, we have withdrawn our prior financial and operational guidance with respect to the first quarter 2020 and fiscal year 2020 and such prior guidance should no longer be relied on."Co issues guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $20.1-22.2 bln vs. $17.76 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Net loss attributable to Valero Energy stockholders is expected to be $(2.1)-(1.83) bln.14:32COMDX Energy Settlement PricesMay Crude Oil futures fell $0.03 (-0.13%) to $22.73/barrel May Natural Gas $0.03 lower (-1.67%) at $1.704/MMBtu May RBOB Gasoline settled $0.03 higher (4.24%) at $0.706/gallon May Heating oil futures settled $0.03 higher (3.18%) at $1.0035/gallon13:57SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/ Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: noneTomorrow Morning: CONN FAST FRC INFY JNJ JPM OGI WFC13:44XLRE Sector Briefing: Real Estate (34.00 -1.53)Ten sectors trade in negative territory this afternoon, with the real estate sector (-4.6%) sitting at the bottom of the leaderboard.Real estate has been among the hardest hit sectors during the market's recent bout with historical volatility.

The energy sector shows relative leadership at this juncture, supported by a bump in oil prices that followed news that a multinational production cut agreement has been reached. Other energy industry names outperforming include ENLC, RTLR, NBLX... DRD (8.84 +19.78%): Surges to a new three-year high on above 3x average volume. Gold stocks generally see strength. (Related: NGD, SBSW...) ATHX (3.44 +18.11%): The FDA authorized co to initiate a Phase 2/3 study to assess the safety and efficacy of MultiStem therapy in subjects with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by the novel coronavirus disease; a new IND will not need to be filed for the program, and co plans to open the first clinical sites for recruitment of this MACOVIA study this quarter.Small Cap LosersSABR (5.55 -20.79%): Pulls back on more than 2x average volume, moderating last week's circa +63% gains. Among recent items, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority put out a notice late last week in which it announced that following an in-depth investigation, the CMA is blocking co's proposed takeover of Farelogix; per the CMA's statement, the CMA "found that Sabre's purchase of Farelogix could result in less innovation in their services, leading to fewer new features that may be released more slowly" and that such a purchase could also drive up fees for certain products, leaving "airlines, travel agents and UK passengers [...] worse off" as a result. The US District Court of Delaware had decided to clear the deal several days earlier. Mizuho commented in a note that it views the CMA's decision as a positive for co's shares, as it believes that the acquisition "would have significantly reduced SABR's financial flexibility at a crucial time"; Mizuho raised co's target to $5 from $3. AMC (2.09 -19.81%): Reports suggest that co is hiring a law firm to explore a potential bankruptcy filing. Hearing downgraded to Sell at B. Riley FBR. Sees continued volatility on above average volume. CYH (3.22 -16.58%): Pulls back after advancing by circa +37% last week.

During its Q4 report in January, the company guided for 2020, estimating that reported adjusted EPS for 2020 will be between $8.95-9.10 and that operational sales will increase 4.5-5.5% yr/yr to $85.8-86.6 bln. S&P Capital IQ consensus now calls for EPS of $8.17 and revenues of $79.80 bln for the current fiscal year. The company does not typically issue guidance on a quarterly basis. In the last four quarters, Johnson & Johnson topped expectations for EPS four times while issuing generally in-line or upside revenues in each quarter; revenues for Q4 were slightly below consensus, impacted by a deceleration in sales growth for the company's largest segment, Pharmaceutical, and by a decline in Baby Care products globally within the Consumer segment. The company commented in mid-March that its supply chain was holding steady amid COVID-19 disruptions and that it was taking measures to maximize the availability of its over-the-counter medicine portfolio during the crisis. Meanwhile, the company's Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies unit has been engaged in attempting to combat the outbreak by collaborating with BARDA and other agencies to fund and conduct vaccine research, development, and clinical testing; at the end of March, it announced that it had selected a lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate and that it expected to initiate human clinical studies of the candidate by September at latest.JNJ has a market cap of circa $365 bln and trades at roughly 17x forward earnings estimates. After experiencing significant volatility in recent weeks alongside the broader market, the stock currently trades lower by circa 7% since the company's Q4 earnings release in January.13:00SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (41.47 mln -14.4%)Industrials: GE (54.4 mln -3.85%), DAL (53.04 mln -6.6%), AAL (48.67 mln -7.59%), UAL (24.26 mln -7.29%)Consumer Discretionary: F (59.19 mln -5.59%), CCL (55.43 mln -7.25%), NIO (24.52 mln +9.37%), NCLH (23.48 mln -12.5%)Information Technology: AMD (39.17 mln +2.88%)Financials: MFA (46.41 mln -5.56%), BAC (39.43 mln -3.46%), SQQQ (37.68 mln +0.6%), TQQQ (29.52 mln -0.44%)Energy: CHK (74.64 mln -5.65%), MRO (36.98 mln +3.69%), OXY (30.5 mln -0.91%), ET (25.13 mln +3.87%), APA (24.82 mln +0.91%), CPE (24.12 mln -0.59%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: BCRX (2.65x +12.8%), NTRA (1.65x -8.38%), TXMD (1.64x -10.06%), MESO (1.34x -2.95%)Consumer Discretionary: NLS (3.91x +23.4%), AGS (1.47x -2.04%), TUP (1.46x -6.3%), NEW (1.37x +10.7%)Information Technology: DOMO (1.94x +16.98%), SABR (1.55x -23.14%)Financials: VRIG (2.04x -0.4%), VTIP (1.63x +0.18%), ESGE (1.53x -0.56%), MITT (1.47x -3.2%)Energy: FET (2.51x +16.91%), PVAC (1.63x +21.34%), SM (1.49x +19.43%), HLX (1.46x +3.64%), OIS (1.35x +15.98%)12:58SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: LXRX (2.14 +13.83%), BCRX (2.34 +12.8%)Materials: NGD (0.66 +12.59%)Consumer Discretionary: NLS (4.64 +23.4%), CVNA (70.6 +15.07%), GME (4.47 +14.91%), NEW (4.76 +10.7%)Information Technology: DOMO (13.71 +16.98%)Energy: ENBL (3.35 +23.62%), PVAC (3.81 +21.34%), SM (2.09 +19.43%), LPI (0.47 +18.73%), FET (0.27 +16.91%), ENLC (1.25 +16.82%), OIS (2.8 +15.98%), OMP (5.3 +11.81%), USAC (7.96 +11.71%), GPOR (0.72 +10.83%), BTU (3.7 +10.78%), NBLX (5.04 +10.77%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: CYH (3.23 -16.32%), ACB (0.75 -14.4%)Materials: VNTR (1.46 -13.39%)Industrials: WBT (4.46 -13.4%)Consumer Discretionary: EXPR (2.12 -17.83%), CCS (16.04 -15.4%), RCL (34.47 -14.31%), HZO (10.4 -13.88%), FOXF (43.47 -13.85%), EAT (14.92 -13.71%), LGIH (47.52 -13.19%), NCLH (11.47 -12.5%), KBH (19.75 -12.49%)Information Technology: SABR (5.38 -23.14%), BDC (32.66 -12.51%)Energy: FTSI (0.35 -17.36%), SDRL (0.76 -12.8%)12:56WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stocks trade lower midday, weakness in financial and industrial sectorsThe stock market is retracing some of its historic gains from last week, but the major indices are currently trading off session lows. The S&P 500 is down 1.5% after being down 2.5% today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-1.7%) has followed a similar path, while the Nasdaq Composite outperforms with a 0.5% decline.From a sector perspective, the real estate sector (-4.0%) is down the most, but weakness in the financials (-3.2%) and industrials (-3.0%) sectors is having an influential drag on the broader market. Bank stocks are faltering ahead of their Q1 earnings results this week, while an analyst downgrade of Caterpillar (CAT 114.36, -10.65, -8.5%) weighs on the industrials group.Interestingly, the energy sector (-0.4%) trades lower despite a multinational agreement to cut oil production, while the consumer discretionary sector (+0.1%) bucks the broader trend amid strength in shares of Amazon (AMZN 2133.37, +90.61, +4.4%). Amazon is ramping up efforts to meet strong customer demand.Specifying the production agreement, OPEC and other non-OPEC members agreed to cut production by 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, which will then taper to 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31 and 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022. WTI crude futures are only up 1.8% to $23.16/bbl amid unresolved demand problems.Separately, talk has shifted to how the U.S. should proceed with reopening the economy, which could start to reopen as soon as May 1. The consensus is that less-infected parts of the country will get back to work before urban areas, but worries remain about potential mishaps. President Trump said earlier today that a coordinated decision with governors will be made "shortly."U.S. Treasuries have been relatively quiet today with the benchmark 10-yr yield currently down one basis point to 0.73%.

However, the influential sector has been able to stay ahead of the broader market, thanks to a show of relative strength from several chipmakers. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is down 0.3%, narrowing its April gain to 5.7%.The chipmaker group is resisting the bulk of the pressure that is weighing on the broader market, partly due to an understanding that the sudden shift toward remote work should increase demand for computers and other networking products. Intel (INTC 58.11, +0.97, +1.7%) CEO, Bob Swann, confirmed late last week that demand for the company's processors increased in Q1.Notable movers:AMD (AMD 49.46, +1.08, +2.2%): best performer in the group, trading near last week's high with its 50-day moving average (47.46) looming just below.

Every sector is down, except the energy sector (+0.1%) which is drawing support from a bump in oil prices ($23.32, +0.56, +2.5%) that has followed news of a production cut agreement.OPEC and other non-OPEC members said they would cut 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, then 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31, and then 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022. Some think the cut is still not enough to offset the demand destruction from COVID-19. That consideration, and underlying concerns about compliance, help explain why oil prices aren't popping more on the news.The stock market, meanwhile, is grappling with doubts about the pace and shape of the economic recovery in spite of the generous fiscal and monetary policy stimulus actions. That is giving way to broad-based selling interest led by the real estate (-3.8%), financial (-3.7%), utilities (-3.5%), industrials (-3.1%), and materials (-2.6%) sectors.Worries about the shape of things to come are also wrapped up in some angst tied to the Q1 earnings results that will be heard this week from the banks. In particular, market participants are bracing for sizable increases in loan-loss provisions that will weigh on full-year earnings potential.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%; the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 2.0%; and the Russell 2000 is down 2.7%.10:35JPM JPMorgan Chase First Quarter Earnings Preview (99.81 -2.92)JP Morgan (JPM) will report first quarter earnings tomorrow before the open. There is a conference call scheduled for 8:30. Q1 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.20 (-14% yr/yr) on revenue of $29.5 bln (+1% yr/yr). As its most recent investor day on February 25 (which occurred prior to COVID-19 related shutdowns), the company said it expected FY20 net interest income of $57 bln and FY21 of $60 bln or higher and FY20 net revenue build. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank will consider suspending dividend only during "extremely adverse conditions."JPM shares are down by over 25% from its highs as the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the banking industry. Banks like JPM are expected to see increased loan loss provisions due to coronavirus. In addition, lower interest rates spreads are expected to negatively impact probability.Looking back, the company beat on EPS and revenues every quarter since Q4 of 2018. Looking back at Q4, some encouraging takeaways from the report include. An 8.4% yr/yr increase in reported Q4 revenue, a 21% increase in net income, and a 30% yr/yr increase in EPS of $2.57, which handily topped the consensus estimate.JPM has a $305.0 bln valuation and trades at ~14 FY20 EPS estimates.Based on the weekly JPM Apr $100 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~7% in either direction by April expiration (Friday, April 17).10:14OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:MRO Apr 5 calls are seeing interest with 1520 contracts trading vs. open int of 7580, pushing implied vol up around 28 points to ~166%.

The group has already gained 17.6% since the end of March, which puts the sector well ahead of its peers.The growth-sensitive group outperforms today thanks to a rally in crude oil. WTI crude is currently up $0.65, or 2.9%, at $23.41/bbl after enduring a volatile finish to last week. Today's advance follows news of an OPEC+ agreement to reduce oil output between May 1 and June 30 by 9.7 mln barrels per day.Notable movers:Marathon Oil (MRO 4.39, +0.27, +6.7%) Cabot Oil & Gas (COG 19.92, +1.04, +5.5%)Apache (APA 8.62, +0.64, +5.2%) Cimarex (XEC 18.66, +0.70, +3.8%) Devon Energy (DVN 10.02, +0.35, +3.5%) National Oilwell Varco (NOV 12.01, +0.41, +3.5%) Pioneer Resources (PXD 77.98, +2.50, +3.3%)09:42F Ford Motor sees Q1 revs above consensus; is considering a scenario for a phased restart of its manufacturing plants, supply network and other dependent functions beginning in Q2 (5.11 )Co issues upside guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $34 bln vs. $31.87 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.He added that Ford's first-quarter vehicle wholesales were down 21 percent from a year ago, largely as a result of lower production and demand related to the coronavirus. Ford currently expects to report revenue of about $34 billion and first-quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of about negative $0.6 billion, which excludes about $0.3 billion of special-item charges. The company has not yet calculated its tax rate for the first quarter and is not able to provide its preliminary net loss or loss per share, but anticipates valuation allowance adjustments against deferred-tax assets of about $0.9 billion.In March, Ford suspended its $0.6 billion regular quarterly dividend and antidilutive share repurchase program. Stone said the company is taking other steps to preserve cash, including by lowering operating costs, reducing capital expenditures and deferring portions of executive salaries. As of April 9, the company had about $30 billion in cash on its balance sheet, including$15.4 billion of proceeds from borrowings last month against two existing credit lines. Presently, only Ford's joint ventures in China, where coronavirus risks developed earlier and are now moderating, are producing and wholesaling vehicles. The company is considering a scenario for a phased restart of its manufacturing plants, supply network and other dependent functions beginning in the second quarter, with enhanced safety standards in place to protect workers. Any decisions on resumptions will be made in cooperation with local unions, suppliers, dealers and other stakeholders.09:42WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens session slightly lowerThe major indices start the session in negative territory with the S&P 500 down 0.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.2%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the energy sector (+0.9%) bucking the broader trend after OPEC+ and the U.S. agreed to cut oil production.

[Co's guidance was $350-370 mln in revenues. Q1 Capital IQ consensus calls for revenue of $358.2 mln.] While the business was trending at or above the high end of our guidance range for the first 10 weeks of the quarter, like most businesses, we experienced a swift change in customer behavior in the middle of March when the pandemic took hold across the country." "Initially, we observed a decrease in orders across our entire business as the news upended typical routines and there was considerable uncertainty about what day-to-day life would be like. In particular, our corporate business, which accounted for a mid-single digit percentage of our orders in the fourth quarter, was dramatically impacted in mid-March as virtually all of our corporate clients shifted to work-from-home models.""Exiting the first quarter and in the beginning of the second quarter, we have seen trends improve significantly -- so far in April our overall year-over-year DAG growth has been approximately 10%. In markets less affected by the outbreak, diner ordering has returned to, and in many cases exceeded, our pre-COVID-19 expectations. We are also seeing record numbers of new diners and new restaurants on the platform.""While we are confident we could generate meaningful profits in the second quarter that would keep us comfortably on the previously announced path to deliver at least $100 million of Adjusted EBITDA in 2020, we are instead planning to reinvest most of the profits we expect to generate during the second quarter into programs that directly drive more business to our restaurant partners. [...] As a result, we plan to intentionally manage the business to approximately $5 million of Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter to continue to support our ecosystem. To be clear, this is a completely discretionary short-term business decision designed to support our industry. We are proud that our consistent profitability, highly variable cost structure and strong balance sheet afford us ample liquidity (approximately $600 million as of March 31, including $175 million we added from our revolver) and flexibility during times like these." "We are confident that our ability to manage our business profitably while competing aggressively has not changed, but because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of when and how the COVID-19 outbreak will resolve, we believe it's prudent to withdraw our full year 2020 revenue and EBITDA guidance."09:05GLRE Greenlight Capital reports prelim Q1 results (6.42 )The company expects its results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 to reflect:A net loss of $38 million to $43 million or ($1.05) to ($1.19) per fully diluted share.Net premiums written of $107 million to $112 millionNet premiums earned of $109 million to $114 millionThe company expects a fully diluted book value per share as of March 31, 2020 of $11.56 to $11.69.09:04EBAY eBay names Jamie Iannone CEO, effective April 27 (33.83 )Most recently Mr. Iannone was Chief Operating Officer of Walmart eCommerce (WMT).

This includes taking advantage of our vertically integrated business model to adjust production schedules to match current demand and tightly manage labor costs, including furloughing roughly 35% of our permanent workforce. We also have the ability to immediately adjust our significant discretionary online advertising spend in response to any changes in DTC trends as they develop. In addition to the previously announced cash compensation deferments for senior executives and directors of the board and 5% paid-in-kind interest deferral for the first two quarters of 2020 under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we are temporarily reducing our capital spend by delaying all non-maintenance related projects and investments in non-essential initiatives and headcount additions until we have better visibility into when conditions normalize.

The majority of patients in this international cohort demonstrated clinical improvement and no new safety signals were identified with remdesivir treatment. Compassionate use data have limitations and multiple Phase 3 studies are ongoing to determine the safety and efficacy of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19. The detailed results of this analysis were published today in The New England Journal of Medicine. Remdesivir is not yet licensed or approved anywhere globally and has not been demonstrated to be safe or effective for the treatment of COVID-19. Nearly two thirds of patients (64 percent, n=34/53) in this cohort were on mechanical ventilation at baseline, including four patients also on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Treatment with remdesivir resulted in an improvement in oxygen support class for 68 percent of patients (n=36/53) over a median follow-up of 18 days from the first dose of remdesivir. More than half of patients on mechanical ventilation were extubated (57 percent, n=17/30) and nearly half of all patients (47 percent, n=25/53) were discharged from the hospital following treatment with remdesivir.06:14SRC Spirit Realty Capital sees AFFO above consensus (30.36 )Co issues upside guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees adjusted funds from operations of $0.77-0.79 vs. $0.74 S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Maintained strong operational performance, with occupancy of 99.4%, Lost Rent of 0.6% and Property Cost Leakage of 2.4%.

This transition combined with a strong balance sheet has allowed the company to avoid any meaningful deterioration of its liquidity position resulting from the COVID-19 crisis at this time.DaVita commends the swift and bold action by the federal government through HHS to support healthcare providers, like DaVita, in this time of crisis. While the details of the program have not been announced, the expressed intent of the CARES Act is to help defray the significant healthcare-related expenses and lost revenue attributable to COVID-19. DaVita expects that the short-term financial impact of COVID-19 resulting from its increased costs, lost revenue and its increase in the treatment of the uninsured, may be offset by the CARES Act payment DaVita received of approximately $ 240 million.Because of the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, DaVita's future results could vary materially from the guidance we have provided. DaVita believes the long-term impact of COVID-19 will be primarily driven by the severity and duration of the pandemic, the pandemic's impact on the U.S. and global economies and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses.06:04JELD JELD-WEN: Steves wins preliminary injunction against JELD in new lawsuit, requiring JELD to comply with Doorskin supply agreement (11.53 )Judge cited "substantial likelihood, amounting to a near certainty, that steves will succeed on the merits" at trial.In the first suit filed in June 2016, Steves claimed that JELD-WEN violated the federal antitrust laws in 2012 when it merged with a competitor.

While it is not clear how long this crisis will last, the impact it will have on consumer shopping behavior going forward, or how long it will take retailers to return to their traditional activities, we are committed to helping our retail partners meet the needs of those whom they serve every day.""As we outlined at our Investor Day in February, our recent growth had been very robust such that we were playing catch up to fulfill demand. With the onset of the COVID-19 global health crisis, our demand continued to accelerate as pet parents prioritized shopping for their pets' needs.

The S&P 500 gained 1.5%, extending this week's advance to 12.1% while the Nasdaq (+0.8%) underperformed but still gained 10.6% for the week.The market climbed out of the gate after the release of another horrific weekly initial claims report was masked by news of more unprecedented action from the Fed to help none of the 16 million people who got fired over the past three weeks. Of course, the Fed would protest that direct support is not in its mandate, but neither is the ability to purchase junk bond ETFs or collateralized debt obligations, which can now be acquired by the Fed. The central bank also added another $2.30 trln in emergency lending capacity for businesses and municipalities. Fed Chairman, Jay Powell, said that the central bank will continue using its powers forcefully, proactively, and aggressively.In Europe, the Bank of England announced that it will begin directly financing the U.K.'s fiscal needs while German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, rejected Italy's demand for the issuance of joint euro debt.Also of note, the Japanese government will reportedly spend up to $2.20 bln to help Japanese manufacturers move their production facilities out of China.Equities backpedaled from their highs in the afternoon, but ten out of eleven sectors were able to finish in the green.

That volatility followed conflicting headlines from the OPEC+ meeting, where producers struggled to agree to a large output cut.

Crude oil ended the day lower by $2.30, or 9.1%, at $22.87/bbl.Treasuries finished near their highs, sending the 10-yr yield lower by four basis points to 0.73%.The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.6% to 99.50, widening this week's loss to 1.0%.Reviewing today's economic data:It was another dismal initial claims report, with 6.606 million jobless claims filed for the week ending April 4 (Briefing.com consensus 5.000 million), bringing the three-week total to 13,476,307 after revisions. Continuing claims for the week ending March 28 hit a record high 7.455 millionThe key takeaway from the jobless claims data is that the number of filings is simply astounding and a true sign of the vast impact of the sudden economic stop. Unfortunately, it likely still doesn't capture the fullness of the impact as it's reasonable to assume that the system for filing claims is overwhelmed and not facilitating every effort to file for jobless benefitsThe preliminary reading for the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index for April plummeted to 71.0 (Briefing.com consensus 79.3) from 89.1 in March.

For Roku, this has resulted in an acceleration in new account growth and an increase in viewing.Roku ended the first quarter with an estimated $587 million of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments. This includes a $70 million draw-down from its revolving credit facility16:44DGX Quest Diagnostics provides update on impact of COVID-19 (86.43 -3.34)Excerpts from an email to colleagues from CEO and Chairman Steve Rusckowski include:"To date Quest has performed nearly 800,000 tests, or about 40% of all testing by commercial labs. We are now preparing to offer antibody blood testing to identify people who have been exposed and built immunity. However, as we reported on March 31, the increase in our COVID-19 testing has not nearly been enough to offset the significant reductions we have seen to Quest's overall testing volumes, which declined by more than 40% in the last two weeks of March.""My base pay as CEO will be reduced by 25% for the next 12 weeks, and each of the members of the company's Board of Directors will forgo 25% of their cash compensation over the same period. Quest exempt employees also will take a temporary pay cut for 12 weeks, ranging from 20% for the most senior executives down to 5%, depending on level.""Other temporary changes include [...] [a]pproving furloughs for employees with diminished work who have indicated interest to be at home [...]; to date, more than 4,000 colleagues, or 9% of our workforce, have been enrolled."

While there are a few pockets of strength such as the utilities and government verticals, several industries, such as entertainment, automotive and aerospace, are being negatively impacted. We believe that we can continue to generate cash even as revenue declines due to the immediate cost reduction and working capital management actions we are taking combined with the results of our Blueprint for Growth strategy. Our strategy enabled us to simplify the business during the last few years through the 80/20 Process, reduce our cost structure and improve efficiencies. We believe that we will be well positioned for the inevitable recovery when it comes. In the meantime, we are focused on optimizing our results in this current challenging environment."16:24AB AllianceBernstein reports that preliminary month-end assets under management decreased to $542 bln during March 2020 from $614 bln at the end of February (20.24 -1.72)The 11.7% decrease resulted predominantly from sharp market declines as well as net outflows from all three client channels -- Retail, Institutions, and Private Wealth.16:22INSP Inspire Medical Systems announces public offering of $75.0 mln of shares of its common stock (63.39 -1.22)16:20MTDR Matador Resources announces initial Rodney Robinson well results, improves hedging protection and provides operational update (3.38 +0.17)Key highlights of this release include the following: Rodney Robinson wells achieve Matador record 24-hour initial potential test results from all three formations tested and are expected to contribute 8 to 10% of Company's total production for the remainder of 2020; Restructured 2020 oil hedges now cover 75 to 80% of anticipated oil production at $35 per barrel or above for remainder of 2020; and Recent actions taken by Matador should save or cause the Company to receive a sum approaching $340 million in 2020, as compared to its original 2020 estimates, including reductions of $250 million in capital expenditures for drilling, completing and equipping well and $40 million in operating expenses, in particular lease operating and general and administrative expenses.16:19SWIR Sierra Wireless appoints Samuel Cochrane as CFO, effective May 6 (6.92 +0.29)Samuel Cochrane will join as CFO starting May 6.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4%, and the Russell 2000 fell 2.8%.There wasn't much conviction in today's session ahead of the Q1 earnings reports from the leading U.S. banks this week. Perhaps some skittishness regarding the loan-loss reserves these banks are accruing contributed to the influential drag from the S&P 500 financials sector (-3.6%).Sellers were kept in check, though, as stocks drifted sideways for most of the session and closed well off intraday lows after a brief tumble after the open. The S&P 500 real estate sector (-4.6%) declined the most, while the consumer discretionary sector (+1.1%) finished comfortably in positive territory.Interestingly, a multinational agreement to cut oil production was unable to stir much enthusiasm within the energy sector (-0.4%). Specifically, OPEC and other non-OPEC members agreed to cut production by 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, then 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31, and then 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022.WTI crude futures struggled for direction and ultimately settled the session down 2.0%, or $0.45, to $22.42/bbl, suggesting that investors were not convinced that the production cuts alone would save an industry still facing demand problems caused by COVID-19. The economy is expected to gradually reopen in May, but the speed and scope of a recovery remained uncertain.Investors' appetite for growth, meanwhile, continued to lead buyers toward technology companies, including Amazon (AMZN 2168.87, +126.11, +6.2%), Apple (AAPL 273.25, +5.26, +2.0%), and Netflix (NFLX 396.72, +26.00, +7.0%). Amazon stepped up efforts to meet strong customer demand, while Netflix benefited from a positive note in Barron's.Separately, shares of Caterpillar (CAT 114.14, -10.89, -8.7%) dropped nearly 9% after the stock was downgraded to Underperform from Neutral at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.U.S. Treasuries ended the quiet session on a lower note. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.23%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 0.75%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 99.42.Investors did not receive any economic data on Monday.

"Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, our efforts to enhance commercial execution and improve market access infrastructure were beginning to yield benefits as our first quarter 2020 sales were tracking to prior year and in-line with our expectations. However, sales trailed off throughout March as the various COVID-19 restrictions were implemented. While our business has and will be impacted by hospitals suspending elective surgical procedures and reduced ENT office visits, we are maintaining our customer-focus and taking the necessary actions to maintain continuity. To that end, we proactively implemented initiatives to reduce costs, maintain liquidity and preserve our cash to enable us to navigate this challenge and return to growth." Due to the rapidly evolving environment and continued uncertainties resulting from the impact of COVID-19, the Company is withdrawing its previously announced annual guidance for 2020, which was issued on February 24, 2020. At this date, the Company cannot predict the extent or duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its financial and operating results, but believes current government policies, including the suspension of elective procedures worldwide, will substantially impact its revenues in the second quarter of 2020 and potentially longer. While the financial impact will certainly impact near term results, the Company believes the actions it has taken will enable it to maintain its ability to return to growth as the current crisis subsides.16:14STRL Sterling Construction was awarded "significant" projects and increases to the scope on existing projects totaling ~$100 million during Q1 2020 (9.03 -0.27)The site development projects included distribution centers for the e-commerce platform and retail grocers, a major children's hospital expansion and an industrial location.

"Prior to the impacts from COVID-19 spreading across the globe, FIS achieved strong revenue growth. As U.S. and foreign governmental authorities imposed social distancing, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders, spending declined, most notably in travel, restaurants, entertainment, and retail, resulting in a rapid deterioration in payments volume and transaction trends on a worldwide basis beginning in March, 2020 which adversely impacted revenue in our payments businesses that earn transaction based fees... We had previously projected revenue of $3,180 to $3,210 million during the first quarter of 2020, representing an increase of approximately 55% to 56% over the prior year period.

As a result of the Hartsville No. 10 machine conversion, Sonoco will be exiting the corrugated medium market by the end of 2021, and the expected efficiency of the converted machine will give the Company the opportunity to rationalize some of the higher cost assets in its mill system.15:58SCANX Large cap notable movers of interest -- Caterpillar (CAT) pulls back following analyst downgrade -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable large cap movers of interest ($10 bln - $200 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Large Cap GainersTSLA (648.33 +3.15%): Spikes to one-month highs.

Treasuries started the cash session on a modestly lower note after overnight action saw a weak start from Asian markets while European indices remained closed for Easter. The coronavirus situation continued improving in closely watched places like New York, which supported the growing belief that parts of the U.S. economy will begin reopening soon. However, Minneapolis Fed President, Neel Kashkari, who appeared on CBS on Sunday, had a different view, saying that he expects 18 months of rolling shutdowns unless a medical breakthrough takes place. Meanwhile, Fed Vice Chair, Richard Clarida, acknowledged this morning that the coronavirus will have a disinflationary impact, but he said that the Fed has tools to avoid deflation. Treasuries began the day with modest losses and the 10-yr note remained near its starting level until the close. The long bond underperformed, finishing near its morning low, while shorter tenors underperformed intraday, but narrowed their losses ahead of the close. Gold had another good day, climbing to a level not seen since October 2012. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.2% to 99.37.

[...] This has in turn significantly reduced global economic activity and resulted in airlines dramatically cutting back on flights and a decrease in motor vehicle use at a time when seasonal driving patterns typically result in an increase of consumer demand for gasoline. As a result, there has also been a decline in the demand for, and thus also the market prices of, crude oil and certain of our products, particularly our refined petroleum products and most notably gasoline and jet fuel.""In addition, recent events concerning the dispute over production levels between Russia and the members of [OPEC], particularly Saudi Arabia, [...] have exacerbated the decline in crude oil prices and have contributed to an increase in crude oil price volatility.""The decrease in the demand for refined petroleum products coupled with the decline in the price of crude oil has resulted in a significant decrease in the price of the refined petroleum products manufactured by our refining segment. Because ethanol is primarily blended into gasoline, ethanol demand has declined along with the decline in the demand for gasoline, and the price of the products manufactured by our ethanol segment have also decreased. Essential businesses [...] continue to operate, blunting the decrease in the demand for diesel. Demand for renewable diesel is consistent with the demand for diesel as a whole; therefore, our renewable diesel segment has not been impacted as significantly as our refining and ethanol segments.""In late March and through early April 2020, we started reducing the amount of crude oil processed at most of our refineries in response to the decreased demand for our products, we temporarily idled various gasoline-making units at certain of our refineries to further limit gasoline production, and we took measures to reduce jet fuel production. We also temporarily idled eight of our ethanol plants, and we reduced the amount of corn feedstock processed at our remaining six ethanol plants to address the decreased demand for ethanol.""We expect to defer or delay certain capital expenditures which we had expected to make in 2020 related to our refining and ethanol segments. [...] We have not purchased any shares of our common stock since mid-March 2020, and will evaluate the timing of repurchases when appropriate.""Furthermore, as a result of the uncertainties concerning COVID-19 and global oil markets, we have withdrawn our prior financial and operational guidance with respect to the first quarter 2020 and fiscal year 2020 and such prior guidance should no longer be relied on."Co issues guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $20.1-22.2 bln vs. $17.76 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Net loss attributable to Valero Energy stockholders is expected to be $(2.1)-(1.83) bln.14:32COMDX Energy Settlement PricesMay Crude Oil futures fell $0.03 (-0.13%) to $22.73/barrel May Natural Gas $0.03 lower (-1.67%) at $1.704/MMBtu May RBOB Gasoline settled $0.03 higher (4.24%) at $0.706/gallon May Heating oil futures settled $0.03 higher (3.18%) at $1.0035/gallon13:57SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/ Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: noneTomorrow Morning: CONN FAST FRC INFY JNJ JPM OGI WFC13:44XLRE Sector Briefing: Real Estate (34.00 -1.53)Ten sectors trade in negative territory this afternoon, with the real estate sector (-4.6%) sitting at the bottom of the leaderboard.Real estate has been among the hardest hit sectors during the market's recent bout with historical volatility.

The energy sector shows relative leadership at this juncture, supported by a bump in oil prices that followed news that a multinational production cut agreement has been reached. Other energy industry names outperforming include ENLC, RTLR, NBLX... DRD (8.84 +19.78%): Surges to a new three-year high on above 3x average volume. Gold stocks generally see strength. (Related: NGD, SBSW...) ATHX (3.44 +18.11%): The FDA authorized co to initiate a Phase 2/3 study to assess the safety and efficacy of MultiStem therapy in subjects with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by the novel coronavirus disease; a new IND will not need to be filed for the program, and co plans to open the first clinical sites for recruitment of this MACOVIA study this quarter.Small Cap LosersSABR (5.55 -20.79%): Pulls back on more than 2x average volume, moderating last week's circa +63% gains. Among recent items, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority put out a notice late last week in which it announced that following an in-depth investigation, the CMA is blocking co's proposed takeover of Farelogix; per the CMA's statement, the CMA "found that Sabre's purchase of Farelogix could result in less innovation in their services, leading to fewer new features that may be released more slowly" and that such a purchase could also drive up fees for certain products, leaving "airlines, travel agents and UK passengers [...] worse off" as a result. The US District Court of Delaware had decided to clear the deal several days earlier. Mizuho commented in a note that it views the CMA's decision as a positive for co's shares, as it believes that the acquisition "would have significantly reduced SABR's financial flexibility at a crucial time"; Mizuho raised co's target to $5 from $3. AMC (2.09 -19.81%): Reports suggest that co is hiring a law firm to explore a potential bankruptcy filing. Hearing downgraded to Sell at B. Riley FBR.

During its Q4 report in January, the company guided for 2020, estimating that reported adjusted EPS for 2020 will be between $8.95-9.10 and that operational sales will increase 4.5-5.5% yr/yr to $85.8-86.6 bln. S&P Capital IQ consensus now calls for EPS of $8.17 and revenues of $79.80 bln for the current fiscal year. The company does not typically issue guidance on a quarterly basis. In the last four quarters, Johnson & Johnson topped expectations for EPS four times while issuing generally in-line or upside revenues in each quarter; revenues for Q4 were slightly below consensus, impacted by a deceleration in sales growth for the company's largest segment, Pharmaceutical, and by a decline in Baby Care products globally within the Consumer segment. The company commented in mid-March that its supply chain was holding steady amid COVID-19 disruptions and that it was taking measures to maximize the availability of its over-the-counter medicine portfolio during the crisis. Meanwhile, the company's Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies unit has been engaged in attempting to combat the outbreak by collaborating with BARDA and other agencies to fund and conduct vaccine research, development, and clinical testing; at the end of March, it announced that it had selected a lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate and that it expected to initiate human clinical studies of the candidate by September at latest.JNJ has a market cap of circa $365 bln and trades at roughly 17x forward earnings estimates. After experiencing significant volatility in recent weeks alongside the broader market, the stock currently trades lower by circa 7% since the company's Q4 earnings release in January.13:00SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (41.47 mln -14.4%)Industrials: GE (54.4 mln -3.85%), DAL (53.04 mln -6.6%), AAL (48.67 mln -7.59%), UAL (24.26 mln -7.29%)Consumer Discretionary: F (59.19 mln -5.59%), CCL (55.43 mln -7.25%), NIO (24.52 mln +9.37%), NCLH (23.48 mln -12.5%)Information Technology: AMD (39.17 mln +2.88%)Financials: MFA (46.41 mln -5.56%), BAC (39.43 mln -3.46%), SQQQ (37.68 mln +0.6%), TQQQ (29.52 mln -0.44%)Energy: CHK (74.64 mln -5.65%), MRO (36.98 mln +3.69%), OXY (30.5 mln -0.91%), ET (25.13 mln +3.87%), APA (24.82 mln +0.91%), CPE (24.12 mln -0.59%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: BCRX (2.65x +12.8%), NTRA (1.65x -8.38%), TXMD (1.64x -10.06%), MESO (1.34x -2.95%)Consumer Discretionary: NLS (3.91x +23.4%), AGS (1.47x -2.04%), TUP (1.46x -6.3%), NEW (1.37x +10.7%)Information Technology: DOMO (1.94x +16.98%), SABR (1.55x -23.14%)Financials: VRIG (2.04x -0.4%), VTIP (1.63x +0.18%), ESGE (1.53x -0.56%), MITT (1.47x -3.2%)Energy: FET (2.51x +16.91%), PVAC (1.63x +21.34%), SM (1.49x +19.43%), HLX (1.46x +3.64%), OIS (1.35x +15.98%)12:58SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: LXRX (2.14 +13.83%), BCRX (2.34 +12.8%)Materials: NGD (0.66 +12.59%)Consumer Discretionary: NLS (4.64 +23.4%), CVNA (70.6 +15.07%), GME (4.47 +14.91%), NEW (4.76 +10.7%)Information Technology: DOMO (13.71 +16.98%)Energy: ENBL (3.35 +23.62%), PVAC (3.81 +21.34%), SM (2.09 +19.43%), LPI (0.47 +18.73%), FET (0.27 +16.91%), ENLC (1.25 +16.82%), OIS (2.8 +15.98%), OMP (5.3 +11.81%), USAC (7.96 +11.71%), GPOR (0.72 +10.83%), BTU (3.7 +10.78%), NBLX (5.04 +10.77%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: CYH (3.23 -16.32%), ACB (0.75 -14.4%)Materials: VNTR (1.46 -13.39%)Industrials: WBT (4.46 -13.4%)Consumer Discretionary: EXPR (2.12 -17.83%), CCS (16.04 -15.4%), RCL (34.47 -14.31%), HZO (10.4 -13.88%), FOXF (43.47 -13.85%), EAT (14.92 -13.71%), LGIH (47.52 -13.19%), NCLH (11.47 -12.5%), KBH (19.75 -12.49%)Information Technology: SABR (5.38 -23.14%), BDC (32.66 -12.51%)Energy: FTSI (0.35 -17.36%), SDRL (0.76 -12.8%)12:56WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stocks trade lower midday, weakness in financial and industrial sectorsThe stock market is retracing some of its historic gains from last week, but the major indices are currently trading off session lows. The S&P 500 is down 1.5% after being down 2.5% today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-1.7%) has followed a similar path, while the Nasdaq Composite outperforms with a 0.5% decline.From a sector perspective, the real estate sector (-4.0%) is down the most, but weakness in the financials (-3.2%) and industrials (-3.0%) sectors is having an influential drag on the broader market. Bank stocks are faltering ahead of their Q1 earnings results this week, while an analyst downgrade of Caterpillar (CAT 114.36, -10.65, -8.5%) weighs on the industrials group.Interestingly, the energy sector (-0.4%) trades lower despite a multinational agreement to cut oil production, while the consumer discretionary sector (+0.1%) bucks the broader trend amid strength in shares of Amazon (AMZN 2133.37, +90.61, +4.4%). Amazon is ramping up efforts to meet strong customer demand.Specifying the production agreement, OPEC and other non-OPEC members agreed to cut production by 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, which will then taper to 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31 and 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022. WTI crude futures are only up 1.8% to $23.16/bbl amid unresolved demand problems.Separately, talk has shifted to how the U.S. should proceed with reopening the economy, which could start to reopen as soon as May 1. The consensus is that less-infected parts of the country will get back to work before urban areas, but worries remain about potential mishaps. President Trump said earlier today that a coordinated decision with governors will be made "shortly."U.S. Treasuries have been relatively quiet today with the benchmark 10-yr yield currently down one basis point to 0.73%.

However, the influential sector has been able to stay ahead of the broader market, thanks to a show of relative strength from several chipmakers. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is down 0.3%, narrowing its April gain to 5.7%.The chipmaker group is resisting the bulk of the pressure that is weighing on the broader market, partly due to an understanding that the sudden shift toward remote work should increase demand for computers and other networking products. Intel (INTC 58.11, +0.97, +1.7%) CEO, Bob Swann, confirmed late last week that demand for the company's processors increased in Q1.Notable movers:AMD (AMD 49.46, +1.08, +2.2%): best performer in the group, trading near last week's high with its 50-day moving average (47.46) looming just below. Intel (INTC 58.11, +0.97, +1.7%): trading above its 50-day moving average (57.68) after the company's CEO confirmed higher demand in Q1.

Texas Instruments (TXN 106.78, -0.91, -0.9%): downgraded to Underweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley.10:43TALKX Market Briefing: Slipping on recovery edgeThe stock market is coming off its best week since 1974, so it will be forgiven somewhat for starting today's trading with a pullback edge. Every sector is down, except the energy sector (+0.1%) which is drawing support from a bump in oil prices ($23.32, +0.56, +2.5%) that has followed news of a production cut agreement.OPEC and other non-OPEC members said they would cut 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, then 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31, and then 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022. Some think the cut is still not enough to offset the demand destruction from COVID-19. That consideration, and underlying concerns about compliance, help explain why oil prices aren't popping more on the news.The stock market, meanwhile, is grappling with doubts about the pace and shape of the economic recovery in spite of the generous fiscal and monetary policy stimulus actions. That is giving way to broad-based selling interest led by the real estate (-3.8%), financial (-3.7%), utilities (-3.5%), industrials (-3.1%), and materials (-2.6%) sectors.Worries about the shape of things to come are also wrapped up in some angst tied to the Q1 earnings results that will be heard this week from the banks. In particular, market participants are bracing for sizable increases in loan-loss provisions that will weigh on full-year earnings potential.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%; the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 2.0%; and the Russell 2000 is down 2.7%.10:35JPM JPMorgan Chase First Quarter Earnings Preview (99.81 -2.92)JP Morgan (JPM) will report first quarter earnings tomorrow before the open. There is a conference call scheduled for 8:30. Q1 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.20 (-14% yr/yr) on revenue of $29.5 bln (+1% yr/yr). As its most recent investor day on February 25 (which occurred prior to COVID-19 related shutdowns), the company said it expected FY20 net interest income of $57 bln and FY21 of $60 bln or higher and FY20 net revenue build. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank will consider suspending dividend only during "extremely adverse conditions."JPM shares are down by over 25% from its highs as the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the banking industry. Banks like JPM are expected to see increased loan loss provisions due to coronavirus. In addition, lower interest rates spreads are expected to negatively impact probability.Looking back, the company beat on EPS and revenues every quarter since Q4 of 2018. Looking back at Q4, some encouraging takeaways from the report include. An 8.4% yr/yr increase in reported Q4 revenue, a 21% increase in net income, and a 30% yr/yr increase in EPS of $2.57, which handily topped the consensus estimate.JPM has a $305.0 bln valuation and trades at ~14 FY20 EPS estimates.Based on the weekly JPM Apr $100 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~7% in either direction by April expiration (Friday, April 17).10:14OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:MRO Apr 5 calls are seeing interest with 1520 contracts trading vs. open int of 7580, pushing implied vol up around 28 points to ~166%.

Available for immediate pre-order, the Maple 30x was revealed in an online brand launch ceremony on April 10. Production of the Maple 30x started in January and is currently ready for customer delivery. Fengsheng noted that the Maple 30X is the first Maple model released this year. There will be two more models to be launched later this year: a pure SUV targeting "millennial" families and an MPV model.10:01XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (34.44 +0.53)Ten out of eleven sectors trade in the red in the early going while the energy sector (+1.2%) is fighting to stay ahead of the broader market. The group has already gained 17.6% since the end of March, which puts the sector well ahead of its peers.The growth-sensitive group outperforms today thanks to a rally in crude oil. WTI crude is currently up $0.65, or 2.9%, at $23.41/bbl after enduring a volatile finish to last week. Today's advance follows news of an OPEC+ agreement to reduce oil output between May 1 and June 30 by 9.7 mln barrels per day.Notable movers:Marathon Oil (MRO 4.39, +0.27, +6.7%) Cabot Oil & Gas (COG 19.92, +1.04, +5.5%)Apache (APA 8.62, +0.64, +5.2%) Cimarex (XEC 18.66, +0.70, +3.8%) Devon Energy (DVN 10.02, +0.35, +3.5%) National Oilwell Varco (NOV 12.01, +0.41, +3.5%) Pioneer Resources (PXD 77.98, +2.50, +3.3%)09:42F Ford Motor sees Q1 revs above consensus; is considering a scenario for a phased restart of its manufacturing plants, supply network and other dependent functions beginning in Q2 (5.11 )Co issues upside guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $34 bln vs. $31.87 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.He added that Ford's first-quarter vehicle wholesales were down 21 percent from a year ago, largely as a result of lower production and demand related to the coronavirus. Ford currently expects to report revenue of about $34 billion and first-quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of about negative $0.6 billion, which excludes about $0.3 billion of special-item charges. The company has not yet calculated its tax rate for the first quarter and is not able to provide its preliminary net loss or loss per share, but anticipates valuation allowance adjustments against deferred-tax assets of about $0.9 billion.In March, Ford suspended its $0.6 billion regular quarterly dividend and antidilutive share repurchase program. Stone said the company is taking other steps to preserve cash, including by lowering operating costs, reducing capital expenditures and deferring portions of executive salaries. As of April 9, the company had about $30 billion in cash on its balance sheet, including$15.4 billion of proceeds from borrowings last month against two existing credit lines. Presently, only Ford's joint ventures in China, where coronavirus risks developed earlier and are now moderating, are producing and wholesaling vehicles. The company is considering a scenario for a phased restart of its manufacturing plants, supply network and other dependent functions beginning in the second quarter, with enhanced safety standards in place to protect workers. Any decisions on resumptions will be made in cooperation with local unions, suppliers, dealers and other stakeholders.09:42WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens session slightly lowerThe major indices start the session in negative territory with the S&P 500 down 0.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.2%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the energy sector (+0.9%) bucking the broader trend after OPEC+ and the U.S. agreed to cut oil production. Today's early laggards include the financials (-2.3%) and real estate (-2.5%) sectors.U.S. Treasuries trade near their flat lines.

[Co's guidance was $350-370 mln in revenues. Q1 Capital IQ consensus calls for revenue of $358.2 mln.] While the business was trending at or above the high end of our guidance range for the first 10 weeks of the quarter, like most businesses, we experienced a swift change in customer behavior in the middle of March when the pandemic took hold across the country." "Initially, we observed a decrease in orders across our entire business as the news upended typical routines and there was considerable uncertainty about what day-to-day life would be like. In particular, our corporate business, which accounted for a mid-single digit percentage of our orders in the fourth quarter, was dramatically impacted in mid-March as virtually all of our corporate clients shifted to work-from-home models.""Exiting the first quarter and in the beginning of the second quarter, we have seen trends improve significantly -- so far in April our overall year-over-year DAG growth has been approximately 10%. In markets less affected by the outbreak, diner ordering has returned to, and in many cases exceeded, our pre-COVID-19 expectations. We are also seeing record numbers of new diners and new restaurants on the platform.""While we are confident we could generate meaningful profits in the second quarter that would keep us comfortably on the previously announced path to deliver at least $100 million of Adjusted EBITDA in 2020, we are instead planning to reinvest most of the profits we expect to generate during the second quarter into programs that directly drive more business to our restaurant partners. [...] As a result, we plan to intentionally manage the business to approximately $5 million of Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter to continue to support our ecosystem. To be clear, this is a completely discretionary short-term business decision designed to support our industry. We are proud that our consistent profitability, highly variable cost structure and strong balance sheet afford us ample liquidity (approximately $600 million as of March 31, including $175 million we added from our revolver) and flexibility during times like these." "We are confident that our ability to manage our business profitably while competing aggressively has not changed, but because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of when and how the COVID-19 outbreak will resolve, we believe it's prudent to withdraw our full year 2020 revenue and EBITDA guidance."09:05GLRE Greenlight Capital reports prelim Q1 results (6.42 )The company expects its results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 to reflect:A net loss of $38 million to $43 million or ($1.05) to ($1.19) per fully diluted share.Net premiums written of $107 million to $112 millionNet premiums earned of $109 million to $114 millionThe company expects a fully diluted book value per share as of March 31, 2020 of $11.56 to $11.69.09:04EBAY eBay names Jamie Iannone CEO, effective April 27 (33.83 )Most recently Mr. Iannone was Chief Operating Officer of Walmart eCommerce (WMT).

This includes taking advantage of our vertically integrated business model to adjust production schedules to match current demand and tightly manage labor costs, including furloughing roughly 35% of our permanent workforce. We also have the ability to immediately adjust our significant discretionary online advertising spend in response to any changes in DTC trends as they develop. In addition to the previously announced cash compensation deferments for senior executives and directors of the board and 5% paid-in-kind interest deferral for the first two quarters of 2020 under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we are temporarily reducing our capital spend by delaying all non-maintenance related projects and investments in non-essential initiatives and headcount additions until we have better visibility into when conditions normalize.

This transition combined with a strong balance sheet has allowed the company to avoid any meaningful deterioration of its liquidity position resulting from the COVID-19 crisis at this time.DaVita commends the swift and bold action by the federal government through HHS to support healthcare providers, like DaVita, in this time of crisis. While the details of the program have not been announced, the expressed intent of the CARES Act is to help defray the significant healthcare-related expenses and lost revenue attributable to COVID-19. DaVita expects that the short-term financial impact of COVID-19 resulting from its increased costs, lost revenue and its increase in the treatment of the uninsured, may be offset by the CARES Act payment DaVita received of approximately $ 240 million.Because of the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, DaVita's future results could vary materially from the guidance we have provided. DaVita believes the long-term impact of COVID-19 will be primarily driven by the severity and duration of the pandemic, the pandemic's impact on the U.S. and global economies and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses.06:04JELD JELD-WEN: Steves wins preliminary injunction against JELD in new lawsuit, requiring JELD to comply with Doorskin supply agreement (11.53 )Judge cited "substantial likelihood, amounting to a near certainty, that steves will succeed on the merits" at trial.In the first suit filed in June 2016, Steves claimed that JELD-WEN violated the federal antitrust laws in 2012 when it merged with a competitor.

While it is not clear how long this crisis will last, the impact it will have on consumer shopping behavior going forward, or how long it will take retailers to return to their traditional activities, we are committed to helping our retail partners meet the needs of those whom they serve every day.""As we outlined at our Investor Day in February, our recent growth had been very robust such that we were playing catch up to fulfill demand. With the onset of the COVID-19 global health crisis, our demand continued to accelerate as pet parents prioritized shopping for their pets' needs. While we expect a trough in retail sales behind the surge, we remain diligent in ensuring that our manufacturing operations are safe through additional investments when necessary and believe all of our efforts demonstrate the strength of our organization, the business we have built and the merits of our mission and values that are focused on Pets.

The S&P 500 gained 1.5%, extending this week's advance to 12.1% while the Nasdaq (+0.8%) underperformed but still gained 10.6% for the week.The market climbed out of the gate after the release of another horrific weekly initial claims report was masked by news of more unprecedented action from the Fed to help none of the 16 million people who got fired over the past three weeks. Of course, the Fed would protest that direct support is not in its mandate, but neither is the ability to purchase junk bond ETFs or collateralized debt obligations, which can now be acquired by the Fed. The central bank also added another $2.30 trln in emergency lending capacity for businesses and municipalities. Fed Chairman, Jay Powell, said that the central bank will continue using its powers forcefully, proactively, and aggressively.In Europe, the Bank of England announced that it will begin directly financing the U.K.'s fiscal needs while German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, rejected Italy's demand for the issuance of joint euro debt.Also of note, the Japanese government will reportedly spend up to $2.20 bln to help Japanese manufacturers move their production facilities out of China.Equities backpedaled from their highs in the afternoon, but ten out of eleven sectors were able to finish in the green.

That volatility followed conflicting headlines from the OPEC+ meeting, where producers struggled to agree to a large output cut.

Crude oil ended the day lower by $2.30, or 9.1%, at $22.87/bbl.Treasuries finished near their highs, sending the 10-yr yield lower by four basis points to 0.73%.The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.6% to 99.50, widening this week's loss to 1.0%.Reviewing today's economic data:It was another dismal initial claims report, with 6.606 million jobless claims filed for the week ending April 4 (Briefing.com consensus 5.000 million), bringing the three-week total to 13,476,307 after revisions. Continuing claims for the week ending March 28 hit a record high 7.455 millionThe key takeaway from the jobless claims data is that the number of filings is simply astounding and a true sign of the vast impact of the sudden economic stop. Unfortunately, it likely still doesn't capture the fullness of the impact as it's reasonable to assume that the system for filing claims is overwhelmed and not facilitating every effort to file for jobless benefitsThe preliminary reading for the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index for April plummeted to 71.0 (Briefing.com consensus 79.3) from 89.1 in March.

We are now preparing to offer antibody blood testing to identify people who have been exposed and built immunity.

While there are a few pockets of strength such as the utilities and government verticals, several industries, such as entertainment, automotive and aerospace, are being negatively impacted. We believe that we can continue to generate cash even as revenue declines due to the immediate cost reduction and working capital management actions we are taking combined with the results of our Blueprint for Growth strategy. Our strategy enabled us to simplify the business during the last few years through the 80/20 Process, reduce our cost structure and improve efficiencies.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4%, and the Russell 2000 fell 2.8%.There wasn't much conviction in today's session ahead of the Q1 earnings reports from the leading U.S. banks this week. Perhaps some skittishness regarding the loan-loss reserves these banks are accruing contributed to the influential drag from the S&P 500 financials sector (-3.6%).Sellers were kept in check, though, as stocks drifted sideways for most of the session and closed well off intraday lows after a brief tumble after the open. The S&P 500 real estate sector (-4.6%) declined the most, while the consumer discretionary sector (+1.1%) finished comfortably in positive territory.Interestingly, a multinational agreement to cut oil production was unable to stir much enthusiasm within the energy sector (-0.4%). Specifically, OPEC and other non-OPEC members agreed to cut production by 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, then 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31, and then 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022.WTI crude futures struggled for direction and ultimately settled the session down 2.0%, or $0.45, to $22.42/bbl, suggesting that investors were not convinced that the production cuts alone would save an industry still facing demand problems caused by COVID-19. The economy is expected to gradually reopen in May, but the speed and scope of a recovery remained uncertain.Investors' appetite for growth, meanwhile, continued to lead buyers toward technology companies, including Amazon (AMZN 2168.87, +126.11, +6.2%), Apple (AAPL 273.25, +5.26, +2.0%), and Netflix (NFLX 396.72, +26.00, +7.0%). Amazon stepped up efforts to meet strong customer demand, while Netflix benefited from a positive note in Barron's.Separately, shares of Caterpillar (CAT 114.14, -10.89, -8.7%) dropped nearly 9% after the stock was downgraded to Underperform from Neutral at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.U.S. Treasuries ended the quiet session on a lower note. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.23%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 0.75%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 99.42.Investors did not receive any economic data on Monday. Looking ahead, investors will receive Import and Export Prices for March on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite -8.7% YTDS&P 500 -14.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -18.0% YTDRussell 2000 -27.4% YTD16:17XENT Intersect ENT issues downside Q1 revs guidance and withdraws 2020 guidance; taken pre-emptive actions to curtail spending (11.76 +0.03)Co sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $19.5-19.8 mln vs. $26.53 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. "Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, our efforts to enhance commercial execution and improve market access infrastructure were beginning to yield benefits as our first quarter 2020 sales were tracking to prior year and in-line with our expectations. However, sales trailed off throughout March as the various COVID-19 restrictions were implemented. While our business has and will be impacted by hospitals suspending elective surgical procedures and reduced ENT office visits, we are maintaining our customer-focus and taking the necessary actions to maintain continuity. To that end, we proactively implemented initiatives to reduce costs, maintain liquidity and preserve our cash to enable us to navigate this challenge and return to growth." Due to the rapidly evolving environment and continued uncertainties resulting from the impact of COVID-19, the Company is withdrawing its previously announced annual guidance for 2020, which was issued on February 24, 2020. At this date, the Company cannot predict the extent or duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its financial and operating results, but believes current government policies, including the suspension of elective procedures worldwide, will substantially impact its revenues in the second quarter of 2020 and potentially longer. While the financial impact will certainly impact near term results, the Company believes the actions it has taken will enable it to maintain its ability to return to growth as the current crisis subsides.16:14STRL Sterling Construction was awarded "significant" projects and increases to the scope on existing projects totaling ~$100 million during Q1 2020 (9.03 -0.27)The site development projects included distribution centers for the e-commerce platform and retail grocers, a major children's hospital expansion and an industrial location.

As a result of the Hartsville No. 10 machine conversion, Sonoco will be exiting the corrugated medium market by the end of 2021, and the expected efficiency of the converted machine will give the Company the opportunity to rationalize some of the higher cost assets in its mill system.15:58SCANX Large cap notable movers of interest -- Caterpillar (CAT) pulls back following analyst downgrade -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable large cap movers of interest ($10 bln - $200 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Large Cap GainersTSLA (648.33 +3.15%): Spikes to one-month highs.

Treasuries started the cash session on a modestly lower note after overnight action saw a weak start from Asian markets while European indices remained closed for Easter. The coronavirus situation continued improving in closely watched places like New York, which supported the growing belief that parts of the U.S. economy will begin reopening soon. However, Minneapolis Fed President, Neel Kashkari, who appeared on CBS on Sunday, had a different view, saying that he expects 18 months of rolling shutdowns unless a medical breakthrough takes place. Meanwhile, Fed Vice Chair, Richard Clarida, acknowledged this morning that the coronavirus will have a disinflationary impact, but he said that the Fed has tools to avoid deflation. Treasuries began the day with modest losses and the 10-yr note remained near its starting level until the close. The long bond underperformed, finishing near its morning low, while shorter tenors underperformed intraday, but narrowed their losses ahead of the close. Gold had another good day, climbing to a level not seen since October 2012. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.2% to 99.37. Yield Check: 2-yr: +1 bp to 0.23% 3-yr: +1 bp to 0.31% 5-yr: +2 bps to 0.43% 10-yr: +2 bps to 0.75% 30-yr: +4 bps to 1.39%News: Senator Bernie Sanders endorsed Joe Biden's candidacy for president. China's March New Loans totaled CNY2.85 trln (expected CNY1.80 trln; last CNY905.70 bln) while Total Social Financing reached CNY5.15 trln (expected CNY2.80 trln; last CNY855.00 bln). Outstanding loans grew 12.7% yr/yr (expected 12.1%; last 12.1%) in March. The Australian government may underwrite domestic flights operated by major carriers in order to maintain links between large cities. Japan's Finance Minister, Taro Aso, said that a sales tax cut is not being considered at this time. Greek Finance Minister, Christos Staikouras, said that Greek GDP will contract between 5% and 10% in 2020. The Italian government is reportedly considering using EUR10 bln of EU funds in a relief package, which would represent a deviation from the EU's deficit rules.

[...] This has in turn significantly reduced global economic activity and resulted in airlines dramatically cutting back on flights and a decrease in motor vehicle use at a time when seasonal driving patterns typically result in an increase of consumer demand for gasoline. As a result, there has also been a decline in the demand for, and thus also the market prices of, crude oil and certain of our products, particularly our refined petroleum products and most notably gasoline and jet fuel.""In addition, recent events concerning the dispute over production levels between Russia and the members of [OPEC], particularly Saudi Arabia, [...] have exacerbated the decline in crude oil prices and have contributed to an increase in crude oil price volatility.""The decrease in the demand for refined petroleum products coupled with the decline in the price of crude oil has resulted in a significant decrease in the price of the refined petroleum products manufactured by our refining segment. Because ethanol is primarily blended into gasoline, ethanol demand has declined along with the decline in the demand for gasoline, and the price of the products manufactured by our ethanol segment have also decreased. Essential businesses [...] continue to operate, blunting the decrease in the demand for diesel. Demand for renewable diesel is consistent with the demand for diesel as a whole; therefore, our renewable diesel segment has not been impacted as significantly as our refining and ethanol segments.""In late March and through early April 2020, we started reducing the amount of crude oil processed at most of our refineries in response to the decreased demand for our products, we temporarily idled various gasoline-making units at certain of our refineries to further limit gasoline production, and we took measures to reduce jet fuel production. We also temporarily idled eight of our ethanol plants, and we reduced the amount of corn feedstock processed at our remaining six ethanol plants to address the decreased demand for ethanol.""We expect to defer or delay certain capital expenditures which we had expected to make in 2020 related to our refining and ethanol segments. [...] We have not purchased any shares of our common stock since mid-March 2020, and will evaluate the timing of repurchases when appropriate.""Furthermore, as a result of the uncertainties concerning COVID-19 and global oil markets, we have withdrawn our prior financial and operational guidance with respect to the first quarter 2020 and fiscal year 2020 and such prior guidance should no longer be relied on."Co issues guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $20.1-22.2 bln vs. $17.76 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Net loss attributable to Valero Energy stockholders is expected to be $(2.1)-(1.83) bln.14:32COMDX Energy Settlement PricesMay Crude Oil futures fell $0.03 (-0.13%) to $22.73/barrel May Natural Gas $0.03 lower (-1.67%) at $1.704/MMBtu May RBOB Gasoline settled $0.03 higher (4.24%) at $0.706/gallon May Heating oil futures settled $0.03 higher (3.18%) at $1.0035/gallon13:57SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/ Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: noneTomorrow Morning: CONN FAST FRC INFY JNJ JPM OGI WFC13:44XLRE Sector Briefing: Real Estate (34.00 -1.53)Ten sectors trade in negative territory this afternoon, with the real estate sector (-4.6%) sitting at the bottom of the leaderboard.Real estate has been among the hardest hit sectors during the market's recent bout with historical volatility.

The energy sector shows relative leadership at this juncture, supported by a bump in oil prices that followed news that a multinational production cut agreement has been reached. Other energy industry names outperforming include ENLC, RTLR, NBLX... DRD (8.84 +19.78%): Surges to a new three-year high on above 3x average volume. Gold stocks generally see strength. (Related: NGD, SBSW...) ATHX (3.44 +18.11%): The FDA authorized co to initiate a Phase 2/3 study to assess the safety and efficacy of MultiStem therapy in subjects with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by the novel coronavirus disease; a new IND will not need to be filed for the program, and co plans to open the first clinical sites for recruitment of this MACOVIA study this quarter.Small Cap LosersSABR (5.55 -20.79%): Pulls back on more than 2x average volume, moderating last week's circa +63% gains. Among recent items, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority put out a notice late last week in which it announced that following an in-depth investigation, the CMA is blocking co's proposed takeover of Farelogix; per the CMA's statement, the CMA "found that Sabre's purchase of Farelogix could result in less innovation in their services, leading to fewer new features that may be released more slowly" and that such a purchase could also drive up fees for certain products, leaving "airlines, travel agents and UK passengers [...] worse off" as a result. The US District Court of Delaware had decided to clear the deal several days earlier. Mizuho commented in a note that it views the CMA's decision as a positive for co's shares, as it believes that the acquisition "would have significantly reduced SABR's financial flexibility at a crucial time"; Mizuho raised co's target to $5 from $3. AMC (2.09 -19.81%): Reports suggest that co is hiring a law firm to explore a potential bankruptcy filing. Hearing downgraded to Sell at B. Riley FBR.

During its Q4 report in January, the company guided for 2020, estimating that reported adjusted EPS for 2020 will be between $8.95-9.10 and that operational sales will increase 4.5-5.5% yr/yr to $85.8-86.6 bln. S&P Capital IQ consensus now calls for EPS of $8.17 and revenues of $79.80 bln for the current fiscal year. The company does not typically issue guidance on a quarterly basis. In the last four quarters, Johnson & Johnson topped expectations for EPS four times while issuing generally in-line or upside revenues in each quarter; revenues for Q4 were slightly below consensus, impacted by a deceleration in sales growth for the company's largest segment, Pharmaceutical, and by a decline in Baby Care products globally within the Consumer segment. The company commented in mid-March that its supply chain was holding steady amid COVID-19 disruptions and that it was taking measures to maximize the availability of its over-the-counter medicine portfolio during the crisis. Meanwhile, the company's Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies unit has been engaged in attempting to combat the outbreak by collaborating with BARDA and other agencies to fund and conduct vaccine research, development, and clinical testing; at the end of March, it announced that it had selected a lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate and that it expected to initiate human clinical studies of the candidate by September at latest.JNJ has a market cap of circa $365 bln and trades at roughly 17x forward earnings estimates. After experiencing significant volatility in recent weeks alongside the broader market, the stock currently trades lower by circa 7% since the company's Q4 earnings release in January.13:00SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (41.47 mln -14.4%)Industrials: GE (54.4 mln -3.85%), DAL (53.04 mln -6.6%), AAL (48.67 mln -7.59%), UAL (24.26 mln -7.29%)Consumer Discretionary: F (59.19 mln -5.59%), CCL (55.43 mln -7.25%), NIO (24.52 mln +9.37%), NCLH (23.48 mln -12.5%)Information Technology: AMD (39.17 mln +2.88%)Financials: MFA (46.41 mln -5.56%), BAC (39.43 mln -3.46%), SQQQ (37.68 mln +0.6%), TQQQ (29.52 mln -0.44%)Energy: CHK (74.64 mln -5.65%), MRO (36.98 mln +3.69%), OXY (30.5 mln -0.91%), ET (25.13 mln +3.87%), APA (24.82 mln +0.91%), CPE (24.12 mln -0.59%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: BCRX (2.65x +12.8%), NTRA (1.65x -8.38%), TXMD (1.64x -10.06%), MESO (1.34x -2.95%)Consumer Discretionary: NLS (3.91x +23.4%), AGS (1.47x -2.04%), TUP (1.46x -6.3%), NEW (1.37x +10.7%)Information Technology: DOMO (1.94x +16.98%), SABR (1.55x -23.14%)Financials: VRIG (2.04x -0.4%), VTIP (1.63x +0.18%), ESGE (1.53x -0.56%), MITT (1.47x -3.2%)Energy: FET (2.51x +16.91%), PVAC (1.63x +21.34%), SM (1.49x +19.43%), HLX (1.46x +3.64%), OIS (1.35x +15.98%)12:58SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: LXRX (2.14 +13.83%), BCRX (2.34 +12.8%)Materials: NGD (0.66 +12.59%)Consumer Discretionary: NLS (4.64 +23.4%), CVNA (70.6 +15.07%), GME (4.47 +14.91%), NEW (4.76 +10.7%)Information Technology: DOMO (13.71 +16.98%)Energy: ENBL (3.35 +23.62%), PVAC (3.81 +21.34%), SM (2.09 +19.43%), LPI (0.47 +18.73%), FET (0.27 +16.91%), ENLC (1.25 +16.82%), OIS (2.8 +15.98%), OMP (5.3 +11.81%), USAC (7.96 +11.71%), GPOR (0.72 +10.83%), BTU (3.7 +10.78%), NBLX (5.04 +10.77%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: CYH (3.23 -16.32%), ACB (0.75 -14.4%)Materials: VNTR (1.46 -13.39%)Industrials: WBT (4.46 -13.4%)Consumer Discretionary: EXPR (2.12 -17.83%), CCS (16.04 -15.4%), RCL (34.47 -14.31%), HZO (10.4 -13.88%), FOXF (43.47 -13.85%), EAT (14.92 -13.71%), LGIH (47.52 -13.19%), NCLH (11.47 -12.5%), KBH (19.75 -12.49%)Information Technology: SABR (5.38 -23.14%), BDC (32.66 -12.51%)Energy: FTSI (0.35 -17.36%), SDRL (0.76 -12.8%)12:56WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stocks trade lower midday, weakness in financial and industrial sectorsThe stock market is retracing some of its historic gains from last week, but the major indices are currently trading off session lows. The S&P 500 is down 1.5% after being down 2.5% today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-1.7%) has followed a similar path, while the Nasdaq Composite outperforms with a 0.5% decline.From a sector perspective, the real estate sector (-4.0%) is down the most, but weakness in the financials (-3.2%) and industrials (-3.0%) sectors is having an influential drag on the broader market. Bank stocks are faltering ahead of their Q1 earnings results this week, while an analyst downgrade of Caterpillar (CAT 114.36, -10.65, -8.5%) weighs on the industrials group.Interestingly, the energy sector (-0.4%) trades lower despite a multinational agreement to cut oil production, while the consumer discretionary sector (+0.1%) bucks the broader trend amid strength in shares of Amazon (AMZN 2133.37, +90.61, +4.4%). Amazon is ramping up efforts to meet strong customer demand.Specifying the production agreement, OPEC and other non-OPEC members agreed to cut production by 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, which will then taper to 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31 and 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022. WTI crude futures are only up 1.8% to $23.16/bbl amid unresolved demand problems.Separately, talk has shifted to how the U.S. should proceed with reopening the economy, which could start to reopen as soon as May 1. The consensus is that less-infected parts of the country will get back to work before urban areas, but worries remain about potential mishaps. President Trump said earlier today that a coordinated decision with governors will be made "shortly."U.S. Treasuries have been relatively quiet today with the benchmark 10-yr yield currently down one basis point to 0.73%.

The PHLX Semiconductor Index is down 0.3%, narrowing its April gain to 5.7%.The chipmaker group is resisting the bulk of the pressure that is weighing on the broader market, partly due to an understanding that the sudden shift toward remote work should increase demand for computers and other networking products. Intel (INTC 58.11, +0.97, +1.7%) CEO, Bob Swann, confirmed late last week that demand for the company's processors increased in Q1.Notable movers:AMD (AMD 49.46, +1.08, +2.2%): best performer in the group, trading near last week's high with its 50-day moving average (47.46) looming just below. Intel (INTC 58.11, +0.97, +1.7%): trading above its 50-day moving average (57.68) after the company's CEO confirmed higher demand in Q1. Qualcomm (QCOM 72.56, +0.98, +1.4%): hovering near the middle of its range from Thursday. Cirrus Logic (CRUS 64.69, +0.11, +0.2%): trading above its 200-day moving average (63.92).

Texas Instruments (TXN 106.78, -0.91, -0.9%): downgraded to Underweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley.10:43TALKX Market Briefing: Slipping on recovery edgeThe stock market is coming off its best week since 1974, so it will be forgiven somewhat for starting today's trading with a pullback edge. Every sector is down, except the energy sector (+0.1%) which is drawing support from a bump in oil prices ($23.32, +0.56, +2.5%) that has followed news of a production cut agreement.OPEC and other non-OPEC members said they would cut 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, then 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31, and then 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022. Some think the cut is still not enough to offset the demand destruction from COVID-19. That consideration, and underlying concerns about compliance, help explain why oil prices aren't popping more on the news.The stock market, meanwhile, is grappling with doubts about the pace and shape of the economic recovery in spite of the generous fiscal and monetary policy stimulus actions. That is giving way to broad-based selling interest led by the real estate (-3.8%), financial (-3.7%), utilities (-3.5%), industrials (-3.1%), and materials (-2.6%) sectors.Worries about the shape of things to come are also wrapped up in some angst tied to the Q1 earnings results that will be heard this week from the banks. In particular, market participants are bracing for sizable increases in loan-loss provisions that will weigh on full-year earnings potential.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%; the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 2.0%; and the Russell 2000 is down 2.7%.10:35JPM JPMorgan Chase First Quarter Earnings Preview (99.81 -2.92)JP Morgan (JPM) will report first quarter earnings tomorrow before the open. There is a conference call scheduled for 8:30. Q1 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.20 (-14% yr/yr) on revenue of $29.5 bln (+1% yr/yr). As its most recent investor day on February 25 (which occurred prior to COVID-19 related shutdowns), the company said it expected FY20 net interest income of $57 bln and FY21 of $60 bln or higher and FY20 net revenue build. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank will consider suspending dividend only during "extremely adverse conditions."JPM shares are down by over 25% from its highs as the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the banking industry. Banks like JPM are expected to see increased loan loss provisions due to coronavirus. In addition, lower interest rates spreads are expected to negatively impact probability.Looking back, the company beat on EPS and revenues every quarter since Q4 of 2018. Looking back at Q4, some encouraging takeaways from the report include. An 8.4% yr/yr increase in reported Q4 revenue, a 21% increase in net income, and a 30% yr/yr increase in EPS of $2.57, which handily topped the consensus estimate.JPM has a $305.0 bln valuation and trades at ~14 FY20 EPS estimates.Based on the weekly JPM Apr $100 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~7% in either direction by April expiration (Friday, April 17).10:14OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:MRO Apr 5 calls are seeing interest with 1520 contracts trading vs. open int of 7580, pushing implied vol up around 28 points to ~166%.

The company has not yet calculated its tax rate for the first quarter and is not able to provide its preliminary net loss or loss per share, but anticipates valuation allowance adjustments against deferred-tax assets of about $0.9 billion.In March, Ford suspended its $0.6 billion regular quarterly dividend and antidilutive share repurchase program.

As of April 9, the company had about $30 billion in cash on its balance sheet, including$15.4 billion of proceeds from borrowings last month against two existing credit lines. Presently, only Ford's joint ventures in China, where coronavirus risks developed earlier and are now moderating, are producing and wholesaling vehicles.

[Co's guidance was $350-370 mln in revenues. Q1 Capital IQ consensus calls for revenue of $358.2 mln.] While the business was trending at or above the high end of our guidance range for the first 10 weeks of the quarter, like most businesses, we experienced a swift change in customer behavior in the middle of March when the pandemic took hold across the country." "Initially, we observed a decrease in orders across our entire business as the news upended typical routines and there was considerable uncertainty about what day-to-day life would be like. In particular, our corporate business, which accounted for a mid-single digit percentage of our orders in the fourth quarter, was dramatically impacted in mid-March as virtually all of our corporate clients shifted to work-from-home models.""Exiting the first quarter and in the beginning of the second quarter, we have seen trends improve significantly -- so far in April our overall year-over-year DAG growth has been approximately 10%. In markets less affected by the outbreak, diner ordering has returned to, and in many cases exceeded, our pre-COVID-19 expectations. We are also seeing record numbers of new diners and new restaurants on the platform.""While we are confident we could generate meaningful profits in the second quarter that would keep us comfortably on the previously announced path to deliver at least $100 million of Adjusted EBITDA in 2020, we are instead planning to reinvest most of the profits we expect to generate during the second quarter into programs that directly drive more business to our restaurant partners. [...] As a result, we plan to intentionally manage the business to approximately $5 million of Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter to continue to support our ecosystem. To be clear, this is a completely discretionary short-term business decision designed to support our industry. We are proud that our consistent profitability, highly variable cost structure and strong balance sheet afford us ample liquidity (approximately $600 million as of March 31, including $175 million we added from our revolver) and flexibility during times like these." "We are confident that our ability to manage our business profitably while competing aggressively has not changed, but because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of when and how the COVID-19 outbreak will resolve, we believe it's prudent to withdraw our full year 2020 revenue and EBITDA guidance."09:05GLRE Greenlight Capital reports prelim Q1 results (6.42 )The company expects its results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 to reflect:A net loss of $38 million to $43 million or ($1.05) to ($1.19) per fully diluted share.Net premiums written of $107 million to $112 millionNet premiums earned of $109 million to $114 millionThe company expects a fully diluted book value per share as of March 31, 2020 of $11.56 to $11.69.09:04EBAY eBay names Jamie Iannone CEO, effective April 27 (33.83 )Most recently Mr. Iannone was Chief Operating Officer of Walmart eCommerce (WMT).

This transition combined with a strong balance sheet has allowed the company to avoid any meaningful deterioration of its liquidity position resulting from the COVID-19 crisis at this time.DaVita commends the swift and bold action by the federal government through HHS to support healthcare providers, like DaVita, in this time of crisis. While the details of the program have not been announced, the expressed intent of the CARES Act is to help defray the significant healthcare-related expenses and lost revenue attributable to COVID-19. DaVita expects that the short-term financial impact of COVID-19 resulting from its increased costs, lost revenue and its increase in the treatment of the uninsured, may be offset by the CARES Act payment DaVita received of approximately $ 240 million.Because of the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, DaVita's future results could vary materially from the guidance we have provided. DaVita believes the long-term impact of COVID-19 will be primarily driven by the severity and duration of the pandemic, the pandemic's impact on the U.S. and global economies and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses.06:04JELD JELD-WEN: Steves wins preliminary injunction against JELD in new lawsuit, requiring JELD to comply with Doorskin supply agreement (11.53 )Judge cited "substantial likelihood, amounting to a near certainty, that steves will succeed on the merits" at trial.In the first suit filed in June 2016, Steves claimed that JELD-WEN violated the federal antitrust laws in 2012 when it merged with a competitor.

Of course, the Fed would protest that direct support is not in its mandate, but neither is the ability to purchase junk bond ETFs or collateralized debt obligations, which can now be acquired by the Fed. The central bank also added another $2.30 trln in emergency lending capacity for businesses and municipalities.

Unfortunately, it likely still doesn't capture the fullness of the impact as it's reasonable to assume that the system for filing claims is overwhelmed and not facilitating every effort to file for jobless benefitsThe preliminary reading for the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index for April plummeted to 71.0 (Briefing.com consensus 79.3) from 89.1 in March.

This preliminary estimate predominantly reflects VASCEPA sales in the United States. Co also says cash/investments were more than $620 million and less than $50 million remained due on its royalty-like debt instrument.16:49ROKU Roku sees Q1 revs above consensus but withdraws 2020 outlook due to COVID-19 uncertainty (96.56 +4.11)Co sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $307-317 mln vs. $299.88 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; Adjusted EBITDA of ($23)-(18) mln; and other metrics generally in-line with prior outlook.

We are now preparing to offer antibody blood testing to identify people who have been exposed and built immunity.

While there are a few pockets of strength such as the utilities and government verticals, several industries, such as entertainment, automotive and aerospace, are being negatively impacted. We believe that we can continue to generate cash even as revenue declines due to the immediate cost reduction and working capital management actions we are taking combined with the results of our Blueprint for Growth strategy. Our strategy enabled us to simplify the business during the last few years through the 80/20 Process, reduce our cost structure and improve efficiencies. We believe that we will be well positioned for the inevitable recovery when it comes. In the meantime, we are focused on optimizing our results in this current challenging environment."16:24AB AllianceBernstein reports that preliminary month-end assets under management decreased to $542 bln during March 2020 from $614 bln at the end of February (20.24 -1.72)The 11.7% decrease resulted predominantly from sharp market declines as well as net outflows from all three client channels -- Retail, Institutions, and Private Wealth.16:22INSP Inspire Medical Systems announces public offering of $75.0 mln of shares of its common stock (63.39 -1.22)16:20MTDR Matador Resources announces initial Rodney Robinson well results, improves hedging protection and provides operational update (3.38 +0.17)Key highlights of this release include the following: Rodney Robinson wells achieve Matador record 24-hour initial potential test results from all three formations tested and are expected to contribute 8 to 10% of Company's total production for the remainder of 2020; Restructured 2020 oil hedges now cover 75 to 80% of anticipated oil production at $35 per barrel or above for remainder of 2020; and Recent actions taken by Matador should save or cause the Company to receive a sum approaching $340 million in 2020, as compared to its original 2020 estimates, including reductions of $250 million in capital expenditures for drilling, completing and equipping well and $40 million in operating expenses, in particular lease operating and general and administrative expenses.16:19SWIR Sierra Wireless appoints Samuel Cochrane as CFO, effective May 6 (6.92 +0.29)Samuel Cochrane will join as CFO starting May 6.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4%, and the Russell 2000 fell 2.8%.There wasn't much conviction in today's session ahead of the Q1 earnings reports from the leading U.S. banks this week. Perhaps some skittishness regarding the loan-loss reserves these banks are accruing contributed to the influential drag from the S&P 500 financials sector (-3.6%).Sellers were kept in check, though, as stocks drifted sideways for most of the session and closed well off intraday lows after a brief tumble after the open. The S&P 500 real estate sector (-4.6%) declined the most, while the consumer discretionary sector (+1.1%) finished comfortably in positive territory.Interestingly, a multinational agreement to cut oil production was unable to stir much enthusiasm within the energy sector (-0.4%). Specifically, OPEC and other non-OPEC members agreed to cut production by 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, then 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31, and then 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022.WTI crude futures struggled for direction and ultimately settled the session down 2.0%, or $0.45, to $22.42/bbl, suggesting that investors were not convinced that the production cuts alone would save an industry still facing demand problems caused by COVID-19. The economy is expected to gradually reopen in May, but the speed and scope of a recovery remained uncertain.Investors' appetite for growth, meanwhile, continued to lead buyers toward technology companies, including Amazon (AMZN 2168.87, +126.11, +6.2%), Apple (AAPL 273.25, +5.26, +2.0%), and Netflix (NFLX 396.72, +26.00, +7.0%). Amazon stepped up efforts to meet strong customer demand, while Netflix benefited from a positive note in Barron's.Separately, shares of Caterpillar (CAT 114.14, -10.89, -8.7%) dropped nearly 9% after the stock was downgraded to Underperform from Neutral at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.U.S. Treasuries ended the quiet session on a lower note. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.23%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 0.75%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 99.42.Investors did not receive any economic data on Monday. Looking ahead, investors will receive Import and Export Prices for March on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite -8.7% YTDS&P 500 -14.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -18.0% YTDRussell 2000 -27.4% YTD16:17XENT Intersect ENT issues downside Q1 revs guidance and withdraws 2020 guidance; taken pre-emptive actions to curtail spending (11.76 +0.03)Co sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $19.5-19.8 mln vs. $26.53 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. "Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, our efforts to enhance commercial execution and improve market access infrastructure were beginning to yield benefits as our first quarter 2020 sales were tracking to prior year and in-line with our expectations. However, sales trailed off throughout March as the various COVID-19 restrictions were implemented. While our business has and will be impacted by hospitals suspending elective surgical procedures and reduced ENT office visits, we are maintaining our customer-focus and taking the necessary actions to maintain continuity. To that end, we proactively implemented initiatives to reduce costs, maintain liquidity and preserve our cash to enable us to navigate this challenge and return to growth." Due to the rapidly evolving environment and continued uncertainties resulting from the impact of COVID-19, the Company is withdrawing its previously announced annual guidance for 2020, which was issued on February 24, 2020. At this date, the Company cannot predict the extent or duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its financial and operating results, but believes current government policies, including the suspension of elective procedures worldwide, will substantially impact its revenues in the second quarter of 2020 and potentially longer. While the financial impact will certainly impact near term results, the Company believes the actions it has taken will enable it to maintain its ability to return to growth as the current crisis subsides.16:14STRL Sterling Construction was awarded "significant" projects and increases to the scope on existing projects totaling ~$100 million during Q1 2020 (9.03 -0.27)The site development projects included distribution centers for the e-commerce platform and retail grocers, a major children's hospital expansion and an industrial location.

"Prior to the impacts from COVID-19 spreading across the globe, FIS achieved strong revenue growth. As U.S. and foreign governmental authorities imposed social distancing, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders, spending declined, most notably in travel, restaurants, entertainment, and retail, resulting in a rapid deterioration in payments volume and transaction trends on a worldwide basis beginning in March, 2020 which adversely impacted revenue in our payments businesses that earn transaction based fees... We had previously projected revenue of $3,180 to $3,210 million during the first quarter of 2020, representing an increase of approximately 55% to 56% over the prior year period. Organic revenue growth was previously estimated to be 5% to 6% during the first quarter of 2020, including approximately $10 million in anticipated negative foreign exchange impact.""In response to COVID-19, we are taking several actions to manage discretionary expenses and achieve cost synergies, including limiting travel, reducing incentive compensation and decreasing third-party spending as well as accelerating automation and functional alignment across the organization."16:11FIVE Five Below announces additional actions in response to COVID-19 (79.77 -3.21)As previously announced on March 31, Five Below extended the temporary closures of its stores and will reopen stores as soon as federal, state and local authorities allow, targeting May 1.

Treasuries started the cash session on a modestly lower note after overnight action saw a weak start from Asian markets while European indices remained closed for Easter. The coronavirus situation continued improving in closely watched places like New York, which supported the growing belief that parts of the U.S. economy will begin reopening soon. However, Minneapolis Fed President, Neel Kashkari, who appeared on CBS on Sunday, had a different view, saying that he expects 18 months of rolling shutdowns unless a medical breakthrough takes place. Meanwhile, Fed Vice Chair, Richard Clarida, acknowledged this morning that the coronavirus will have a disinflationary impact, but he said that the Fed has tools to avoid deflation. Treasuries began the day with modest losses and the 10-yr note remained near its starting level until the close. The long bond underperformed, finishing near its morning low, while shorter tenors underperformed intraday, but narrowed their losses ahead of the close. Gold had another good day, climbing to a level not seen since October 2012. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.2% to 99.37.

[...] This has in turn significantly reduced global economic activity and resulted in airlines dramatically cutting back on flights and a decrease in motor vehicle use at a time when seasonal driving patterns typically result in an increase of consumer demand for gasoline. As a result, there has also been a decline in the demand for, and thus also the market prices of, crude oil and certain of our products, particularly our refined petroleum products and most notably gasoline and jet fuel.""In addition, recent events concerning the dispute over production levels between Russia and the members of [OPEC], particularly Saudi Arabia, [...] have exacerbated the decline in crude oil prices and have contributed to an increase in crude oil price volatility.""The decrease in the demand for refined petroleum products coupled with the decline in the price of crude oil has resulted in a significant decrease in the price of the refined petroleum products manufactured by our refining segment. Because ethanol is primarily blended into gasoline, ethanol demand has declined along with the decline in the demand for gasoline, and the price of the products manufactured by our ethanol segment have also decreased. Essential businesses [...] continue to operate, blunting the decrease in the demand for diesel. Demand for renewable diesel is consistent with the demand for diesel as a whole; therefore, our renewable diesel segment has not been impacted as significantly as our refining and ethanol segments.""In late March and through early April 2020, we started reducing the amount of crude oil processed at most of our refineries in response to the decreased demand for our products, we temporarily idled various gasoline-making units at certain of our refineries to further limit gasoline production, and we took measures to reduce jet fuel production. We also temporarily idled eight of our ethanol plants, and we reduced the amount of corn feedstock processed at our remaining six ethanol plants to address the decreased demand for ethanol.""We expect to defer or delay certain capital expenditures which we had expected to make in 2020 related to our refining and ethanol segments. [...] We have not purchased any shares of our common stock since mid-March 2020, and will evaluate the timing of repurchases when appropriate.""Furthermore, as a result of the uncertainties concerning COVID-19 and global oil markets, we have withdrawn our prior financial and operational guidance with respect to the first quarter 2020 and fiscal year 2020 and such prior guidance should no longer be relied on."Co issues guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $20.1-22.2 bln vs. $17.76 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Net loss attributable to Valero Energy stockholders is expected to be $(2.1)-(1.83) bln.14:32COMDX Energy Settlement PricesMay Crude Oil futures fell $0.03 (-0.13%) to $22.73/barrel May Natural Gas $0.03 lower (-1.67%) at $1.704/MMBtu May RBOB Gasoline settled $0.03 higher (4.24%) at $0.706/gallon May Heating oil futures settled $0.03 higher (3.18%) at $1.0035/gallon13:57SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/ Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: noneTomorrow Morning: CONN FAST FRC INFY JNJ JPM OGI WFC13:44XLRE Sector Briefing: Real Estate (34.00 -1.53)Ten sectors trade in negative territory this afternoon, with the real estate sector (-4.6%) sitting at the bottom of the leaderboard.Real estate has been among the hardest hit sectors during the market's recent bout with historical volatility.

The US District Court of Delaware had decided to clear the deal several days earlier.

During its Q4 report in January, the company guided for 2020, estimating that reported adjusted EPS for 2020 will be between $8.95-9.10 and that operational sales will increase 4.5-5.5% yr/yr to $85.8-86.6 bln. S&P Capital IQ consensus now calls for EPS of $8.17 and revenues of $79.80 bln for the current fiscal year. The company does not typically issue guidance on a quarterly basis. In the last four quarters, Johnson & Johnson topped expectations for EPS four times while issuing generally in-line or upside revenues in each quarter; revenues for Q4 were slightly below consensus, impacted by a deceleration in sales growth for the company's largest segment, Pharmaceutical, and by a decline in Baby Care products globally within the Consumer segment. The company commented in mid-March that its supply chain was holding steady amid COVID-19 disruptions and that it was taking measures to maximize the availability of its over-the-counter medicine portfolio during the crisis. Meanwhile, the company's Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies unit has been engaged in attempting to combat the outbreak by collaborating with BARDA and other agencies to fund and conduct vaccine research, development, and clinical testing; at the end of March, it announced that it had selected a lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate and that it expected to initiate human clinical studies of the candidate by September at latest.JNJ has a market cap of circa $365 bln and trades at roughly 17x forward earnings estimates. After experiencing significant volatility in recent weeks alongside the broader market, the stock currently trades lower by circa 7% since the company's Q4 earnings release in January.13:00SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (41.47 mln -14.4%)Industrials: GE (54.4 mln -3.85%), DAL (53.04 mln -6.6%), AAL (48.67 mln -7.59%), UAL (24.26 mln -7.29%)Consumer Discretionary: F (59.19 mln -5.59%), CCL (55.43 mln -7.25%), NIO (24.52 mln +9.37%), NCLH (23.48 mln -12.5%)Information Technology: AMD (39.17 mln +2.88%)Financials: MFA (46.41 mln -5.56%), BAC (39.43 mln -3.46%), SQQQ (37.68 mln +0.6%), TQQQ (29.52 mln -0.44%)Energy: CHK (74.64 mln -5.65%), MRO (36.98 mln +3.69%), OXY (30.5 mln -0.91%), ET (25.13 mln +3.87%), APA (24.82 mln +0.91%), CPE (24.12 mln -0.59%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: BCRX (2.65x +12.8%), NTRA (1.65x -8.38%), TXMD (1.64x -10.06%), MESO (1.34x -2.95%)Consumer Discretionary: NLS (3.91x +23.4%), AGS (1.47x -2.04%), TUP (1.46x -6.3%), NEW (1.37x +10.7%)Information Technology: DOMO (1.94x +16.98%), SABR (1.55x -23.14%)Financials: VRIG (2.04x -0.4%), VTIP (1.63x +0.18%), ESGE (1.53x -0.56%), MITT (1.47x -3.2%)Energy: FET (2.51x +16.91%), PVAC (1.63x +21.34%), SM (1.49x +19.43%), HLX (1.46x +3.64%), OIS (1.35x +15.98%)12:58SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: LXRX (2.14 +13.83%), BCRX (2.34 +12.8%)Materials: NGD (0.66 +12.59%)Consumer Discretionary: NLS (4.64 +23.4%), CVNA (70.6 +15.07%), GME (4.47 +14.91%), NEW (4.76 +10.7%)Information Technology: DOMO (13.71 +16.98%)Energy: ENBL (3.35 +23.62%), PVAC (3.81 +21.34%), SM (2.09 +19.43%), LPI (0.47 +18.73%), FET (0.27 +16.91%), ENLC (1.25 +16.82%), OIS (2.8 +15.98%), OMP (5.3 +11.81%), USAC (7.96 +11.71%), GPOR (0.72 +10.83%), BTU (3.7 +10.78%), NBLX (5.04 +10.77%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: CYH (3.23 -16.32%), ACB (0.75 -14.4%)Materials: VNTR (1.46 -13.39%)Industrials: WBT (4.46 -13.4%)Consumer Discretionary: EXPR (2.12 -17.83%), CCS (16.04 -15.4%), RCL (34.47 -14.31%), HZO (10.4 -13.88%), FOXF (43.47 -13.85%), EAT (14.92 -13.71%), LGIH (47.52 -13.19%), NCLH (11.47 -12.5%), KBH (19.75 -12.49%)Information Technology: SABR (5.38 -23.14%), BDC (32.66 -12.51%)Energy: FTSI (0.35 -17.36%), SDRL (0.76 -12.8%)12:56WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stocks trade lower midday, weakness in financial and industrial sectorsThe stock market is retracing some of its historic gains from last week, but the major indices are currently trading off session lows. The S&P 500 is down 1.5% after being down 2.5% today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-1.7%) has followed a similar path, while the Nasdaq Composite outperforms with a 0.5% decline.From a sector perspective, the real estate sector (-4.0%) is down the most, but weakness in the financials (-3.2%) and industrials (-3.0%) sectors is having an influential drag on the broader market. Bank stocks are faltering ahead of their Q1 earnings results this week, while an analyst downgrade of Caterpillar (CAT 114.36, -10.65, -8.5%) weighs on the industrials group.Interestingly, the energy sector (-0.4%) trades lower despite a multinational agreement to cut oil production, while the consumer discretionary sector (+0.1%) bucks the broader trend amid strength in shares of Amazon (AMZN 2133.37, +90.61, +4.4%). Amazon is ramping up efforts to meet strong customer demand.Specifying the production agreement, OPEC and other non-OPEC members agreed to cut production by 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, which will then taper to 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31 and 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022.

However, the influential sector has been able to stay ahead of the broader market, thanks to a show of relative strength from several chipmakers. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is down 0.3%, narrowing its April gain to 5.7%.The chipmaker group is resisting the bulk of the pressure that is weighing on the broader market, partly due to an understanding that the sudden shift toward remote work should increase demand for computers and other networking products.

Every sector is down, except the energy sector (+0.1%) which is drawing support from a bump in oil prices ($23.32, +0.56, +2.5%) that has followed news of a production cut agreement.OPEC and other non-OPEC members said they would cut 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, then 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31, and then 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022. Some think the cut is still not enough to offset the demand destruction from COVID-19. That consideration, and underlying concerns about compliance, help explain why oil prices aren't popping more on the news.The stock market, meanwhile, is grappling with doubts about the pace and shape of the economic recovery in spite of the generous fiscal and monetary policy stimulus actions. That is giving way to broad-based selling interest led by the real estate (-3.8%), financial (-3.7%), utilities (-3.5%), industrials (-3.1%), and materials (-2.6%) sectors.Worries about the shape of things to come are also wrapped up in some angst tied to the Q1 earnings results that will be heard this week from the banks. In particular, market participants are bracing for sizable increases in loan-loss provisions that will weigh on full-year earnings potential.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%; the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 2.0%; and the Russell 2000 is down 2.7%.10:35JPM JPMorgan Chase First Quarter Earnings Preview (99.81 -2.92)JP Morgan (JPM) will report first quarter earnings tomorrow before the open. There is a conference call scheduled for 8:30. Q1 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.20 (-14% yr/yr) on revenue of $29.5 bln (+1% yr/yr). As its most recent investor day on February 25 (which occurred prior to COVID-19 related shutdowns), the company said it expected FY20 net interest income of $57 bln and FY21 of $60 bln or higher and FY20 net revenue build. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank will consider suspending dividend only during "extremely adverse conditions."JPM shares are down by over 25% from its highs as the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the banking industry. Banks like JPM are expected to see increased loan loss provisions due to coronavirus. In addition, lower interest rates spreads are expected to negatively impact probability.Looking back, the company beat on EPS and revenues every quarter since Q4 of 2018. Looking back at Q4, some encouraging takeaways from the report include. An 8.4% yr/yr increase in reported Q4 revenue, a 21% increase in net income, and a 30% yr/yr increase in EPS of $2.57, which handily topped the consensus estimate.JPM has a $305.0 bln valuation and trades at ~14 FY20 EPS estimates.Based on the weekly JPM Apr $100 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~7% in either direction by April expiration (Friday, April 17).10:14OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:MRO Apr 5 calls are seeing interest with 1520 contracts trading vs. open int of 7580, pushing implied vol up around 28 points to ~166%.

The group has already gained 17.6% since the end of March, which puts the sector well ahead of its peers.The growth-sensitive group outperforms today thanks to a rally in crude oil. WTI crude is currently up $0.65, or 2.9%, at $23.41/bbl after enduring a volatile finish to last week. Today's advance follows news of an OPEC+ agreement to reduce oil output between May 1 and June 30 by 9.7 mln barrels per day.Notable movers:Marathon Oil (MRO 4.39, +0.27, +6.7%) Cabot Oil & Gas (COG 19.92, +1.04, +5.5%)Apache (APA 8.62, +0.64, +5.2%) Cimarex (XEC 18.66, +0.70, +3.8%) Devon Energy (DVN 10.02, +0.35, +3.5%) National Oilwell Varco (NOV 12.01, +0.41, +3.5%) Pioneer Resources (PXD 77.98, +2.50, +3.3%)09:42F Ford Motor sees Q1 revs above consensus; is considering a scenario for a phased restart of its manufacturing plants, supply network and other dependent functions beginning in Q2 (5.11 )Co issues upside guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $34 bln vs. $31.87 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.He added that Ford's first-quarter vehicle wholesales were down 21 percent from a year ago, largely as a result of lower production and demand related to the coronavirus. Ford currently expects to report revenue of about $34 billion and first-quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of about negative $0.6 billion, which excludes about $0.3 billion of special-item charges. The company has not yet calculated its tax rate for the first quarter and is not able to provide its preliminary net loss or loss per share, but anticipates valuation allowance adjustments against deferred-tax assets of about $0.9 billion.In March, Ford suspended its $0.6 billion regular quarterly dividend and antidilutive share repurchase program. Stone said the company is taking other steps to preserve cash, including by lowering operating costs, reducing capital expenditures and deferring portions of executive salaries. As of April 9, the company had about $30 billion in cash on its balance sheet, including$15.4 billion of proceeds from borrowings last month against two existing credit lines. Presently, only Ford's joint ventures in China, where coronavirus risks developed earlier and are now moderating, are producing and wholesaling vehicles. The company is considering a scenario for a phased restart of its manufacturing plants, supply network and other dependent functions beginning in the second quarter, with enhanced safety standards in place to protect workers. Any decisions on resumptions will be made in cooperation with local unions, suppliers, dealers and other stakeholders.09:42WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens session slightly lowerThe major indices start the session in negative territory with the S&P 500 down 0.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.2%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the energy sector (+0.9%) bucking the broader trend after OPEC+ and the U.S. agreed to cut oil production.

[Co's guidance was $350-370 mln in revenues. Q1 Capital IQ consensus calls for revenue of $358.2 mln.] While the business was trending at or above the high end of our guidance range for the first 10 weeks of the quarter, like most businesses, we experienced a swift change in customer behavior in the middle of March when the pandemic took hold across the country." "Initially, we observed a decrease in orders across our entire business as the news upended typical routines and there was considerable uncertainty about what day-to-day life would be like. In particular, our corporate business, which accounted for a mid-single digit percentage of our orders in the fourth quarter, was dramatically impacted in mid-March as virtually all of our corporate clients shifted to work-from-home models.""Exiting the first quarter and in the beginning of the second quarter, we have seen trends improve significantly -- so far in April our overall year-over-year DAG growth has been approximately 10%. In markets less affected by the outbreak, diner ordering has returned to, and in many cases exceeded, our pre-COVID-19 expectations. We are also seeing record numbers of new diners and new restaurants on the platform.""While we are confident we could generate meaningful profits in the second quarter that would keep us comfortably on the previously announced path to deliver at least $100 million of Adjusted EBITDA in 2020, we are instead planning to reinvest most of the profits we expect to generate during the second quarter into programs that directly drive more business to our restaurant partners. [...] As a result, we plan to intentionally manage the business to approximately $5 million of Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter to continue to support our ecosystem. To be clear, this is a completely discretionary short-term business decision designed to support our industry. We are proud that our consistent profitability, highly variable cost structure and strong balance sheet afford us ample liquidity (approximately $600 million as of March 31, including $175 million we added from our revolver) and flexibility during times like these." "We are confident that our ability to manage our business profitably while competing aggressively has not changed, but because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of when and how the COVID-19 outbreak will resolve, we believe it's prudent to withdraw our full year 2020 revenue and EBITDA guidance."09:05GLRE Greenlight Capital reports prelim Q1 results (6.42 )The company expects its results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 to reflect:A net loss of $38 million to $43 million or ($1.05) to ($1.19) per fully diluted share.Net premiums written of $107 million to $112 millionNet premiums earned of $109 million to $114 millionThe company expects a fully diluted book value per share as of March 31, 2020 of $11.56 to $11.69.09:04EBAY eBay names Jamie Iannone CEO, effective April 27 (33.83 )Most recently Mr. Iannone was Chief Operating Officer of Walmart eCommerce (WMT).

The Bank also announced today selected preliminary first quarter results and is withdrawing its 2020 full year guidance given the uncertainty and lack of visibility resulting from the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and related disruption to Mexican, regional and global economic activity.Co expects to report results for the first quarter of 2020 showing a modest increase in net income, in line with the 2020 guidance previously announced, together with fourth quarter 2019 results, which were reported on January 30, 2020. While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during this period has been significant in general, co believes that the first quarter 2020 results will not yet significantly reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic given that the quarantine in Mexico only began after the second week of March 2020. Co expects that results in the remainder of 2020 will likely be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the extent of the pandemic's impact dependent in part on how long quarantine and social distancing requirements and practices and resulting restrictions on the Mexican and international global economy remain in place. Since co believes the pandemic will have a continuing negative impact on co for 2020, it does not expect to be able to achieve the 2020 financial results targeted in guidance provided in January of 2020.

This transition combined with a strong balance sheet has allowed the company to avoid any meaningful deterioration of its liquidity position resulting from the COVID-19 crisis at this time.DaVita commends the swift and bold action by the federal government through HHS to support healthcare providers, like DaVita, in this time of crisis. While the details of the program have not been announced, the expressed intent of the CARES Act is to help defray the significant healthcare-related expenses and lost revenue attributable to COVID-19. DaVita expects that the short-term financial impact of COVID-19 resulting from its increased costs, lost revenue and its increase in the treatment of the uninsured, may be offset by the CARES Act payment DaVita received of approximately $ 240 million.Because of the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, DaVita's future results could vary materially from the guidance we have provided. DaVita believes the long-term impact of COVID-19 will be primarily driven by the severity and duration of the pandemic, the pandemic's impact on the U.S. and global economies and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses.06:04JELD JELD-WEN: Steves wins preliminary injunction against JELD in new lawsuit, requiring JELD to comply with Doorskin supply agreement (11.53 )Judge cited "substantial likelihood, amounting to a near certainty, that steves will succeed on the merits" at trial.In the first suit filed in June 2016, Steves claimed that JELD-WEN violated the federal antitrust laws in 2012 when it merged with a competitor.

Of course, the Fed would protest that direct support is not in its mandate, but neither is the ability to purchase junk bond ETFs or collateralized debt obligations, which can now be acquired by the Fed. The central bank also added another $2.30 trln in emergency lending capacity for businesses and municipalities. Fed Chairman, Jay Powell, said that the central bank will continue using its powers forcefully, proactively, and aggressively.In Europe, the Bank of England announced that it will begin directly financing the U.K.'s fiscal needs while German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, rejected Italy's demand for the issuance of joint euro debt.Also of note, the Japanese government will reportedly spend up to $2.20 bln to help Japanese manufacturers move their production facilities out of China.Equities backpedaled from their highs in the afternoon, but ten out of eleven sectors were able to finish in the green. The gains were paced by groups like financials (+5.2%), real estate (+5.2%), and utilities (+4.8%).The top-weighted technology sector (UNCH) lagged, which was also the case earlier in the week. The sector climbed 10.6% for the week while chipmakers also underperformed today. The PHLX Semiconductor Index lost 2.3%, narrowing this week's gain to 11.0%.Costco (COST 300.01, -5.96, -2.0%) reported a 12.1% jump in domestic comparable sales in March, but its stock finished lower since the market had already priced in strong March sales.The energy sector (-1.1%) turned negative in the afternoon amid volatility in crude oil. That volatility followed conflicting headlines from the OPEC+ meeting, where producers struggled to agree to a large output cut. The Wall Street Journal reported in the late afternoon that daily output in May and June will be reduced by ten million barrels. Crude oil ended the day lower by $2.30, or 9.1%, at $22.87/bbl.Treasuries finished near their highs, sending the 10-yr yield lower by four basis points to 0.73%.The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.6% to 99.50, widening this week's loss to 1.0%.Reviewing today's economic data:It was another dismal initial claims report, with 6.606 million jobless claims filed for the week ending April 4 (Briefing.com consensus 5.000 million), bringing the three-week total to 13,476,307 after revisions. Continuing claims for the week ending March 28 hit a record high 7.455 millionThe key takeaway from the jobless claims data is that the number of filings is simply astounding and a true sign of the vast impact of the sudden economic stop. Unfortunately, it likely still doesn't capture the fullness of the impact as it's reasonable to assume that the system for filing claims is overwhelmed and not facilitating every effort to file for jobless benefitsThe preliminary reading for the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index for April plummeted to 71.0 (Briefing.com consensus 79.3) from 89.1 in March.

Core PPI was up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus -0.1%) The key takeaway from the report is that it doesn't fully reflect the impact of the COVID-19 shutdown measures as the pricing date for the survey was March 10 Wholesale inventories decreased by 0.7% in February (Briefing.com consensus -0.4%) after decreasing a revised 0.6% (from -0.4%) in JanuaryThere is no data scheduled for Monday.Nasdaq Composite -9.1% YTD S&P 500 -13.7% YTD Dow Jones Industrial Average -16.9% YTD Russell 2000 -25.3% YTD16:20WCC Wesco: Anixter shareholders vote to approve previously-announced merger (26.47 +1.64)WCC provides update regarding its previously announced merger with Anixter (AXE).Earlier today, Anixter held a special meeting of stockholders; The merger was approved by approximately 99.42% of the votes cast at the special meeting, which represented approximately 82.26% of the total outstanding shares of Anixter common stock.

Perhaps some skittishness regarding the loan-loss reserves these banks are accruing contributed to the influential drag from the S&P 500 financials sector (-3.6%).Sellers were kept in check, though, as stocks drifted sideways for most of the session and closed well off intraday lows after a brief tumble after the open. The S&P 500 real estate sector (-4.6%) declined the most, while the consumer discretionary sector (+1.1%) finished comfortably in positive territory.Interestingly, a multinational agreement to cut oil production was unable to stir much enthusiasm within the energy sector (-0.4%). Specifically, OPEC and other non-OPEC members agreed to cut production by 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, then 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31, and then 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022.WTI crude futures struggled for direction and ultimately settled the session down 2.0%, or $0.45, to $22.42/bbl, suggesting that investors were not convinced that the production cuts alone would save an industry still facing demand problems caused by COVID-19. The economy is expected to gradually reopen in May, but the speed and scope of a recovery remained uncertain.Investors' appetite for growth, meanwhile, continued to lead buyers toward technology companies, including Amazon (AMZN 2168.87, +126.11, +6.2%), Apple (AAPL 273.25, +5.26, +2.0%), and Netflix (NFLX 396.72, +26.00, +7.0%). Amazon stepped up efforts to meet strong customer demand, while Netflix benefited from a positive note in Barron's.Separately, shares of Caterpillar (CAT 114.14, -10.89, -8.7%) dropped nearly 9% after the stock was downgraded to Underperform from Neutral at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.U.S. Treasuries ended the quiet session on a lower note. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.23%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 0.75%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 99.42.Investors did not receive any economic data on Monday. Looking ahead, investors will receive Import and Export Prices for March on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite -8.7% YTDS&P 500 -14.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -18.0% YTDRussell 2000 -27.4% YTD16:17XENT Intersect ENT issues downside Q1 revs guidance and withdraws 2020 guidance; taken pre-emptive actions to curtail spending (11.76 +0.03)Co sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $19.5-19.8 mln vs. $26.53 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. "Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, our efforts to enhance commercial execution and improve market access infrastructure were beginning to yield benefits as our first quarter 2020 sales were tracking to prior year and in-line with our expectations. However, sales trailed off throughout March as the various COVID-19 restrictions were implemented. While our business has and will be impacted by hospitals suspending elective surgical procedures and reduced ENT office visits, we are maintaining our customer-focus and taking the necessary actions to maintain continuity. To that end, we proactively implemented initiatives to reduce costs, maintain liquidity and preserve our cash to enable us to navigate this challenge and return to growth." Due to the rapidly evolving environment and continued uncertainties resulting from the impact of COVID-19, the Company is withdrawing its previously announced annual guidance for 2020, which was issued on February 24, 2020. At this date, the Company cannot predict the extent or duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its financial and operating results, but believes current government policies, including the suspension of elective procedures worldwide, will substantially impact its revenues in the second quarter of 2020 and potentially longer. While the financial impact will certainly impact near term results, the Company believes the actions it has taken will enable it to maintain its ability to return to growth as the current crisis subsides.16:14STRL Sterling Construction was awarded "significant" projects and increases to the scope on existing projects totaling ~$100 million during Q1 2020 (9.03 -0.27)The site development projects included distribution centers for the e-commerce platform and retail grocers, a major children's hospital expansion and an industrial location.

Key secondary endpoints included overall survival and safety. The safety profile of tislelizumab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy was consistent with the known risks of each study treatment, and no new safety signals were identified.BeiGene plans to discuss its plans for filing a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for tislelizumab as a first-line treatment for non-squamous NSCLC with the Center for Drug Evaluation at the National Medical Products Administration in China and to present detailed data at upcoming medical conferences.16:12TMDX TransMedics Group guides Q1 revs slightly above consensus; withdraws 2020 guidance (14.51 -0.54)Co issues upside guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $7.4-7.5 mln vs. $6.87 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Co has taken preemptive measures to reduce near-term expenses, including reducing all non-essential discretionary expenses across the organization, and deferring a portion of executive and employee compensation.

"Prior to the impacts from COVID-19 spreading across the globe, FIS achieved strong revenue growth. As U.S. and foreign governmental authorities imposed social distancing, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders, spending declined, most notably in travel, restaurants, entertainment, and retail, resulting in a rapid deterioration in payments volume and transaction trends on a worldwide basis beginning in March, 2020 which adversely impacted revenue in our payments businesses that earn transaction based fees... We had previously projected revenue of $3,180 to $3,210 million during the first quarter of 2020, representing an increase of approximately 55% to 56% over the prior year period. Organic revenue growth was previously estimated to be 5% to 6% during the first quarter of 2020, including approximately $10 million in anticipated negative foreign exchange impact.""In response to COVID-19, we are taking several actions to manage discretionary expenses and achieve cost synergies, including limiting travel, reducing incentive compensation and decreasing third-party spending as well as accelerating automation and functional alignment across the organization."16:11FIVE Five Below announces additional actions in response to COVID-19 (79.77 -3.21)As previously announced on March 31, Five Below extended the temporary closures of its stores and will reopen stores as soon as federal, state and local authorities allow, targeting May 1.

The majority of the investment includes transforming its Hartsville, S.C., corrugated medium machine (No. 10 machine) into a state-of-the-art URB machine with annual production capacity of approximately 180,000 tons. As a result of the Hartsville No. 10 machine conversion, Sonoco will be exiting the corrugated medium market by the end of 2021, and the expected efficiency of the converted machine will give the Company the opportunity to rationalize some of the higher cost assets in its mill system.15:58SCANX Large cap notable movers of interest -- Caterpillar (CAT) pulls back following analyst downgrade -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable large cap movers of interest ($10 bln - $200 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Large Cap GainersTSLA (648.33 +3.15%): Spikes to one-month highs.

Treasuries started the cash session on a modestly lower note after overnight action saw a weak start from Asian markets while European indices remained closed for Easter. The coronavirus situation continued improving in closely watched places like New York, which supported the growing belief that parts of the U.S. economy will begin reopening soon. However, Minneapolis Fed President, Neel Kashkari, who appeared on CBS on Sunday, had a different view, saying that he expects 18 months of rolling shutdowns unless a medical breakthrough takes place. Meanwhile, Fed Vice Chair, Richard Clarida, acknowledged this morning that the coronavirus will have a disinflationary impact, but he said that the Fed has tools to avoid deflation. Treasuries began the day with modest losses and the 10-yr note remained near its starting level until the close. The long bond underperformed, finishing near its morning low, while shorter tenors underperformed intraday, but narrowed their losses ahead of the close. Gold had another good day, climbing to a level not seen since October 2012. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.2% to 99.37. Yield Check: 2-yr: +1 bp to 0.23% 3-yr: +1 bp to 0.31% 5-yr: +2 bps to 0.43% 10-yr: +2 bps to 0.75% 30-yr: +4 bps to 1.39%News: Senator Bernie Sanders endorsed Joe Biden's candidacy for president.

[...] This has in turn significantly reduced global economic activity and resulted in airlines dramatically cutting back on flights and a decrease in motor vehicle use at a time when seasonal driving patterns typically result in an increase of consumer demand for gasoline. As a result, there has also been a decline in the demand for, and thus also the market prices of, crude oil and certain of our products, particularly our refined petroleum products and most notably gasoline and jet fuel.""In addition, recent events concerning the dispute over production levels between Russia and the members of [OPEC], particularly Saudi Arabia, [...] have exacerbated the decline in crude oil prices and have contributed to an increase in crude oil price volatility.""The decrease in the demand for refined petroleum products coupled with the decline in the price of crude oil has resulted in a significant decrease in the price of the refined petroleum products manufactured by our refining segment. Because ethanol is primarily blended into gasoline, ethanol demand has declined along with the decline in the demand for gasoline, and the price of the products manufactured by our ethanol segment have also decreased. Essential businesses [...] continue to operate, blunting the decrease in the demand for diesel. Demand for renewable diesel is consistent with the demand for diesel as a whole; therefore, our renewable diesel segment has not been impacted as significantly as our refining and ethanol segments.""In late March and through early April 2020, we started reducing the amount of crude oil processed at most of our refineries in response to the decreased demand for our products, we temporarily idled various gasoline-making units at certain of our refineries to further limit gasoline production, and we took measures to reduce jet fuel production. We also temporarily idled eight of our ethanol plants, and we reduced the amount of corn feedstock processed at our remaining six ethanol plants to address the decreased demand for ethanol.""We expect to defer or delay certain capital expenditures which we had expected to make in 2020 related to our refining and ethanol segments. [...] We have not purchased any shares of our common stock since mid-March 2020, and will evaluate the timing of repurchases when appropriate.""Furthermore, as a result of the uncertainties concerning COVID-19 and global oil markets, we have withdrawn our prior financial and operational guidance with respect to the first quarter 2020 and fiscal year 2020 and such prior guidance should no longer be relied on."Co issues guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $20.1-22.2 bln vs. $17.76 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Net loss attributable to Valero Energy stockholders is expected to be $(2.1)-(1.83) bln.14:32COMDX Energy Settlement PricesMay Crude Oil futures fell $0.03 (-0.13%) to $22.73/barrel May Natural Gas $0.03 lower (-1.67%) at $1.704/MMBtu May RBOB Gasoline settled $0.03 higher (4.24%) at $0.706/gallon May Heating oil futures settled $0.03 higher (3.18%) at $1.0035/gallon13:57SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/ Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: noneTomorrow Morning: CONN FAST FRC INFY JNJ JPM OGI WFC13:44XLRE Sector Briefing: Real Estate (34.00 -1.53)Ten sectors trade in negative territory this afternoon, with the real estate sector (-4.6%) sitting at the bottom of the leaderboard.Real estate has been among the hardest hit sectors during the market's recent bout with historical volatility.

Among recent items, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority put out a notice late last week in which it announced that following an in-depth investigation, the CMA is blocking co's proposed takeover of Farelogix; per the CMA's statement, the CMA "found that Sabre's purchase of Farelogix could result in less innovation in their services, leading to fewer new features that may be released more slowly" and that such a purchase could also drive up fees for certain products, leaving "airlines, travel agents and UK passengers [...] worse off" as a result. The US District Court of Delaware had decided to clear the deal several days earlier.

During its Q4 report in January, the company guided for 2020, estimating that reported adjusted EPS for 2020 will be between $8.95-9.10 and that operational sales will increase 4.5-5.5% yr/yr to $85.8-86.6 bln. S&P Capital IQ consensus now calls for EPS of $8.17 and revenues of $79.80 bln for the current fiscal year. The company does not typically issue guidance on a quarterly basis. In the last four quarters, Johnson & Johnson topped expectations for EPS four times while issuing generally in-line or upside revenues in each quarter; revenues for Q4 were slightly below consensus, impacted by a deceleration in sales growth for the company's largest segment, Pharmaceutical, and by a decline in Baby Care products globally within the Consumer segment.

The S&P 500 is down 1.5% after being down 2.5% today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-1.7%) has followed a similar path, while the Nasdaq Composite outperforms with a 0.5% decline.From a sector perspective, the real estate sector (-4.0%) is down the most, but weakness in the financials (-3.2%) and industrials (-3.0%) sectors is having an influential drag on the broader market. Bank stocks are faltering ahead of their Q1 earnings results this week, while an analyst downgrade of Caterpillar (CAT 114.36, -10.65, -8.5%) weighs on the industrials group.Interestingly, the energy sector (-0.4%) trades lower despite a multinational agreement to cut oil production, while the consumer discretionary sector (+0.1%) bucks the broader trend amid strength in shares of Amazon (AMZN 2133.37, +90.61, +4.4%). Amazon is ramping up efforts to meet strong customer demand.Specifying the production agreement, OPEC and other non-OPEC members agreed to cut production by 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, which will then taper to 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31 and 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022. WTI crude futures are only up 1.8% to $23.16/bbl amid unresolved demand problems.Separately, talk has shifted to how the U.S. should proceed with reopening the economy, which could start to reopen as soon as May 1. The consensus is that less-infected parts of the country will get back to work before urban areas, but worries remain about potential mishaps. President Trump said earlier today that a coordinated decision with governors will be made "shortly."U.S. Treasuries have been relatively quiet today with the benchmark 10-yr yield currently down one basis point to 0.73%.

However, the influential sector has been able to stay ahead of the broader market, thanks to a show of relative strength from several chipmakers. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is down 0.3%, narrowing its April gain to 5.7%.The chipmaker group is resisting the bulk of the pressure that is weighing on the broader market, partly due to an understanding that the sudden shift toward remote work should increase demand for computers and other networking products.

Every sector is down, except the energy sector (+0.1%) which is drawing support from a bump in oil prices ($23.32, +0.56, +2.5%) that has followed news of a production cut agreement.OPEC and other non-OPEC members said they would cut 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, then 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31, and then 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022. Some think the cut is still not enough to offset the demand destruction from COVID-19. That consideration, and underlying concerns about compliance, help explain why oil prices aren't popping more on the news.The stock market, meanwhile, is grappling with doubts about the pace and shape of the economic recovery in spite of the generous fiscal and monetary policy stimulus actions. That is giving way to broad-based selling interest led by the real estate (-3.8%), financial (-3.7%), utilities (-3.5%), industrials (-3.1%), and materials (-2.6%) sectors.Worries about the shape of things to come are also wrapped up in some angst tied to the Q1 earnings results that will be heard this week from the banks. In particular, market participants are bracing for sizable increases in loan-loss provisions that will weigh on full-year earnings potential.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%; the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 2.0%; and the Russell 2000 is down 2.7%.10:35JPM JPMorgan Chase First Quarter Earnings Preview (99.81 -2.92)JP Morgan (JPM) will report first quarter earnings tomorrow before the open. There is a conference call scheduled for 8:30. Q1 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.20 (-14% yr/yr) on revenue of $29.5 bln (+1% yr/yr). As its most recent investor day on February 25 (which occurred prior to COVID-19 related shutdowns), the company said it expected FY20 net interest income of $57 bln and FY21 of $60 bln or higher and FY20 net revenue build. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank will consider suspending dividend only during "extremely adverse conditions."JPM shares are down by over 25% from its highs as the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the banking industry. Banks like JPM are expected to see increased loan loss provisions due to coronavirus. In addition, lower interest rates spreads are expected to negatively impact probability.Looking back, the company beat on EPS and revenues every quarter since Q4 of 2018. Looking back at Q4, some encouraging takeaways from the report include. An 8.4% yr/yr increase in reported Q4 revenue, a 21% increase in net income, and a 30% yr/yr increase in EPS of $2.57, which handily topped the consensus estimate.JPM has a $305.0 bln valuation and trades at ~14 FY20 EPS estimates.Based on the weekly JPM Apr $100 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~7% in either direction by April expiration (Friday, April 17).10:14OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:MRO Apr 5 calls are seeing interest with 1520 contracts trading vs. open int of 7580, pushing implied vol up around 28 points to ~166%.

The group has already gained 17.6% since the end of March, which puts the sector well ahead of its peers.The growth-sensitive group outperforms today thanks to a rally in crude oil. WTI crude is currently up $0.65, or 2.9%, at $23.41/bbl after enduring a volatile finish to last week. Today's advance follows news of an OPEC+ agreement to reduce oil output between May 1 and June 30 by 9.7 mln barrels per day.Notable movers:Marathon Oil (MRO 4.39, +0.27, +6.7%) Cabot Oil & Gas (COG 19.92, +1.04, +5.5%)Apache (APA 8.62, +0.64, +5.2%) Cimarex (XEC 18.66, +0.70, +3.8%) Devon Energy (DVN 10.02, +0.35, +3.5%) National Oilwell Varco (NOV 12.01, +0.41, +3.5%) Pioneer Resources (PXD 77.98, +2.50, +3.3%)09:42F Ford Motor sees Q1 revs above consensus; is considering a scenario for a phased restart of its manufacturing plants, supply network and other dependent functions beginning in Q2 (5.11 )Co issues upside guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $34 bln vs. $31.87 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.He added that Ford's first-quarter vehicle wholesales were down 21 percent from a year ago, largely as a result of lower production and demand related to the coronavirus. Ford currently expects to report revenue of about $34 billion and first-quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of about negative $0.6 billion, which excludes about $0.3 billion of special-item charges. The company has not yet calculated its tax rate for the first quarter and is not able to provide its preliminary net loss or loss per share, but anticipates valuation allowance adjustments against deferred-tax assets of about $0.9 billion.In March, Ford suspended its $0.6 billion regular quarterly dividend and antidilutive share repurchase program. Stone said the company is taking other steps to preserve cash, including by lowering operating costs, reducing capital expenditures and deferring portions of executive salaries. As of April 9, the company had about $30 billion in cash on its balance sheet, including$15.4 billion of proceeds from borrowings last month against two existing credit lines. Presently, only Ford's joint ventures in China, where coronavirus risks developed earlier and are now moderating, are producing and wholesaling vehicles. The company is considering a scenario for a phased restart of its manufacturing plants, supply network and other dependent functions beginning in the second quarter, with enhanced safety standards in place to protect workers. Any decisions on resumptions will be made in cooperation with local unions, suppliers, dealers and other stakeholders.09:42WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens session slightly lowerThe major indices start the session in negative territory with the S&P 500 down 0.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.2%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the energy sector (+0.9%) bucking the broader trend after OPEC+ and the U.S. agreed to cut oil production.

[Co's guidance was $350-370 mln in revenues. Q1 Capital IQ consensus calls for revenue of $358.2 mln.] While the business was trending at or above the high end of our guidance range for the first 10 weeks of the quarter, like most businesses, we experienced a swift change in customer behavior in the middle of March when the pandemic took hold across the country." "Initially, we observed a decrease in orders across our entire business as the news upended typical routines and there was considerable uncertainty about what day-to-day life would be like. In particular, our corporate business, which accounted for a mid-single digit percentage of our orders in the fourth quarter, was dramatically impacted in mid-March as virtually all of our corporate clients shifted to work-from-home models.""Exiting the first quarter and in the beginning of the second quarter, we have seen trends improve significantly -- so far in April our overall year-over-year DAG growth has been approximately 10%. In markets less affected by the outbreak, diner ordering has returned to, and in many cases exceeded, our pre-COVID-19 expectations. We are also seeing record numbers of new diners and new restaurants on the platform.""While we are confident we could generate meaningful profits in the second quarter that would keep us comfortably on the previously announced path to deliver at least $100 million of Adjusted EBITDA in 2020, we are instead planning to reinvest most of the profits we expect to generate during the second quarter into programs that directly drive more business to our restaurant partners. [...] As a result, we plan to intentionally manage the business to approximately $5 million of Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter to continue to support our ecosystem. To be clear, this is a completely discretionary short-term business decision designed to support our industry. We are proud that our consistent profitability, highly variable cost structure and strong balance sheet afford us ample liquidity (approximately $600 million as of March 31, including $175 million we added from our revolver) and flexibility during times like these." "We are confident that our ability to manage our business profitably while competing aggressively has not changed, but because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of when and how the COVID-19 outbreak will resolve, we believe it's prudent to withdraw our full year 2020 revenue and EBITDA guidance."09:05GLRE Greenlight Capital reports prelim Q1 results (6.42 )The company expects its results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 to reflect:A net loss of $38 million to $43 million or ($1.05) to ($1.19) per fully diluted share.Net premiums written of $107 million to $112 millionNet premiums earned of $109 million to $114 millionThe company expects a fully diluted book value per share as of March 31, 2020 of $11.56 to $11.69.09:04EBAY eBay names Jamie Iannone CEO, effective April 27 (33.83 )Most recently Mr. Iannone was Chief Operating Officer of Walmart eCommerce (WMT).

Given the difficultly in predicting how long this pandemic will persist and its full impact, we continue to look at all opportunities to preserve liquidity. This includes taking advantage of our vertically integrated business model to adjust production schedules to match current demand and tightly manage labor costs, including furloughing roughly 35% of our permanent workforce. We also have the ability to immediately adjust our significant discretionary online advertising spend in response to any changes in DTC trends as they develop. In addition to the previously announced cash compensation deferments for senior executives and directors of the board and 5% paid-in-kind interest deferral for the first two quarters of 2020 under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we are temporarily reducing our capital spend by delaying all non-maintenance related projects and investments in non-essential initiatives and headcount additions until we have better visibility into when conditions normalize. We believe the strength of our digital business, along with these cash-preserving efforts, combined with our cash balance of more than $26 million at March 31, 2020, will set us up to weather this crisis."07:33BDC Belden lowers Q1 EPS and revenue guidasnce (37.33 )Co issues lowered guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees EPS of $0.64-0.69 from $0.70-0.85 vs. $0.72 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $460-465 mln from $485-505 mln vs. $484.40 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus."Our first quarter results were tracking in line with our expectations through February, but some of our facilities, along with our customers and suppliers, are now experiencing varying levels of disruption related to the global pandemic.

DaVita expects that the short-term financial impact of COVID-19 resulting from its increased costs, lost revenue and its increase in the treatment of the uninsured, may be offset by the CARES Act payment DaVita received of approximately $ 240 million.Because of the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, DaVita's future results could vary materially from the guidance we have provided. DaVita believes the long-term impact of COVID-19 will be primarily driven by the severity and duration of the pandemic, the pandemic's impact on the U.S. and global economies and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses.06:04JELD JELD-WEN: Steves wins preliminary injunction against JELD in new lawsuit, requiring JELD to comply with Doorskin supply agreement (11.53 )Judge cited "substantial likelihood, amounting to a near certainty, that steves will succeed on the merits" at trial.In the first suit filed in June 2016, Steves claimed that JELD-WEN violated the federal antitrust laws in 2012 when it merged with a competitor.

The S&P 500 gained 1.5%, extending this week's advance to 12.1% while the Nasdaq (+0.8%) underperformed but still gained 10.6% for the week.The market climbed out of the gate after the release of another horrific weekly initial claims report was masked by news of more unprecedented action from the Fed to help none of the 16 million people who got fired over the past three weeks. Of course, the Fed would protest that direct support is not in its mandate, but neither is the ability to purchase junk bond ETFs or collateralized debt obligations, which can now be acquired by the Fed. The central bank also added another $2.30 trln in emergency lending capacity for businesses and municipalities. Fed Chairman, Jay Powell, said that the central bank will continue using its powers forcefully, proactively, and aggressively.In Europe, the Bank of England announced that it will begin directly financing the U.K.'s fiscal needs while German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, rejected Italy's demand for the issuance of joint euro debt.Also of note, the Japanese government will reportedly spend up to $2.20 bln to help Japanese manufacturers move their production facilities out of China.Equities backpedaled from their highs in the afternoon, but ten out of eleven sectors were able to finish in the green.

That volatility followed conflicting headlines from the OPEC+ meeting, where producers struggled to agree to a large output cut. The Wall Street Journal reported in the late afternoon that daily output in May and June will be reduced by ten million barrels. Crude oil ended the day lower by $2.30, or 9.1%, at $22.87/bbl.Treasuries finished near their highs, sending the 10-yr yield lower by four basis points to 0.73%.The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.6% to 99.50, widening this week's loss to 1.0%.Reviewing today's economic data:It was another dismal initial claims report, with 6.606 million jobless claims filed for the week ending April 4 (Briefing.com consensus 5.000 million), bringing the three-week total to 13,476,307 after revisions. Continuing claims for the week ending March 28 hit a record high 7.455 millionThe key takeaway from the jobless claims data is that the number of filings is simply astounding and a true sign of the vast impact of the sudden economic stop. Unfortunately, it likely still doesn't capture the fullness of the impact as it's reasonable to assume that the system for filing claims is overwhelmed and not facilitating every effort to file for jobless benefitsThe preliminary reading for the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index for April plummeted to 71.0 (Briefing.com consensus 79.3) from 89.1 in March.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4%, and the Russell 2000 fell 2.8%.There wasn't much conviction in today's session ahead of the Q1 earnings reports from the leading U.S. banks this week. Perhaps some skittishness regarding the loan-loss reserves these banks are accruing contributed to the influential drag from the S&P 500 financials sector (-3.6%).Sellers were kept in check, though, as stocks drifted sideways for most of the session and closed well off intraday lows after a brief tumble after the open. The S&P 500 real estate sector (-4.6%) declined the most, while the consumer discretionary sector (+1.1%) finished comfortably in positive territory.Interestingly, a multinational agreement to cut oil production was unable to stir much enthusiasm within the energy sector (-0.4%). Specifically, OPEC and other non-OPEC members agreed to cut production by 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, then 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31, and then 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022.WTI crude futures struggled for direction and ultimately settled the session down 2.0%, or $0.45, to $22.42/bbl, suggesting that investors were not convinced that the production cuts alone would save an industry still facing demand problems caused by COVID-19. The economy is expected to gradually reopen in May, but the speed and scope of a recovery remained uncertain.Investors' appetite for growth, meanwhile, continued to lead buyers toward technology companies, including Amazon (AMZN 2168.87, +126.11, +6.2%), Apple (AAPL 273.25, +5.26, +2.0%), and Netflix (NFLX 396.72, +26.00, +7.0%). Amazon stepped up efforts to meet strong customer demand, while Netflix benefited from a positive note in Barron's.Separately, shares of Caterpillar (CAT 114.14, -10.89, -8.7%) dropped nearly 9% after the stock was downgraded to Underperform from Neutral at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.U.S. Treasuries ended the quiet session on a lower note. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.23%, and the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 0.75%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 99.42.Investors did not receive any economic data on Monday. Looking ahead, investors will receive Import and Export Prices for March on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite -8.7% YTDS&P 500 -14.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -18.0% YTDRussell 2000 -27.4% YTD16:17XENT Intersect ENT issues downside Q1 revs guidance and withdraws 2020 guidance; taken pre-emptive actions to curtail spending (11.76 +0.03)Co sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $19.5-19.8 mln vs. $26.53 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. "Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, our efforts to enhance commercial execution and improve market access infrastructure were beginning to yield benefits as our first quarter 2020 sales were tracking to prior year and in-line with our expectations. However, sales trailed off throughout March as the various COVID-19 restrictions were implemented. While our business has and will be impacted by hospitals suspending elective surgical procedures and reduced ENT office visits, we are maintaining our customer-focus and taking the necessary actions to maintain continuity. To that end, we proactively implemented initiatives to reduce costs, maintain liquidity and preserve our cash to enable us to navigate this challenge and return to growth." Due to the rapidly evolving environment and continued uncertainties resulting from the impact of COVID-19, the Company is withdrawing its previously announced annual guidance for 2020, which was issued on February 24, 2020. At this date, the Company cannot predict the extent or duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its financial and operating results, but believes current government policies, including the suspension of elective procedures worldwide, will substantially impact its revenues in the second quarter of 2020 and potentially longer. While the financial impact will certainly impact near term results, the Company believes the actions it has taken will enable it to maintain its ability to return to growth as the current crisis subsides.16:14STRL Sterling Construction was awarded "significant" projects and increases to the scope on existing projects totaling ~$100 million during Q1 2020 (9.03 -0.27)The site development projects included distribution centers for the e-commerce platform and retail grocers, a major children's hospital expansion and an industrial location.

Treasuries started the cash session on a modestly lower note after overnight action saw a weak start from Asian markets while European indices remained closed for Easter. The coronavirus situation continued improving in closely watched places like New York, which supported the growing belief that parts of the U.S. economy will begin reopening soon. However, Minneapolis Fed President, Neel Kashkari, who appeared on CBS on Sunday, had a different view, saying that he expects 18 months of rolling shutdowns unless a medical breakthrough takes place. Meanwhile, Fed Vice Chair, Richard Clarida, acknowledged this morning that the coronavirus will have a disinflationary impact, but he said that the Fed has tools to avoid deflation. Treasuries began the day with modest losses and the 10-yr note remained near its starting level until the close. The long bond underperformed, finishing near its morning low, while shorter tenors underperformed intraday, but narrowed their losses ahead of the close. Gold had another good day, climbing to a level not seen since October 2012. The U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.2% to 99.37.

[...] This has in turn significantly reduced global economic activity and resulted in airlines dramatically cutting back on flights and a decrease in motor vehicle use at a time when seasonal driving patterns typically result in an increase of consumer demand for gasoline. As a result, there has also been a decline in the demand for, and thus also the market prices of, crude oil and certain of our products, particularly our refined petroleum products and most notably gasoline and jet fuel.""In addition, recent events concerning the dispute over production levels between Russia and the members of [OPEC], particularly Saudi Arabia, [...] have exacerbated the decline in crude oil prices and have contributed to an increase in crude oil price volatility.""The decrease in the demand for refined petroleum products coupled with the decline in the price of crude oil has resulted in a significant decrease in the price of the refined petroleum products manufactured by our refining segment. Because ethanol is primarily blended into gasoline, ethanol demand has declined along with the decline in the demand for gasoline, and the price of the products manufactured by our ethanol segment have also decreased. Essential businesses [...] continue to operate, blunting the decrease in the demand for diesel. Demand for renewable diesel is consistent with the demand for diesel as a whole; therefore, our renewable diesel segment has not been impacted as significantly as our refining and ethanol segments.""In late March and through early April 2020, we started reducing the amount of crude oil processed at most of our refineries in response to the decreased demand for our products, we temporarily idled various gasoline-making units at certain of our refineries to further limit gasoline production, and we took measures to reduce jet fuel production. We also temporarily idled eight of our ethanol plants, and we reduced the amount of corn feedstock processed at our remaining six ethanol plants to address the decreased demand for ethanol.""We expect to defer or delay certain capital expenditures which we had expected to make in 2020 related to our refining and ethanol segments. [...] We have not purchased any shares of our common stock since mid-March 2020, and will evaluate the timing of repurchases when appropriate.""Furthermore, as a result of the uncertainties concerning COVID-19 and global oil markets, we have withdrawn our prior financial and operational guidance with respect to the first quarter 2020 and fiscal year 2020 and such prior guidance should no longer be relied on."Co issues guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $20.1-22.2 bln vs. $17.76 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Net loss attributable to Valero Energy stockholders is expected to be $(2.1)-(1.83) bln.14:32COMDX Energy Settlement PricesMay Crude Oil futures fell $0.03 (-0.13%) to $22.73/barrel May Natural Gas $0.03 lower (-1.67%) at $1.704/MMBtu May RBOB Gasoline settled $0.03 higher (4.24%) at $0.706/gallon May Heating oil futures settled $0.03 higher (3.18%) at $1.0035/gallon13:57SUMRX Earnings Out This Afternoon/ Tomorrow MorningThis Afternoon: noneTomorrow Morning: CONN FAST FRC INFY JNJ JPM OGI WFC13:44XLRE Sector Briefing: Real Estate (34.00 -1.53)Ten sectors trade in negative territory this afternoon, with the real estate sector (-4.6%) sitting at the bottom of the leaderboard.Real estate has been among the hardest hit sectors during the market's recent bout with historical volatility.

The energy sector shows relative leadership at this juncture, supported by a bump in oil prices that followed news that a multinational production cut agreement has been reached. Other energy industry names outperforming include ENLC, RTLR, NBLX... DRD (8.84 +19.78%): Surges to a new three-year high on above 3x average volume. Gold stocks generally see strength. (Related: NGD, SBSW...) ATHX (3.44 +18.11%): The FDA authorized co to initiate a Phase 2/3 study to assess the safety and efficacy of MultiStem therapy in subjects with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by the novel coronavirus disease; a new IND will not need to be filed for the program, and co plans to open the first clinical sites for recruitment of this MACOVIA study this quarter.Small Cap LosersSABR (5.55 -20.79%): Pulls back on more than 2x average volume, moderating last week's circa +63% gains. Among recent items, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority put out a notice late last week in which it announced that following an in-depth investigation, the CMA is blocking co's proposed takeover of Farelogix; per the CMA's statement, the CMA "found that Sabre's purchase of Farelogix could result in less innovation in their services, leading to fewer new features that may be released more slowly" and that such a purchase could also drive up fees for certain products, leaving "airlines, travel agents and UK passengers [...] worse off" as a result. The US District Court of Delaware had decided to clear the deal several days earlier. Mizuho commented in a note that it views the CMA's decision as a positive for co's shares, as it believes that the acquisition "would have significantly reduced SABR's financial flexibility at a crucial time"; Mizuho raised co's target to $5 from $3. AMC (2.09 -19.81%): Reports suggest that co is hiring a law firm to explore a potential bankruptcy filing. Hearing downgraded to Sell at B. Riley FBR. Sees continued volatility on above average volume. CYH (3.22 -16.58%): Pulls back after advancing by circa +37% last week.

During its Q4 report in January, the company guided for 2020, estimating that reported adjusted EPS for 2020 will be between $8.95-9.10 and that operational sales will increase 4.5-5.5% yr/yr to $85.8-86.6 bln. S&P Capital IQ consensus now calls for EPS of $8.17 and revenues of $79.80 bln for the current fiscal year. The company does not typically issue guidance on a quarterly basis. In the last four quarters, Johnson & Johnson topped expectations for EPS four times while issuing generally in-line or upside revenues in each quarter; revenues for Q4 were slightly below consensus, impacted by a deceleration in sales growth for the company's largest segment, Pharmaceutical, and by a decline in Baby Care products globally within the Consumer segment. The company commented in mid-March that its supply chain was holding steady amid COVID-19 disruptions and that it was taking measures to maximize the availability of its over-the-counter medicine portfolio during the crisis. Meanwhile, the company's Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies unit has been engaged in attempting to combat the outbreak by collaborating with BARDA and other agencies to fund and conduct vaccine research, development, and clinical testing; at the end of March, it announced that it had selected a lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate and that it expected to initiate human clinical studies of the candidate by September at latest.JNJ has a market cap of circa $365 bln and trades at roughly 17x forward earnings estimates. After experiencing significant volatility in recent weeks alongside the broader market, the stock currently trades lower by circa 7% since the company's Q4 earnings release in January.13:00SCANX Today's most active stocks -Technical-The following are today's most active stocks ranked by volume and relative volume, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 volume Healthcare: ACB (41.47 mln -14.4%)Industrials: GE (54.4 mln -3.85%), DAL (53.04 mln -6.6%), AAL (48.67 mln -7.59%), UAL (24.26 mln -7.29%)Consumer Discretionary: F (59.19 mln -5.59%), CCL (55.43 mln -7.25%), NIO (24.52 mln +9.37%), NCLH (23.48 mln -12.5%)Information Technology: AMD (39.17 mln +2.88%)Financials: MFA (46.41 mln -5.56%), BAC (39.43 mln -3.46%), SQQQ (37.68 mln +0.6%), TQQQ (29.52 mln -0.44%)Energy: CHK (74.64 mln -5.65%), MRO (36.98 mln +3.69%), OXY (30.5 mln -0.91%), ET (25.13 mln +3.87%), APA (24.82 mln +0.91%), CPE (24.12 mln -0.59%)Today's top relative volume (current volume to 1-month average daily volume) Healthcare: BCRX (2.65x +12.8%), NTRA (1.65x -8.38%), TXMD (1.64x -10.06%), MESO (1.34x -2.95%)Consumer Discretionary: NLS (3.91x +23.4%), AGS (1.47x -2.04%), TUP (1.46x -6.3%), NEW (1.37x +10.7%)Information Technology: DOMO (1.94x +16.98%), SABR (1.55x -23.14%)Financials: VRIG (2.04x -0.4%), VTIP (1.63x +0.18%), ESGE (1.53x -0.56%), MITT (1.47x -3.2%)Energy: FET (2.51x +16.91%), PVAC (1.63x +21.34%), SM (1.49x +19.43%), HLX (1.46x +3.64%), OIS (1.35x +15.98%)12:58SCANX Today's biggest % gainers/losers -Technical-The following are today's top 20 percentage gainers and top 20 percentage losers, categorized by sectors (over $300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume).Today's top 20 % gainers Healthcare: LXRX (2.14 +13.83%), BCRX (2.34 +12.8%)Materials: NGD (0.66 +12.59%)Consumer Discretionary: NLS (4.64 +23.4%), CVNA (70.6 +15.07%), GME (4.47 +14.91%), NEW (4.76 +10.7%)Information Technology: DOMO (13.71 +16.98%)Energy: ENBL (3.35 +23.62%), PVAC (3.81 +21.34%), SM (2.09 +19.43%), LPI (0.47 +18.73%), FET (0.27 +16.91%), ENLC (1.25 +16.82%), OIS (2.8 +15.98%), OMP (5.3 +11.81%), USAC (7.96 +11.71%), GPOR (0.72 +10.83%), BTU (3.7 +10.78%), NBLX (5.04 +10.77%)Today's top 20 % losers Healthcare: CYH (3.23 -16.32%), ACB (0.75 -14.4%)Materials: VNTR (1.46 -13.39%)Industrials: WBT (4.46 -13.4%)Consumer Discretionary: EXPR (2.12 -17.83%), CCS (16.04 -15.4%), RCL (34.47 -14.31%), HZO (10.4 -13.88%), FOXF (43.47 -13.85%), EAT (14.92 -13.71%), LGIH (47.52 -13.19%), NCLH (11.47 -12.5%), KBH (19.75 -12.49%)Information Technology: SABR (5.38 -23.14%), BDC (32.66 -12.51%)Energy: FTSI (0.35 -17.36%), SDRL (0.76 -12.8%)12:56WRAPX Midday Market Summary: Stocks trade lower midday, weakness in financial and industrial sectorsThe stock market is retracing some of its historic gains from last week, but the major indices are currently trading off session lows. The S&P 500 is down 1.5% after being down 2.5% today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-1.7%) has followed a similar path, while the Nasdaq Composite outperforms with a 0.5% decline.From a sector perspective, the real estate sector (-4.0%) is down the most, but weakness in the financials (-3.2%) and industrials (-3.0%) sectors is having an influential drag on the broader market. Bank stocks are faltering ahead of their Q1 earnings results this week, while an analyst downgrade of Caterpillar (CAT 114.36, -10.65, -8.5%) weighs on the industrials group.Interestingly, the energy sector (-0.4%) trades lower despite a multinational agreement to cut oil production, while the consumer discretionary sector (+0.1%) bucks the broader trend amid strength in shares of Amazon (AMZN 2133.37, +90.61, +4.4%). Amazon is ramping up efforts to meet strong customer demand.Specifying the production agreement, OPEC and other non-OPEC members agreed to cut production by 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, which will then taper to 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31 and 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022. WTI crude futures are only up 1.8% to $23.16/bbl amid unresolved demand problems.Separately, talk has shifted to how the U.S. should proceed with reopening the economy, which could start to reopen as soon as May 1. The consensus is that less-infected parts of the country will get back to work before urban areas, but worries remain about potential mishaps. President Trump said earlier today that a coordinated decision with governors will be made "shortly."U.S. Treasuries have been relatively quiet today with the benchmark 10-yr yield currently down one basis point to 0.73%.

However, the influential sector has been able to stay ahead of the broader market, thanks to a show of relative strength from several chipmakers. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is down 0.3%, narrowing its April gain to 5.7%.The chipmaker group is resisting the bulk of the pressure that is weighing on the broader market, partly due to an understanding that the sudden shift toward remote work should increase demand for computers and other networking products. Intel (INTC 58.11, +0.97, +1.7%) CEO, Bob Swann, confirmed late last week that demand for the company's processors increased in Q1.Notable movers:AMD (AMD 49.46, +1.08, +2.2%): best performer in the group, trading near last week's high with its 50-day moving average (47.46) looming just below.

Every sector is down, except the energy sector (+0.1%) which is drawing support from a bump in oil prices ($23.32, +0.56, +2.5%) that has followed news of a production cut agreement.OPEC and other non-OPEC members said they would cut 9.7 mb/d from May 1-June 30, then 7.7 mb/d from July 1-Dec. 31, and then 5.8 mb/d from Jan. 1, 2021-April 30, 2022. Some think the cut is still not enough to offset the demand destruction from COVID-19. That consideration, and underlying concerns about compliance, help explain why oil prices aren't popping more on the news.The stock market, meanwhile, is grappling with doubts about the pace and shape of the economic recovery in spite of the generous fiscal and monetary policy stimulus actions. That is giving way to broad-based selling interest led by the real estate (-3.8%), financial (-3.7%), utilities (-3.5%), industrials (-3.1%), and materials (-2.6%) sectors.Worries about the shape of things to come are also wrapped up in some angst tied to the Q1 earnings results that will be heard this week from the banks. In particular, market participants are bracing for sizable increases in loan-loss provisions that will weigh on full-year earnings potential.The Nasdaq Composite is down 1.0%; the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 2.0%; and the Russell 2000 is down 2.7%.10:35JPM JPMorgan Chase First Quarter Earnings Preview (99.81 -2.92)JP Morgan (JPM) will report first quarter earnings tomorrow before the open. There is a conference call scheduled for 8:30. Q1 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $2.20 (-14% yr/yr) on revenue of $29.5 bln (+1% yr/yr). As its most recent investor day on February 25 (which occurred prior to COVID-19 related shutdowns), the company said it expected FY20 net interest income of $57 bln and FY21 of $60 bln or higher and FY20 net revenue build. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank will consider suspending dividend only during "extremely adverse conditions."JPM shares are down by over 25% from its highs as the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the banking industry. Banks like JPM are expected to see increased loan loss provisions due to coronavirus. In addition, lower interest rates spreads are expected to negatively impact probability.Looking back, the company beat on EPS and revenues every quarter since Q4 of 2018. Looking back at Q4, some encouraging takeaways from the report include. An 8.4% yr/yr increase in reported Q4 revenue, a 21% increase in net income, and a 30% yr/yr increase in EPS of $2.57, which handily topped the consensus estimate.JPM has a $305.0 bln valuation and trades at ~14 FY20 EPS estimates.Based on the weekly JPM Apr $100 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~7% in either direction by April expiration (Friday, April 17).10:14OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:MRO Apr 5 calls are seeing interest with 1520 contracts trading vs. open int of 7580, pushing implied vol up around 28 points to ~166%.

The group has already gained 17.6% since the end of March, which puts the sector well ahead of its peers.The growth-sensitive group outperforms today thanks to a rally in crude oil. WTI crude is currently up $0.65, or 2.9%, at $23.41/bbl after enduring a volatile finish to last week. Today's advance follows news of an OPEC+ agreement to reduce oil output between May 1 and June 30 by 9.7 mln barrels per day.Notable movers:Marathon Oil (MRO 4.39, +0.27, +6.7%) Cabot Oil & Gas (COG 19.92, +1.04, +5.5%)Apache (APA 8.62, +0.64, +5.2%) Cimarex (XEC 18.66, +0.70, +3.8%) Devon Energy (DVN 10.02, +0.35, +3.5%) National Oilwell Varco (NOV 12.01, +0.41, +3.5%) Pioneer Resources (PXD 77.98, +2.50, +3.3%)09:42F Ford Motor sees Q1 revs above consensus; is considering a scenario for a phased restart of its manufacturing plants, supply network and other dependent functions beginning in Q2 (5.11 )Co issues upside guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees Q1 (Mar) revs of $34 bln vs. $31.87 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.He added that Ford's first-quarter vehicle wholesales were down 21 percent from a year ago, largely as a result of lower production and demand related to the coronavirus. Ford currently expects to report revenue of about $34 billion and first-quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of about negative $0.6 billion, which excludes about $0.3 billion of special-item charges. The company has not yet calculated its tax rate for the first quarter and is not able to provide its preliminary net loss or loss per share, but anticipates valuation allowance adjustments against deferred-tax assets of about $0.9 billion.In March, Ford suspended its $0.6 billion regular quarterly dividend and antidilutive share repurchase program. Stone said the company is taking other steps to preserve cash, including by lowering operating costs, reducing capital expenditures and deferring portions of executive salaries. As of April 9, the company had about $30 billion in cash on its balance sheet, including$15.4 billion of proceeds from borrowings last month against two existing credit lines. Presently, only Ford's joint ventures in China, where coronavirus risks developed earlier and are now moderating, are producing and wholesaling vehicles. The company is considering a scenario for a phased restart of its manufacturing plants, supply network and other dependent functions beginning in the second quarter, with enhanced safety standards in place to protect workers. Any decisions on resumptions will be made in cooperation with local unions, suppliers, dealers and other stakeholders.09:42WRAPX Opening Market Summary: Stock market opens session slightly lowerThe major indices start the session in negative territory with the S&P 500 down 0.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.2%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the energy sector (+0.9%) bucking the broader trend after OPEC+ and the U.S. agreed to cut oil production.

[Co's guidance was $350-370 mln in revenues. Q1 Capital IQ consensus calls for revenue of $358.2 mln.] While the business was trending at or above the high end of our guidance range for the first 10 weeks of the quarter, like most businesses, we experienced a swift change in customer behavior in the middle of March when the pandemic took hold across the country." "Initially, we observed a decrease in orders across our entire business as the news upended typical routines and there was considerable uncertainty about what day-to-day life would be like. In particular, our corporate business, which accounted for a mid-single digit percentage of our orders in the fourth quarter, was dramatically impacted in mid-March as virtually all of our corporate clients shifted to work-from-home models.""Exiting the first quarter and in the beginning of the second quarter, we have seen trends improve significantly -- so far in April our overall year-over-year DAG growth has been approximately 10%. In markets less affected by the outbreak, diner ordering has returned to, and in many cases exceeded, our pre-COVID-19 expectations. We are also seeing record numbers of new diners and new restaurants on the platform.""While we are confident we could generate meaningful profits in the second quarter that would keep us comfortably on the previously announced path to deliver at least $100 million of Adjusted EBITDA in 2020, we are instead planning to reinvest most of the profits we expect to generate during the second quarter into programs that directly drive more business to our restaurant partners. [...] As a result, we plan to intentionally manage the business to approximately $5 million of Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter to continue to support our ecosystem. To be clear, this is a completely discretionary short-term business decision designed to support our industry. We are proud that our consistent profitability, highly variable cost structure and strong balance sheet afford us ample liquidity (approximately $600 million as of March 31, including $175 million we added from our revolver) and flexibility during times like these." "We are confident that our ability to manage our business profitably while competing aggressively has not changed, but because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of when and how the COVID-19 outbreak will resolve, we believe it's prudent to withdraw our full year 2020 revenue and EBITDA guidance."09:05GLRE Greenlight Capital reports prelim Q1 results (6.42 )The company expects its results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 to reflect:A net loss of $38 million to $43 million or ($1.05) to ($1.19) per fully diluted share.Net premiums written of $107 million to $112 millionNet premiums earned of $109 million to $114 millionThe company expects a fully diluted book value per share as of March 31, 2020 of $11.56 to $11.69.09:04EBAY eBay names Jamie Iannone CEO, effective April 27 (33.83 )Most recently Mr. Iannone was Chief Operating Officer of Walmart eCommerce (WMT).

This includes taking advantage of our vertically integrated business model to adjust production schedules to match current demand and tightly manage labor costs, including furloughing roughly 35% of our permanent workforce. We also have the ability to immediately adjust our significant discretionary online advertising spend in response to any changes in DTC trends as they develop. In addition to the previously announced cash compensation deferments for senior executives and directors of the board and 5% paid-in-kind interest deferral for the first two quarters of 2020 under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we are temporarily reducing our capital spend by delaying all non-maintenance related projects and investments in non-essential initiatives and headcount additions until we have better visibility into when conditions normalize.

The majority of patients in this international cohort demonstrated clinical improvement and no new safety signals were identified with remdesivir treatment. Compassionate use data have limitations and multiple Phase 3 studies are ongoing to determine the safety and efficacy of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19. The detailed results of this analysis were published today in The New England Journal of Medicine. Remdesivir is not yet licensed or approved anywhere globally and has not been demonstrated to be safe or effective for the treatment of COVID-19. Nearly two thirds of patients (64 percent, n=34/53) in this cohort were on mechanical ventilation at baseline, including four patients also on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Treatment with remdesivir resulted in an improvement in oxygen support class for 68 percent of patients (n=36/53) over a median follow-up of 18 days from the first dose of remdesivir. More than half of patients on mechanical ventilation were extubated (57 percent, n=17/30) and nearly half of all patients (47 percent, n=25/53) were discharged from the hospital following treatment with remdesivir.06:14SRC Spirit Realty Capital sees AFFO above consensus (30.36 )Co issues upside guidance for Q1 (Mar), sees adjusted funds from operations of $0.77-0.79 vs. $0.74 S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Maintained strong operational performance, with occupancy of 99.4%, Lost Rent of 0.6% and Property Cost Leakage of 2.4%.

This transition combined with a strong balance sheet has allowed the company to avoid any meaningful deterioration of its liquidity position resulting from the COVID-19 crisis at this time.DaVita commends the swift and bold action by the federal government through HHS to support healthcare providers, like DaVita, in this time of crisis. While the details of the program have not been announced, the expressed intent of the CARES Act is to help defray the significant healthcare-related expenses and lost revenue attributable to COVID-19. DaVita expects that the short-term financial impact of COVID-19 resulting from its increased costs, lost revenue and its increase in the treatment of the uninsured, may be offset by the CARES Act payment DaVita received of approximately $ 240 million.Because of the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, DaVita's future results could vary materially from the guidance we have provided. DaVita believes the long-term impact of COVID-19 will be primarily driven by the severity and duration of the pandemic, the pandemic's impact on the U.S. and global economies and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses.06:04JELD JELD-WEN: Steves wins preliminary injunction against JELD in new lawsuit, requiring JELD to comply with Doorskin supply agreement (11.53 )Judge cited "substantial likelihood, amounting to a near certainty, that steves will succeed on the merits" at trial.In the first suit filed in June 2016, Steves claimed that JELD-WEN violated the federal antitrust laws in 2012 when it merged with a competitor.

While it is not clear how long this crisis will last, the impact it will have on consumer shopping behavior going forward, or how long it will take retailers to return to their traditional activities, we are committed to helping our retail partners meet the needs of those whom they serve every day.""As we outlined at our Investor Day in February, our recent growth had been very robust such that we were playing catch up to fulfill demand. With the onset of the COVID-19 global health crisis, our demand continued to accelerate as pet parents prioritized shopping for their pets' needs.

The S&P 500 gained 1.5%, extending this week's advance to 12.1% while the Nasdaq (+0.8%) underperformed but still gained 10.6% for the week.The market climbed out of the gate after the release of another horrific weekly initial claims report was masked by news of more unprecedented action from the Fed to help none of the 16 million people who got fired over the past three weeks. Of course, the Fed would protest that direct support is not in its mandate, but neither is the ability to purchase junk bond ETFs or collateralized debt obligations, which can now be acquired by the Fed. The central bank also added another $2.30 trln in emergency lending capacity for businesses and municipalities. Fed Chairman, Jay Powell, said that the central bank will continue using its powers forcefully, proactively, and aggressively.In Europe, the Bank of England announced that it will begin directly financing the U.K.'s fiscal needs while German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, rejected Italy's demand for the issuance of joint euro debt.Also of note, the Japanese government will reportedly spend up to $2.20 bln to help Japanese manufacturers move their production facilities out of China.Equities backpedaled from their highs in the afternoon, but ten out of eleven sectors were able to finish in the green. The gains were paced by groups like financials (+5.2%), real estate (+5.2%), and utilities (+4.8%).The top-weighted technology sector (UNCH) lagged, which was also the case earlier in the week. The sector climbed 10.6% for the week while chipmakers also underperformed today. The PHLX Semiconductor Index lost 2.3%, narrowing this week's gain to 11.0%.Costco (COST 300.01, -5.96, -2.0%) reported a 12.1% jump in domestic comparable sales in March, but its stock finished lower since the market had already priced in strong March sales.The energy sector (-1.1%) turned negative in the afternoon amid volatility in crude oil. That volatility followed conflicting headlines from the OPEC+ meeting, where producers struggled to agree to a large output cut. The Wall Street Journal reported in the late afternoon that daily output in May and June will be reduced by ten million barrels. Crude oil ended the day lower by $2.30, or 9.1%, at $22.87/bbl.Treasuries finished near their highs, sending the 10-yr yield lower by four basis points to 0.73%.The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.6% to 99.50, widening this week's loss to 1.0%.Reviewing today's economic data:It was another dismal initial claims report, with 6.606 million jobless claims filed for the week ending April 4 (Briefing.com consensus 5.000 million), bringing the three-week total to 13,476,307 after revisions. Continuing claims for the week ending March 28 hit a record high 7.455 millionThe key takeaway from the jobless claims data is that the number of filings is simply astounding and a true sign of the vast impact of the sudden economic stop. Unfortunately, it likely still doesn't capture the fullness of the impact as it's reasonable to assume that the system for filing claims is overwhelmed and not facilitating every effort to file for jobless benefitsThe preliminary reading for the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index for April plummeted to 71.0 (Briefing.com consensus 79.3) from 89.1 in March. This is the largest monthly decline on record The key takeaway from the report is that the more modest decline in the Expectations Index captures a feeling that the impact of the COVID-19 cases and death rates could soon peak, allowing for a restart of the economy The Producer Price Index for final demand declined 0.2% m/m in March (Briefing.com consensus -0.4%). Core PPI was up 0.2% (Briefing.com consensus -0.1%) The key takeaway from the report is that it doesn't fully reflect the impact of the COVID-19 shutdown measures as the pricing date for the survey was March 10 Wholesale inventories decreased by 0.7% in February (Briefing.com consensus -0.4%) after decreasing a revised 0.6% (from -0.4%) in JanuaryThere is no data scheduled for Monday.Nasdaq Composite -9.1% YTD S&P 500 -13.7% YTD Dow Jones Industrial Average -16.9% YTD Russell 2000 -25.3% YTD16:20WCC Wesco: Anixter shareholders vote to approve previously-announced merger (26.47 +1.64)WCC provides update regarding its previously announced merger with Anixter (AXE).Earlier today, Anixter held a special meeting of stockholders; The merger was approved by approximately 99.42% of the votes cast at the special meeting, which represented approximately 82.26% of the total outstanding shares of Anixter common stock.

Where local regulations permit, the company has limited its workforce to only essential production and maintenance.In response to the manufacturing slowdown caused by these various North American "shelter in place" or "stay at home" orders, the company is taking action to manage costs by enacting executive pay cuts and temporary furloughs, curtailing non-essential capital expenditures, and reducing expenses overall during this time.16:17LZB La-Z-Boy provides update on COVID-19 action plan (22.92 +2.03)With a continued focus on health, safety, and well-being, the company will continue to:Evaluate plans and timing to re-open the 155 company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores on a case by case basis; the company expects the cadence of store openings to vary.Evaluate plans and timing to re-start production at its US- and Mexico-based manufacturing facilities, in line with applicable federal, state, and local requirements and guidelines, as well as customer demand, with no firm date established; the company is monitoring health, safety, and market conditions continually and plans to open as conditions dictate.Operate its Regional Distribution Centers, adhering to safety guidelines, to deliver in-process orders.16:13CEMI Chembio Diagnostics collaborates with Stony Brook Medicine to identify coronavirus survivors (8.08 +0.64)Chembio Diagnostics today announced that its DPP COVID-19 serological point-of-care test for the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies has been selected for use in a Stony Brook Medicine effort to recruit patients who have recovered from COVID-19 infection. The study is intended to determine if convalescent blood plasma, the plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19, can help treat hospitalized patients with active COVID-19 infection. In early April, Stony Brook University Hospital received FDA approval to offer convalescent blood plasma treatment to its patients through a randomized, controlled study and is expected to enroll up to 500 patients from the Long Island area. The Chembio DPP COVID-19 test is being used to confirm that patients were infected with COVID-19 and now have adequate levels of IgG antibodies to make them eligible to donate convalescent plasma.16:08HA Hawaiian Holdings discloses "sharp declines" in March traffic amid COVID-19; has reduced scheduled service systemwide by 95% through April (11.82 +0.61)Hawaiian Airlines, a subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings, saw sharp declines in its system-wide traffic statistics in March 2020 as government mandated restrictions on travel in response to the COVID-19 pandemic became more numerous.Demand declines that began with US government restrictions on Chinese arrivals in late January accelerated in mid-March, when governments in Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, American Samoa and Hawai'i instituted requirements of self-isolation or quarantine for incoming arrivals. Hawaiian Airlines has responded to the diminishing demand by reducing its scheduled service systemwide by 95% through April 2020.In March, system-wide RPMs declined 40.9% yr/yr while ASMs fell 11.9% yr/yr; load factor was 58.0%, down from 86.4% one year ago.

BRIEFING ON TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING CORPORATION'S INTENT TO INVEST $12 BILLION IN THE U.S. AND ON THE CCP'S ABILITY TO UNDERMINE U.S. EXPORT CONTROLSStates News ServiceMay 15, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 5064 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Department of State:Keith Krach, Under Secretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and the EnvironmentMung Chiang, Science and Technology Adviser to the SecretaryOffice of the Science and Technology AdviserDr. Christopher Ashley Ford, Assistant SecretaryBureau of International Security and NonproliferationMS ORTAGUS: Thanks. Hello again, everyone. We're three for three briefings today. I know it's at the end of the day and we do a full Friday afternoon, so thank you so much for dialing in. Just a reminder that this call is on the record but is embargoed the contents are embargoed until the end of the call, please.We wanted to highlight two separate but related developments for your attention today. We note with pleasure that on May 14th, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, or TSMC, announced that it intends to invest 12 billion in the state of Arizona starting in 2021 to develop the most state-of-the-art five-nanometer semiconductor fabrication foundry in the world. The TSMC deal is a game changer for the U.S. semiconductor industry that will bolster American national security and our economic prosperity.Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced today its plan to restrict Huawei's ability to use U.S. technology and software to design and manufacture its semiconductors abroad. This action is intended to cut off Huawei's, and by extension, the PRC's, efforts to undermine U.S. export controls.To help put these events in broader context, I'm joined for this on-the-record briefing with Keith Krach, our under secretary for economic growth, energy, and the environment; as well as Assistant Secretary Chris Ford, who heads our Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation; and for QandA we have Mung Chiang, the Science and Technology Adviser to the Secretary. They'll all be available to answer your questions after their brief introductory statements.As always, the contents of this on-the-record briefing are embargoed until the end of the call, and to get into the question queue, please dial 1 and then 0. We'll start with Keith's opening statements first. Keith, go ahead.UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: All right, thanks so much, Morgan, and thanks to everyone for being here. A happy Friday to you. So this is a big day for America for national security, our economic security, and our long-term prosperity. And I'd like to highlight the three separate yet highly interrelated achievements of the week, and the first, as Morgan said, is the $12 billion investment by TSMC; the second is the tightening of export controls to restrain Huawei; and third, the continued implementation of the 5G Clean Path. Any of these alone is are newsworthy, but together they represent a 5G national security trifecta.And first let me turn to TSMC to give you an overview. TSMC will invest $12 billion, a truly massive sum, in perhaps one of the most historic onshorings in decades, and from 2021 to 2029 to develop the world's most advanced five-nanometer chip fabrication facility in Arizona. And this means that chips critical to our lives and national security will once again be made in America, where the semiconductor industry was first invented. The chips will power everything from smartphones in our pockets to 5G base stations to the F-35s that help defend our homeland.The deal is a game changer for the U.S. semiconductor industry. TSMC is bringing its supply chain companies to the United States. This is a giant leap towards bringing high-tech manufacturing back home where it belongs and keeping that commitment that President Trump has made. The fab and they call these manufacturing facilities "fabs" the fab will promote the creation of thriving, high-skilled sub-industries known as clusters, and that will help ensure American leadership in technologies of the future. And I want to say something about so highly skilled that in talking with the chairman of TSMC, over 50 percent of the employees that are going to work in this fab are going to have master's degrees or higher. And the clustering effect is perhaps unique to the semiconductor industry or at least really intensified, and that's where all that ecosystem builds up around. I mean, that's how Silicon Valley became Silicon Valley.The investment will of course create thousands of jobs across the entire supply chain and create a broad ripple effect of technical training and know-how throughout the tech ecosystem. TSMC will train hundreds of American workers on its leading-edge technologies in Taiwan, and these workers will bring skills back home, where they will proliferate. The deal will also spur cutting-edge research and development by American universities and campuses, and in particularly in the equipment manufacturers themselves.Not least of all, it strengthens our relationship with Taiwan, a vibrant democracy and a force for good in the world and a great friend to the United States. Yet again, President Trump is delivering on his pledge to make America stronger, safer, and more prosperous.Let me move on to the second part of that trifecta, and that's with the Foreign Direct Product Rule. All of this is also supported by the day's other big news: expansion of the Foreign Direct Product Rule to prevent Huawei from dodging U.S. export controls. And Dr. Ford will talk about this in detail after I complete my remarks, and I simply want to make this point: Since its addition to the entity list one year ago today, Huawei has persisted in its efforts to circumvent U.S. export controls. Huawei benefited from a loophole that allowed it to make use of U.S. electronic design software and manufacturing equipment to continue to produce its own semiconductors.That ends today. The United States is closing this loophole to prevent Huawei from exploiting U.S. technology and threatening our national security. Quite simply, Huawei cannot be trusted to respect the rule of law. It is required by the PRC to cooperate with Beijing's security and intelligence services, and that really relates to the law that I've talked with you many times about in terms of the National Intelligence Act of the PRC. We urge our allies and our partners to join us in aligning their domestic export-control laws to address the very real security threat posed by Huawei and the PRC. Huawei is a PRC state-supported firm serving as a tool for the Chinese Communist Party. The United States will continue to restrict most exports to Huawei.And the third part of that trifecta is the Clean Path. And let me call your attention to the State Department's 5G Clean Path initiative, and that was announced by Secretary Pompeo on April 29th. It said that 5G data entering or exiting U.S. diplomatic facilities, domestically and overseas, like in our embassies, must transit only through trusted equipment. The 5G Clean Path is an end-to-end communication path that does not use any 5G transmission, control, computing, or storage equipment from an untrusted vendor, including Huawei and ZTE. 5G Clean Path implementation in the 2019 NDAA prohibits U.S. executive agencies from procuring, obtaining, extending, or renewing contracts for any equipment, system, or telecommunications services that make the use of Huawei, ZTE, and Xiaomi, and other untrusted PRC vendor equipment.The 5G Clean Path embodies the highest standards of security against untrusted, high-risk vendors by blocking their ability to siphon sensitive information into the hands of the PRC. And we encourage all of our allies and partners to join us in requiring a 5G clean path for their diplomatic facilities overseas.So just to sum it up, each of these initiatives form a three-legged stool of trust, security, and resilience for the United States. Each reinforces the others and greatly augments U.S. national and economic security, especially as we're facing increasing competition from the PRC.The last five months can leave no doubt in the minds of any freedom-loving nation that the PRC is untrustworthy, and only by maintaining solidarity with our trusted partners can we guarantee a secure future for the United States, our companies, and our friends.So with that (inaudible) I'd like to turn it over to Dr. Ford for his comments.ASSISTANT SECRETARY FORD: Thank you, Keith, and good afternoon, everybody. As Under Secretary Krach noted, while major suppliers of semiconductors are clearly flocking to the United States to take advantage of the opportunities available here in America, the other piece of good news is that we are also in the Trump administration taking decisive steps to protect U.S. technology and suppliers from being exploited by Huawei and its masters in the PRC.We announced today the expansion of something called the Foreign Direct Product Rule, or FDPR, if you will, which is designed to help keep Huawei, as the Under Secretary indicated, from circumventing U.S. export controls. This expanded rule will impose a U.S. licensing requirement, an export-control licensing requirement whenever anyone anywhere in the world uses U.S. technology or software to design or produce semiconductors for Huawei. Companies wishing to sell certain items to Huawei produced with U.S. technology must now obtain a license from the United States.Now, this is done because we need to understand how Huawei is taking advantage of cutting-edge U.S. technology in this field, and we need to make it harder for Huawei to use this technology against us, against our allies, and against our partners. These licensing requirements will help us do that.The key issue today, and I'd like to add a bit of a gloss on what the Under Secretary had said, is why we are doing this and why the United States believes Huawei to be such a threat. And I would say that our concerns with Huawei are at least threefold. First of all, for starters, Huawei engages, clearly, in illegal activity, including intellectual property theft from U.S. companies and the evasion of U.S. sanctions, in support of the world's biggest state sponsor of terror and a notorious proliferator. The U.S. Department of Justice has issued not one but two indictments against Huawei for a range of crimes, including intellectual property theft, violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act that is to say, RICO and for helping Iran evade sanctions. This is not the sort of entity with which reputable U.S. or other foreign companies should be doing business as usual, and our changes reflect that.The second factor is that Huawei is an enabler for human rights abuses by the People's Republic of China. It provides technological support for Chinese Communist Party ethnic cleansing in Xinjiang, for example, and for the party's technologically facilitated surveillance-and-control authoritarianism throughout China. Huawei also helps make such technologies available for export to other repressive regimes. So that's the second factor.And the third one is that is perhaps in some ways the most troubling over time, and that is that because of the PRC's governance model and standing Chinese laws, Huawei is a company that is structurally subject to manipulation and to control by the Chinese Communist Party, essentially at any time. Whenever the party calls upon it, Huawei can function and indeed has no choice but to serve as a tool of strategic influence and political manipulation, including through providing support where it can to the PRC's broader military-civil fusion strategy for acquiring Western technology and diverting that technology to military and security uses that further the CCP's, the Chinese Communist Party's, repressive agenda at home and its geopolitical revisionism abroad.So in our view, U.S. national security simply requires that we put mechanisms in place to understand how U.S. exports and technology are being used by and for Huawei. These new licensing rules help to do that so that we can keep an eye on any malign activity that runs contrary to our foreign policy and national security interests, and indeed I would suggest those of all free and democratic countries.So for these reasons, we needed to take action to prevent Huawei from flaunting our export-control laws, exploiting American technology, and threatening our national security. And we would be happy to answer such questions as you might have as best we can about how it is specifically that we are doing that.But I should probably turn things back over to Morgan. Thanks.MS ORTAGUS: Thanks, Chris. I know we've got a queue started already. We're going to try our best to get through everybody in the queue. And again, just dial 1 and 0 if you'd like to be added.First up is from Reuters, we have Humeyra.QUESTION: Hello, can you hear me? Hi.MS ORTAGUS: Yes, we (inaudible).QUESTION: Thank you. Can I ask a couple of things? Can you comment on the timing of this? TSMC announced this investment, and the next day USG has moved to amend this export rule, which is something that could restrict its sales. Why now? And can you talk a little bit about whether this investment actually makes it easier for them to get the license?And lastly, can you talk a bit about the incentives that were given to TSMC? Was it federal money, tax breaks, what is the breakdown? Thank you so much.UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: First of all, with regard to the timing, the Direct Foreign Product Rule has been in the works for quite some time. So that was on a path to happen. And then also on a separate path were discussions with TSMC, and they actually announced on their earnings call on their last earnings call that they were looking at this. So they lined up together. And then it also lined up as well with the Clean Path.And I think now, nothing really happens by total coincidence, but this went on these particular days it actually did. But I think you'll also see future announcements in terms of different clean strategies coming down the road that will be rolled out, and we'll be having some other announcements in the June timeframe. We haven't set a date for it, but there's some more coming down the path.And I think a big thing in terms of the deal itself, the Trump administration is committed to advancing the reshoring of manufacturing, particularly for critical components such as semiconductors, and this is a strategic imperative for our national security. And the administration policies will help make TSMC successful in their investment in the United States, and it will provide the same benefits to other investors and companies in the semiconductor industry. Our objective is that U.S. chip manufacturers build all their future fabs in the U.S., and also that other foreign chip manufacturers build their next state-of-the-art fabs in the United States to really create that ecosystem.And the semiconductor was invented in the United States. We have tremendous capabilities here. Sixty percent of TSMC's customers are based in the United States. So that's kind of the rationale. So did I answer your question?ASSISTANT SECRETARY FORD: Okay. If I might, Keith, just to add someUNDER SECRETARY KRACH: Yeah, sure.ASSISTANT SECRETARY FORD: gloss on that, just to underline what the Under Secretary said, that both of these things moved entirely on their own steam and on their trajectories and timelines. It was actually quite surprising to me that they lined up to be so close in sequence, but they are conceptually different and moved for different reasons.I would say that the common element that they share in some respects is the fact that they are both in different ways reflections of the commanding comparative advantage that U.S. high technology skills and prowess and innovation in the realm of soft of semiconductor design and fabrication. We have an extraordinary position in the global technology ecosystem by virtue of the skills and efforts of U.S. companies in this respect. And they it's not surprising in light of that both that we will need both that our that the United States would be an attractive location for companies to come to and take advantage of all that we have in this country to offer, and at the same time that we would need to be careful about making sure that others did not exploit and try to gain inappropriate access to our technology moving forward.So these are both two sides of the same coin, but they are, in terms of timing, entirely coincidental.MS ORTAGUS: Thanks. Okay. Let's go over to Nick Wadhams from Bloomberg.QUESTION: Hi, thanks very much. I just wanted to try to put a finer point on Humeyra's question because I didn't hear an answer there, just two issues. Is there any understanding with TSMC as part of this deal that it will get a license given that it gets about 10 percent of its revenue from Huawei, that that business will not be affected? And is the federal government offering any incentives or subsidies to TSMC as part of this agreement? Thanks.UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: So the TSMC will not be granted a license or not granted a license based upon their commitment, their intent to build a five-nanometer fab here in the United States. So that's not part of it at all.If you look at this decision for their press announcement in the first place, it's really a result of they looked at the investment climate here in the U.S., and some of the statements they shared with us is President Trump's tax cuts, regulatory reform, workforce development, and an emphasis on the high-tech innovation is a big reason why they decided to make that $12 billion commitment, along with the as I mentioned, many of their main customers like Apple, (inaudible) Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, Nvidia are all customers, great customers for TSMC.And so and they and I think they were really successful and galvanizing their ecosystem as well. So and they looked at the workforce here as well. So and there's already a ecosystem here in the U.S. So I think it was a natural choice by them, but certainly one that reflects the great emphasis that President Trump has put on bringing jobs and back to the United States, and a particular interest of what our focus is at the State Department, and that's national security.MS ORTAGUS: Thanks.ASSISTANT SECRETARY FORD: And if I might, from my perspective, just to say that although we do not have someone from the Department of Commerce on the call, if we were to have someone from the Department of Commerce on this call, I have every confidence that they would be very, very clear and state unequivocally that all licenses are reviewed on their own merits and always will be.MS ORTAGUS: Thanks, guys. Hey, Ruben, my email is acting up. Can you tell me who's in the queue next, please? I'm sorry.MR HARUTUNIAN: Sure. We've got Asa Fitch from The Wall Street Journal next.QUESTION: Hi, guys. Thanks for doing this call. Where is this TSMC plant going to be exactly? We know Arizona; we don't know anything more specific than that. Does that depend on the incentives you can offer, the biggest ones? And then just to echo what some others have asked, what are the incentives that have been discussed?UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: With regard to the location in Arizona, the I don't think that's been 100 percent nailed down. I believe it might be somewhere around the Phoenix area, but it's not been 100 percent nailed down.In terms of the incentives, I know there is a number of things that the United States Congress is looking at. I think they they understood there's some really good possibilities coming down the road as well as the climate for this. And there's a lot we're doing in terms of RandD, and I think that was a big point to it. But and they did the math and it worked out for them.MS ORTAGUS: Great. Thanks. We now have Ana Swanson from The New York Times.QUESTION: Hi. Thank you so much for doing the call. I appreciate that. So setting the issue of the facility aside, do you think that TSMC will receive a license, or has the company received any assurances about the license? This right, it seems like this regulation on Huawei announced today could be quite a blow to the company, and there are some rumors and reports that TSMC had received some kind of assurance. And if they had not, would TSMC be reacting negatively to this measure that you announced today that could clamp down on their revenue? Thank you.UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: Well, I could say for a fact that there's no assurance whatsoever on that. And about I think roughly around 10 to 12 percent of TSMC's business is China, and I think that is in essence almost primarily Huawei, so they will be restricted unless they're granted a license. And there's no assurances on that, and we don't anticipate that.MS ORTAGUS: Thanks. Let's go over to Nick Schifrin, PBS.QUESTION: Hey, guys, thanks for thank you for doing this. Just wanted to switch over to 5G a little bit and have you zoom in on that. So the Secretary's talked about what you spoke about earlier in terms of trying to protect U.S. institutions around the world, U.S. facilities around the world from 5G. What does that look like? Does that look like, I don't know, some local businessman who wants to walk into the embassy can't have a Huawei phone or something much more specific about U.S. infrastructure? And can you talk about the larger effort to try and convince countries around the world to get, for example, Nokia or Erickson 5G when Huawei's been out front packaging 5G for over a year now? Thanks.UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: So just to put the Clean Path in the most simplistic terms, what that means is that for traffic coming in, let's say to a U.S. embassy or a U.S. military base, it cannot have touched a Huawei base station. Or if you have a Huawei to the TELCO providers, they have a Huawei tower and a Huawei antenna, they're going to need to put it in Ericsson or a Nokia one right alongside of it. So those technical details would be up to the TELCO operator. It definitely increases their cost if 5G Huawei is one of their vendors. And this is a 5G program, so most TELCO operators have not rolled out their pure 5G yet, but so it will be a significant cost. And I forgot what your second question was.MS ORTAGUS: Can ATandT, can unmute Nick Schifrin's line and let him re-ask?UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: And Mung, you may want to you may want to addMS ORTAGUS: Nick?QUESTION: Yes. Can you hear me now?MS ORTAGUS: Yes.UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: in terms of the Clean Path.QUESTION: If you can hear me, what I was asking about, the second question is the larger context of the 5G battle. As you guys know, Huawei's been packaging these 5G offers around the world for over a year. Obviously, you've been working with Nokia and Ericsson, so can you talk about the larger effort to try and convince countries not to buy these Huawei packages and instead consider the more expensive European ones?UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: Sure. And we've had a lot of discussions with countries as well as TELCO operators, and it boils down to one word and one word only. It's who do you trust. Because a lot of times people will say: Well, Nokia or Ericsson, they can't do the job, or we've we're only going to put them on the edge, or they've given us a written agreement that there will be no back doors. Well, the fact of the matter is that ATandT, Verizon T-Mobile, which is majority owned by Deutsche Telekom NTT Docomo they're all rolling out with Nokia, Ericsson, or Samsung, so they can do the job.In terms of hey, there's no back door. Well, anybody from Silicon Valley knows or anybody's who's been in the software business know there's no such thing as a back door. There's a front door every day because that software's being updated almost every day, so they could slip in there anything that they anything they want. And in terms of just putting it on the edge, well, a way to look at a 5G system, it's like a necklace with chains. You're only as strong as your weakest link. So once you're in, you're in.So the fact of the matter is that the IT vendors have the keys to the kingdom, and so it depends who do you trust. And when you look at Huawei and ZTE, coming from a country where they have a national intelligence act that requires any state-owned company or otherwise or any Chinese citizen to turn over any information, proprietary technology, intellectual property, or data upon request to the Chinese Communist Party or to the Chinese Government or the PLA. And if they don't, they have to suffer the consequences. Then I think countries and TELCO operators really understand that, and I think now citizens of the world do as well. And we're seeing that around the world.And the other thing, too, is sometimes we say well, it's so much less expensive, and I'll say to them, "Well, you're paying something, you're getting ripped off," because in a lot of cases, they're giving it away for free. And my question is: Why do you think they're giving it away for free? They want to be able to control it. They want to have access to the data.MS ORTAGUS: Great, thanks. Let's see. I think now we have Jeanne Whalen from Washington Post.QUESTION: Oh, hello. Won't the new commerce rule just incentivize fabs to buy their chip-making equipment from non-U.S. manufacturers? Like how hard would it be for GSMT or other fabs to just buy chip-making equipment from the Netherlands or other suppliers?UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: Well, I would say in response to that that it depends what one wants to make. And one of the virtues of this approach is that we've taken with the direct product rule is precisely that it does put foundries all around the world on a level playing field and makes it very difficult simply to substitute in foreign supply. With respect to the cutting edge of chip technology, the Chinese technology companies of course would very much like to and are working very hard to try to indigenize all aspects of the supply chain. But at least for the moment and for at least some time to come, U.S. companies have still a very significant comparative advantage when it comes to the largely software-facilitated design tools that are involved in producing the very best chips.One might be able to find non-U.S. providers for design tools for making somewhat less sophisticated chips, but if you really want to play on the cutting edge of this technology area right now, you still for the most part have to use U.S. technology. And so frankly, it's taking advantage of that relative position that enables the direct product rule change that we have just rolled out to be effective, because it applies to anyone who wishes to use the very best tools in support of Huawei. And it doesn't matter whether that user of those tools is in the United States or someplace else. So we regard this as a very elegant solution that in fact structurally does in fact address the concerns that you raise.MS ORTAGUS: Thanks. Thanks so much. And our last question is going to go to Nike Ching, Voice of America.QUESTION: Thank you. Good afternoon for this phone call. How much will this deal pave the way for U.S.-Taiwan free trade agreement? And is a free trade agreement with Taiwan still on the table? Thank you.UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: It by the way, it won't affect it at all. One thing that I can say, though, is we think it does nothing but strengthen the relationship between the United States and Taiwan. So nothing's changed in terms of those discussions, and Taiwan's been a great friend to the United States.QUESTION: And can IMS ORTAGUS: Great, thanks sure, go ahead, Nike. You can follow up.QUESTION: Yes, thank you. So a more technical question: For people who do not know much about the semiconductor like me, could you please help us understand the five-nanometer semiconductor technology? And what can they do? What is so such a game change deal, and why it's so, like, state of the art? Thank you.UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: By the way, Dr. Mung, if you're we haven't heard from you, and this probably would be a good one.DR CHIANG: Sure.UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: And Dr. Mung comes to us from Purdue University where he was dean of engineering. Before that he was dean of electrical engineering at Princeton, three-time entrepreneur, did his PhD in 5G. So Dr. Mung, I turn over to you.DR CHIANG: Thank you, Under Secretary Krach. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for sticking around. And I'm going to focus on this particular technology aspect of the first story, that is the very important TSMC investment in United States. And Under Secretary Krach summarized very well why this is a game-changer for the U.S. semiconductor industry that will bolster the American national security. And to answer the question just raised, indeed semiconductor is the backbone to the entire digital industry, going from artificial intelligence to autonomous vehicles to next-generation wireless networks. And indeed one can say that with this investment, now United States has a very vibrant 5G chip future. And this is the cutting-edge technology.Different generations of semiconductor technology is often labeled by the number, and smaller the number the better, because you will be able to do more with the same given resource. And this five-nanometer technology will be the cutting-edge one, not just in the U.S. but around the world, and coming from one of the pioneering companies in the entire industry, coming from Taiwan, as mentioned, friend to the United States. And we have seen bipartisan support of such research and development leadership here in the United States, and with this latest cutting-edge semiconductor investment, we can anticipate a full blossom just like the old Bell Lab days, if you will. We can now anticipate a full blossom of American innovations in the coming years. Thank you.MS ORTAGUS: Thanks, Mung. We appreciate that. Well listen, everybody, thank you so much for dialing in on a Friday. While we were on the call, we did issue, I believe Ruben, correct me if I'm wrong, but we went ahead and issued the Secretary's statement on the commerce action, is that right?MR HARUTUNIAN: That's right.MS ORTAGUS: Okay, great, so you all should have that in your queues as well. So thank you so much, Keith, Chris, Mung. We really appreciate it. And hope everyone has a great weekend.UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: Thank you.DR CHIANG: Thank you, everyone. Cheers.ASSISTANT SECRETARY FORD: Yes, thanks, Morgan. Have a great weekend.Load-Date: May 16, 2020End of Document

BRIEFING ON TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING CORPORATION'S INTENT TO INVEST $12B IN THE U.S. AND ON THE CCP'S ABILITY TO UNDERMINE U.S. EXPORT CONTROLSUS Fed NewsMay 15, 2020 Friday 6:38 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 5058 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, May 15 -- The U.S. Department of State issued the following press release:MS ORTAGUS: Thanks. Hello again, everyone. We're three for three briefings today. I know it's at the end of the day and we do a full Friday afternoon, so thank you so much for dialing in. Just a reminder that this call is on the record but is embargoed - the contents are embargoed - until the end of the call, please.We wanted to highlight two separate but related developments for your attention today. We note with pleasure that on May 14th, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, or TSMC, announced that it intends to invest 12 billion in the state of Arizona starting in 2021 to develop the most state-of-the-art five-nanometer semiconductor fabrication foundry in the world. The TSMC deal is a game changer for the U.S. semiconductor industry that will bolster American national security and our economic prosperity.Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced today its plan to restrict Huawei's ability to use U.S. technology and software to design and manufacture its semiconductors abroad. This action is intended to cut off Huawei's, and by extension, the PRC's, efforts to undermine U.S. export controls.To help put these events in broader context, I'm joined for this on-the-record briefing with Keith Krach, our under secretary for economic growth, energy, and the environment; as well as Assistant Secretary Chris Ford, who heads our Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation; and for Q&A we have Mung Chiang, the Science and Technology Adviser to the Secretary. They'll all be available to answer your questions after their brief introductory statements.As always, the contents of this on-the-record briefing are embargoed until the end of the call, and to get into the question queue, please dial 1 and then 0. We'll start with Keith's opening statements first. Keith, go ahead.UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: All right, thanks so much, Morgan, and thanks to everyone for being here. A happy Friday to you. So this is a big day for America - for national security, our economic security, and our long-term prosperity. And I'd like to highlight the three separate yet highly interrelated achievements of the week, and the first, as Morgan said, is the $12 billion investment by TSMC; the second is the tightening of export controls to restrain Huawei; and third, the continued implementation of the 5G Clean Path. Any of these alone is - are newsworthy, but together they represent a 5G national security trifecta.And first let me turn to TSMC to give you an overview. TSMC will invest $12 billion, a truly massive sum, in perhaps one of the most historic onshorings in decades, and from 2021 to 2029 to develop the world's most advanced five-nanometer chip fabrication facility in Arizona. And this means that chips critical to our lives and national security will once again be made in America, where the semiconductor industry was first invented. The chips will power everything from smartphones in our pockets to 5G base stations to the F-35s that help defend our homeland.The deal is a game changer for the U.S. semiconductor industry. TSMC is bringing its supply chain companies to the United States. This is a giant leap towards bringing high-tech manufacturing back home where it belongs and keeping that commitment that President Trump has made. The fab - and they call these manufacturing facilities "fabs" - the fab will promote the creation of thriving, high-skilled sub-industries known as clusters, and that will help ensure American leadership in technologies of the future. And I want to say something about so highly skilled that in talking with the chairman of TSMC, over 50 percent of the employees that are going to work in this fab are going to have master's degrees or higher. And the clustering effect is perhaps unique to the semiconductor industry or at least really intensified, and that's where all that ecosystem builds up around. I mean, that's how Silicon Valley became Silicon Valley.The investment will of course create thousands of jobs across the entire supply chain and create a broad ripple effect of technical training and know-how throughout the tech ecosystem. TSMC will train hundreds of American workers on its leading-edge technologies in Taiwan, and these workers will bring skills back home, where they will proliferate. The deal will also spur cutting-edge research and development by American universities and campuses, and in particularly in the equipment manufacturers themselves.Not least of all, it strengthens our relationship with Taiwan, a vibrant democracy and a force for good in the world and a great friend to the United States. Yet again, President Trump is delivering on his pledge to make America stronger, safer, and more prosperous.Let me move on to the second part of that trifecta, and that's with the Foreign Direct Product Rule. All of this is also supported by the day's other big news: expansion of the Foreign Direct Product Rule to prevent Huawei from dodging U.S. export controls. And Dr. Ford will talk about this in detail after I complete my remarks, and I simply want to make this point: Since its addition to the entity list one year ago today, Huawei has persisted in its efforts to circumvent U.S. export controls. Huawei benefited from a loophole that allowed it to make use of U.S. electronic design software and manufacturing equipment to continue to produce its own semiconductors.That ends today. The United States is closing this loophole to prevent Huawei from exploiting U.S. technology and threatening our national security. Quite simply, Huawei cannot be trusted to respect the rule of law. It is required by the PRC to cooperate with Beijing's security and intelligence services, and that really relates to the law that I've talked with you many times about in terms of the National Intelligence Act of the PRC. We urge our allies and our partners to join us in aligning their domestic export-control laws to address the very real security threat posed by Huawei and the PRC. Huawei is a PRC state-supported firm serving as a tool for the Chinese Communist Party. The United States will continue to restrict most exports to Huawei.And the third part of that trifecta is the Clean Path. And let me call your attention to the State Department's 5G Clean Path initiative, and that was announced by Secretary Pompeo on April 29th. It said that 5G data entering or exiting U.S. diplomatic facilities, domestically and overseas, like in our embassies, must transit only through trusted equipment. The 5G Clean Path is an end-to-end communication path that does not use any 5G transmission, control, computing, or storage equipment from an untrusted vendor, including Huawei and ZTE. 5G Clean Path implementation in the 2019 NDAA prohibits U.S. executive agencies from procuring, obtaining, extending, or renewing contracts for any equipment, system, or telecommunications services that make the use of Huawei, ZTE, and Xiaomi, and other untrusted PRC vendor equipment.The 5G Clean Path embodies the highest standards of security against untrusted, high-risk vendors by blocking their ability to siphon sensitive information into the hands of the PRC. And we encourage all of our allies and partners to join us in requiring a 5G clean path for their diplomatic facilities overseas.So just to sum it up, each of these initiatives form a three-legged stool of trust, security, and resilience for the United States. Each reinforces the others and greatly augments U.S. national and economic security, especially as we're facing increasing competition from the PRC.The last five months can leave no doubt in the minds of any freedom-loving nation that the PRC is untrustworthy, and only by maintaining solidarity with our trusted partners can we guarantee a secure future for the United States, our companies, and our friends.So with that (inaudible) I'd like to turn it over to Dr. Ford for his comments.ASSISTANT SECRETARY FORD: Thank you, Keith, and good afternoon, everybody. As Under Secretary Krach noted, while major suppliers of semiconductors are clearly flocking to the United States to take advantage of the opportunities available here in America, the other piece of good news is that we are also in the Trump administration taking decisive steps to protect U.S. technology and suppliers from being exploited by Huawei and its masters in the PRC.We announced today the expansion of something called the Foreign Direct Product Rule, or FDPR, if you will, which is designed to help keep Huawei, as the Under Secretary indicated, from circumventing U.S. export controls. This expanded rule will impose a U.S. licensing requirement, an export-control licensing requirement whenever anyone anywhere in the world uses U.S. technology or software to design or produce semiconductors for Huawei. Companies wishing to sell certain items to Huawei produced with U.S. technology must now obtain a license from the United States.Now, this is done because we need to understand how Huawei is taking advantage of cutting-edge U.S. technology in this field, and we need to make it harder for Huawei to use this technology against us, against our allies, and against our partners. These licensing requirements will help us do that.The key issue today, and I'd like to add a bit of a gloss on what the Under Secretary had said, is why we are doing this and why the United States believes Huawei to be such a threat. And I would say that our concerns with Huawei are at least threefold. First of all, for starters, Huawei engages, clearly, in illegal activity, including intellectual property theft from U.S. companies and the evasion of U.S. sanctions, in support of the world's biggest state sponsor of terror and a notorious proliferator. The U.S. Department of Justice has issued not one but two indictments against Huawei for a range of crimes, including intellectual property theft, violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act - that is to say, RICO - and for helping Iran evade sanctions. This is not the sort of entity with which reputable U.S. or other foreign companies should be doing business as usual, and our changes reflect that.The second factor is that Huawei is an enabler for human rights abuses by the People's Republic of China. It provides technological support for Chinese Communist Party ethnic cleansing in Xinjiang, for example, and for the party's technologically facilitated surveillance-and-control authoritarianism throughout China. Huawei also helps make such technologies available for export to other repressive regimes. So that's the second factor.And the third one is that - is perhaps in some ways the most troubling over time, and that is that because of the PRC's governance model and standing Chinese laws, Huawei is a company that is structurally subject to manipulation and to control by the Chinese Communist Party, essentially at any time. Whenever the party calls upon it, Huawei can function - and indeed has no choice but to serve - as a tool of strategic influence and political manipulation, including through providing support where it can to the PRC's broader military-civil fusion strategy for acquiring Western technology and diverting that technology to military and security uses that further the CCP's, the Chinese Communist Party's, repressive agenda at home and its geopolitical revisionism abroad.So in our view, U.S. national security simply requires that we put mechanisms in place to understand how U.S. exports and technology are being used by and for Huawei. These new licensing rules help to do that so that we can keep an eye on any malign activity that runs contrary to our foreign policy and national security interests, and indeed I would suggest those of all free and democratic countries.So for these reasons, we needed to take action to prevent Huawei from flaunting our export-control laws, exploiting American technology, and threatening our national security. And we would be happy to answer such questions as you might have as best we can about how it is specifically that we are doing that.But I should probably turn things back over to Morgan. Thanks.MS ORTAGUS: Thanks, Chris. I know we've got a queue started already. We're going to try our best to get through everybody in the queue. And again, just dial 1 and 0 if you'd like to be added.First up is from Reuters, we have Humeyra.QUESTION: Hello, can you hear me? Hi.MS ORTAGUS: Yes, we (inaudible).QUESTION: Thank you. Can I ask a couple of things? Can you comment on the timing of this? TSMC announced this investment, and the next day USG has moved to amend this export rule, which is something that could restrict its sales. Why now? And can you talk a little bit about whether this investment actually makes it easier for them to get the license?And lastly, can you talk a bit about the incentives that were given to TSMC? Was it federal money, tax breaks, what is the breakdown? Thank you so much.UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: First of all, with regard to the timing, the Direct Foreign Product Rule has been in the works for quite some time. So that was on a path to happen. And then also on a separate path were discussions with TSMC, and they actually announced on their earnings call - on their last earnings call that they were looking at this. So they lined up together. And then it also lined up as well with the Clean Path.And I think - now, nothing really happens by total coincidence, but this went - on these particular days it actually did. But I think you'll also see future announcements in terms of different clean strategies coming down the road that will be rolled out, and we'll be having some other announcements in the June timeframe. We haven't set a date for it, but there's some more coming down the path.And I think a big thing in terms of the deal itself, the Trump administration is committed to advancing the reshoring of manufacturing, particularly for critical components such as semiconductors, and this is a strategic imperative for our national security. And the administration policies will help make TSMC successful in their investment in the United States, and it will provide the same benefits to other investors and companies in the semiconductor industry. Our objective is that U.S. chip manufacturers build all their future fabs in the U.S., and also that other foreign chip manufacturers build their next state-of-the-art fabs in the United States to really create that ecosystem.And the semiconductor was invented in the United States. We have tremendous capabilities here. Sixty percent of TSMC's customers are based in the United States. So that's kind of the rationale. So did I answer your question?ASSISTANT SECRETARY FORD: Okay. If I might, Keith, just to add some -UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: Yeah, sure.ASSISTANT SECRETARY FORD: - gloss on that, just to underline what the Under Secretary said, that both of these things moved entirely on their own steam and on their trajectories and timelines. It was actually quite surprising to me that they lined up to be so close in sequence, but they are conceptually different and moved for different reasons.I would say that the common element that they share in some respects is the fact that they are both in different ways reflections of the commanding comparative advantage that U.S. high technology skills and prowess and innovation in the realm of soft - of semiconductor design and fabrication. We have an extraordinary position in the global technology ecosystem by virtue of the skills and efforts of U.S. companies in this respect. And they - it's not surprising in light of that both that we will need - both that our - that the United States would be an attractive location for companies to come to and take advantage of all that we have in this country to offer, and at the same time that we would need to be careful about making sure that others did not exploit and try to gain inappropriate access to our technology moving forward.So these are both two sides of the same coin, but they are, in terms of timing, entirely coincidental.MS ORTAGUS: Thanks. Okay. Let's go over to Nick Wadhams from Bloomberg.QUESTION: Hi, thanks very much. I just wanted to try to put a finer point on Humeyra's question because I didn't hear an answer there, just two issues. Is there any understanding with TSMC as part of this deal that it will get a license given that it gets about 10 percent of its revenue from Huawei, that that business will not be affected? And is the federal government offering any incentives or subsidies to TSMC as part of this agreement? Thanks.UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: So the TSMC will not be granted a license or not granted a license based upon their commitment, their intent to build a five-nanometer fab here in the United States. So that's not part of it at all.If you look at this decision for their press announcement in the first place, it's really a result of - they looked at the investment climate here in the U.S., and some of the statements they shared with us is President Trump's tax cuts, regulatory reform, workforce development, and an emphasis on the high-tech innovation is a big reason why they decided to make that $12 billion commitment, along with the - as I mentioned, many of their main customers like Apple, (inaudible) Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, Nvidia are all customers, great customers for TSMC.And so - and they - and I think they were really successful and galvanizing their ecosystem as well. So - and they looked at the workforce here as well. So - and there's already a ecosystem here in the U.S. So I think it was a natural choice by them, but certainly one that reflects the great emphasis that President Trump has put on bringing jobs and - back to the United States, and a particular interest of what our focus is at the State Department, and that's national security.MS ORTAGUS: Thanks.ASSISTANT SECRETARY FORD: And if I might, from my perspective, just to say that although we do not have someone from the Department of Commerce on the call, if we were to have someone from the Department of Commerce on this call, I have every confidence that they would be very, very clear and state unequivocally that all licenses are reviewed on their own merits and always will be.MS ORTAGUS: Thanks, guys. Hey, Ruben, my email is acting up. Can you tell me who's in the queue next, please? I'm sorry.MR HARUTUNIAN: Sure. We've got Asa Fitch from The Wall Street Journal next.QUESTION: Hi, guys. Thanks for doing this call. Where is this TSMC plant going to be exactly? We know Arizona; we don't know anything more specific than that. Does that depend on the incentives you can offer, the biggest ones? And then just to echo what some others have asked, what are the incentives that have been discussed?UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: With regard to the location in Arizona, the - I don't think that's been 100 percent nailed down. I believe it might be somewhere around the Phoenix area, but it's not been 100 percent nailed down.In terms of the incentives, I know there is a number of things that the United States Congress is looking at. I think they - they understood there's some really good possibilities coming down the road as well as the climate for this. And there's a lot we're doing in terms of R&D, and I think that was a big point to it. But - and they did the math and it worked out for them.MS ORTAGUS: Great. Thanks. We now have Ana Swanson from The New York Times.QUESTION: Hi. Thank you so much for doing the call. I appreciate that. So setting the issue of the facility aside, do you think that TSMC will receive a license, or has the company received any assurances about the license? This - right, it seems like this regulation on Huawei announced today could be quite a blow to the company, and there are some rumors and reports that TSMC had received some kind of assurance. And if they had not, would TSMC be reacting negatively to this measure that you announced today that could clamp down on their revenue? Thank you.UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: Well, I could say for a fact that there's no assurance whatsoever on that. And about - I think roughly around 10 to 12 percent of TSMC's business is China, and I think that is in essence almost primarily Huawei, so they will be restricted unless they're granted a license. And there's no assurances on that, and we don't anticipate that.MS ORTAGUS: Thanks. Let's go over to Nick Schifrin, PBS.QUESTION: Hey, guys, thanks for - thank you for doing this. Just wanted to switch over to 5G a little bit and have you zoom in on that. So the Secretary's talked about what you spoke about earlier in terms of trying to protect U.S. institutions around the world, U.S. facilities around the world from 5G. What does that look like? Does that look like, I don't know, some local businessman who wants to walk into the embassy can't have a Huawei phone or something much more specific about U.S. infrastructure? And can you talk about the larger effort to try and convince countries around the world to get, for example, Nokia or Erickson 5G when Huawei's been out front packaging 5G for over a year now? Thanks.UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: So just to put the Clean Path in the most simplistic terms, what that means is that for traffic coming in, let's say to a U.S. embassy or a U.S. military base, it cannot have touched a Huawei base station. Or if you have a Huawei - to the TELCO providers, they have a Huawei tower and a Huawei antenna, they're going to need to put it in Ericsson or a Nokia one right alongside of it. So those technical details would be up to the TELCO operator. It definitely increases their cost if 5G Huawei is one of their vendors. And this is a 5G program, so most TELCO operators have not rolled out their pure 5G yet, but - so it will be a significant cost. And I forgot what your second question was.MS ORTAGUS: Can - AT&T, can unmute Nick Schifrin's line and let him re-ask?UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: And Mung, you may want to - you may want to add -MS ORTAGUS: Nick?QUESTION: Yes. Can you hear me now?MS ORTAGUS: Yes.UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: - in terms of the Clean Path.QUESTION: If you can hear me, what I was asking about, the second question is the larger context of the 5G battle. As you guys know, Huawei's been packaging these 5G offers around the world for over a year. Obviously, you've been working with Nokia and Ericsson, so can you talk about the larger effort to try and convince countries not to buy these Huawei packages and instead consider the more expensive European ones?UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: Sure. And we've had a lot of discussions with countries as well as TELCO operators, and it boils down to one word and one word only. It's who do you trust. Because a lot of times people will say: Well, Nokia or Ericsson, they can't do the job, or we've - we're only going to put them on the edge, or they've given us a written agreement that there will be no back doors. Well, the fact of the matter is that AT&T, Verizon - T-Mobile, which is majority owned by Deutsche Telekom - NTT Docomo - they're all rolling out with Nokia, Ericsson, or Samsung, so they can do the job.In terms of hey, there's no back door. Well, anybody from Silicon Valley knows - or anybody's who's been in the software business know there's no such thing as a back door. There's a front door every day because that software's being updated almost every day, so they could slip in there anything that they - anything they want. And in terms of just putting it on the edge, well, a way to look at a 5G system, it's like a necklace with chains. You're only as strong as your weakest link. So once you're in, you're in.So the fact of the matter is that the IT vendors have the keys to the kingdom, and so it depends who do you trust. And when you look at Huawei and ZTE, coming from a country where they have a national intelligence act that requires any state-owned company or otherwise or any Chinese citizen to turn over any information, proprietary technology, intellectual property, or data upon request to the Chinese Communist Party or to the Chinese Government or the PLA. And if they don't, they have to suffer the consequences. Then - I think countries and TELCO operators really understand that, and I think now citizens of the world do as well. And we're seeing that around the world.And the other thing, too, is sometimes we say well, it's so much less expensive, and I'll say to them, "Well, you're paying something, you're getting ripped off," because in a lot of cases, they're giving it away for free. And my question is: Why do you think they're giving it away for free? They want to be able to control it. They want to have access to the data.MS ORTAGUS: Great, thanks. Let's see. I think now we have Jeanne Whalen from Washington Post.QUESTION: Oh, hello. Won't the new commerce rule just incentivize fabs to buy their chip-making equipment from non-U.S. manufacturers? Like how hard would it be for GSMT or other fabs to just buy chip-making equipment from the Netherlands or other suppliers?UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: Well, I would say in response to that that it depends what one wants to make. And one of the virtues of this approach is - that we've taken with the direct product rule - is precisely that it does put foundries all around the world on a level playing field and makes it very difficult simply to substitute in foreign supply. With respect to the cutting edge of chip technology, the Chinese technology companies of course would very much like to and are working very hard to try to indigenize all aspects of the supply chain. But at least for the moment and for at least some time to come, U.S. companies have still a very significant comparative advantage when it comes to the largely software-facilitated design tools that are involved in producing the very best chips.One might be able to find non-U.S. providers for design tools for making somewhat less sophisticated chips, but if you really want to play on the cutting edge of this technology area right now, you still for the most part have to use U.S. technology. And so frankly, it's taking advantage of that relative position that enables the direct product rule change that we have just rolled out to be effective, because it applies to anyone who wishes to use the very best tools in support of Huawei. And it doesn't matter whether that user of those tools is in the United States or someplace else. So we regard this as a very elegant solution that in fact structurally does in fact address the concerns that you raise.MS ORTAGUS: Thanks. Thanks so much. And our last question is going to go to Nike Ching, Voice of America.QUESTION: Thank you. Good afternoon - for this phone call. How much will this deal pave the way for U.S.-Taiwan free trade agreement? And is a free trade agreement with Taiwan still on the table? Thank you.UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: It - by the way, it won't affect it at all. One thing that I can say, though, is we think it does nothing but strengthen the relationship between the United States and Taiwan. So nothing's changed in terms of those discussions, and Taiwan's been a great friend to the United States.QUESTION: And can I -MS ORTAGUS: Great, thanks - sure, go ahead, Nike. You can follow up.QUESTION: Yes, thank you. So a more technical question: For people who do not know much about the semiconductor like me, could you please help us understand the five-nanometer semiconductor technology? And what can they do? What is so - such a game change deal, and why it's so, like, state of the art? Thank you.UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: By the way, Dr. Mung, if you're - we haven't heard from you, and this probably would be a good one.DR CHIANG: Sure.UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: And Dr. Mung comes to us from Purdue University where he was dean of engineering. Before that he was dean of electrical engineering at Princeton, three-time entrepreneur, did his PhD in 5G. So Dr. Mung, I turn over to you.DR CHIANG: Thank you, Under Secretary Krach. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for sticking around. And I'm going to focus on this particular technology aspect of the first story, that is the very important TSMC investment in United States. And Under Secretary Krach summarized very well why this is a game-changer for the U.S. semiconductor industry that will bolster the American national security. And to answer the question just raised, indeed semiconductor is the backbone to the entire digital industry, going from artificial intelligence to autonomous vehicles to next-generation wireless networks. And indeed one can say that with this investment, now United States has a very vibrant 5G chip future. And this is the cutting-edge technology.Different generations of semiconductor technology is often labeled by the number, and smaller the number the better, because you will be able to do more with the same given resource. And this five-nanometer technology will be the cutting-edge one, not just in the U.S. but around the world, and coming from one of the pioneering companies in the entire industry, coming from Taiwan, as mentioned, friend to the United States. And we have seen bipartisan support of such research and development leadership here in the United States, and with this latest cutting-edge semiconductor investment, we can anticipate a full blossom just like the old Bell Lab days, if you will. We can now anticipate a full blossom of American innovations in the coming years. Thank you.MS ORTAGUS: Thanks, Mung. We appreciate that. Well listen, everybody, thank you so much for dialing in on a Friday. While we were on the call, we did issue, I believe - Ruben, correct me if I'm wrong, but we went ahead and issued the Secretary's statement on the commerce action, is that right?MR HARUTUNIAN: That's right.MS ORTAGUS: Okay, great, so you all should have that in your queues as well. So thank you so much, Keith, Chris, Mung. We really appreciate it. And hope everyone has a great weekend.UNDER SECRETARY KRACH: Thank you.DR CHIANG: Thank you, everyone. Cheers.ASSISTANT SECRETARY FORD: Yes, thanks, Morgan. Have a great weekend.
