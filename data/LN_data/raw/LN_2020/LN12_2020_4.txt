The company anticipates steel price volatility to decrease in 2020, as uncertainty caused by global and regional trade negotiations appears to have moderated after significant turbulence during the past two years and a prolonged steel inventory destocking in North America recently has come to an end.Ternium expects EBITDA to increase in the first quarter 2020 compared to the fourth quarter 2019, with higher shipments and a recovery in steel margin, mainly as a result of slightly lower costs.With marginally improving steel market sentiment in Mexico, the company anticipates steel shipments in the country to increase in the first quarter of the year after a seasonally weak fourth quarter 2019. Demand in Mexico's industrial markets remains stable and public construction activity in the country is beginning to show some signs of improvement. In addition, the recent ratification by the USA of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has reduced uncertainty, which should help foster economic activity and investment in Mexico in the years to come.16:40AWK American Water Works misses by $0.01, misses on revs; reaffirms FY20 EPS guidance (139.26 -0.06)Reports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.73 per share, $0.01 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.74; revenues rose 6.1% year/year to $902 mln vs the $928.56 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Currently, BIFMA is forecasting 2% growth for the coming year. That seems like a reasonable starting point for core growth, though it is quite a bit lower than the double digit increases in both the number of and dollar value of the projects we are tracking and the growth in the number of clients visiting with us. We have seen average order size continue to stabilize and believe some of that is a function of our ability to capture a greater portion of our client's workplace spend. If you add on approximately three quarters of Fully sales, you arrive at a mid-single digit top line growth rate for 2020.We expect gross margin expansion of 20 to 30 basis points during 2020, driven primarily by continued lean initiatives in our manufacturing facilities and supply chain, and favorable commodity pricing. Mid-term gross margin expansion will be bolstered by our manufacturing footprint optimization and we expect to begin recognizing savings late in 2020, but more meaningfully in 2021, delivering an additional 50 basis points of improvement. However, we do expect that the combination of a slight reduction in production capacity during the first quarter of 2020 as the result of our manufacturing optimization moves, combined with somewhat extended client request dates in our backlog, will result in a shift of revenue from the first to the second quarter. Additionally, while we have very little revenue exposure in China, we are watching any potential supply disruptions due to extended supplier shutdowns in China. At this point in time we do not see any material impact but understand that the situation is fluid.As we look out over the 2020 year, we expect EBITDA margin expansion to be more modest. Looking to 2021, we will move closer to our long-term goal of 15% consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin with the benefit of a year of savings related to the footprint and logistics optimization activities. As we continue to focus on debt reduction as a use of available free cash, we believe our average outstanding debt will be approximately $435 million during 2020, with an average interest rate of approximately 3.7%. This is reflective of the $250 million interest rate swap for 2020 and an average credit spread of 150 basis points. We expect our consolidated effective tax rate to be between 25% and 26% for full year 2020.As a result of the continued efforts around showroom enhancements to make the most use of our floor space to support the constellation selling strategy and residential initiatives, as well as investments in new product development and technology expansion for our e-commerce capabilities, we expect 2020 capital expenditures will be between $55 million and $60 million.16:23DT Dynatrace launches follow-on public offering of 25.0 mln shares of common stock by certain selling stockholders (35.14 -0.98)Dynatrace will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares being offered by the selling stockholders but will bear the costs associated with the sale of such shares.16:22KRG Kite Realty beats by $0.01, beats on revs; guides FY20 FFO below consensus (18.00 +0.08)Reports Q4 (Dec) funds from operations of $0.40 per share, $0.01 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.39; revenues fell 13.4% year/year to $75.27 mln vs the $73.17 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The market resiliently cut its losses during the afternoon, though, leaving the S&P 500 down 0.3% for the session.The Nasdaq Composite (+0.02%) eked out a closing record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) still finished lower.Apple specifically said it doesn't expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to the coronavirus restraining its supply chain and impacting consumer demand in China. The news didn't come as a surprise given similar warnings previously issued by companies, and investors presumably viewed the situation as temporary and China-specific.Investors, however, did assume some defensive positioning, evident by the gains in bonds, gold futures ($1590.00, +$19.00, +1.2%), and the CBOE Volatility Index (14.83, +1.15, +8.4%). The resulting decline in Treasury yields undercut the financials sector (-0.9%), while it benefited the utilities sector (+0.8%).The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.40%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.4% to 99.43. WTI crude inched up 0.1% (+$0.05) to $52.10/bbl, recouping its intraday losses.Microsoft (MSFT 187.23, +1.88, +1.0%) and Amazon (AMZN 2155.67, +20.80, +1.0%), which have a combined market cap of nearly $2.5 trillion, helped offset the weakness in Apple with 1% gains of their own. Both stocks extended their yearly gains to 18.7% and 16.6%, respectively, while Apple trimmed its yearly gain to 8.6%.Walmart (WMT 119.63, +1.74, +1.5%) also outperformed despite missing profit estimates.

In the first-quarter 2020, oil production is projected to average in the range of 158,000 to 163,000 barrels per day. Importantly, Devon expects to deliver this improved oil growth outlook with less capital than previously projected. The company is now lowering the top end of its upstream capital guidance by $50 million to a range of $1.7 billion to $1.85 billion in 2020. Furthermore, the capital efficiency of this investment in 2020 is expected to be enhanced by reallocation of capital to the Delaware Basin from the STACK play. The company now projects that capital spending in the Delaware Basin will increase by approximately 15 percent year-over-year and account for approximately 60 percent of Devon's total capital investment in 2020. Another noteworthy guidance item for 2020 is the company's full-year G&A outlook that is expected to decline to a range of $360 million to $400 million. Including costs reclassified as discontinued operations, this represents an improvement of more than 20 percent compared to 2019. With this outlook, Devon remains on track to meet or exceed its stated goal of reducing total G&A expense to a level of $350 million by the end of 2021.16:13TPH TRI Pointe Homes beats by $0.14, beats on revs (17.23 -0.27)Reports Q4 (Dec) earnings of $0.85 per share, $0.14 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.71; revenues rose 1.5% year/year to $1.14 bln vs the $1.09 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Excluding interest, impairments and lot option abandonments, adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was 26.2%.New home orders of 1,235 compared to 812, an increase of 52%.Backlog units at quarter end of 1,752 homes compared to 1,335, an increase of 31%.For the first quarter of 2020, the Company expects to open 15 new communities and close out of 7 communities, which would result in 145 active selling communities as of March 31, 2020.

I'm Maria Bartiromo, coming to you live from the World Economic Forum here in Davos, Switzerland, where the biggest and the brightest minds from across the political and business world are gathering this week.It is Friday, January 24th. Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.The coronavirus is spreading. We have the very latest numbers this morning.Plus, rising tensions over impeachment. Scorching testimony yesterday. Renewed calls for the Bidens now to take the stand. The very latest from Capitol Hill.Markets this morning are edging higher ahead of the opening of trading. Take a look. We've got the Dow Jones Industrial average right now at the highs of the morning, up 85 points, after markets finished the day mixed yesterday but closed well off of the lows of the session yesterday on Wall Street. Dow Industrials were down 26 points but the Nasdaq was up 18, and the S&P was up three.Global markets this morning look like this. European indices currently right now also we're seeing a higher performance. The FT 100 in London is up 124 points. That's one and two thirds percent. We had the ECB meeting yesterday, of course. The CAC quarante in Paris up 68 points and the DAX index in Germany higher by 192. That's 1.5 percent.In Asia overnight, only Japan and Hong Kong were open. Of course, markets in China are closed for the lunar new year. And as you can see, there were fractional moves in Japan and Hong Kong.All those stories coming up this Friday morning.And joining me in New York, Fox Business' Dagen McDowell and "The Wall Street Journal" wealth management reporter, the host of the podcast "Secrets of Wealthy Women," Veronica Dagher.Great to see you, ladies.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you, Maria Bartiromo.VERONICA DAGHER, WEALTH MANAGEMENT REPORTER, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL": Great to be here.BARTIROMO: We've been covering this incredible story, the Chinese government taking steps this morning to contain the coronavirus.Let's get right to Cheryl Casone on headlines with the very latest.Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, we're watching the headlines, Maria.Officials hoping to stem the spread of the virus right now. They've closed many top tourist sites across the country, including Shanghai Disneyland and portions of the Great Wall of China. Estimates projecting the virus could reduce China's growth by nearly 1 percent. Seven countries now confirming cases, 26 people confirmed dead, more than 800 cases now confirmed.Well, JP: Morgan Chase rewarding its CEO, Jamie Dimon, for a strong 2019. The company gave Dimon a 1.6 percent raise, putting him at $31.5 million. His compensation package includes $1.5 million in salary, $30 million in performance based incentives. 2019, a banner year for the bank. Dimon was the highest-paid big bank boss in the United States in 2018, we should add.Well, a large explosion we're following this morning. This is happening in Houston. It was felt by thousands. This is an early morning explosion. The reports we have so far suggest this happened in an industrial area of the city. Now, officials are warning there could be a secondary explosion. There are risks to the surrounding air quality. No details yet on what may have caused the blast, but many going to social media saying they heard the huge boom in the middle of the night.And finally this, guys, Bill Murray is suiting up once again for one of his most iconic roles. He just told "Vanity Fair" he's going to be in "Ghostbusters: Afterlife," which is going to be the fourth installment of the franchise. His fellow stars, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson going to also reprise their roles. Notably missing is going to be Harold Ramis, who played Spengler. He died back in 2014.Now, the plot, not exactly known, but it's going to take place 36 years after the original movie, Maria. Expected to hit the theaters July 10th. "Ghostbusters," 36 years ago, Maria. Wow.Back to you.BARTIROMO: Wow is right. Thirty-six years.Thank you, Cheryl.CASONE: You bet.BARTIROMO: We have been covering the coronavirus all morning this morning. It is now a worldwide illness. Cases have been confirmed in several Asian countries and the United States as well. There was a case in Washington state. So far here are the numbers, 26 people confirmed dead. More than 800 others diagnosed with coronavirus.Joining me right now is the United Nations Secretary General, Antonio Guterres.Good to see you, sir. Thank you so much for joining us.ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL: Great pleasure to be here.BARTIROMO: Yes, I would like to ask you your reaction to what has taken place. You're talking about the city of Wuhan in China, 11 million people, five times the size of London. Just for context, these three cities being shut down. Your reaction to what has taken place.GUTERRES: I think in the beginning there was not a clear perception about the seriousness of this disease to the extent that it was not declared a global health emergency. It was considered to be centrally in China. Now obvious to me that the Chinese authorities have the perception that this is a very serious thing, and they took very tough measures.And so, at a certain moment we will need - there is a panel of experts in the World Health Organization that deals with that. We will probably need to reconsider whether or not this needs to be dealt with as a global emergency, but for the moment I think it's important that the Chinese authorities do everything needed to contain the spread of the virus.BARTIROMO: Well, I know that the World Health Organization is working on this, but of course you have seen your share of crises having taken office in 2017, witnessed the suffering of most vulnerable people on Earth in refugee camps, in war zones.So what do you want to tell people who are diagnosed and those people who are worried about this getting airborne in terms of travelling, the airports, et cetera?GUTERRES: Well, as I said, I don't think there is a reason for people not to travel. Generally, I don't think there is a reason for people to really change their way of life. We are not yet there.What we need is to be very attentive, see how the Chinese authorities are able to manage it in the near future, and if it becomes a globally emergency, then more tough measures will have to be taken even at global level.BARTIROMO: Let me -(CROSSTALK)GUTERRES: But for the moment, I think it's important to - not to exaggerate the dimension but also to be very, very, very closely following the situation.BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, you make a good point, but you've got the U.S., Japan putting some travel restrictions. People are trying to take as much cautionary measures as they can.What about these pictures? The world has been stunned by the pictures out of the tragic wildfires in Australia. Three American firefighters were killed in a plane crash while helping fighting the fires. At least 31 have been killed in the fires as well as millions of animals. We know that arson is being talked about as well. People were arrested because of arson, but others are blaming climate change for this heightening crisis. This has been your initiative for a long time at the United Nations and, of course, the climate has been one of the key topics spoken about here in Davos. GUTERRES: Well, this is something that I feel very strongly, emotionally. I come from - my family comes a region in Portugal. We have lots of pine tree forests and we have fires - forest fires have been terrible.I remember two years ago we had more than 40 people being killed. So I mean, I feel a lot the suffering of the Australian people. I mean, those that have died, those that have had to flee, the firefighters that were killed, I mean, the dramatic loss in animal life and -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Terrible.GUTERRES: -- I mean -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Do you think it was arson because people were arrested for that?GUTERRES: In fires you have always a combination of things. Sometimes we have arson, sometimes we have natural. And one thing it is clear people discuss about climate change, there were fires since ever.What climate change is, is an accelerator. I mean, now we have hurricanes that are stronger, that are more devastating, that are more frequent. Now we have droughts that are bigger, that are more frequent, and that cause more dramatic impacts, forcing populations also to move.And now we have fires that are becoming - if you look at the fires that we had in the Arctic, in Siberia, in Greenland, and in Canada, I mean, this is becoming a huge problem, and the climate change is, of course, accelerating. As things are warmer, as things are dryer, the fire is more intense and more dramatic.BARTIROMO: We are certainly seeing corporate CEOs react to what you're saying and try to shift their business principals as a result of all that you've just said. I want to turn to the Middle East because we've seen heightened tensions now with Iran and Middle East. Iran is vowing further retaliation after the killing of General Soleimani.President Trump says that he plans to make public his Middle East peace plan before actually meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, and then of course front page of the Financial Times this morning, the U.N. is calling for urgent probe into alleged Saudi role in the phone hacking of Jeff Bezos. What can you tell us?GUTERRES: In relation to the last point, this was information that was made available to two independent experts of human rights council, and I think the independent experts seized this material that produced the report, and that report now is well-known by authorities and by the different U.N. bodies.And, of course, anyone should look at it seriously and in the framework of competencies that anyone has seen what can be done. You know, for this that is a clear human rights violation not to become a new normal in the life of all societies.BARTIROMO: What can the U.N. do specifically about the human rights of women in the Middle East?GUTERRES: Well, we have done a lot. I mean, we have been advocating a lot for human - gender equality at all levels. For instance in the Middle East just to give an example, one of our (inaudible) campaigns has been in relation to the right of women to convey nationality their children because in several of the countries only the fathers can convey the nationality.We are absolutely adamant that women must have the full rights of political participation and the full rights of life in all areas of society, and we have been quite active on this. I think one of the most important reports that was produced on that was produced by UNDP on human development in the Middle East, and it was a clear alert.For the Middle East the fact that women do not fully participate in the economic, social, and political life is a major loss that largely contributes to explain why that region is a region with less peace and less development than what it should have with the huge resources that exist there.BARTIROMO: Yes, thank you for taking that question and addressing it. I should have said, women, the gay and lesbian community. I mean, it's - there are other groups as well.GUTERRES: The rights of LGBTI are also -(CROSS TALK)BARTIROMO: Exactly, in the Middle East. Yes.GUTERRES: -- extremely important to be respected in the Middle East and everywhere. I mean, one of the things, for instance, as Secretary General I have stuff all over the world, and whenever our clear orientations is to guarantee that all of our LGBTI staff enjoys full equality of rights -(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Yes.GUTERRES: -- and nondiscrimination. And I have to tell you in some countries it's not easy.BARTIROMO: Well I'm - I am glad to hear you say that and we'll be watching you. Thank you for your leadership.GUTERRES: It's a pleasure. Thank you very much.BARTIROMO: Secretary General, it's good to see you. Antonio Guterres.Coming up, next up, FISA bombshell. The Department of Justice admitting a major flaw over the surveillance of Carter Page. We've got those details coming up.And then from baseball to brewing, Alex Rodriguez trying his hand at a new business. What he's doing, right here, next up.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Well, another embarrassing blow to the leadership of the FBI. At least two of the FBI's surveillance applications to secretly monitor former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page lacked probable cause. The assessment released yesterday by the FISA, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Now we know for sure, from the FISA judges, that they surveilled Carter Page unlawfully.Dagen is in New York and, Dagen, you and I have spoken about this over and over again. The question is, are we going to see any accountability here.MCDOWELL: Again, this is "The Wall Street Journal" has an editorial about this, cleaning up after Comey. And it is -- but this is something that we knew. Again, these were warrants sought by the FBI that were based in a large part on false information from Christopher Steele. Who was Christopher Steele ultimately paid by? The Hillary Clinton campaign.It is an outrage and Andy McCarthy has said this over and over again, this was an abuse of surveillance powers that are used by the FBI and the intelligence communities, by extension, to protect the United States, to protect the United States and its citizens and its residents from terrorists.So what do you do when you abuse these powers? Well, again, the American people would demand that they be taken away.And this is one of the reasons the backdrop of the impeachment trial is this, is that there was corruption within the FBI to prevent Donald Trump from being elected president and then to kick him out once he took office. And so that's why the needle hasn't moved on support for impeachment.I look at it every morning. It's roughly 10 percent of Republicans want the president removed. It's usually below 10 percent. That's why all of this is not changing the way people feel about the president and the corruption within the government.DAGHER: And that's why also the market's not even --BARTIROMO: Right, because --DAGHER: I'm sorry.BARTIROMO: No, go ahead.DAGHER: The market's not even reacting to the impeachment trial, right? I don't know if any more traders (ph) even watching, right, because we're looking around and saying, hey, there's no new news coming out of Washington at this moment.BARTIROMO: Yes.DAGHER: So if you look at the Dow, everything is focused on the coronavirus right now, not focused on impeachment. And I think that says a lot.BARTIROMO: Right. Because people know what happened in 2016. We have put a spotlight on this. And we are going to continue to spotlight it until there's accountability. It's not about Donald Trump, it's about fairness and the Constitution.We're going to take a break, jobs in America is next.MCDOWELL: Well, and I want to point out --BARTIROMO: Yes, go ahead, Dagen.MCDOWELL: No, you -- will there be accountability? The answer is yes. And I will let you follow up on that later.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, no, I know there will be. We've got a criminal investigation underway by John Durham. And, let me tell you, it would not be a criminal investigation unless they thought or suspected there was criminal activity.When we come back, Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia is here in an exclusive interview. We are going to talk about jobs.We are also looking at a new cyber threat, scammers using text messages and FedEx to take advantage of you. All the details right after this.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.The U.S. unemployment rate holding steady at a 50 year low. The Trump administration pointing to economic policies put in place over the president's first term. That was one big issue that I spoke with the labor secretary, Eugene Scalia, about in this "Fox Business Exclusive."(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Tell us what you're focused on here in Davos.EUGENE SCALIA, U.S. SECRETARY OF LABOR: Yes. Well, as you know, we are enjoying an extraordinary economy right now with unemployment at a 50 year low. Wages are rising. We have new trade deals that are well for continued economic expansion. So we're talking about that.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about the jobs numbers on average. What would you say we're going to average in terms of job creation in 2020?SCALIA: Look, we've been right around 180,000 a month for some time now. I think that's a good number to hit. And when I look back in 2016, here was the projection. It was that we would add 1.9 million jobs by now. So they said from summer of 2016 until now the congressional budget office said 1.9 million jobs.BARTIROMO: You far exceeded that.SCALIA: We've added 6 -- exactly, 6.7 since January 2017.BARTIROMO: Isn't it fascinating in the last jobs report we learned that today women hold more jobs than men. Is that right?SCALIA: In the bureau of labor statistic numbers that we have that are focused particularly on the private non-foreign (ph) payrolls, that's right.BARTIROMO: Why is that?SCALIA: And it's a great sign. Well, I think there are a number of factors. One is that employers I think are trying to bring more people into jobs and into non-traditional jobs because when you have unemployment as low as it is, wages rise. We know that.But employers look elsewhere for workers and so, construction and manufacturing both. When I speak to executives, one of the things they're doing is trying to bring more women into the workplace.BARTIROMO: It's interesting because at the same time you've got a dichotomy with men because I know that during the financial service -- during the financial crisis back in 2006 and 2007, white collar jobs got crushed and men were really the ones getting impacted there. So as you see women moving up, you also see men moving down.SCALIA: Well, I think that men are doing very well in this economy too. I think--BARTIROMO: They've come back from 2006.SCALIA: Yes. I think all boats are being lifted right now. There has been concern for example about what we call the labor participation rate, right, how many people are on the sidelines because the unemployment number that we hear most commonly, the 3.5 percent number right now which is just an amazing number.But that measures only people working the last four weeks. What we're seeing now is more and more people coming off the sidelines including and really very importantly people in the prime working years of say age 25 to mid-50s.BARTIROMO: Let's talk wages because wages are another really good story here. I want to know your take on the bottom earners, because those are the earners that are seeing the biggest increases in their wages. Correct?SCALIA: Yes. Well look, the end of the Obama administration what we saw is wage growth for the high wage earners, slower wage growth for the low wage earners. We flipped that in this economy. So that production, non- supervisory workers are seeing their ages rise faster than their boss's which we haven't seen in a long time.BARTIROMO: So is it fair to say income inequality is narrowing?SCALIA: It's absolutely narrowing. And no, that's what the data is showing. And again, it's a result of policies that President Trump ran on that he said would have these effects. And we're here in Davos talking to foreign leaders about the changes we made here which we'd love to see pursued globally.BARTIROMO: What are those things that you'd like to see happen globally in terms of continuing this move?SCALIA: Well, look, I think that deregulation has been so important to the economic growth we're seeing in the U.S. right now. I think that the business leaders here, they see that. They recognize it.And I think the other countries can look at the model that President Trump has set and find ways that they too can reduce the burden on business with a goal ultimately of helping workers. Bringing more and providing them jobs. And then as unemployment gets better all the time, wages are going to go up too. And that's really been the goal.I mean USMCA; I think the president said just the other day that that changing NAFTA might've been the single most important factor for him running for the presidency. And it's because he saw American jobs drifting away. He wanted to bring them back. USMCA's going to be key to doing that.BARTIROMO: How do you ensure that our workers today have the proper skill sets to actually compete effectively in this new economy where you've got things like AI and quantum computing and all of these things that five years ago people really didn't know much about?SCALIA: Right. It is a key thing for us to address how we do it. I think in part by bringing business more into the role of training workers.BARTIROMO: The owners should be on corporations to train people.SCALIA: Yes. They know better than I do at the Department of Labor what job skills are needed at this moment. They know better than I do at the Department of Labor what job skills are going to be needed in a few years.So, what I want to do is incentivize those employer based training programs like apprenticeships which have really been a major focus for the president, for the senior advisor of the president Ivanka Trump.BARTIROMO: Do you think that we are seeing more and more people reconsider college?SCALIA: I think we should be. Four year college degree for many people is absolutely the way to go but not for everybody. And you come out of an apprenticeship program for example and the average wages are around $70,000 a year once you've completed an apprenticeship.BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us.SCALIA: OK. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Good to see you.(END VIDEOTAPE)BARTIROMO: Monday, we are one week from the first votes being cast in the 2020 presidential election cycle.

Our top story this half an hour, Chinese officials are looking to stem the coronavirus. Cheryl Casone with headlines right now, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria. Chinese officials are building a 1,000-bed field hospital at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, amid reports that hospitals in the province are overwhelmed and forced to turn people away even those that show symptoms.Hospital officials are making urgent appeals for help and more medical supplies. They need masks, they need gloves and disposable scrubs to deal with the influx of the sick.26 people are dead from the virus, more than 800 cases have been confirmed in seven countries including the United States.Watch those text messages, if you get one that looks like it's from FedEx which asks you to deliver -- to set your delivery preferences, you need to delete it. The bogus text uses your real name but links you to a fake Amazon listing for a phony survey.You are then going to be asked for personal and credit card information to get a free gift.

Those are your headlines from New York.BARTIROMO: Yes, very nice to see that transition to entrepreneur. Thank you so much, Cheryl.Well promises kept, President Trump will reportedly sign the USMCA trade pact with Canada and Mexico this Wednesday. The NAFTA replacement has been one of the president's major objectives throughout his time in office, certainly. And it mirrors the president's push to lock down a trade deal with China which will also be a key facet of his re-election campaign.Joining me right now is AFL-CIO president, Richard Trumka, a key decision maker in the USMCA talks. It is good to see you.RICHARD TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AFL-CIO: Good to see you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. So, there was a while there when we were sitting when will USMCA come to the floor, when will it come to the floor. And the word behind the scenes was, it's Richard Trumka, he doesn't want it signed yet, he wants changes. Is that true?TRUMKA: Well, when the agreement first came back, we had several problems with it. One of the major problems was, it was -- it was a totally unenforceable agreement.Another one, it had some giveaways to pharma and some bad things on the environment. And so we started negotiating to try to make it better. It took us a little over a year but we finally got to the point where we got an agreement that is not only enforceable but it's effective for labor and it took away the giveaways that they had for big pharma and the other things.BARTIROMO: Tell me about the enforcement and in terms of labor, what labor gets from this. Because even before the tweaks that you wanted made, you still saw it as better than what was in place, NAFTA, right?TRUMKA: Well, when it came back, the labor section, chapter was a little -- was better -- a little better, but it was unenforceable. So, an unenforceable agreement is virtually useless.We had three levels of enforcement that we were worried about. One, the Mexicans used a thing called protectionist contracts to keep wages artificially low. The agreement made them change their labor laws, which they did. But we were worried that they wouldn't enforce them. They wouldn't have the wherewithal to enforce them. There was nothing on that in the original agreement.Now we have -- we increased that. We have monitorships where we can send monitors into Mexico and actually make sure they're living up to their part of the bargain.BARTIROMO: OK.TRUMKA: The second level of enforcement was as you know, a trade agreement is enforced by a thing called the panel. It's like an arbitrator.The first agreement when it came back, either party could block a panel. So you could never get a decision. That was ultimately eliminated.And the third part was, remedies in the past would take up to 10 years for you to get something done. In the meantime, they were violating the trade agreement for those 10 years.Now we have a procedure where it will be six months in length and at the end of that six months if they violate the agreement, we can actually stop their products from coming into the United States if they were produced any in violation of the agreement.BARTIROMO: I'm very glad that you're happy with what you had in front of you. The president will sign that into law this week, it's a huge victory.Another victory has been some of these policies. Your members, the unions, have to be happy with unemployment at a 50-year low, with the fact that wages, the bottom wagers, the bottom earners are seeing their wages go up. This is a positive. You heard Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia just said it, income inequality is narrowing, yes?TRUMKA: No.BARTIROMO: Why no?TRUMKA: Every standard that you do, you look at by income inequality in the U.S. and around the world has been increasing dramatically. Look --BARTIROMO: Dramatically?TRUMKA: Yes. Our economy is on a trajectory towards implosion. There are several things that can either increase that trajectory or decelerate it. Technology is one. Climate change is another one.But inequality when you talk about it, Maria, there are three facets to it. Inequality of income, inequality of opportunity and inequality of power. And until you address inequality of power, you're never going to be able to get inequality of income to close that gap.BARTIROMO: I like what you said about inequality of opportunity because that's what most people want. They don't want to giveaway. They just want an opportunity to work.TRUMKA: Absolutely.BARTIROMO: And that is exactly what Ivanka Trump is doing right now and a whole host of companies, they're talking about apprenticeship. They're saying look, companies need to take -- the onus is on companies to say let me train you on A.I., let me train you on quantum computing.What do you think about this whole de-emphasis on a college degree and emphasis on apprenticeships?TRUMKA: Well, first of all, we have more apprenticeships than anybody else. And this is the best kept secret in the world. Other than the U.S. military, the American labor movement educates more people every single year than any other institution. We've stigmatized trade schools and apprenticeships in the past. Sometimes we said, if you don't have a college degree, it's like you're a failure. That's just not true.Apprenticeships, trade schools are all good schools that can give you the skills that you need to make a good living, contribute to society and actually increase productivity for all of society. Our apprenticeship programs are the best in the world.BARTIROMO: Do your members buy into that, Richard, you've got to explain to our audience U.S. union membership hitting a record low?TRUMKA: Well, actually, last year we -- the number of people that we covered was up but we were down a little bit. We organized about 250,000 new members last year but because of the attacks on us from the (INAUDIBLE) and other thing, the change in laws, we did lose a little bit of membership.However, MIT just did a study and they found out that 60 million Americans say they would join a union tomorrow if given the chance. Our popularity is at a 50-year high. People know that they have to have a voice on the job that they can't get it done relying on anybody but their sisters and brothers work beside them.BARTIROMO: You have to be happy with President Trump's focus and emphasis on jobs.TRUMKA: Oh, jobs are always good.BARTIROMO: So, he's doing a good job then?TRUMKA: It's the quality of the jobs. And we still have that inequality gap.BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. Richard, love to have you on all the time. Thank you for joining me.TRUMKA: Thanks for having me.BARTIROMO: Richard Trumka, AFL-CIO. We'll be right backBARTIROMO: Welcome back from Davos. Well, the head of the nation's largest retail bank is expecting a strong 2020. Here is Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan earlier this week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Let's talk banking and really the economy because you have such a great vantage point in terms of we're -- how we're doing, the largest retail bank, retail to consumer. Tell me how the consumer is looking to you today.BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CEO, BANK OF AMERICA: Well, starting with last year, just to get people a point of reference, it grew about 5-1/2 percent to six percent over the year before which grew at 8-1/2 percent over the year before. So, you had two strong years of growth.This year so far in the first couple of weeks, we're seeing consistent with last year. And the good news, during '19 each quarter got stronger.And so, across Bank of America, consumers in '19 there was $3 trillion of money spent on credit cards, debit cards, checks out the door, bill payments, (INAUDIBLE) things like that. And growing at five percent plus is consistent with a two percent plus growth GDP in the United States. That when you look back, eight percent was a three percent, five to six percent, so a two percent level. So we feel very confident that the U.S. economy is on a good plane.BARTIROMO: Well, tell me about the consumer though in terms of their balance sheet, in terms of paying back loans. Does it feel like it's a healthy situation?MOYNIHAN: Well, in the prime space which where we concentrate, you know, our delinquencies are -- have been five years, our charge-offs are under 40 basis -- around 40 basis points on a core basis. The delinquencies are down.And so, the prime borrower is in very good shape. Why, because they're employed and the wages are rising. I think housing has a good room to move here. There's an undersupply of housing and it's hard to build because of the labor shortages.And so, that shouldn't rock it, we don't want to do that but that will help extend. Because remember how many people are involved in a house build and how many local. It's all local. We can't import a build house. I mean, theoretically we can but it's hard.BARTIROMO: So housing is strengthening right now.MOYNIHAN: We feel good about housing, we feel good about the card business, we feel good about the auto business and all in the prime space, the consumer. And they have -- as we watch originations come on, the quality is as strong now as it was a couple years ago and that's good.BARTIROMO: But aren't the auto -- the auto area is shaky when you look at auto lending in some corners, maybe not prime.MOYNIHAN: It did, that's the question. We made a commitment to responsible growth many years ago. So we stay in those prime space because that's consistent with our brand, our capabilities, how we think about consumers and also stability of our company and ability to earn through any recession.BARTIROMO: How much are you spending on technology, tell me what it has gotten you? What has it yielded you?MOYNIHAN: Well, in the decade I've been CEO, that pure technology code has been probably $35 billion. Some of that goes to, you know, doing more tech -- upgrade the systems and we've upgrade all of them across the last 10 years replaced everyone. And except for the systems that didn't exist so we couldn't find them, we just keep investing in it.Some comes from feature functionality, take the mobile banking. You know, we probably put in online mobile banking space a billion dollars over last decade of at least of spending to make it better and better and it makes a good future functionality. But importantly, be secure and to scale.BARTIROMO: Well, I think that's the really important point in terms of scale, because that's why some of your competitors, the regional banks are being forced to merge right now. They're being forced to either, you know, create their own scale or they'll die because of the strength of B of A, some of your competitors, J.P. Morgan as well. Are you expecting more regional mergers?MOYNIHAN: Well, as a person who spent -- you know, starting in the early '90s and even as a lawyer before that --BARTIROMO: You lived it.TRUMKA: This is what I did and I did the wonderful thing to run our company now compared to my -- a lot of predecessors from all the prior companies, we can't do any deals so I don't have to think about that. It's illegal in the United States for us to consolidate through acquisition anymore.BARTIROMO: You can't add to your deposits.MOYNIHAN: Exactly. So, there's an investment banker in the old M&A guy, you know, look, the consolidation power is there. We always think it's going to happen fast than it does. And you saw some meaningful size deals obviously with the truest transaction last year in the First Horizon, there's deals happening.But those are always tricky because it takes the stars to align. But the fundamental basis -- the fundamental reasons to do it are there. And that's, you know, the Schwab transaction, these are all about building more scale.BARTIROMO: But what about the pressure coming from something like a Schwab merger? I mean, you see Vanguard dropping fees to zero, Schwab dropping fees to zero. How is that impacting the business at Merrill Lynch?MOYNIHAN: So our Merrill Lynch business has about $250 billion and assets and that's not Merrill, it's Merrill Lynch. It's for more general public, more mass market. It grew -- I don't -- by $40 billion over the last year in terms of flows. 24 billion of flows, 40 billion in growth for the market. It's a great business.So, we're already making that business. We're already adding a lot of assets. But we don't do any businesses as a standalone business, we have a consumer business. And for investment for the general consumer that is Merrill Lynch. For investment for the wealthy consumer, that's Merrill and the private bank. And so, you have this what makes us unique as a competitor is we have all of it.BARTIROMO: Tell me about the Fed because when we first came out with the -- when they first came out with the stress tests people were thinking, well, you know, it's too much capital that we're putting aside, it's too much in terms of these aggressive predictions. But in the end, I think it's actually been helpful.MOYNIHAN: I think going back to the crisis and being here and talking to the global regulators and we'd have these meetings in rooms where everybody were waiting outside, to think if we thought of something that somebody hadn't thought of meeting all these very smart people.And the reality is, you know, leverage and ill preparedness for recession with the two big issues. So, you know, the stress tests really are the people who -- that show you that what it will be like to hit a recession and go through it.BARTIROMO: What kind of a year are you looking for?MOYNIHAN: I'm looking for another good year in the U.S. about 1.7 percent GDP growth, little above three around the world. I think there's -- this is one of those years where there's some risk to the upside as things are solving towards the end of the year, the trade deals, the trade situation.Think about USMCA, think about China, you know, and think about Japan -- there's trade deal is falling in place good for business more certainty and we need -- we need business -- they're coming back off the bottom in terms of investing. They went down. They still are positive, still growth but slowed down. Now we got to get back in.I think the certainty around that will be helpful. I think the election cycle will create interesting questions; it always does.BARTIROMO: Do you have plans, what are your plans in terms of Merrill Lynch in London and the U.K., given the Brexit situation?MOYNIHAN: Oh, we didn't wait for them to figure out the final because you couldn't, because you weren't sure whether it could drop on your head on the given days. So, we moved our broker dealer activities in Europe to Paris and we moved our bank activities to Dublin and then we have our London based activities that all broker dealer are still there in the -- in the -- it's a branch of the U.S. bank. So, we're done with that.BARTIROMO: Tell me about what's most prevalent among your clients.MOYNIHAN: Everything.BARTIROMO: They want to do everything online.MOYNIHAN: Everything online and everything personal and they write check. Our clients in consumer wrote 700 million checks last year. Now it was down 10 percent. The dollar volume was actually up. So, all those checks are going through the system. And when you speak to a lot of foreign countries, they don't know what a check is. So, we still write them in the United States. And so -- and so everybody is everything.So, the mobile interactions are growing at you know, 15, 20 percent a year. The number of mobile customers grew at 10 percent a year, which is growing off a huge base.BARTIROMO: And you made an important announcement in terms of sustainability. Tell me where you're allocating money there.MOYNIHAN: First, we are carbon neutral today. And that was a commitment we made by 2020. We actually got there the end of last year but we're already there.And then the second major commitment is we've always had environmental commitments in terms of business, in terms of generating business, green bonds and financings and solar installations.So, we had committed 125 billion about five years ago for 10 years. We finished it in four. And so we said OK, let's figure out where we're going next.For the next 10 years we committed $300 billion of environmental funding, financing to help make the transition happen on a rational way.And so we're helping, you know, finance solar, wind, and also other types of technologies that are actually making even the current fossil fuels more efficient and more effective and that's good for the environment.BARTIROMO: You made the commitment to raise the minimum wage. You said you were going to get to 20. You're at 20?MOYNIHAN: So last year I would have interviewed, talked about growing $17.00, 18.50, 20 over two years. We've look at it and said, you know, the pressure on us to get the great people we need to be the company we want to be; we went ahead and went to 20.So this quarter, in March, all the teammates at Bank of America will start at 20 or more. Even if you're a summer intern, even if you're a high school kid, you start at 20 and go up from there.BARTIROMO: Fantastic. Brian, thank you.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: My thanks to Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America. Stay with us, a lot more to come right here. Back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Get ready to Monster Jam. Monster truck drivers competing for top honors, wowing the crowd with some seriously crazy stunts. Kristina Partsinevelos is at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey getting an up-close look. Good morning, Kristina.KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: I know, this is a great way to start the morning and it's not just some tricks. We're going to expect a back flip here this weekend in New Jersey. And for those that might miss out, next weekend too you can see it in Long Island.But I got one of the first female drivers, Krysten, thank you so much for joining us. Tell me, this runs in the family. You've been doing this for four seasons. You're 22 years old. What? Your dad has been involved with the Grave Digger for a while?KRYSTEN ANDERSON, GRAVE DIGGER DRIVER: Yes, so my dad is Dennis Anderson and he created the Grave Digger back in 1982. We're celebrating almost 40 years of Grave Digger this year. And I'm just a second-generation driver. I'm carrying on my dad's legacy. I got two older brothers Adam and Ryan that are also involved in Monster Jam. So, it's family tradition, we're all monster truck drivers and that's what I'm out here doing.PARTSINEVELOS: This is amazing because I know there's over like a hundred - - you were telling me a hundred athletes but there's only about 20 women that do it. How does it work with you? Like how do you prep? How do you get involved? How much are you training?ANDERSON: So, I am the only female driver that's on the Grave Digger team. There's about seven drivers total, six males and me, and on a tour we'll have about two females to a tour. This tour has got eight athletes on it. But it kind of is very physically enduring, especially this Triple Threat Series.So, we're constantly changing from the monster truck, to the Monster Jam, speedster to the ATV. So, we're always doing changes in our gear all the time, we're running around, running back stage. So, it's really important that you stay and hydrated, doing the cardio, lifting weights. Because having a strong body will also help protect you in the truck a lot better too.PARTSINEVELOS: Some of these drivers are literally doing wheelies and nose, I don't even know the terminology. But these weigh a lot, of 12,000 pounds, they cost $250,000 to make, these wheels are 66 inches. So, it's not a small machine at all. Can you just preview what we can expect from this weekend from you?ANDERSON: Well, I definitely tell people if you've never seen a Monster Jam or monster trucks live, you've only seen it on T.V. or on YouTube or something, you have to come out and definitely see a live event.I'm going to hold it to the floor. I'm going to drive wild just like my dad did. My dad was bad to the bone for almost 35 years and that's why I'm here. I'm here to carry on his legacy. That's what the Andersons do, we always throw it down and free style. Throw it down at racing. So I'm here - - I'm here to win. Just because I'm a female doesn't mean I'm not a tough competitor.PARTSINEVELOS: That's how we're going to end it because that was an epic way to end it. Thank you so much for joining us.Maria, I'm going to throw it back to you. We have another hit with another driver coming up in the next hour. Back to you.BARTIROMO: All right. We look forward to it, Kristina, thank you. Kristina Partsinevelos.Quick break and then still ahead, illness is spreading, the very latest on the highly contagious coronavirus that's left at least 26 people dead.

The Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) underperformed in a rare outing, although it still closed at a new high.Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors contributed to the advance, especially the energy sector (+3.8%) after weeks of underperformance and a nice rebound in oil prices ($50.85, +1.24, +2.5%). The real estate sector (-0.1%) was the lone holdout today.The bullish price action was driven mostly by optimism, particularly tied to the prevailing view that the economy is fine and any negative impact resulting from the coronavirus will be minimal. Aiding this sentiment were reports that progress is being made in developing a vaccine and economic data depicting a healthy labor market and services sector.Specifically, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for January increased to 55.5% (Briefing.com consensus 55.0%) from 54.9% in December. The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000).That's not to say that the coronavirus is behind the market, though.

The January reading eclipsed the December reading as the fastest pace of expansion since August 2019.The key takeaway from the report is that it marked the second straight month of accelerating activity in the services sector, which is an encouraging sign that the U.S. economic expansion is poised to continue.The Trade Balance report for December showed a widening in the deficit to $48.9 billion (Briefing.com consensus -$48.2 billion) from a downwardly revised -$43.7 billion (from -$43.1 billion). Exports were $1.6 billion more than November exports while imports were $6.8 billion more than November imports.The key takeaway from the report is that the goods deficit with China decreased by $73.9 billion in 2019 to $345.6 billion, as tariff measures contributed to a $13.5 billion decrease in exports and an $87.4 billion decrease in imports.The ADP Employment Change report showed an estimated 291,000 jobs were added to private-sector payrolls in January (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), with healthy gains across small, midsized, and large employers.

Huawei's new indictment in New York for theft of industrial secretsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 14, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 764 wordsBodyU.S. justice on Thursday reinforced pressure against Chinese telecoms giant Huawei by bringing three new criminal charges against him, as the company's heiress's fate, in Canada's home prison, remains on hold.Brooklyn Federal Prosecutor Richard Donaghue accused Huawei of stealing industrial secrets and eskiming U.S. sanctions against North Korea.These three new charges add up to the 13 the company had already faced for a year in Brooklyn federal court for bank fraud and the alleged violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran.Indicted on the first charges in January 2019, Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, currently under house arrest in Canada, is still on the new indictment, albeit not being charged with further charges.Canadian justice has not yet ruled on his extradition claimed by the United States."This new indictment is part of the Department of Justice's attempt to irrevocably damage Huawei's reputation and business for competition-related reasons, rather than law enforcement," the firm said in a statement."The government will not win and we will prove that these charges are unfounded and unfair," he added.The U.S. Department of Commerce on Thursday once again renewed the deadline given to Huawei to continue selling services to U.S. companies, this time for 45 days, while looking for alternatives to this giant that Washington sees as a threat to national security.Several U.S. telecom companies rely on Huawei's cheaper equipment to bring Wi-Fi service to remote rural areas and will now have to find another partner.- Us spying risk -Against the backdrop of the U.S.-China trade war, the Trump administration sees that there is a risk that Huawei, the world's largest provider of telecommunications equipment, will spy on the Chinese government.On Wednesday, anonymous U.S. officials cited by The Wall Street Journal accused Huawei of secretly accessing global telecommunications networks through "backdoors" designed to be used by law enforcement.The company responded that these allegations were "a smokescreen" and recalled that, according to an article in The Washington Post published Tuesday, the CIA used its own encrypted language company for decades to spy on other countries.The United States has called on many countries to dispense with Huawei's infrastructure for the deployment of the new 5G telephone network.The Chinese government reiterated Friday that the United States is financially harassing Huawei and urged "immediately to cease an ideological oppression against Chinese companies."Prosecutor Donaghue stated in the indictment that Huawei engaged in the theft of industrial secrets from 2000 until now, and that in 2013 it implemented an internal policy that encouraged its employees to "steal confidential information from rivals" with headquarters or offices in the United States, in exchange for the payment of premiums.The Chinese company is accused of trying to recruit employees from U.S. telecommunications companies, and of obtaining information from them related to the technology of the companies.This data allowed it to launch products similar to those of its competitors, at lower selling prices, according to the re-indictment.Among the examples cited is a professional salon in Chicago in 2004, where a Huawei employee was discovered in the middle of the night trying to photograph a competitor's computer server, which he had disarmed.Huawei then maintained thatthe individual, who was carrying a pass that read "Weihua", was a subaltern who went to the salon on his own initiative, although his resume mentions that he was chief engineer in research and development of the company.The Brooklyn prosecutor's office claims that the company participated in several projects in North Korea, although one of its leaders had indicated in 2012 to a US legislative committee, under oath, that Huawei had no activities in that country.The accusation states that through its unofficial subsidiary Skycom in Iran, Huawei dodged the embargo on the Islamic Republic."Huawei also attended the government of Iran by installing surveillance equipment, including the one used to monitor, identify and stop demonstrators at the 2009 anti-government protests in Tehran," he adds.Nearly a year ago, in March 2019, Huawei pleaded not guilty to the initial 13 counts before a federal judge in New York.A total of five companies are indicted, all Huawei subsidiaries, as well as Meng Wanzhou and other group executives "who have not yet been arrested" and whose names are crossed out with a marker in the indictment.tu-lbc/ll/gma/yowLoad-Date: February 15, 2020End of Document

Fact-checking Tom Cotton's claims about the coronavirusCNN.comFebruary 17, 2020 Monday 8:10 AM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICSLength: 1155 wordsByline: By Tara Subramaniam, CNNDateline: Washington BodyOver the weekend, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton came under fire for a series of comments and tweets on the coronavirus. On Fox News Sunday morning, Cotton suggested the virus did not originate in an animal market as the Chinese government has claimed, but perhaps from another source, such as an infectious disease research lab nearby. While acknowledging there's no evidence the disease originated there, Cotton questioned the validity of China's statements, saying "China was lying from the beginning, and they're still lying today."Cotton's theory is one of many that have been floating around as China and other countries aim to get a handle on the outbreak. Here's what we know about the coronavirus.The originsAfter his appearance on Fox News, Cotton took to Twitter to clarify his position. He claimed there are "at least four hypotheses about the origin of the virus," ranging from "the engineered-bio weapon hypothesis" to "natural," which Cotton calls "still the most likely but almost certainly not from the Wuhan food market."In his interview on Fox, Cotton said his conviction that the virus did not originate in the Wuhan food market was based on a study published in the Lancet medical journal in January 2020.At CNN, we start with the facts. Visit CNN's home for Facts First."Epidemiologists who are widely respected from China who have published a study in the international journal The Lancet have demonstrated that several of the original cases did not have any contact with that food market," Cotton said. "The virus went into that food market before it came out of that food market."Early January statements from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission had said most cases were related to the South China Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, based on preliminary studies.Besides Cotton, The Washington Times, citing an Israeli biological warfare analyst, suggested the virus was developed in a lab, potentially as part of a Chinese bioweapons program. A story claiming China planned to admit the virus came from the lab was also circulating on Facebook but flagged by fact-checkers as false.Facts First: Experts have dismissed Cotton's "engineered bioweapon hypothesis" but noted it's possible, yet unlikely, that the lab was connected to the start of the outbreak.Vipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at MIT with a background in chemical engineering told CNN, "the thing that weighs against the claim is that it's a terrible bioweapon. If you were engineering a bioweapon this would have the absolute opposite of the characteristics you would want."Cotton's other hypotheses were more plausible, Narang said."If the claim is that there were bats at the facility that may have had the novel coronavirus and there was a lapse in security and protocol, it's possible but it doesn't sound like there was anything intentional," Narang said. "Unless there's strong evidence to the contrary that should be the operating assumption."Regarding Cotton's hypothesis that the virus originated in connection with a lab, Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said "I have seen no one provide any solid information to support that theory. I think at this point you can draw a line through it and say that didn't happen.""Everyone with whom I've spoken, or whom I've read, thinks that it has come from a natural source, as did the SARS virus, as did the MERS virus. Both of those were also coronaviruses in animal populations that jumped to the human species in the natural environment," Schaffner said. "By now scientists all over the world have looked at this virus and nothing nefarious has come up."Chinese responseIn his conversation with Fox's Maria Bartiromo on Sunday, Cotton decried China's response to the virus. He said, "They have more than 70 million people now under quarantine, and you've probably seen the videos online from social media sites, as have I, of the Chinese Communist Party's police beating people who they think might have coronavirus or trying to keep them locked inside of their apartments or quarantining them in large hospitals or what have you."Facts First: Cotton exaggerated certain aspects of China's response to the situation. While almost half of China's population is in some way restricted from traveling in response to the outbreak, not all of these individuals are in quarantine.The strictest restrictions are in the four cities at the heart of the outbreak, where residents are now forbidden to leave their homes. The combined population of these cities is approximately 25 million.Even taking into account individuals outside of these cities in self-quarantine as well as the more than 70,000 individuals in mainland China infected with the virus, the total is still less than Cotton's estimated 70 million. As of Monday, the total number of cases of coronavirus worldwide was 71,000 which includes patients demonstrating symptoms who have not yet tested positive. While there have been concerns about the figures China has reported, given the government's track record of suppressing information about this and previous crises, the World Health Organization has backed the way China now counts and reports the number of coronavirus cases.In an effort to stop the spread of the virus, certain residential compounds have been sealed off and officials have been authorized to go door-to-door for screening purposes.On these screenings Schaffner said, "We know that people have been organized to go door to door and take their temperature and seek out people who are ill.

Fact-checking Tom Cotton's claims about the coronavirusCNN WireFebruary 18, 2020 Tuesday 1:10 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1167 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON (CNN) BodyWASHINGTON (CNN) --  Over the weekend, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton came under fire for a series of comments and tweets on the coronavirus. On Fox News Sunday morning, Cotton suggested the virus did not originate in an animal market as the Chinese government has claimed, but perhaps from another source, such as an infectious disease research lab nearby. While acknowledging there's no evidence the disease originated there, Cotton questioned the validity of China's statements, saying "China was lying from the beginning, and they're still lying today."Cotton's theory is one of many that have been floating around as China and other countries aim to get a handle on the outbreak. Here's what we know about the coronavirus.The originsAfter his appearance on Fox News, Cotton took to Twitter to clarify his position. He claimed there are "at least four hypotheses about the origin of the virus," ranging from "the engineered-bio weapon hypothesis" to "natural," which Cotton calls "still the most likely but almost certainly not from the Wuhan food market."In his interview on Fox, Cotton said his conviction that the virus did not originate in the Wuhan food market was based on a study published in the Lancet medical journal in January 2020."Epidemiologists who are widely respected from China who have published a study in the international journal The Lancet have demonstrated that several of the original cases did not have any contact with that food market," Cotton said. "The virus went into that food market before it came out of that food market."Early January statements from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission had said most cases were related to the South China Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, based on preliminary studies.Besides Cotton, The Washington Times, citing an Israeli biological warfare analyst, suggested the virus was developed in a lab, potentially as part of a Chinese bioweapons program. A story claiming China planned to admit the virus came from the lab was also circulating on Facebook but flagged by fact-checkers as false.Facts First: Experts have dismissed Cotton's "engineered bioweapon hypothesis" but noted it's possible, yet unlikely, that the lab was connected to the start of the outbreak. Vipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at MIT with a background in chemical engineering told CNN, "the thing that weighs against the claim is that it's a terrible bioweapon. If you were engineering a bioweapon this would have the absolute opposite of the characteristics you would want."Cotton's other hypotheses were more plausible, Narang said."If the claim is that there were bats at the facility that may have had the novel coronavirus and there was a lapse in security and protocol, it's possible but it doesn't sound like there was anything intentional," Narang said. "Unless there's strong evidence to the contrary that should be the operating assumption."Regarding Cotton's hypothesis that the virus originated in connection with a lab, Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said "I have seen no one provide any solid information to support that theory. I think at this point you can draw a line through it and say that didn't happen.""Everyone with whom I've spoken, or whom I've read, thinks that it has come from a natural source, as did the SARS virus, as did the MERS virus. Both of those were also coronaviruses in animal populations that jumped to the human species in the natural environment," Schaffner said. "By now scientists all over the world have looked at this virus and nothing nefarious has come up." Chinese responseIn his conversation with Fox's Maria Bartiromo on Sunday, Cotton decried China's response to the virus. He said, "They have more than 70 million people now under quarantine, and you've probably seen the videos online from social media sites, as have I, of the Chinese Communist Party's police beating people who they think might have coronavirus or trying to keep them locked inside of their apartments or quarantining them in large hospitals or what have you."Facts First: Cotton exaggerated certain aspects of China's response to the situation. While almost half of China's population is in some way restricted from traveling in response to the outbreak, not all of these individuals are in quarantine.The strictest restrictions are in the four cities at the heart of the outbreak, where residents are now forbidden to leave their homes. The combined population of these cities is approximately 25 million. Even taking into account individuals outside of these cities in self-quarantine as well as the more than 70,000 individuals in mainland China infected with the virus, the total is still less than Cotton's estimated 70 million. As of Monday, the total number of cases of coronavirus worldwide was 71,000 which includes patients demonstrating symptoms who have not yet tested positive. While there have been concerns about the figures China has reported, given the government's track record of suppressing information about this and previous crises, the World Health Organization has backed the way China now counts and reports the number of coronavirus cases. In an effort to stop the spread of the virus, certain residential compounds have been sealed off and officials have been authorized to go door-to-door for screening purposes.On these screenings Schaffner said, "We know that people have been organized to go door to door and take their temperature and seek out people who are ill. I have heard reports that sometimes they are forceful, but I have not heard about beating."Warm weather to the rescue?President Donald Trump has also been vocal on Twitter about the coronavirus, largely in praise for Chinese President Xi Jinping's response to the situation. In one such series of tweets, Trump implied warm weather would weaken and help eliminate the virus, a claim he has since reiterated in public remarks.Speaking to the nation's governors, Trump said, "The virus that we're talking about having to do, you know a lot of people think that goes away in April, with the heat, as the heat comes in. Typically that will go away in April."Facts First: Infectious disease experts told CNN nobody knows enough about the novel coronavirus to make assessments about its behavior, so they cannot say for sure yet whether it will behave as the President has claimed.There is a basis for the President's assumption. During a briefing last week on the coronavirus, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases noted that the regular flu is seasonal, with a decline in cases often around March and April."There's a certainty, for example, of seasonal flu," Fauci said.

NEW CORONAVIRUS CASES EASE, BUT DEATH TOLL NEAR 1,900States News ServiceFebruary 18, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 853 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):The reported number of new coronavirus cases eased Tuesday in China, but the death toll from the infections still rose to nearly 1,900, including the director of a hospital at the epicenter of the outbreak.Chinese officials reported 1,886 new cases, the first time the daily figure had dipped below 2,000 since late January, but the overall figure now totals more than 72,000. A total of 98 new deaths were reported, the first time the figure had dropped below 100 in a week.Among the deaths was Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuchang Hospital in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province that is at the center of the outbreak.Director-General of the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus speaks during a news conference on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Geneva, Switzerland, Feb. 11, 2020.World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the Chinese coronavirus figures appear "to show a decline in new cases" but emphasized the new data "must be interpreted very cautiously.""We don't have enough data on cases outside China to make meaningful conclusions," Tedros said. A Chinese pulmonologist predicted the number of infections will level off, rather than falling further, after hitting a peak later in February.Tedros also said more than 80% of patients "have mild disease and will recover."The coronavirus outbreak continued to wreak havoc around the world. WHO reported that outside China there are now 804 cases in 25 countries, with three deaths.Nurses walk inside a quarantine room for coronavirus patients at finished but still unused building A2 of the Shanghai Public Clinical Center, in Shanghai, China, Feb. 17, 2020.Russia said starting Thursday it would ban all Chinese from entering its territory.Tatiana Golikova, the deputy prime minister for health, said the decision was necessary "because of the worsening epidemic in China and the fact that Chinese nationals are continuing to arrive on Russian territory."U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it took the United States "too long to get the medical experts into" China to help combat the outbreak.On a visit to Africa, Pompeo said, "We hope that every country that has information, this includes China, will be completely open and transparent ... We are hopeful that the Chinese government will increase its transparency [and] will continue to share this information."Global stock markets mostly fell Tuesday after American technology giant Apple reported the coronavirus was hurting its revenues and that it would not meet its March sales forecast.FILE PHOTO: A woman wearing a mask walks past a quarantine notice about the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan, China, at an arrival hall of Haneda airport in Tokyo, Japan, Jan. 20, 2020.The U.S. said Monday it had evacuated more than 300 of its citizens and their immediate family members who had been on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship. One flight carrying the passengers arrived early Monday at Travis Air Force Base in California, while another landed hours later at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.A group of 14 people who did not show symptoms, but did test positive for the virus, were allowed on the flights in an area isolated from the rest of the passengers. All of the evacuees are being held under quarantine for 14 days.Australia announced Monday it would also be evacuating its citizens from the ship. Canada, Italy, South Korea and Hong Kong are planning their own evacuation efforts.The U.S. State Department is also looking into the case of a U.S. citizen who was diagnosed with the coronavirus after departing another cruise ship, the Westerdam, whose passengers tested negative for the virus before disembarking in Cambodia.Medical workers in protective suits attend to a patient inside an isolated ward of Wuhan Red Cross Hospital in Wuhan, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak, in Hubei province, China, Feb. 16, 2020.Malaysian medical authorities said the passenger, an 83-year-old woman, twice tested positive for the virus upon arriving in Malaysia after showing signs of a viral infection, a State Department spokesperson said Sunday. She is the first person from the Westerdam to test positive. Her husband tested negative.The spokesperson said U.S. authorities do not have "sufficient evidence to determine when the passenger may have been exposed and where." The American patient remains in Malaysia where she is receiving treatment.While China has recently been complimented for the way it has handled the outbreak and its efforts to contain it, the WHO is still asking for more information on how China is making its diagnoses.Chinese state media Saturday published a speech President Xi Jinping made Feb. 3 that shows Chinese authorities knew more about the seriousness of the coronavirus at least two weeks before it made the dangers known to the public. It wasn't until late January that officials said the virus could spread among humans.In a Jan. 7 speech, Xi ordered the shutdown of the cities most affected by the virus. Those lockdowns began Jan. 23.Load-Date: February 18, 2020End of Document

The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.4%, and the Russell 2000 increased 0.5%.In the U.S., building permits climbed to a near 13-year high in January, while China signaled further support for businesses affected by the coronavirus. In addition, the FOMC minutes from the January meeting didn't alter the market's favorable outlook for monetary policy, which is to say that policy could be adjusted if the coronavirus situation doesn't improve.Although the stock market did lose some steam into the close, the S&P 500 energy (+1.3%) and information technology (+1.1%) sectors still rose more than 1.0%. Energy stocks benefited from a sharp increase in oil prices ($53.32/bbl, +1.22, +2.3%). The defensive-oriented real estate (-1.4%) and utilities (-1.1%) sectors closed noticeably lower.Apple (AAPL 323.62, +4.62, +1.5%) provided influential leadership for the market while momentum stock like Tesla (TSLA 917.42, +59.02, +6.9%) and Virgin Galactic (SPCE 37.35, +7.05, +23.3%) stayed hot.Apple's advance today was a testament to the market's view that the coronavirus is a transitory event. Shares recouped most of yesterday's losses following the company's quarterly revenue warning due to the virus. Regarding Tesla, its price target was raised to $928 from $729 at Piper Sandler.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.6%, thanks to strength in NVIDIA (NVIDA 314.70, +18.13, +6.1%), which was upgraded to Outperform from Mkt Perform at Bernstein, and Analog Devices (ADI 123.89, +5.32, +4.5%), which beat earnings estimates.U.S. Treasuries traded within a narrow range and closed slightly lower. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.42%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.57%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.2% to 99.59.Reviewing Wednesday's economic data:The Producer Price Index for January was up 0.5% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) and core PPI, which excludes food and energy, was also up 0.5% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%).Notwithstanding the large m/m increases, the key takeaway from the report is that producer prices remain relatively tame on a yr/yr basis, up 2.1% for total PPI and up 1.7% for core PPI. Also, with the Consumer Price Index released last week, it is clear today that there wasn't much bleed-through in January to the consumer side of things from the uptick in producer prices.Granted total housing starts declined 3.6% m/m in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.567 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.390 million), but that was well above expectations and marked a 21.4% yr/yr increase. Building permits -- a leading indicator -- increased 9.2% m/m to 1.551 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.460 million) and were up 17.9% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that the three-month moving average for starts (1.525 mln) is the highest since January 2007.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index fell 6.4% following a 1.1% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the Philadelphia Fed Index for February, and the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index for January on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +9.4% YTDS&P 500 +4.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +2.8% YTDRussell 2000 +1.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1540/1334. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1913/1260.15:25 ETDow +140.03 at 29372.13, Nasdaq +92.98 at 9825.75, S&P +18.88 at 3389.17[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.6% and is on pace to close in record territory.One last look at the S&P 500 sectors shows energy (+1.5%) and information technology (+1.1%) up more than 1%, while utilities (-0.9%) and real estate (-1.0%) are down about 1%. No other sector is trading lower today.WTI crude rose $1.22 (+2.3%) to $53.32/bbl.15:00 ETDow +155.26 at 29387.36, Nasdaq +100.23 at 9833, S&P +21.21 at 3391.5[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is up 0.6%, and the Russell 2000 is up 0.8%.The Fed's minutes from its January policy meeting have been largely unnoticed by the market, as they didn't provide the market any new surprises. Participants agreed that the current stance of policy is appropriate.Looking ahead, Avis Budget (CAR 42.85, +1.54, +3.7%), Hyatt Hotels (H 90.26, +1.58, +1.8%), and Zillow (ZG 55.02, +2.63, +5.0%) are some notable companies that will report earnings after the close.14:25 ETDow +145.26 at 29377.36, Nasdaq +97.04 at 9829.81, S&P +20.11 at 3390.4[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages held firm after the latest FOMC minutes, released at the bottom of the hour, revealed that the Committee expects economic growth to continue at a moderate pace, aided by easing of certain economic risks. The Committee added that the current policy stance could be helpful "for a time" in supporting U.S. economic activity and employment.Specifically, participants generally saw the distribution of risks to the outlook for economic activity as somewhat more favorable than at the previous meeting, although a number of downside risks remained prominent; the easing of trade tensions resulting from the recent agreement with China and the passage of the USMCA as well as tentative signs of stabilization in global economic growth helped reduce downside risks and appeared to buoy business sentiment.Additionally, the threat of the coronavirus, in addition to its human toll, had emerged as a new risk to the global growth outlook, which participants agreed warranted close watching.Looking ahead, participants were generally cautiously optimistic about the effects on the business sector of the recent favorable trade developments and the signs of stabilization in global growth.Treasury prices held their modestly higher tone following the minutes with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note is up about 1 point to 1.57%.13:55 ETDow +146.57 at 29378.67, Nasdaq +93.31 at 9826.08, S&P +19.77 at 3390.06[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages haven't moved much in the last half hour with the Nasdaq Composite still atop the standings, up 0.96%.Gold futures settled $8.20 higher (+0.5%) to $1,611.80/oz, its fifth straight positive session, despite strength in both the major averages and the dollar.Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index is higher by about 0.3% to 99.69.As a reminder, the minutes from the FOMC's January meeting will be released at 2 p.m. ET.13:30 ETDow +141.25 at 29373.35, Nasdaq +92.08 at 9824.85, S&P +19.62 at 3389.91[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have fallen a bit off their session highs from 30 minutes ago, though still stand decently higher across the board. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (+0.95%) is still atop the standings.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that JPMorgan Chase (JPM 138.36, +2.72, +2.01%), Goldman Sachs (GS 237.01, +3.80, +1.63%), and Walt Disney (DIS 141.28, +2.14, +1.54%) are outperforming. JPM and GS are notably higher due in part to decent strength out of the financial space, while DIS bounces off its 200-day SMA (138.94).Conversely, Cisco Systems (CSCO 45.92, -0.67, -1.44%) sits at the bottom of the index.Today's advance trims the DJIA's declines since Friday's close to under 0.1%.12:55 ETDow +159.56 at 29391.66, Nasdaq +98.15 at 9830.92, S&P +21.17 at 3391.46[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (+0.6%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%) are trading at new all-time highs, as the market shifts back into offense with technology stocks setting the pace. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.6%.Apple (AAPL 324.44, +5.44, +1.7%) has essentially recouped all losses that followed its revenue warning yesterday, reflecting the market's lack of concern for the coronavirus. Apple's 1.7% gain, coupled with Amazon's (AMZN 2181.66, +25.99, +1.2%) gain, is providing influential support for the market.The S&P 500 information technology (+1.2%) and financials (+0.9%) sectors outperform, while the defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%) and utilities (-0.8%) sectors trade in negative territory.Semiconductor stocks are rallying following positive news in NVIDIA (NVDA 311.97, +15.33, +5.2%) and Analog Devices (ADI 124.10, +5.54, +4.7%). NVIDIA was upgraded to Outperform from Mkt Perform at Bernstein, and Analog Devices beat profit expectations. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.6%.There also remain pockets of euphoria in the market, namely in shares of Tesla (TSLA 911.99, +52.90, +6.1%) and Virgin Galactic (SPCE 33.21, +2.92, +9.6%). Tesla's price target was raised to $928 from $729 at Piper Sandler. SPCE is up nearly 200% this year.Interestingly, U.S. Treasuries are barely moving despite the bullish bias in equities and the 0.5% increase in the Producer Price Index for January (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%). Regarding the latter, the market will presumably need to see a sustained rise in inflation pressure to even start to think about the Fed.The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.42%, and the 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.3% to 99.70. WTI crude is up 2.6% to $53.65/bbl.Reviewing today's economic data, which focused on producer prices and the housing sector:The Producer Price Index for January was up 0.5% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) and core PPI, which excludes food and energy, was also up 0.5% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%).Notwithstanding the large m/m increases, the key takeaway from the report is that producer prices remain relatively tame on a yr/yr basis, up 2.1% for total PPI and up 1.7% for core PPI. Also, with the Consumer Price Index released last week, it is clear today that there wasn't much bleed-through in January to the consumer side of things from the uptick in producer prices.Granted total housing starts declined 3.6% m/m in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.567 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.390 million), but that was well above expectations and marked a 21.4% yr/yr increase. Building permits -- a leading indicator -- increased 9.2% m/m to 1.551 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.460 million) and were up 17.9% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that the three-month moving average for starts (1.525 mln) is the highest since January 2007.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index fell 6.4% following a 1.1% increase in the prior week.As a reminder, the FOMC Minutes from the January meeting will be released at 2:00 p.m. ET.12:25 ETDow +162.39 at 29394.49, Nasdaq +93.57 at 9826.34, S&P +21.00 at 3391.29[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.6%, while the Nasdaq outperforms with gain of 0.9%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results.

The market resiliently cut its losses during the afternoon, though, leaving the S&P 500 down 0.3% for the session.The Nasdaq Composite (+0.02%) eked out a closing record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) still finished lower.Apple specifically said it doesn't expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to the coronavirus restraining its supply chain and impacting consumer demand in China. The news didn't come as a surprise given similar warnings previously issued by companies, and investors presumably viewed the situation as temporary and China-specific.Investors, however, did assume some defensive positioning, evident by the gains in bonds, gold futures ($1590.00, +$19.00, +1.2%), and the CBOE Volatility Index (14.83, +1.15, +8.4%). The resulting decline in Treasury yields undercut the financials sector (-0.9%), while it benefited the utilities sector (+0.8%).The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.40%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.56%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.4%, and the Russell 2000 increased 0.5%.In the U.S., building permits climbed to a near 13-year high in January, while China signaled further support for businesses affected by the coronavirus. In addition, the FOMC minutes from the January meeting didn't alter the market's favorable outlook for monetary policy, which is to say that policy could be adjusted if the coronavirus situation doesn't improve.Although the stock market did lose some steam into the close, the S&P 500 energy (+1.3%) and information technology (+1.1%) sectors still rose more than 1.0%. Energy stocks benefited from a sharp increase in oil prices ($53.32/bbl, +1.22, +2.3%). The defensive-oriented real estate (-1.4%) and utilities (-1.1%) sectors closed noticeably lower.Apple (AAPL 323.62, +4.62, +1.5%) provided influential leadership for the market while momentum stock like Tesla (TSLA 917.42, +59.02, +6.9%) and Virgin Galactic (SPCE 37.35, +7.05, +23.3%) stayed hot.Apple's advance today was a testament to the market's view that the coronavirus is a transitory event. Shares recouped most of yesterday's losses following the company's quarterly revenue warning due to the virus. Regarding Tesla, its price target was raised to $928 from $729 at Piper Sandler.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.6%, thanks to strength in NVIDIA (NVDA 314.70, +18.13, +6.1%), which was upgraded to Outperform from Mkt Perform at Bernstein, and Analog Devices (ADI 123.89, +5.32, +4.5%), which beat earnings estimates.U.S. Treasuries traded within a narrow range and closed slightly lower. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.42%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.57%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.2% to 99.59.Reviewing Wednesday's economic data:The Producer Price Index for January was up 0.5% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) and core PPI, which excludes food and energy, was also up 0.5% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%).Notwithstanding the large m/m increases, the key takeaway from the report is that producer prices remain relatively tame on a yr/yr basis, up 2.1% for total PPI and up 1.7% for core PPI. Also, with the Consumer Price Index released last week, it is clear today that there wasn't much bleed-through in January to the consumer side of things from the uptick in producer prices.Granted total housing starts declined 3.6% m/m in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.567 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.390 million), but that was well above expectations and marked a 21.4% yr/yr increase. Building permits -- a leading indicator -- increased 9.2% m/m to 1.551 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.460 million) and were up 17.9% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that the three-month moving average for starts (1.525 mln) is the highest since January 2007.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index fell 6.4% following a 1.1% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the Philadelphia Fed Index for February, and the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index for January on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite +9.4% YTDS&P 500 +4.8% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +2.8% YTDRussell 2000 +1.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1540/1334. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1913/1260.15:25 ETDow +140.03 at 29372.13, Nasdaq +92.98 at 9825.75, S&P +18.88 at 3389.17[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.6% and is on pace to close in record territory.One last look at the S&P 500 sectors shows energy (+1.5%) and information technology (+1.1%) up more than 1%, while utilities (-0.9%) and real estate (-1.0%) are down about 1%.

Participants agreed that the current stance of policy is appropriate.Looking ahead, Avis Budget (CAR 42.85, +1.54, +3.7%), Hyatt Hotels (H 90.26, +1.58, +1.8%), and Zillow (ZG 55.02, +2.63, +5.0%) are some notable companies that will report earnings after the close.14:25 ETDow +145.26 at 29377.36, Nasdaq +97.04 at 9829.81, S&P +20.11 at 3390.4[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages held firm after the latest FOMC minutes, released at the bottom of the hour, revealed that the Committee expects economic growth to continue at a moderate pace, aided by easing of certain economic risks. The Committee added that the current policy stance could be helpful "for a time" in supporting U.S. economic activity and employment.Specifically, participants generally saw the distribution of risks to the outlook for economic activity as somewhat more favorable than at the previous meeting, although a number of downside risks remained prominent; the easing of trade tensions resulting from the recent agreement with China and the passage of the USMCA as well as tentative signs of stabilization in global economic growth helped reduce downside risks and appeared to buoy business sentiment.Additionally, the threat of the coronavirus, in addition to its human toll, had emerged as a new risk to the global growth outlook, which participants agreed warranted close watching.Looking ahead, participants were generally cautiously optimistic about the effects on the business sector of the recent favorable trade developments and the signs of stabilization in global growth.Treasury prices held their modestly higher tone following the minutes with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note is up about 1 point to 1.57%.13:55 ETDow +146.57 at 29378.67, Nasdaq +93.31 at 9826.08, S&P +19.77 at 3390.06[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages haven't moved much in the last half hour with the Nasdaq Composite still atop the standings, up 0.96%.Gold futures settled $8.20 higher (+0.5%) to $1,611.80/oz, its fifth straight positive session, despite strength in both the major averages and the dollar.Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index is higher by about 0.3% to 99.69.As a reminder, the minutes from the FOMC's January meeting will be released at 2 p.m. ET.13:30 ETDow +141.25 at 29373.35, Nasdaq +92.08 at 9824.85, S&P +19.62 at 3389.91[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have fallen a bit off their session highs from 30 minutes ago, though still stand decently higher across the board. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (+0.95%) is still atop the standings.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that JPMorgan Chase (JPM 138.36, +2.72, +2.01%), Goldman Sachs (GS 237.01, +3.80, +1.63%), and Walt Disney (DIS 141.28, +2.14, +1.54%) are outperforming. JPM and GS are notably higher due in part to decent strength out of the financial space, while DIS bounces off its 200-day SMA (138.94).Conversely, Cisco Systems (CSCO 45.92, -0.67, -1.44%) sits at the bottom of the index.Today's advance trims the DJIA's declines since Friday's close to under 0.1%.12:55 ETDow +159.56 at 29391.66, Nasdaq +98.15 at 9830.92, S&P +21.17 at 3391.46[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (+0.6%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%) are trading at new all-time highs, as the market shifts back into offense with technology stocks setting the pace. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.6%.Apple (AAPL 324.44, +5.44, +1.7%) has essentially recouped all losses that followed its revenue warning yesterday, reflecting the market's lack of concern for the coronavirus. Apple's 1.7% gain, coupled with Amazon's (AMZN 2181.66, +25.99, +1.2%) gain, is providing influential support for the market.The S&P 500 information technology (+1.2%) and financials (+0.9%) sectors outperform, while the defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%) and utilities (-0.8%) sectors trade in negative territory.Semiconductor stocks are rallying following positive news in NVIDIA (NVDA 311.97, +15.33, +5.2%) and Analog Devices (ADI 124.10, +5.54, +4.7%). NVIDIA was upgraded to Outperform from Mkt Perform at Bernstein, and Analog Devices beat profit expectations. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.6%.There also remain pockets of euphoria in the market, namely in shares of Tesla (TSLA 911.99, +52.90, +6.1%) and Virgin Galactic (SPCE 33.21, +2.92, +9.6%). Tesla's price target was raised to $928 from $729 at Piper Sandler. SPCE is up nearly 200% this year.Interestingly, U.S. Treasuries are barely moving despite the bullish bias in equities and the 0.5% increase in the Producer Price Index for January (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%). Regarding the latter, the market will presumably need to see a sustained rise in inflation pressure to even start to think about the Fed.The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.42%, and the 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.3% to 99.70. WTI crude is up 2.6% to $53.65/bbl.Reviewing today's economic data, which focused on producer prices and the housing sector:The Producer Price Index for January was up 0.5% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) and core PPI, which excludes food and energy, was also up 0.5% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%).Notwithstanding the large m/m increases, the key takeaway from the report is that producer prices remain relatively tame on a yr/yr basis, up 2.1% for total PPI and up 1.7% for core PPI. Also, with the Consumer Price Index released last week, it is clear today that there wasn't much bleed-through in January to the consumer side of things from the uptick in producer prices.Granted total housing starts declined 3.6% m/m in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.567 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.390 million), but that was well above expectations and marked a 21.4% yr/yr increase. Building permits -- a leading indicator -- increased 9.2% m/m to 1.551 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.460 million) and were up 17.9% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that the three-month moving average for starts (1.525 mln) is the highest since January 2007.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index fell 6.4% following a 1.1% increase in the prior week.As a reminder, the FOMC Minutes from the January meeting will be released at 2:00 p.m. ET.12:25 ETDow +162.39 at 29394.49, Nasdaq +93.57 at 9826.34, S&P +21.00 at 3391.29[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.6%, while the Nasdaq outperforms with gain of 0.9%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results.

The market has shifted to offense after yesterday's defensive stance.The information technology sector (+1.1%) is today's leader after declining the most yesterday, while the utilities sector (-0.6%) is today's laggard after advancing the most yesterday. Despite cases of the coronavirus continuing to climb, the market is simply holding onto the view that it has seen the worst and things will get better soon.WTI crude is up 2.0% to $53.35/bbl as it continues to climb off recent lows where it was below $50.00/bbl earlier this month.10:55 ETDow +96.11 at 29328.21, Nasdaq +74.85 at 9807.62, S&P +16.54 at 3386.83[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade sideways with comfortable gains.

These three companies have a combined market cap of over $3.5 trillion.Interestingly, despite the unabated gains in the stock market, longer-dated bonds are holding steady. The benchmark 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.56%. The big jump in producer prices for January barely moved prices on the short end of the curve, too.10:25 ETDow +86.45 at 29318.55, Nasdaq +76.79 at 9809.56, S&P +15.50 at 3385.79[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently up 0.5% after recently setting a new intraday high.Garmin (GRMN 104.55, +7.43, +7.7%) is among today's earnings winners, as shares rise nearly 8% after the company beat top and bottom-line estimates and issued upside FY20 guidance.Conversely, shares of Groupon (GRPN 1.84, -1.21, -39.8%) have tanked 40% after the struggling company missed top and bottom-line estimates and said it will exit the Goods business. The company announced a proposal for a reverse stock split.09:55 ETDow +95.52 at 29327.62, Nasdaq +75.23 at 9808, S&P +16.31 at 3386.6[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now up 0.5%, and the Russell 2000 is up 0.4%. The market's positive bias is being driven by strength in the technology space, particularly Apple (AAPL 322.87, +3.86, +1.2%) and the semiconductor stocks.Apple is continuing its rebound from yesterday's lows, while chipmakers are rallying around an earnings beat from Analog Devices (ADI 125.23, +6.66, +5.6%) and an analyst upgrade for NVIDIA (NVDA 308.46, +11.86, +5.6%). The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.3%.Separately, shares of Tesla (TSLA 911.77, +53.34, +6.3%) are up more than 6%, as yet another analyst has turned bullish on the stock.

The market resiliently cut its losses during the afternoon, though, leaving the S&P 500 down 0.3% for the session.The Nasdaq Composite (+0.02%) eked out a closing record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) still finished lower.Apple specifically said it doesn't expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to the coronavirus restraining its supply chain and impacting consumer demand in China. The news didn't come as a surprise given similar warnings previously issued by companies, and investors presumably viewed the situation as temporary and China-specific.Investors, however, did assume some defensive positioning, evident by the gains in bonds, gold futures ($1590.00, +$19.00, +1.2%), and the CBOE Volatility Index (14.83, +1.15, +8.4%). The resulting decline in Treasury yields undercut the financials sector (-0.9%), while it benefited the utilities sector (+0.8%).The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.40%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.56%.

Both stocks extended their yearly gains to 18.7% and 16.6%, respectively, while Apple trimmed its yearly gain to 8.6%.Walmart (WMT 119.63, +1.74, +1.5%) also outperformed despite missing profit estimates.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.4%, and the Russell 2000 increased 0.5%. In the U.S., building permits climbed to a near 13-year high in January, while China signaled further support for businesses affected by the coronavirus. In addition, the FOMC minutes from the January meeting didn't alter the market's favorable outlook for monetary policy, which is to say that policy could be adjusted if the coronavirus situation doesn't improve. Although the stock market did lose some steam into the close, the S&P 500 energy (+1.3%) and information technology (+1.1%) sectors still rose more than 1.0%. Energy stocks benefited from a sharp increase in oil prices ($53.32/bbl, +1.22, +2.3%). The defensive-oriented real estate (-1.4%) and utilities (-1.1%) sectors closed noticeably lower. Apple (AAPL 323.62, +4.62, +1.5%) provided influential leadership for the market while momentum stock like Tesla (TSLA 917.42, +59.02, +6.9%) and Virgin Galactic (SPCE 37.35, +7.05, +23.3%) stayed hot. Apple's advance today was a testament to the market's view that the coronavirus is a transitory event. Shares recouped most of yesterday's losses following the company's quarterly revenue warning due to the virus. Regarding Tesla, its price target was raised to $928 from $729 at Piper Sandler. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.6%, thanks to strength in NVIDIA (NVDA 314.70, +18.13, +6.1%), which was upgraded to Outperform from Mkt Perform at Bernstein, and Analog Devices (ADI 123.89, +5.32, +4.5%), which beat earnings estimates. U.S. Treasuries traded within a narrow range and closed slightly lower. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.42%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.57%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.2% to 99.59. Reviewing Wednesday's economic data:• The Producer Price Index for January was up 0.5% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) and core PPI, which excludes food and energy, was also up 0.5% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%).Notwithstanding the large m/m increases, the key takeaway from the report is that producer prices remain relatively tame on a yr/yr basis, up 2.1% for total PPI and up 1.7% for core PPI. Also, with the Consumer Price Index released last week, it is clear today that there wasn't much bleed-through in January to the consumer side of things from the uptick in producer prices.• Granted total housing starts declined 3.6% m/m in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.567 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.390 million), but that was well above expectations and marked a 21.4% yr/yr increase. Building permits -- a leading indicator -- increased 9.2% m/m to 1.551 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.460 million) and were up 17.9% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that the three-month moving average for starts (1.525 mln) is the highest since January 2007.• The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index fell 6.4% following a 1.1% increase in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the Philadelphia Fed Index for February, and the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index for January on Thursday.• Nasdaq Composite +9.4% YTD• S&P 500 +4.8% YTD• Dow Jones Industrial Average +2.8% YTD• Russell 2000 +1.4% YTDNASDAQ - 1913 - 1260 - 2.4 blnNYSE - 1540 - 1334 - 828.7 mlnDJ30 - +115.84 - 29347.94NASDAQ - +84.44 - 9817.21SP500 - +15.86 - 3386.15WTI crude gains more than 2% - Feb 19 - 15:25 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.6% and is on pace to close in record territory. One last look at the S&P 500 sectors shows energy (+1.5%) and information technology (+1.1%) up more than 1%, while utilities (-0.9%) and real estate (-1.0%) are down about 1%.

Participants agreed that the current stance of policy is appropriate.Looking ahead, Avis Budget (CAR 42.85, +1.54, +3.7%), Hyatt Hotels (H 90.26, +1.58, +1.8%), and Zillow (ZG 55.02, +2.63, +5.0%) are some notable companies that will report earnings after the close. NASDAQ - 2076 - 1056 - 1.8 blnNYSE - 1673 - 1189 - 426.7 mlnDJ30 - +155.26 - 29387.36NASDAQ - +100.23 - 9833SP500 - +21.21 - 3391.5Stocks, Treasuries Hold Gains Following Minutes - Feb 19 - 14:25 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages held firm after the latest FOMC minutes, released at the bottom of the hour, revealed that the Committee expects economic growth to continue at a moderate pace, aided by easing of certain economic risks. The Committee added that the current policy stance could be helpful "for a time" in supporting U.S. economic activity and employment.Specifically, participants generally saw the distribution of risks to the outlook for economic activity as somewhat more favorable than at the previous meeting, although a number of downside risks remained prominent; the easing of trade tensions resulting from the recent agreement with China and the passage of the USMCA as well as tentative signs of stabilization in global economic growth helped reduce downside risks and appeared to buoy business sentiment.Additionally, the threat of the coronavirus, in addition to its human toll, had emerged as a new risk to the global growth outlook, which participants agreed warranted close watching.Looking ahead, participants were generally cautiously optimistic about the effects on the business sector of the recent favorable trade developments and the signs of stabilization in global growth.Treasury prices held their modestly higher tone following the minutes with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note is up about 1 point to 1.57%.NASDAQ - 2017 - 1097 - 1.65 blnNYSE - 1637 - 1198 - 394.0 mlnDJ30 - +145.26 - 29377.36NASDAQ - +97.04 - 9829.81SP500 - +20.11 - 3390.4Gold Higher For Fifth Straight Session With FOMC Minutes On Deck - Feb 19 - 13:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages haven't moved much in the last half hour with the Nasdaq Composite still atop the standings, up 0.96%. Gold futures settled $8.20 higher (+0.5%) to $1,611.80/oz, its fifth straight positive session, despite strength in both the major averages and the dollar.Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index is higher by about 0.3% to 99.69.As a reminder, the minutes from the FOMC's January meeting will be released at 2 p.m. ET.NASDAQ - 2015 - 1114 - 1.53 blnNYSE - 1680 - 1158 - 367.0 mlnDJ30 - +146.57 - 29378.67NASDAQ - +93.31 - 9826.08SP500 - +19.77 - 3390.06Averages Peel Off Session Highs - Feb 19 - 13:30 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have fallen a bit off their session highs from 30 minutes ago, though still stand decently higher across the board. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (+0.95%) is still atop the standings.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that JPMorgan Chase (JPM 138.36, +2.72, +2.01%), Goldman Sachs (GS 237.01, +3.80, +1.63%), and Walt Disney (DIS 141.28, +2.14, +1.54%) are outperforming. JPM and GS are notably higher due in part to decent strength out of the financial space, while DIS bounces off its 200-day SMA (138.94).Conversely, CiscoSystems (CSCO 45.92, -0.67, -1.44%) sits at the bottom of the index.Today's advance trims the DJIA's declines since Friday's close to under 0.1%.NASDAQ - 2003 - 1106 - 1.43 blnNYSE - 1651 - 1162 - 343.0 mlnDJ30 - +141.25 - 29373.35NASDAQ - +92.08 - 9824.85SP500 - +19.62 - 3389.91Tech stocks lead market to new records - Feb 19 - 12:55 ET[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (+0.6%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%) are trading at new all-time highs, as the market shifts back into offense with technology stocks setting the pace. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.6%.Apple (AAPL 324.44, +5.44, +1.7%) has essentially recouped all losses that followed its revenue warning yesterday, reflecting the market's lack of concern for the coronavirus. Apple's 1.7% gain, coupled with Amazon's (AMZN 2181.66, +25.99, +1.2%) gain, is providing influential support for the market.The S&P 500 information technology (+1.2%) and financials (+0.9%) sectors outperform, while the defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%) and utilities (-0.8%) sectors trade in negative territory.Semiconductor stocks are rallying following positive news in NVIDIA (NVDA 311.97, +15.33, +5.2%) and Analog Devices (ADI 124.10, +5.54, +4.7%). NVIDIA was upgraded to Outperform from Mkt Perform at Bernstein, and Analog Devices beat profit expectations.

Tesla's price target was raised to $928 from $729 at Piper Sandler. SPCE is up nearly 200% this year. Interestingly, U.S. Treasuries are barely moving despite the bullish bias in equities and the 0.5% increase in the Producer Price Index for January (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%). Regarding the latter, the market will presumably need to see a sustained rise in inflation pressure to even start to think about the Fed. The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.42%, and the 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.3% to 99.70.

The market resiliently cut its losses during the afternoon, though, leaving the S&P 500 down 0.3% for the session.  The Nasdaq Composite (+0.02%) eked out a closing record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) still finished lower. Apple specifically said it doesn't expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to the coronavirus restraining its supply chain and impacting consumer demand in China. The news didn't come as a surprise given similar warnings previously issued by companies, and investors presumably viewed the situation as temporary and China-specific. Investors, however, did assume some defensive positioning, evident by the gains in bonds, gold futures ($1590.00, +$19.00, +1.2%), and the CBOE Volatility Index (14.83, +1.15, +8.4%). The resulting decline in Treasury yields undercut the financials sector (-0.9%), while it benefited the utilities sector (+0.8%). The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.40%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.56%.

Both stocks extended their yearly gains to 18.7% and 16.6%, respectively, while Apple trimmed its yearly gain to 8.6%. Walmart (WMT 119.63, +1.74, +1.5%) also outperformed despite missing profit estimates.

AHF Urges Prompt Action, Full Transparency for Mysterious Pneumonia Strain in ChinaBusiness WireJanuary 7, 2020 Tuesday 8:11 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 505 wordsDateline: LOS ANGELES BodyWith the recent discovery of a dangerous strain of unknown viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) urges the Chinese government and the World Health Organization (WHO) to do all that is necessary to identify and limit transmission of the pathogen and to be fully transparent throughout the entire process.It is currently not known what causes the illness, but signs and symptoms include fever, with some patients having difficulty in breathing and chest x-rays showing invasive lesions of both lungs. Middle East respiratory syndrome, bird flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome - the deadly virus that killed 774 people in China, Singapore, Taiwan, Canada, Vietnam, Philippines and Hong Kong during a 2002-2003 outbreak - have all been ruled out as the cause of the current strain.In addition to the 59 confirmed cases of the mysterious pneumonia in Wuhan to date, Hong Kong has also added the virus to its list of notifiable infectious diseases and is monitoring 14 patients as a precaution."With China's New Year holiday season approaching, this is probably the worst time for a dangerous, unknown virus to be going around-it's critical that in-country health agencies and the WHO go above and beyond to get it under control," said AHF President Michael Weinstein. "China was criticized for under-reporting SARS cases after the 2003 outbreak, and WHO has its own issues with its handling of infectious disease outbreaks like Ebola. We just want to ensure full transparency and a dedicated response for this virus from the outset."WHO also came under fire for mishandling the initial stages of the Ebola crisis in West Africa in 2014 and has been pressured to ensure a secured, sufficient response for the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that has been raging since August of last year and has so far killed 2,231 people as of Jan. 6."Too often, politics and bureaucracy interfere with the response to an infectious disease outbreak, when the reality on the ground and getting people the most effective and efficient help possible should be the top priority," added Weinstein. "There's simply too much at stake in a city [Wuhan] with over 11 million people to not ensure this virus is identified and one-hundred percent contained as quickly as possible."For more information, please contact Ged Kenslea at gedk@aidshealth.org or (323) 791-5526.About AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF)AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF), the largest global AIDS organization, currently provides medical care and/or services to over 1.3 million people in 43 countries worldwide in the US, Africa, Latin America/Caribbean, the Asia/Pacific Region and Eastern Europe.

Good end of year, although it was shortCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 8, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 964 wordsBodyIn December,Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte showed a growth in its total passenger traffic of 8 vs. 8.5% estimated by Monex analysts. Nationally, it reported an increase of 7.6%, while at the international level there was an increase of 10.8%.An important note is that the total traffic reported in the period 99.3% comes from commercial aviation and only 0.7% is a result of general aviation.Monex says that, nationally, the best performance during December was Chihuahua with an increase of 12.5%, followed by Cd Juarez with 8%, Culiacán with 7.3% and Monterrey with 2.9%, while at international level, the best performance was Cd Juarez with a breakthrough of 79.5% , followed by Culiacán with 27.4%, Chihuahua with 3.9% and Monterrey with 7.6 percent.Monex explains that traffic performance during the last month of the year was slightly lower than expected, but maintained a fairly attractive level towards the end of 2019. In the medium term, the financial group's attention will remain in Monterrey and Culiacan's performance, while by this year it would expect growth with a more moderate pace than previous years.According to Monex, this year would maintain an all-time high in total passenger traffic and for the time being its recommendation is Sell with a target price for the share of 135 pesos by the end of this year.Facebook is setting up a new engineering team in Singapore to focus on its lucrative advertising business in China, even as CHIEF Executive Mark Zuckerberg raises criticism from a country blocking the social network.Facebook's Asia-Pacific headquarters team is tasked with developing better ad purchasing tools for Chinese customers who have to bypass internet restrictions in China known as the big firewall, sources said.This is Facebook's first significant attempt to develop advertising tools located regionally outside its Silicon Valley headquarters, where engineering work related to China was previously carried out.Facebook confirmed the creation of the new team, describing it as a "first mission in Asia" consisting of product subteams and "commercial integrity." Its existence has not been reported previously.A spokeswoman said the team would serve "Asia as well as our global advertisers."According to analysts, Facebook sells more than $5 billion a year in advertising space to Chinese companies and government agencies looking to promote their messages abroad. That makes China the largest country of Facebook revenue after the United States, which delivered $24.1 billion in advertising sales in 2018.Zuckerberg once hoped that Facebook could find a way to operate its social network in China, making a high-profile visit to the country in 2016 and promising to learn Mandarin. Product managers made knowledge-sharing trips to China, sharing experience in application functions and advertising tools with their counterparts at companies such as Tencent and Alibaba, a source exposed.The company's Chinese dreams were finally thwarted by the Chinese government's increasingly restrictive internet policies, compounded by the political and trade tensions associated with the US-China trade war.After a stalemate in 2019, analysts from Ve por Más project that the country's economic activity would grow 1.2% annually real this year, subject to improvements in private consumption, investment and government spending; on the other hand,exports would contribute less to GDP than previous years.Five elements that would explain the recovery: low comparative base (GDP 2019: 0.1%); less restrictive monetary policy; partial dissipation of uncertainty (T-MEC, business-government rapprochements); growth in remittances and wages, and higher efficiency in the implementation of public expenditure.Gentera agreed in late 2019 to sell its Intermex family remittance payment business to TransNetwork, a U.S. company with more than 16 years of experience in payment processing, as it has about 58,000 remittance access points such as financial networks and retail chains in the Latin American region.The transaction is agreed for 100% of Intermex's capital and is subject to signature of the closing documents. This event is expected to take hold during the first months of this year; it is worth mentioning that no details were given about the agreed price of the transaction.With figures for the third quarter of 2019, the commission revenue that Intermex contributed to the group was 50 million pesos, representing 0.8% of the total revenue for that period, as well as 14.2% of commission revenue.Habitat for Humanity, through the Terwilliger Center for Housing Innovation, invited governments, companies, institutions and civil society organizations to integrate as their partners to offer housing-oriented products and services, so that people in vulnerable situations have access to a decent home.The Terwilliger Center is an articulator of knowledge, experience, advice and innovation between different actors, who are interested in offering products and services to the population located at the base of the pyramid. Its purpose is to make it possible for the housing ecosystem to work together with different partners, such as financial, business, technical advisors and suppliers of materials, among others, to make the improving family wealth through housing.The Terwilliger Center designed the Strengthening of the Housing Value Chain in Chiapas program with the support of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation as a donor. For implementation, he joined the León XIII Foundation, an organization present in the area, which made housing improvements in certain communities with families who were in housing lag within the municipalities of Chenalhó, Aldama and Chiapa de Corzo, these ranged from sheet ceilings and firm floors to organic stoves.Load-Date: February 26, 2020End of Document

Lingering Worries About Coronavirus Outbreak May Generate Selling PressureRTT News (United States)January 23, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 RTT News All Rights ReservedLength: 1956 wordsByline: editorial@rttnews.com,  (RTT Staff Writer)Body       The major U.S. index futures are pointing to a modestly lower opening on Thursday following the lackluster performance seen over the course of the previous session. Lingering concerns about the impact of the Chinese coronavirus may weigh on Wall Street after contributing to a sell-off in the Asia-Pacific markets. Despite efforts to contain the outbreak, deaths from the new coronavirus have risen to 17, with nearly 600 cases confirmed worldwide. A negative reaction to earnings news from Procter &Gamble; (PG) may also generate some selling pressure in early trading.  Shares of P&G; are slumping in pre-market trading after the consumer products giant reported fiscal second quarter earnings that beat estimates but on weaker than expected revenues. Stocks moved higher in early trading on Wednesday but gave back ground over the course of the session to end the day little changed. The Nasdaq and the S&P; 500 reached new record intraday highs before pulling back near the unchanged line. The major averages eventually finished the session mixed. While the Dow edged down 9.77 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 29,186.27, the Nasdaq inched up 12.96 points or 0.1 percent to 9,383.77 and the S&P; 500 crept up 0.96 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 3,321.75. A positive reaction to earnings news from IBM Corp. (IBM) contributed to the early strength on Wall Street, with the tech giant jumping by 3.4 percent. The advance by IBM came after the company reported better than expected fourth quarter results and provided upbeat full-year 2020 guidance. Positive sentiment was also generated in reaction to news of the Chinese government's efforts to stop the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak.  Chinese health officials told the Wall Street Journal that hospitals are stepping up preventive measures and government officials are recommending that people not enter or leave Wuhan. Buying interest waned as the day progressed, however, with traders seemingly reluctant to make significant moves ahead of earnings news from a slew of other big-name companies in the coming days. Meanwhile, traders largely shrugged off a report from the National Association of Realtors showing U.S. existing home sales rebounded by much more than anticipated in the month of December. NAR said existing home sales spiked by 3.6 percent to an annual rate of 5.54 million in December after tumbling by 1.7 percent to a rate of 5.35 million in November. Economists had expected existing home sales to jump by 1.2 percent to an annual rate of 5.43 million. With the much bigger than expected monthly increase, existing home sales in December were up by 10.8 percent compared to the same month a year ago. On a full-year basis, NAR said total existing home sales came in at 5.34 million in 2019, unchanged from the previous year. Most of the major sectors ended the day showing only modest moves, contributing to the lackluster close by the broader markets. Natural gas stocks showed a significant move to the downside, however, with the sector extending the sell-off seen in the previous session. The NYSE Arca Natural Gas Index fell by 1.7 percent to its lowest closing level in over a month. The continued weakness among natural gas stocks came even though the price of the commodity regained some ground following the nosedive seen on Tuesday. Considerable weakness also emerged among oil service stocks, as reflected by the 1.5 percent loss posted by the Philadelphia Oil Service Index. A steep drop by the price of crude oil weighed on the sector. On the other hand, steel stocks regained some ground after falling sharply in the previous session, driving the NYSE Arca Steel Index up by 1.2 percent. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures are slumping $1.03 to $55.71 a barrel after tumbling $1.64 to $56.74 a barrel on Wednesday. Meanwhile, after slipping $1.20 to $1,556.70 an ounce in the previous session, gold futures are falling $2.20 to $1,554.50 an ounce. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 109.84 yen compared to the 109.57 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Wednesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1090 compared to yesterday's $1.1093. Asia Asian stocks fell on Thursday after deaths from China's new coronavirus rose to 17, with nearly 600 cases confirmed. Investors remain worried about the contagion as the week-long Lunar New Year holidays start on Friday, when millions of Chinese travel domestically and abroad. Chinese shares plunged on concerns the deadly virus will worsen over the week-long trading break. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index plunged 84.23 points, or 2.8 percent, to 2,976.53, marking its worst end to a Lunar Year in its three-decade history.  Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled 431.92 points, or 1.5 percent, to 27,909.12 as Beijing tries to contain the new SARS-like virus. Japanese shares hit two-week lows amid heightened anxiety about the spread of the new coronavirus in China. Investors were also wary ahead of corporate earnings.  The Nikkei 225 Index slumped 235.91 points, or 1 percent, to 23,795.44, while the broader Topix closed 0.8 percent lower at 1,730.50. Commodity-related and other cyclical stocks paced the decliners as the rapidly spreading coronavirus stoked worries about economic growth in China and a dent in the travel sector in the Asia Pacific. Exporters also declined as the yen firmed to a 1-1/2-week high versus the dollar on safe-haven buying.  Meanwhile, semiconductor automated test equipment maker Advantest rallied 2.5 percent after its U.S. competitor Teradyne's fourth quarter earnings beat estimates.  In economic news, Japan posted a merchandise trade deficit of 152.5 billion yen in December, a government report showed. That narrowly beat forecasts for a shortfall of 152.6 billion yen following the 85.2 billion yen deficit in November. Exports were down 6.3 percent year-over-year, missing expectations for a drop of 4.3 percent, while imports sank an annual 4.9 percent versus forecasts for a decline of 3.2 percent. Australian markets fell notably as a tumble in oil prices pulled down energy stocks and upbeat jobs data tempered rate cut expectations. The benchmark S&P;/ASX 200 Index dropped 44.70 points, or 0.6 percent, to 7,088, while the broader All Ordinaries Index ended down 50 points, or 0.7 percent, at 7,199. Heavyweight CIMIC Group plummeted 20 percent after it decided to exit the Middle East. Engineering services provider Downer EDI gave up 18 percent after cutting its full-year profit guidance. Origin Energy, Oil Search, Worley and Santos declined 1-2 percent after oil prices dropped sharply overnight on worries of excess supplies. Beach Energy shares slumped 6 percent.  Biotherapeutics firm CSL eased 0.4 percent on profit taking after scaling a new peak in the previous session. Australia's inflation expectations increased in January, survey data from the Melbourne Institute showed today. The expected inflation rate increased 0.7 percentage points to 4.7 percent in January. Separately, the unemployment rate in Australia came in at a seasonally adjusted 5.1 percent in December. That beat forecasts for 5.2 percent, which would have been unchanged from the November reading. The Australian economy added 28,900 jobs last month, beating expectations for an increase of 10,000 jobs after gaining 38,500 jobs in the previous month. Seoul stocks ended sharply lower amid rising concerns over the spread of Wuhan coronavirus. The benchmark Kospi gave up 21.12 points, or 0.9 percent, to finish at 2,246.13 ahead of the Lunar New year's holiday break that runs Friday through Monday. Market heavyweight Samsung Electronics tumbled 2.4 percent and South Korea's No. 2 chipmaker, SK Hynix Inc., fell 2.3 percent.  On the other hand, Samsung BioLogics surged 6.9 percent and Hyundai Motor advanced 2.8 percent. Europe European stocks have moved mostly lower on Thursday as investors continue to fret over the potential fallout from the outbreak of a new coronavirus that has been spreading in China. Deaths from the virus rose to 17, with nearly 600 cases confirmed. Investors remain worried about the contagion as the week-long Lunar New Year holidays starts on Friday, when millions of Chinese travel domestically and abroad. Traders are also digesting news the European Central Bank announced the launch of a review of its monetary policy strategy, the first such exercise since 2003, as it left its interest rates, asset purchases and forward guidance unchanged. While the French CAC 40 Index has fallen by 0.3 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the German DAX Index are down by 0.5 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively. Anglo American has moved to the downside after the company said that its fourth-quarter copper equivalent production increased 4 percent, led by the continued successful ramp-up at Minas-Rio in Brazil. Infrastructure company John Laing Group has also fallen. The company announced that Chief Executive Officer Olivier Brousse has tendered his resignation in order to take up a senior position at Veolia Group. Daily Mail And General has also slid after the media company said its first-quarter Group revenue declined 4 percent from last year, while underlying revenue increased 1 percent, in line with expectations. German construction major Hochtief has also slumped. The company announced that it plans to recognize a one-off, post-tax impact of around 0.8 billion euros in fiscal 2019 as part of the plan by its 72.8 percent-owned unit CIMIC Group to exit the Middle East region. Renault has also moved sharply lower on news that France's anti-corruption agency was carrying out checks at the company. On the other hand, semiconductor company STMicroelectronics NV has jumped. The company's quarterly profit fell year-on-year but beat analyst estimates. Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 4 percent to $2.75 billion. U.S. Economic Reports First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits showed a modest increase in the week ended January 18th, according to a report released by the Labor Department on Thursday. The report said initial jobless claims rose to 211,000, an increase of 6,000 from the previous week's revised level of 205,000. Economists had expected jobless claims to climb to 215,000 from the 204,000 originally reported for the previous week.  The Conference Board is scheduled to release its report on leading economic indicators in the month of December at 10 am ET. The leading economic index is expected to dip by 0.2 percent. At 11 am ET, the Energy Information Administration is due to release its report on oil inventories in the week ended January 17th. Crude oil inventories are expected to decrease by 1.1 million barrels after falling by 2.5 million barrels in the previous week. The Treasury Department is also scheduled to reveal the details of this month's auctions of two-year, five-year and seven-year notes at 11 am ET. Stocks In Focus Shares of VF Corp. (VFC) are moving significantly lower in pre-market trading after the apparel maker reported weaker than expected fiscal third quarter revenue and lowered its full-year guidance. Hotel and casino operators Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) are also likely to see further downside amid concerns about the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak. On the other hand, shares of Citrix Systems (CTXS) are seeing considerable pre-market strength after the software company reported fourth quarter results that beat analyst estimates. Electronic testing equipment maker Teradyne (TER) is also likely to move to the upside after reporting better than expected fourth quarter results and providing upbeat guidance.        Load-Date: January 24, 2020End of Document

The market resiliently cut its losses during the afternoon, though, leaving the S&P 500 down 0.3% for the session.The Nasdaq Composite (+0.02%) eked out a closing record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) still finished lower.Apple specifically said it doesn't expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to the coronavirus restraining its supply chain and impacting consumer demand in China. The news didn't come as a surprise given similar warnings previously issued by companies, and investors presumably viewed the situation as temporary and China-specific.Investors, however, did assume some defensive positioning, evident by the gains in bonds, gold futures ($1590.00, +$19.00, +1.2%), and the CBOE Volatility Index (14.83, +1.15, +8.4%). The resulting decline in Treasury yields undercut the financials sector (-0.9%), while it benefited the utilities sector (+0.8%).The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.40%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.4% to 99.43. WTI crude inched up 0.1% (+$0.05) to $52.10/bbl, recouping its intraday losses.Microsoft (MSFT 187.23, +1.88, +1.0%) and Amazon (AMZN 2155.67, +20.80, +1.0%), which have a combined market cap of nearly $2.5 trillion, helped offset the weakness in Apple with 1% gains of their own. Both stocks extended their yearly gains to 18.7% and 16.6%, respectively, while Apple trimmed its yearly gain to 8.6%.Walmart (WMT 119.63, +1.74, +1.5%) also outperformed despite missing profit estimates. Tesla (TSLA 858.40, +58.37, +7.3%) resumed its parabolic advance after its price target was raised at Bernstein and Morgan Stanley, although both targets were well below TSLA's closing price.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the Empire State Manufacturing Survey and NAHB Housing Market Index:The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for February increased to 12.9 (Briefing.com consensus 6.3) from the prior month's reading of 4.8.The NAHB Housing Market Index for February declined to 74 (Briefing.com consensus 75) from 75 in January.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for January, Housing Starts and Building Permits for January and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +8.5% YTDS&P 500 +4.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +2.4% YTDRussell 2000 +0.9% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1190/1685. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1455/1758.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: February 19, 2020End of Document

The market resiliently cut its losses during the afternoon, though, leaving the S&P 500 down 0.3% for the session.The Nasdaq Composite (+0.02%) eked out a closing record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) still finished lower.Apple specifically said it doesn't expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to the coronavirus restraining its supply chain and impacting consumer demand in China. The news didn't come as a surprise given similar warnings previously issued by companies, and investors presumably viewed the situation as temporary and China-specific.Investors, however, did assume some defensive positioning, evident by the gains in bonds, gold futures ($1590.00, +$19.00, +1.2%), and the CBOE Volatility Index (14.83, +1.15, +8.4%). The resulting decline in Treasury yields undercut the financials sector (-0.9%), while it benefited the utilities sector (+0.8%).The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.40%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.4% to 99.43. WTI crude inched up 0.1% (+$0.05) to $52.10/bbl, recouping its intraday losses.Microsoft (MSFT 187.23, +1.88, +1.0%) and Amazon (AMZN 2155.67, +20.80, +1.0%), which have a combined market cap of nearly $2.5 trillion, helped offset the weakness in Apple with 1% gains of their own. Both stocks extended their yearly gains to 18.7% and 16.6%, respectively, while Apple trimmed its yearly gain to 8.6%.Walmart (WMT 119.63, +1.74, +1.5%) also outperformed despite missing profit estimates. Tesla (TSLA 858.40, +58.37, +7.3%) resumed its parabolic advance after its price target was raised at Bernstein and Morgan Stanley, although both targets were well below TSLA's closing price.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the Empire State Manufacturing Survey and NAHB Housing Market Index:The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for February increased to 12.9 (Briefing.com consensus 6.3) from the prior month's reading of 4.8.The NAHB Housing Market Index for February declined to 74 (Briefing.com consensus 75) from 75 in January.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for January, Housing Starts and Building Permits for January and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +8.5% YTDS&P 500 +4.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +2.4% YTDRussell 2000 +0.9% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1190/1685. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1455/1758.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: February 19, 2020End of Document

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.6%.Apple (AAPL 324.44, +5.44, +1.7%) has essentially recouped all losses that followed its revenue warning yesterday, reflecting the market's lack of concern for the coronavirus. Apple's 1.7% gain, coupled with Amazon's (AMZN 2181.66, +25.99, +1.2%) gain, is providing influential support.The S&P 500 information technology (+1.2%) and financials (+0.9%) sectors outperform, while the defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%) and utilities (-0.8%) sectors trade in negative territory.Semiconductor stocks are rallying following positive news in NVIDIA (NVDA 311.97, +15.33, +5.2%) and Analog Devices (ADI 124.10, +5.54, +4.7%). NVIDIA was upgraded to Outperform from Mkt Perform at Bernstein, and Analog Devices beat profit expectations. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.6%.There also remain pockets of euphoria in the market, namely in shares of Tesla (TSLA 911.99, +52.90, +6.1%) and Virgin Galactic (SPCE 33.21, +2.92, +9.6%). Tesla's price target was raised to $928 from $729 at Piper Sandler. SPCE is up nearly 200% this year.Interestingly, U.S. Treasuries are barely moving despite the bullish bias in equities and the 0.5% increase in the Producer Price Index for January (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%). Regarding the latter, the market will need to see a sustained rise in inflation pressure to even start to think about the Fed.The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.42%, and the 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.3% to 99.70. WTI crude is up 2.6% to $53.65/bbl.Reviewing today's economic data, which focused on producer prices and the housing sector:The Producer Price Index for January was up 0.5% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) and core PPI, which excludes food and energy, was also up 0.5% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%).Notwithstanding the large m/m increases, the key takeaway from the report is that producer prices remain relatively tame on a yr/yr basis, up 2.1% for total PPI and up 1.7% for core PPI. Also, with the Consumer Price Index released last week, it is clear today that there wasn't much bleed-through in January to the consumer side of things from the uptick in producer prices.Granted total housing starts declined 3.6% m/m in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.567 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.390 million), but that was well above expectations and marked a 21.4% yr/yr increase. Building permits -- a leading indicator -- increased 9.2% m/m to 1.551 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.460 million) and were up 17.9% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that the three-month moving average for starts (1.525 mln) is the highest since January 2007.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index fell 6.4% following a 1.1% increase in the prior week.As a reminder, the FOMC Minutes from the January meeting will be released at 2:00 p.m. ET.12:25 ETDow +162.39 at 29394.49, Nasdaq +93.57 at 9826.34, S&P +21.00 at 3391.29[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.6%, while the Nasdaq outperforms with gain of 0.9%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Apple (AAPL 324.17, +5.17, +1.6%), Amazon (AMZN 2180.94, +25.27, +1.2%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1529.47, +9.81, +0.7%) are up nicely, while Facebook (FB 217.53, -0.27, -0.1%) and Netflix (NFLX 387.55, -0.23, -0.1%) trade slightly lower.The CBOE Volatility Index has ticked lower by 1.6% to 14.59.11:55 ETDow +138.67 at 29370.77, Nasdaq +91.20 at 9823.97, S&P +19.57 at 3389.86[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to sport a 0.6% gain in a relatively calm day from a news perspective.In analyst recommendations, shares of Adobe Systems (ADBE 384.20, +5.35, +1.4%) are up nearly 1.5% after UBS raised its price target to a Street-high of $430 (from $360).Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX rose 0.8%, UK's FTSE rose 1.0%, and France's CAC rose 0.9%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.8%.11:25 ETDow +149.41 at 29381.51, Nasdaq +91.22 at 9823.99, S&P +20.62 at 3390.91[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is showing no signs of fatigue as it continues to set new highs with a 0.6% gain. The market has shifted to offense after yesterday's defensive stance.The information technology sector (+1.1%) is today's leader after declining the most yesterday, while the utilities sector (-0.6%) is today's laggard after advancing the most yesterday. Despite cases of the coronavirus continuing to climb, the market is simply holding onto the view that it has seen the worst and things will get better soon.WTI crude is up 2.0% to $53.35/bbl as it continues to climb off recent lows where it was below $50.00/bbl earlier this month.10:55 ETDow +96.11 at 29328.21, Nasdaq +74.85 at 9807.62, S&P +16.54 at 3386.83[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade sideways with comfortable gains. The S&P 500 is up 0.5%, the Dow is up 0.4%, and the Nasdaq is up 0.8%.Mega-cap stocks Apple (AAPL 323.38, +4.41, +1.4%), Amazon (AMZN 2177.32, +21.65, +1.0%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1526.78, +7.11, +0.5%) continue to provide the market solid support. These three companies have a combined market cap of over $3.5 trillion.Interestingly, despite the unabated gains in the stock market, longer-dated bonds are holding steady. The benchmark 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.56%. The big jump in producer prices for January barely moved prices on the short end of the curve, too.10:25 ETDow +86.45 at 29318.55, Nasdaq +76.79 at 9809.56, S&P +15.50 at 3385.79[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently up 0.5% after recently setting a new intraday high.Garmin (GRMN 104.55, +7.43, +7.7%) is among today's earnings winners, as shares rise nearly 8% after the company beat top and bottom-line estimates and issued upside FY20 guidance.Conversely, shares of Groupon (GRPN 1.84, -1.21, -39.8%) have tanked 40% after the struggling company missed top and bottom-line estimates and said it will exit the Goods business. The company announced a proposal for a reverse stock split.09:55 ETDow +95.52 at 29327.62, Nasdaq +75.23 at 9808, S&P +16.31 at 3386.6[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now up 0.5%, and the Russell 2000 is up 0.4%. The market's positive bias is being driven by strength in the technology space, particularly Apple (AAPL 322.87, +3.86, +1.2%) and the semiconductor stocks.Apple is continuing its rebound from yesterday's lows, while chipmakers are rallying around an earnings beat from Analog Devices (ADI 125.23, +6.66, +5.6%) and an analyst upgrade for NVIDIA (NVDA 308.46, +11.86, +5.6%). The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.3%.Separately, shares of Tesla (TSLA 911.77, +53.34, +6.3%) are up more than 6%, as yet another analyst has turned bullish on the stock. Piper Sandler raised its TSLA target to $928 from $729.09:40 ETDow +81.38 at 29313.48, Nasdaq +57.44 at 9790.21, S&P +12.52 at 3382.81[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices start the session in the green, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.6% to hit a new intraday high. The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.2%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows information technology (+0.7%), consumer discretionary (+0.6%), and energy (+0.5%) leading the market in gains. The utilities (-0.3%) and real estate (-0.3%) sectors trade with modest losses.U.S. Treasuries have edged lower. The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.42%, and the 10-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 99.60.

Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +57.90.The stock market is poised to start the trading session in positive territory after yesterday's resilient session. The S&P 500 futures trade 11 points, or 0.3%, above fair value amid a lack of concern for the coronavirus.Notable stocks on the rise include Tesla (TSLA 921.98, +63.58, +7.4%), which had its price target raised to $928 from $729 at Piper Sandler, and Analog Devices (ADI 125.60, +7.03, +5.9%), which beat earnings estimates. Virgin Galactic (SPCE 34.62, +4.32, +14.3%) is up another 14% in a short squeeze that is outpacing Tesla's parabolic run.Apple (AAPL 320.69, +1.69, +0.5%) shares are recouping yesterday's losses after it issued a revenue warning.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +10.10.

The market resiliently cut its losses during the afternoon, though, leaving the S&P 500 down 0.3% for the session.The Nasdaq Composite (+0.02%) eked out a closing record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) still finished lower.Apple specifically said it doesn't expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to the coronavirus restraining its supply chain and impacting consumer demand in China.

The resulting decline in Treasury yields undercut the financials sector (-0.9%), while it benefited the utilities sector (+0.8%).The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.40%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.4% to 99.43.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (+0.95%) is still atop the standings.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that JPMorgan Chase (JPM 138.36, +2.72, +2.01%), Goldman Sachs (GS 237.01, +3.80, +1.63%), and Walt Disney (DIS 141.28, +2.14, +1.54%) are outperforming. JPM and GS are notably higher due in part to decent strength out of the financial space, while DIS bounces off its 200-day SMA (138.94).Conversely, Cisco Systems (CSCO 45.92, -0.67, -1.44%) sits at the bottom of the index.Today's advance trims the DJIA's declines since Friday's close to under 0.1%.12:55 ETDow +159.56 at 29391.66, Nasdaq +98.15 at 9830.92, S&P +21.17 at 3391.46[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 (+0.6%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.0%) are trading at new all-time highs, as the market shifts back into offense with technology stocks setting the pace. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.6%.Apple (AAPL 324.44, +5.44, +1.7%) has essentially recouped all losses that followed its revenue warning yesterday, reflecting the market's lack of concern for the coronavirus. Apple's 1.7% gain, coupled with Amazon's (AMZN 2181.66, +25.99, +1.2%) gain, is providing influential support for the market.The S&P 500 information technology (+1.2%) and financials (+0.9%) sectors outperform, while the defensive-oriented real estate (-0.9%) and utilities (-0.8%) sectors trade in negative territory.Semiconductor stocks are rallying following positive news in NVIDIA (NVDA 311.97, +15.33, +5.2%) and Analog Devices (ADI 124.10, +5.54, +4.7%). NVIDIA was upgraded to Outperform from Mkt Perform at Bernstein, and Analog Devices beat profit expectations. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.6%.There also remain pockets of euphoria in the market, namely in shares of Tesla (TSLA 911.99, +52.90, +6.1%) and Virgin Galactic (SPCE 33.21, +2.92, +9.6%). Tesla's price target was raised to $928 from $729 at Piper Sandler. SPCE is up nearly 200% this year.Interestingly, U.S. Treasuries are barely moving despite the bullish bias in equities and the 0.5% increase in the Producer Price Index for January (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%). Regarding the latter, the market will presumably need to see a sustained rise in inflation pressure to even start to think about the Fed.The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.42%, and the 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.3% to 99.70. WTI crude is up 2.6% to $53.65/bbl.Reviewing today's economic data, which focused on producer prices and the housing sector:The Producer Price Index for January was up 0.5% m/m (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) and core PPI, which excludes food and energy, was also up 0.5% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%).Notwithstanding the large m/m increases, the key takeaway from the report is that producer prices remain relatively tame on a yr/yr basis, up 2.1% for total PPI and up 1.7% for core PPI. Also, with the Consumer Price Index released last week, it is clear today that there wasn't much bleed-through in January to the consumer side of things from the uptick in producer prices.Granted total housing starts declined 3.6% m/m in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.567 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.390 million), but that was well above expectations and marked a 21.4% yr/yr increase. Building permits -- a leading indicator -- increased 9.2% m/m to 1.551 million (Briefing.com consensus 1.460 million) and were up 17.9% yr/yr.The key takeaway from the report is the recognition that the three-month moving average for starts (1.525 mln) is the highest since January 2007.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index fell 6.4% following a 1.1% increase in the prior week.As a reminder, the FOMC Minutes from the January meeting will be released at 2:00 p.m. ET.12:25 ETDow +162.39 at 29394.49, Nasdaq +93.57 at 9826.34, S&P +21.00 at 3391.29[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to trade higher by 0.6%, while the Nasdaq outperforms with gain of 0.9%.Looking at the FAANG stocks shows mixed results. Apple (AAPL 324.17, +5.17, +1.6%), Amazon (AMZN 2180.94, +25.27, +1.2%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1529.47, +9.81, +0.7%) are up nicely, while Facebook (FB 217.53, -0.27, -0.1%) and Netflix (NFLX 387.55, -0.23, -0.1%) trade slightly lower.The CBOE Volatility Index has ticked lower by 1.6% to 14.59.11:55 ETDow +138.67 at 29370.77, Nasdaq +91.20 at 9823.97, S&P +19.57 at 3389.86[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 continues to sport a 0.6% gain in a relatively calm day from a news perspective.In analyst recommendations, shares of Adobe Systems (ADBE 384.20, +5.35, +1.4%) are up nearly 1.5% after UBS raised its price target to a Street-high of $430 (from $360).Overseas, the major European indices closed on a higher note. Germany's DAX rose 0.8%, UK's FTSE rose 1.0%, and France's CAC rose 0.9%. The Europe Stoxx 600 advanced 0.8%.11:25 ETDow +149.41 at 29381.51, Nasdaq +91.22 at 9823.99, S&P +20.62 at 3390.91[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is showing no signs of fatigue as it continues to set new highs with a 0.6% gain. The market has shifted to offense after yesterday's defensive stance.The information technology sector (+1.1%) is today's leader after declining the most yesterday, while the utilities sector (-0.6%) is today's laggard after advancing the most yesterday. Despite cases of the coronavirus continuing to climb, the market is simply holding onto the view that it has seen the worst and things will get better soon.WTI crude is up 2.0% to $53.35/bbl as it continues to climb off recent lows where it was below $50.00/bbl earlier this month.10:55 ETDow +96.11 at 29328.21, Nasdaq +74.85 at 9807.62, S&P +16.54 at 3386.83[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to trade sideways with comfortable gains. The S&P 500 is up 0.5%, the Dow is up 0.4%, and the Nasdaq is up 0.8%.Mega-cap stocks Apple (AAPL 323.38, +4.41, +1.4%), Amazon (AMZN 2177.32, +21.65, +1.0%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1526.78, +7.11, +0.5%) continue to provide the market solid support. These three companies have a combined market cap of over $3.5 trillion.Interestingly, despite the unabated gains in the stock market, longer-dated bonds are holding steady. The benchmark 10-yr yield is unchanged at 1.56%. The big jump in producer prices for January barely moved prices on the short end of the curve, too.10:25 ETDow +86.45 at 29318.55, Nasdaq +76.79 at 9809.56, S&P +15.50 at 3385.79[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is currently up 0.5% after recently setting a new intraday high.Garmin (GRMN 104.55, +7.43, +7.7%) is among today's earnings winners, as shares rise nearly 8% after the company beat top and bottom-line estimates and issued upside FY20 guidance.Conversely, shares of Groupon (GRPN 1.84, -1.21, -39.8%) have tanked 40% after the struggling company missed top and bottom-line estimates and said it will exit the Goods business. The company announced a proposal for a reverse stock split.09:55 ETDow +95.52 at 29327.62, Nasdaq +75.23 at 9808, S&P +16.31 at 3386.6[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 is now up 0.5%, and the Russell 2000 is up 0.4%. The market's positive bias is being driven by strength in the technology space, particularly Apple (AAPL 322.87, +3.86, +1.2%) and the semiconductor stocks.Apple is continuing its rebound from yesterday's lows, while chipmakers are rallying around an earnings beat from Analog Devices (ADI 125.23, +6.66, +5.6%) and an analyst upgrade for NVIDIA (NVDA 308.46, +11.86, +5.6%). The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.3%.Separately, shares of Tesla (TSLA 911.77, +53.34, +6.3%) are up more than 6%, as yet another analyst has turned bullish on the stock. Piper Sandler raised its TSLA target to $928 from $729.09:40 ETDow +81.38 at 29313.48, Nasdaq +57.44 at 9790.21, S&P +12.52 at 3382.81[BRIEFING.COM] The major indices start the session in the green, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.6% to hit a new intraday high. The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.2%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows information technology (+0.7%), consumer discretionary (+0.6%), and energy (+0.5%) leading the market in gains. The utilities (-0.3%) and real estate (-0.3%) sectors trade with modest losses.U.S. Treasuries have edged lower. The 2-yr yield is up two basis points to 1.42%, and the 10-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 99.60. WTI crude is up 1.5% to $53.10/bbl.09:14 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +11.40. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +57.90.The stock market is poised to start the trading session in positive territory after yesterday's resilient session. The S&P 500 futures trade 11 points, or 0.3%, above fair value amid a lack of concern for the coronavirus.Notable stocks on the rise include Tesla (TSLA 921.98, +63.58, +7.4%), which had its price target raised to $928 from $729 at Piper Sandler, and Analog Devices (ADI 125.60, +7.03, +5.9%), which beat earnings estimates. Virgin Galactic (SPCE 34.62, +4.32, +14.3%) is up another 14% in a short squeeze that is outpacing Tesla's parabolic run.Apple (AAPL 320.69, +1.69, +0.5%) shares are recouping yesterday's losses after it issued a revenue warning.08:50 ETMarket is Closed[BRIEFING.COM] S&P futures vs fair value: +10.10.

The market resiliently cut its losses during the afternoon, though, leaving the S&P 500 down 0.3% for the session.The Nasdaq Composite (+0.02%) eked out a closing record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.6%) and Russell 2000 (-0.2%) still finished lower.Apple specifically said it doesn't expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to the coronavirus restraining its supply chain and impacting consumer demand in China. The news didn't come as a surprise given similar warnings previously issued by companies, and investors presumably viewed the situation as temporary and China-specific.Investors, however, did assume some defensive positioning, evident by the gains in bonds, gold futures ($1590.00, +$19.00, +1.2%), and the CBOE Volatility Index (14.83, +1.15, +8.4%). The resulting decline in Treasury yields undercut the financials sector (-0.9%), while it benefited the utilities sector (+0.8%).The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.40%, and the 10-yr yield declined three basis points to 1.56%. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.4% to 99.43. WTI crude inched up 0.1% (+$0.05) to $52.10/bbl, recouping its intraday losses.Microsoft (MSFT 187.23, +1.88, +1.0%) and Amazon (AMZN 2155.67, +20.80, +1.0%), which have a combined market cap of nearly $2.5 trillion, helped offset the weakness in Apple with 1% gains of their own. Both stocks extended their yearly gains to 18.7% and 16.6%, respectively, while Apple trimmed its yearly gain to 8.6%.Walmart (WMT 119.63, +1.74, +1.5%) also outperformed despite missing profit estimates. Tesla (TSLA 858.40, +58.37, +7.3%) resumed its parabolic advance after its price target was raised at Bernstein and Morgan Stanley, although both targets were well below TSLA's closing price.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included the Empire State Manufacturing Survey and NAHB Housing Market Index:The Empire State Manufacturing Survey for February increased to 12.9 (Briefing.com consensus 6.3) from the prior month's reading of 4.8.The NAHB Housing Market Index for February declined to 74 (Briefing.com consensus 75) from 75 in January.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Producer Price Index for January, Housing Starts and Building Permits for January and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite +8.5% YTDS&P 500 +4.3% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +2.4% YTDRussell 2000 +0.9% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1190/1685. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1455/1758.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: February 19, 2020End of Document

Rep. Thornberry Issues Statement on Arrest of Harvard Department Chair LieberTargeted News ServiceFebruary 1, 2020 Saturday 8:51 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 629 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, ranking Republican member of the House Armed Services Committee, issued the following statement on the charges brought against Charles Lieber, chair of Harvard University's Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology:The FBI arrested Dr. Lieber on charges related to his participation in the People's Republic of China's Thousand Talents Program. According to the charges, while Dr. Lieber was serving as the principal investigator for millions of dollars in nanotechnology research grants from the Office of Naval Research, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the National Institutes of Health in the fields of biology, medicine, energy and computing, Dr. Lieber was also allegedly being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars per month by the Thousand Talents Program to conduct nanotechnology research beneficial to China, and recruiting other scientists to work for China."The allegations against Dr. Lieber underscore how important it is to secure the Department of Defense from aggressive espionage efforts and improve awareness within our partners in Academia. Clearly we have more work to do in this area- including in the FY21 NDAA. Universities must be better partners with the Pentagon in protecting the DoD funded scientific research we need to protect the country."One of our country's great strengths is the robust cooperation between our academic researchers and the national security community. Both sides must acknowledge the stakes and take steps to protect taxpayer funds from theft by foreign nations who seek to erode our technological advantages. Universities must take responsibility for the impact their employees and students can have on national security.

French luxuries giant Kering and winery Maison Bouey from Bordeaux signed contracts to attend the third CIIE at the meeting, becoming the first French exhibitors of the Expo.The Ministry of Commerce of China is closely cooperating with its French counterpart to promote the common understanding of both countries' leaders and drive bilateral economic and trade cooperation toward a new high, said Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Bingnan. It is a significant move for the Chinese government to hold CIIE to give firm support to trade liberalization and economic globalization and actively open the Chinese market to the world. CIIE has become a "fast channel" to enter Chinese market for global enterprises. Wang hoped more French enterprises to attend the third CIIE to explore Chinese market with their featured quality products, technologies and services, share Chinese economic development opportunities and infuse greater impetus into the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and France.Marseille's vice mayor Didier Parakian expected to strengthen cooperation with China in port logistics, digital economy as well as other fields, and encouraged local enterprises to participate in the Expo.According to statistics of the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China, a total of 77 French enterprises attended the 2nd CIIE with a gross exhibition area of 15,000 square meters, and achieved an intended turnover of $2.4 billion, 56 percent higher than that in the previous session.Contact：Ms. Nie QingxinTel.：+86-21-59760717/ +86-21-59761076Email:ciie2020@ciie.org Website:http://www.ciie.org/zbh/en/Facebook:           https://www.facebook.com/ciieonlineTwitter:           https://twitter.com/ciieonline View original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/roadshow-of-the-3rd-ciie-in-france-300988335.htmlSOURCE CIIELoad-Date: January 17, 2020End of Document

Video game blacklist: Coronavirus adds new banCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 29, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 783 wordsBodyThe latest news states that the Chinese government decided to remove From the App Store Plague Inc., one of the games that had been leading the download rankings in app stores. The reason that the Asian authorities slid to Ndemic Creations, developers of the strategy video game, was that it "includes content that is illegal in China as determined by the Chinese Cyberspace Administration." A somewhat ambiguous and unclear explanation.So do those responsible for the title of creating and evolving a pathogen to extinguish humanity. But this ban is not the first in terms of video games. Then a brief review of some of the outlaws, unusual and not so much, that the gaming industry has suffered.We're really sad to announce that Plague Inc. has been removed from the China App Store. This is completely out of our control and we are working to find a way to bring the game back to our players in China. Our statement here: https://t.co/oYkHHkMbgw pic.twitter.com/5wQ93NsCKw— Plague Inc. / Rebel Inc. (@NdemicCreations) February 27, 2020It is clear that there are certain titles that are not uncommon to be prohibited, especially in view of the level of control exercised by certain countries over their population. Such is the case of GTA V, a franchise that from the beginning, from the first installment, was signified by controversies. The most recent title in the series is banned in more than 50 countries, mainly due to the casinos it deployed in one of its expansions, in which the player can enter the casino to bet real money. North Korea, China, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, Jamaica and Cambodia, among others, prohibit GTA V for "incitement to gambling".Something similar happened with the Red Dead Redemption II in countries such as Belgium, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan that banned players from accessing poker or other minigames found within the Rockstar Games western.League of Legends, one of the most active player titles on the planet, is also no stranger to censorship and proscription. But this is a special case, as the one that forbids LoL from being played in nations like Syria and Iran is the same United States. The US country decided this prescription after the rapid escalation of violence in which a U.S. surveillance drone was shot down on Iranian territory.But the Riot Games game is not the only one that is not available in foreign territories under us country laws: Origin is also not available due to "Us embargoes and sanctions laws", like the Epic Games store that is present everywhere "ex where prohibited by U.S. law, such as North Korea and Iran."The 2005 Footbal Manager also suffered the ire of the Chinese government. The question of how a football game can become outlawed becomes inescapable. The answer is simple: among the teams that could manage users were the countries of Taiwan and Tibet, and because China does not consider them independent countries but part of its own territory, the Asian giant was offended and decided to ban it.Another particular case is that of EA Sport MMA. The title of mixed martial arts was banned in Denmark, which sounds strange as it is a country that is usually very open and free in terms of what allows its citizens. In the case of the sporting game the proscription came from a rather economical side. The game showed advertising for some energy drinks that are banned in Denmark, and because EA Sport did not opt to remove sponsorship of those brands from the title, the game was not available to the Danes.For his part, the formerPrince Harry of Great Britain at a Christian Youth Association (YMCA) event in London in early April last year, expressed his or herself about what Fortnite and networks generate. Of the first one he said that it was created to be addictive and that it should be banned from use in the UK as it saw no benefit of it being in British households. As for the nets, he was not left behind and defined them as "more addictive than alcohol and drugs." We'll have to see if he's still thinking the same thing now that he's decided to give up royalty.Britain's Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex arrives to attend the UK-Africa Investment Summit in London on January 20, 2020.

COULD ILLEGALLY TRAFFICKED PANGOLINS BE THE MISSING LINK IN THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK?States News ServiceFebruary 7, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 944 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Fauna & Flora International (FFI):The deadly coronavirus outbreak, which has killed over 600 people and infected thousands more, may have been transmitted from bats to humans via pangolins, according to new research.A newly published study by Chinese scientists has pinpointed these endangered scaly anteaters the world's most trafficked mammal as the "most likely intermediate host" of the virus.If verified, the findings could have enormous implications for the future of these endearing and intriguing animals.With leadership from China, global authorities are working hard to contain the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus. The Chinese government has already imposed a temporary ban on all wildlife trade in Wuhan, effective from 26th January.In light of the outbreak, state-controlled Chinese media outlets have condemned the practice of wild meat consumption and called for permanent bans on wildlife trade. Thousands of Chinese citizens are reported to be echoing these calls on social media channels.On 3rd February, the most powerful committee within the Chinese Community Party issued a statement confirming that it will "strengthen market supervision, resolutely ban and severely crack down on illegal wildlife markets and trade, and control major public health risks from the source.Welcome though this announcement may be, the sad truth is that China is now paying a heavy price for an outbreak that was both predictable and preventable.In 2002, a strain of coronavirus from wild civets infected humans at a wildlife market in Guangdong province in southern China. The ensuing epidemic of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) resulted in more than 8,000 reported cases across 26 countries, and caused almost 800 deaths.Masked palm civet. Consumption of wild civets was implicated in the transmission of SARS to humans. Credit: Jeremy Holden/FFIAlmost two decades later, it is a case of history repeating. This latest coronavirus, which emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan, is hypothesised to have been transmitted to humans at a 'wet' wildlife market (where live and dead wild animals are sold).Crossing the species barrierMany serious human infections have originated in wild animals. These include influenza, plague, smallpox, rabies, typhus, yellow fever and AIDS.In some instances, after being transmitted to humans, a virus will mutate and become a human-specific infection. In other cases, a virus will remain largely unchanged and remain only in the initial host species, until there is an opportunity to transfer to humans.These opportunities are increasing. Growing global travel, climatic changes, urbanisation and other forms of human encroachment on wildlife habitats are providing more opportunities for so-called zoonotic infections to emerge. As the coronavirus outbreaks suggest, wildlife markets are providing the perfect breeding grounds.Wildlife markets A perfect stormHumans have hunted and eaten wild species for thousands of years. But in recent decades, particularly across the tropics, hunting has increased so dramatically that many species are now facing local and global extinction. Moreover, rather than being consumed close to where they are hunted, many wild species are being transported far afield to feed demand in other countries. Today's industrial-scale illegal trade in wildlife across international borders involves a huge range of species from primates to pangolins, wild cattle to civets.These wild animals dead or alive, and often in poor and unhygienic conditions are often thrown together and transported long distances. As in the market at the centre of the Wuhan outbreak, these animals are then stored in close proximity to each other and to shoppers and vendors in their destination markets. This provides the perfect environment for viral infections to cross species barriers. Illegal trade in wild species not only threatens the survival of endangered wildlife, but also poses a very real risk to human health.This is a global issue, rather than a problem unique to China, but the country is unarguably at the epicentre of the current crisis. How it responds to this latest coronavirus outbreak could well determine the future of the world's beleaguered pangolin populations and of the myriad other species threatened by illegal trade.Juvenile Sunda pangolin, one of eight pangolin species threatened by illegal trade. Credit: Zaharil DzulkaflyThe crucial point, worth re-emphasising here, is that pangolins if indeed they turn out to be the vector of the outbreak are not the villains of the piece. There is a genuine danger that the knee-jerk reaction will be to demonise an animal that is an unwitting accomplice in a human-induced crisis. The real crime is being committed by the profiteers who are hoovering pangolins from the wild in industrial quantities and driving them towards extinction. And the solution is to give these extraordinary and irreplaceable creatures the protection they desperately need, rather than making them the scaly scapegoats.Clamping down on wildlife traffickingTo reduce risks posed to human health and to prevent species extinction, Fauna and Flora International (FFI) is calling on governments globally to take stronger action to stop illegal and unregulated wildlife trade. A worldwide clampdown on the marketing and consumption of illegal wildlife products including all eight species of pangolin is urgently needed. It goes without saying that demand reduction will also be critical to long-term success, in order to ensure that a permanent ban does not merely displace trade elsewhere and push transactions underground.Load-Date: February 7, 2020End of Document

Huawei again charged with theft of industrial secretsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 14, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 532 wordsBodyBrooklynFederal Prosecutor Richard Donaghueaccused Huawei of stealing industrial secrets and circumventing U.S. sanctions against North Korea. These three new charges add up to the 13 the company had already faced for a year in Brooklyn federal court. These are bank fraud and the alleged violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran.Indicted on the first charges in January 2019, Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou,currently under house arrest in Canada, is still on the new indictment, albeit not being charged with further charges. Canadian justice has not yet ruled on his extradition claimed by the United States.U.S. justice reinforced pressure against Chinese telecoms giant Huawei,after filing three new criminal charges against him. Meanwhile, the company's heiress' fate, in Canada's home prison,remains on hold."This new indictment is part of the Department of Justice's attempt to irrevocably damage Huawei's reputation and business for competition-related reasons, rather than law enforcement,"the firm said in a statement."The government will not win and we will prove that these charges are unfounded and unfair,"he added.The U.S. Department of Commerce on Thursday once again renewed the deadline given Huawei to continue selling services to U.S. companies, this time for 45 days, while looking for alternatives to this giant that Washington sees as a threat to its national security.Several U.S. telecom companies rely on Huawei's cheapest equipment to bring Wi-Fi service to remote rural areas. Now, you're going to have to find another partner.Against the backdrop of the U.S.-China trade war, Donald Trump's administration sees a risk that Huawei, the world's largest provider of telecommunications equipment, will spy on the Chinese government. On Wednesday, anonymous U.S. officials accused Huawei of secretly accessing global telecommunications networks through "back doors" designed to be used by law enforcement.The company responded that these accusations were "a smokescreen" and recalled that, according to an article in The Washington Post,the CIA used its own encrypted language company for decades to spy on other countries.The United States, for its part, has called on many countries to dispense with Huawei's infrastructure for the deployment of the new 5G telephone network. Because of this, the Chinese government reiterated that the United States is financially harassed against Huawei, urging it to "immediately cease an ideological oppression against Chinese companies."Prosecutor Donaghue stated in the indictment that Huawei engaged in the theft of industrial secrets from 2000 until now. In addition, in 2013 it would have implemented an internal policy that encouraged its employees to "steal confidential information from rivals," based or offices in the United States, in exchange for premium payments.But not just this. The Chinese company is accused of trying to recruit employees from U.S. telecommunications companies, and of obtaining information from them related to the technology of the companies. This data allowed him to launch products similar to those of his competitors,at lower-selling prices, according to the new indictment.Load-Date: February 15, 2020End of Document

UM student uses TikTok to spread fake news about coronavirus on campusThe Miami Hurricane: University of MiamiFebruary 2, 2020 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 998 wordsBodyA student at the University of Miami posted a series of TikTok videos about a false case of coronavirus involving a fiction roommate on Monday, Jan. 27.The UM student claimed his roommate, a Chinese exchange student from Wuhan, was exhibiting flu-like symptoms, and had just left for the hospital in an Uber. A second video featured the student updating viewers about his supposed unofficial quarantine status while he waited for roommate's test results to come back from the hospital.TikTok, a Chinese-owned video-sharing app, was placed under review in November of 2019 by the U.S. government for concerns of censorship and data collection.Around noon on Tuesday, Jan. 28, the student awoke to his phone exploding with TikTok notifications. The videos he uploaded earlier had gone viral. Overnight, the videos had garnered more than 500,000 views, 75,000 likes and 500 comments.By late afternoon the fake news had crossed platforms from TikTok to Twitter, where some users tweeted about a potential unconfirmed case of the virus at the university. The rumors seemed to have reached the university administration, who sent out a health advisory email denying any confirmed cases, or immediate threats to the university or the state of Florida.Bradley Brewer tweeted about the suspected coronavirus case at UM on Monday, Jan. 27 based on a series of TikTok videos. The tweet was later deleted. Photo credit: Twitter, @realBradBrewerUnder different circumstances, the student said he would have enjoyed his newfound social media stardom, but the sensitive nature of the fake news he spread made him realize he had gone too far. Understanding the potential consequences, he removed both videos from the platform that same day.The novel coronavirus, first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in Dec. 2019, is the latest strain of a family of viruses affecting the respiratory system. This novel Coronavirus has never before been identified in humans. As of Feb. 1, reports put the numbers at over 250 deaths and nearly 12,000 confirmed cases. The World Health Organization has now declared it a public health emergency of international concern. The virus has reached U.S. soil with the CDC confirming eight cases, most recently in California and Massachusetts.With the coronavirus dominating news cycles and social media platforms alike, this student saw what he perceived to be an innocent opportunity to gain social currency."Making TikToks is all about participating in trends," he explained.A quick run through the app reveals hashtags such as #coronavirusmeme and #coronavirusconspiracy are popular among its users. These hashtags, and others like them, are utilized by users across platforms in hopes of gaining more views and likes on their content."The only information I had heard about the coronavirus was small, insignificant facts on TikTok," the student admitted. According to a report by Media Matters, several other videos which spread misinformation and conspiracy theories about the coronavirus were posted onto the app. These included videos claiming the Chinese government had released the virus as a means of population control, and another, which received over 25,000 likes, stating that China already had over 90,000 confirmed cases.Photo credit: Media MattersPhoto credit: Media MattersThe combination of trends and reliance on these platforms makes it easier for fake news to spread quickly and dangerously."It went viral almost instantly and I didn't understand the potential repercussions of spreading false information," he said.A recent study conducted by the Pew Research Center concluded that 69 percent of Americans ages 18 to 29 use Snapchat as their primary source of consuming news. In other words, this percentage of young Americans might stumble across content similar to that of this student's false coronavirus TikToks and mistake it for fact, as they are unlikely to corroborate with traditional and vetted news outlets.Earlier this year, TikTok updated its community guidelines to try to tackle misinformation. The update included a section about misleading information, and is even specific about content pertaining to health and medical treatments. The platform prohibits "misinformation that could cause harm to our community or the larger public." The video-sharing network also warns about removal of content that violates these policies.The Beijing-based company has over 1.5 billion users and has recently been linked with the spread of conspiracy theories, one of which includes the claim that the Chinese government is behind coronavirus. Continuing these efforts, this week the company rolled out a series of user friendly features to combat the widespread threat of misinformation, including an in-app reporting option. Details of these measures were shared on the company's blog.These recent actions taken by the company confirm that this student's actions were not an isolated incident. Before posting his own TikToks, the student said he had seen similar videos to the ones he created and thought of the content with some levity.It is not the first time that user-generated content has sparked controversy. Social media platforms are now more than ever faced with the legal and ethical dilemma of if and how to police the content shared on their platforms.In the United States, under section 230 of the Communication Decency Act, the law protects internet hosts from content published on their platforms, while the Constitution protects individuals' freedom of speech under the First Amendment.These incidents blur the lines between what can be done and what should be done in regards to individual freedoms and corporate responsibility."I definitely realized that I should perform more due diligence on any topic I discuss on social media, and carefully check sources," the student said. "I do believe people can be trusted to police their own content, but I am a great example of posting without thinking about the potential problems."Load-Date: February 2, 2020End of Document

VIETNAM'S 10TH CASE OF CORONAVIRUS CONFIRMED AS AUTHORITIES EXPAND QUARANTINEStates News ServiceFebruary 5, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 635 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:As Vietnam's Ministry of Health Tuesday announced that the country now has its 10th case of novel coronavirus (nCoV), the government is making preparations to quarantine massive numbers of citizens returning home from China.The 10th coronavirus patient is Vinh Phuc, 28, who contracted nCoV from a relative who had traveled to Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicenter of the now global outbreak.Vinh's case is the third human-to-human transmission of nCoV in Vietnam. The other two cases involved a Chinese man transmitting the virus to his son and a receptionist at a hotel in Nha Trang.But cases could rise dramatically in the coming weeks. The military has been asked to quarantine 950 Vietnamese who are scheduled to return to Vietnam from China soon.The 950 will stay isolated for a period of 14 days at a military camp located in the outskirts of Hanoi, after their arrivals at Hanoi's Noi Bai airport and Quang Ninh's Van Don airport.Also Tuesday, 145 Vietnamese were placed under quarantine at a Sino-Vietnamese border gate in Lang Son province. The 145 are workers in China that were sent back home by the Chinese government.Field hospitalsIn preparation for what the government expects will be thousands of Vietnamese returning from China, authorities are hastily making field hospitals to accommodate large-scale quarantines.In Hanoi Wednesday, the director of Vietnam's health department Nguyen Khac Hien said during a press conference that there is a proposal to convert Thanh Do University, located in the suburbs of the city, into one such field hospital.If the epidemic spreads, Hanoi has the option of building another field hospital with a capacity of about 1,000 beds in Hanoi's Me Linh district.Currently two military facilities in the city have already been turned into quarantine centers able to treat about 1,500 people.Meanwhile in Ho Chi Minh City, authorities are planning two field hospitals in Cu Chi and Nha Be districts, with a collective capacity of 500 beds. They are expected to be completed before Feb. 15.Health leaders Wednesday said the country was preparing for a worst-case scenario.State media, meanwhile, reported that two Chinese tourists who had traveled to Nha Trang between Jan. 23 and 28 had tested positive for nCoV.Chinese health authorities said Xu Jianjiang and Dai Chunxia were confirmed cases upon their return to China. They had entered Vietnam on a Vietnam Airlines flight Jan. 23.Battle against "fake news"Vietnam's Information and Communications Minister Nguyen Manh Hung asked the agency to work with Facebook and Google to remove fake news about coronavirus.Minister Nguyen said fake news about the virus could create anxiety for the public. He asked the agency to tighten control and to punish those who post fake video clips and information about nCoV.The minister mandated that Vietnam IT firms use artificial intelligence (AI) to discover fake news and to helping the health ministry by ensuring its website would not be overloaded by the spike in demand for coronavirus information.Vietnam's police ministry said at a press conference Wednesday that it summoned more than 170 people accused of spreading fake news.The ministry said about 40 others are being monitored and could be subject to criminal charges.RFA reported last week that at least six Facebookers were reprimanded for posting what the authorities allege is "fake news" about the virus, fining them between 10 million and 15 million dong (U.S. $433-$650).State media reported Wednesday that there were at least nine fined exactly 12 million dong ($516) last week, and they were also forced to remove their posts about coronavirus.Reported by RFA's Vietnamese Service.

A senator wants to ban the US from sharing intelligence with countries using Huawei 5G - which is most of America's alliesBusiness Insider USJanuary 9, 2020 Thursday 06:49 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 534 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Isobel Asher Hamilton)Highlight: The US has been desperately trying to convince allies to freeze out Huawei's 5G kit for a year, with limited success.BodyAP Photo/Ng Han Guan• Republican Sen. Tom Cotton introduced a bill on Wednesday that would ban the US from sharing intelligence with countries that use Huawei 5G equipment.• The US is in a long-running fight with Huawei, claiming the company acts as a conduit for Chinese government espionage. Huawei denies this.• The US has been desperately trying to convince allies to freeze out Huawei's 5G kit for a year, with limited success.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.US lawmakers are keeping up the pressure on Huawei.Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas introduced a bill on Wednesday which, if passed into law, would ban the US from sharing intelligence with any country that uses Huawei 5G equipment."The United States shouldn't be sharing valuable intelligence information with countries that allow an intelligence-gathering arm of the Chinese Communist Party to operate freely within their borders," Cotton said in a statement to CNBC.The bad blood between the US and Huawei goes back to 2012, but over the last year as the US-China trade war has intensified. The Trump administration has stepped up its rhetoric against the smartphone giant, accusing it of acting as a conduit for the Chinese government to spy. Huawei has repeatedly denied this."I urge our allies around the world to carefully consider the consequences of dealing with Huawei to their national interests," Cotton added.With the advent of 5G technology the US has been on a drive to convince its allies to freeze out Huawei.Last year Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned allies that it would be "difficult" for the US to partner with countries who allowed Huawei equipment in their infrastructure.AP Photo/Jacquelyn MartinThe US hasn't had much luck convincing people yet. Australia and Japan both banned Huawei from government contracts, but key allies such as the UK and Germany have remained equivocal on tha subject. The United Arab Emirates, a major ally for America in the Middle East, firmly took Huawei's side in February last year by announcing it would deploy a 5G network built by the company.Part of the issue is that Huawei's telecom equipment is considered both cheap and high quality. Research from Dell'Oro Group in 2019 found that the Chinese firm continues to dominate market share at 28%.This week seems to signal a Hail Mary for US lobbying efforts. Reuters reported Pompeo was due to meet with UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab on Thursday in a final attempt to make the UK ditch Huawei, but the meeting was moved up to Wednesday. Raab's            public statement following the meeting focused on the UK's stance on Iran, and did not mention Huawei.NOW WATCH: Watch Google reveal the new Nest Mini, which is an updated Home MiniSee Also:• TikTok accounts posing as politicians like Trump and Bernie Sanders keep cropping up, and it's another symptom of the app's ongoing struggle to police itself• Tesla delivered 367,500 cars in 2019 - beating its own guidance• Former Google exec says he was 'sidelined' as the company refused to implement human rights policies while pushing into ChinaSEE ALSO: The Trump administration is warning allies to stay away from Huawei - but not everyone's listeningLoad-Date: January 9, 2020End of Document

Uk authorizes restricted use of Huawei on its 5G networkCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 28, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 658 wordsBodyAdd US reaction and Pompeo's trip to London ///London, 28 Jan 2020 (AFP) - The British government on Tuesday gave the green light to a limited participation by Chinese group Huawei in the development of its 5G mobile internet network, ignoring us pressure that said it was "disappointed", just days before Brexit.This disagreement could complicate things for London which, after officially leaving the European Union next Friday night, will begin to negotiate a vast free trade agreement with Brussels and another with Washington." High-risk providers will be excluded from sensitive 'central' parts of 5G networks," said the ministry in charge of the digital sector. The statement did not specifically mention China's controversial telecoms giant, but Huawei immediately claimed to be "reassured by the British government's confirmation that we can continue to work with our customers to continue the deployment of 5G" in the country." The US is disappointed by the UK's decision," a Washington-responsible one told AFP, for whom "there is no sure way for untrusted providers to control any part of a 5G network."          - Spying risk - The US has been demanding for many months that European countries, and in particular the United Kingdom, exclude Huawei from its networks, claiming its close ties to the Chinese government and the risk of espionage, which the Chinese group has always denied. To limit the risks to its security, London will allow these "high-risk providers" to participate in non-strategic infrastructure but exclude it from the most sensitive areas through which customer data flows. The government also limited its presence to "35% on the periphery of the network, known as the access network, which connects devices and equipment to mobile towers." A cap that will be "reviewable to determine whether it should be reduced further as the market diversifies."          - Pompeo travels to London - By authorizing Huawei's participation even on a limited basis, Johnson risks angering Washington at a time when the UK hopes to strengthen its bilateral ties in the face of post-brexit negotiations. However, The Times newspaper had called him on Tuesday to resist American pressure. "The UK is not moving away from Brussels so that it is now Trump who tells him what to do," he wrote in an editorial. American leaders spared no effort to try to get London to bend to its demands, between closed-door meetings and warnings from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who called the impending British decision "capital." Pompeo returns to London on Wednesday and the subject will inevitably be on the table in their conversations. Johnson himself spoke about it on Friday with US President Donald Trump.          - Few technological alternatives - Johnson had warned in the middle of the month that there are few alternatives to Huawei, given that it has a technological advantage over its two main competitors, Nokia and Ericsson.In addition, if the Chinese group were excluded it would be necessary to remove its base stations from the existing 4G infrastructure, which would be costly and impact on customers' bills in addition to delaying the move to 5G. British security services repeatedly assured that it is possible to work with the Chinese manufacturer without compromising security. However, opening up to Huawei worried some in the Westminster Parliament and within the government. For example, conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the foreign policy committee, warned that it would be like "introducing the fox into the chicken coop." Australia and Japanthey followed the US example by banning the use of Huawei, but European countries, still undecided when choosing manufacturers of future 5G networks, seem divided. For their part, most large emerging markets, led by Brazil and India, are opening their arms to the Chinese equipment manufacturer.jbo-acc/mb -------------------------------------------------------------Load-Date: January 29, 2020End of Document

The coronavirus epidemic could wipe out $43 billion of luxury sales in 2020Business Insider USFebruary 26, 2020 Wednesday 07:18 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc.

(Bernstein would not reveal exactly which execs were included in the survey when contacted by Business Insider). These execs are anticipating to see a (EURO)30 to (EURO)40 billion ($32 to $43 billion) hit on luxury sales in 2020 thanks to the spread of the virus.43% of the execs surveyed said they are expecting sales to be impacted for the next three to six months before leveling out. 2020 will be a 'disaster' for many luxury brandsThe luxury market is especially vulnerable to the coronavirus outbreak because it's impacting the spending habits of its most important customer base: the Chinese. Chinese consumers were estimated to account for around 35% of the total spend in the global luxury market in 2019 and around 90% of the growth in global luxury goods sales, according to recent data from Bain. Store and mall closures in mainland China are preventing these customers from shopping in their own country and travel bans put in place by the Chinese government and other countries mean that some of these shoppers also aren't shopping elsewhere. This especially pertinent as the majority of luxury spending done by Chinese shoppers happens outside their own country, according to Bain. Beyond these physical constraints, a decline in shoppers' morale means that those that do have access to stores or the ability to shop online, may not be in the mood to shop. Pauline Brown, a luxury goods expert and a former chairman of LVMH North America, said she expects 2020 to be a "disaster" for many luxury brands in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance."The problem with luxury is that if you don't buy it in a given quarter, it's not like you come back and all of a sudden there's excess demand the next quarter... you're not going to get the sales back," she said. The economic impact of coronavirus outbreak has frequently been compared to the SARS or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2003, which also took a hit on luxury sales but from which brands were fairly quick to recover from. But the Bernstein note highlights a major difference between the two epidemics: in 2003, the Chinese accounted for 2% to 3% of global demand in the luxury market but today, they account for ten times that, a group of Bernstein analysts wrote. Meaning that luxury brands may be hurting more this time around. According to the Bernstein research, Swatch and Richemont - the owner of Cartier and Chloé among other brands - are most exposed to the Chinese customer base, while Luxxotica and Moncler are least exposed to this market. NOW WATCH: Camel milk can cost $30 a litre.

Renewed Coronavirus Concerns May Weigh On Wall StreetRTT News (United States)January 30, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 RTT News All Rights ReservedLength: 2142 wordsByline: editorial@rttnews.com,  (RTT Staff Writer)Body       The major U.S. index futures are pointing to a lower opening on Thursday, with stocks likely to come under pressure after ending the previous session roughly flat. Renewed concerns about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak are likely to weigh on the markets as the death toll continues to rise. According to Chinese health officials, the coronavirus outbreak has killed at least 170 people and infected more than 7,700. The cases of the mysterious new coronavirus in mainland China now outnumber the infections that China saw during the entire SARS outbreak of 2002 and 2003. Some companies have already started to warn about the impact of the outbreak on their first quarter corporate results. A steep drop by shares of Facebook (FB) may also weigh on the markets, with the social media giant moving sharply lower in pre-market trading after reporting better than expected fourth quarter results but warning of slower growth. On the other hand, shares of Microsoft (MSFT) are likely to see initial strength after the software giant reported fiscal second quarter results that beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Stocks moved to the upside early in the trading day on Wednesday but fluctuated over the course of the session before eventually closing little changed. The major averages spent most of the session in positive territory but ended the day on opposite sides of the unchanged line. While the S&P; 500 edged down 2.84 points or 0.1 percent to 3,273.40, the Dow crept up 11.60 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 28,734.45 and the Nasdaq inched up 5.48 points or 0.1 percent to 9,275.16. Stocks gave back ground going into the close following reports Google is temporarily closing its offices in China due to the spread of the coronavirus. The news of the shutdown, which reportedly affects Google's offices in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, led to renewed concerns about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The roughly flat close on Wall Street also came after the Federal Reserve announced its widely expected decision to leave interest rates unchanged. The Fed decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent, keeping rates unchanged for the second straight meeting after three straight quarter-point rate cuts. The accompanying statement was largely unchanged from last month, with the Fed noting that recent data indicates the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. The central bank did describe household spending as rising at a "moderate pace" compared to last month's description of spending as rising at a "strong pace." In his post-meeting press conference, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged that some of the uncertainties around trade have diminished following the signing of the phase one U.S.-China trade deal. Powell noted that some uncertainties about the global economic outlook remain, however, with the Fed chief specifically pointing to the new coronavirus outbreak. "With the yield curve close to re-inverting, speculation has risen that the Fed might consider cutting interest rates again, perhaps because of fears about the potential economic disruption from the new coronavirus," said Paul Ashworth, Chief U.S. Economist at Capital Economics.  "But unless the U.S. experiences its own epidemic, we doubt the indirect effects from the disruption in China would be enough to warrant a U.S. rate cut," he added. "We continue to expect that the Fed will leave rates on hold for an extended period." Earlier in the session, stocks benefited from a positive reaction to the latest batch of earnings news, with shares of General Electric (GE) moving sharply higher after the industrial conglomerate reported better than expected fourth quarter results. Tech giant Apple (AAPL) also posted a strong gain after reporting fiscal first quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates on strong iPhone sales and providing upbeat guidance for the current quarter. On the other hand, shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) came under pressure after the chipmaker reported fourth quarter results that beat expectations but provided disappointing guidance. In U.S. economic news, the National Association of Realtors released a report unexpectedly showing a sharp pullback in pending home sales in the month of December. NAR said its pending home sales index plunged by 4.9 percent in December after jumping by 1.2 percent in November. Economists had expected pending home sales to rise by 0.5 percent. A pending home sale is one in which a contract was signed but not yet closed. Normally, it takes four to six weeks to close a contracted sale. Natural gas stocks moved sharply lower over the course of the trading session, dragging the NYSE Arca Natural Gas Index down by 2.2 percent to its lowest closing level in nearly two months. The sell-off by natural gas stocks came amid a steep drop by the price of the commodity, with natural gas for March delivery falling $0.043 or 2.3 percent to $1.865 per million BTUs. Significant weakness was also visible among networking stocks, as reflected by the 2.2 percent slump by the NYSE Arca Networking Index. Telecom, oil service and semiconductor stocks also saw notable weakness on the day, while gold stocks soared going into the close of trading. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures are sliding $1.00 to $52.33 a barrel after slipping $0.15 to $53.33 a barrel on Wednesday. Meanwhile, after inching up $0.20 to $1,576 an ounce in the previous session, gold futures are climbing $7.20 to $1,583.20 an ounce. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 108.87 yen compared to the 109.02 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Wednesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1025 compared to yesterday's $1.1010. Asia Asian stocks fell sharply on Thursday as the rapidly spreading outbreak of the coronavirus respiratory disease prompted the World Health Organization to call an emergency meeting to consider issuing a global alarm.  Investors also digested the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged and mixed earnings updates from top U.S. companies that came after the U.S. market close.  According to Chinese health officials, the coronavirus outbreak has killed 170 people and infected 7,711 people. A Chinese government economist estimated that the outbreak could cut China's first quarter growth by one point to 5 percent or more. The Chinese markets remained closed for the Lunar New Year holidays. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 2.6 percent to 26,449.13 as investors kept an eye on  the WHO meeting related to the coronavirus outbreak.  The Taiwan Weighted Index plunged 5.8 percent to close at 11,421.74, marking the biggest decline since October 2018, as trading resumed after the Lunar New Year break. Japanese shares fell sharply as the yen gained further ground and earnings failed to impress investors. The Nikkei 225 Index tumbled 401.65 points, or 1.7 percent, to 22,977.75, while the broader Topix closed 1.5 percent lower at 1,674.77. Screen Holdings slumped 19.3 percent after the semiconductor equipment maker slashed its operating profit forecasts by almost half. Advantest plunged 6.4 percent and IHI Corp plummeted 5.6 percent.  Canon gave up 5.3 percent after the digital camera maker reported a more than 50 percent drop in full-year profit and a 9 percent decrease in net sales. Australian markets drifted lower after Newcrest Mining posted a 16 percent drop in second-quarter gold output and said shipments from its flagship Cadia mine in New South Wales were delayed by the recent bushfires. Concerns over the coronavirus impact also kept investors on the edge.  The benchmark S&P;/ASX 200 Index dropped 23.10 points, or 0.3 percent, to 7,008.40, while the broader All Ordinaries Index ended down 27.30 points, or 0.4 percent, at 7,108.60. Shares of Newcrest Mining tumbled 2.8 percent and Evolution lost 2.1 percent. Fortescue Metals Group declined 2.1 percent despite the iron ore miner releasing a strong quarterly production report. Heavyweight BHP shed 0.9 percent and Rio Tinto gave up 1.2 percent.  Aerial imagery firm Nearmap plummeted almost 30 percent on an earnings downgrade. Treasury Wine Estates jumped 5.3 percent on bargain hunting after falling more than 22 percent in the previous session on its downbeat full-year outlook. Commonwealth Bank of Australia gained 1 percent after raising its stake in buy-now-pay-later company Klarna. Export prices in Australia were down 5.2 percent sequentially but rose 4.1 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said today in a report. Seoul stocks ended deep in the red after the release of mixed data. The benchmark Kospi ended down 37.28 points, or 1.7 percent, at 2,148. South Korea's confidence among manufacturers rose in January, while sentiment among non-manufacturers decreased at the beginning of the year, survey data from Bank of Korea revealed. Europe European stocks have fallen sharply on Thursday after preliminary figures suggested that cases of the mysterious new coronavirus in mainland China now outnumbered the infections that China saw during the entire SARS outbreak of 2002 and 2003. While the French CAC 40 Index has slumped by 1.4 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the German DAX Index are both down by 1.1 percent. Oil &gas; company Royal Dutch Shell has shown a significant move to the downside after its quarterly profit missed analyst estimates.  Telecom company BT Group has also tumbled after its profit before tax for the nine months to December 31, 2019 declined to 1.91 billion pounds from the previous year's 2.09 billion pounds. Sanofi shares have also fallen even though the company said Olipudase alfa showed positive results in two clinical trials in the treatment of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency in adult and pediatric patients. On the other hand, gold miner Centamin has jumped. The company reported gold production of 148,387 ounces from the Sukari Gold Mine for the fourth quarter, an increase of 8 percent from the prior year. Unilever has also moved notably higher after saying it would carry out a strategic view of its global tea business. Volvo Group has soared after the Swedish auto maker reported that its fourth quarter income climbed to 6.83 billion Swedish kronor from the previous year's 2.66 billion kronor. Swedish retailer Hennes &Mauritz; AB has also jumped after its fourth quarter profit after tax rose to 4.21 billion Swedish kronor from 3.54 billion kronor last year. In economic news, Germany's unemployment unexpectedly declined in January, the Federal Employment Agency reported. The number of people out of work decreased by 2,000 from the previous month, confounding expectations for an increase of 5,000 in January. Unemployment totaled 2.277 million. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at a near-record low 5 percent in the month, in line with expectations. U.S. Economic Reports U.S. economic growth in the fourth quarter continued at the same pace as in the previous quarter, according to a report released by the Commerce Department. The Commerce Department said real gross domestic product climbed by 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter, unchanged from the third quarter and in line with economist estimates. The pace of GDP growth was unchanged as a downturn in imports, an acceleration in government spending, and a smaller decrease in non-residential investment were offset by a larger decrease in private inventory investment and a slowdown in consumer spending. A separate report released by the Labor Department showed first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits decreased from an upwardly revised level in the week ended January 25th. The report said initial jobless claims fell to 216,000, a decrease of 7,000 from the previous week's revised level of 223,000. Economists had expected jobless claims to inch up to 215,000 from the 211,000 originally reported for the previous week. Stocks In Focus Shares of DuPont (DD) may come under pressure after the chemical giant reported fourth quarter earnings in line with analyst estimates but provided disappointing guidance. Align Technology (ALGN) is also likely to see initial weakness after reporting better than expected fourth quarter results but warning of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on its first quarter results. On the other hand, shares of Qorvo (QRVO) are seeing significant pre-market strength after the chipmaker reported fiscal third quarter results that exceeded estimates and provided upbeat guidance. Chocolate giant Hershey (HSY) may also move to the upside after reporting better than expected fourth quarter results and forecasting 2020 results above analyst estimates.        Load-Date: January 31, 2020End of Document

Luis Castillo / The Mask CrisisCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 12, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 658 wordsBody       On Friday, January 31, the World Health Organization issued a global alert for the coronavirus. It has categorized it as a multiple epidemic. Today I want to talk to you about how this epidemic is going to change your life. We will approach it from the point of view of a unique product: masks. Your server is dedicated to the sale of industrial safety goods, including masks and respirators. Throughout the week our customers were making unusual requests for those items. With high numbers and tremendous urgency. On Friday, the bomb exploded with requests ranging from 100,000 to 6 million masks. Guess where they're being exported. Of course to China. I share some realities about masks. The term N95 became fashionable. Many might think it's the brand or a norm, however it refers to the level of solid particles they filter. That is, they filter 95 percent of the solid particles, so it is advisable to use them to avoid spreading or spreading viral diseases. China is the world's largest producer of masks with 20 million a day, according to Chinese government data. The state has taken control of most of the mask factories, disposable overalls, gloves, lenses, monogogles and face protectors to supply its doctors and population. However, there is no supply, so the high demand we are seeing globally. Colleagues in the medium in Mexico and Latin America informed us of the same situation, an over-demand that is being exported to China. Delivery times, for example, of a container, from January 31 went to 90 days when the normal is 30. This oversupply is going to have economic consequences. First the raw materials will go up. Same as the cost of masks, disposable gloves and eye protection; this by the law of supply and demand. But I detect another impact besides economics. I am concerned that I have not seen any related tenders on CompraNet - the procurement portal by the federal government. I do not know the situation of the states of the Republic, but hopefully they are being prevented. What am I going to do with this? Being a responsible government means preventing global epidemics. Protect the population, starting with the medical and nursing corps. They are the ones who will care for and heal the sick. In China, medical staff wear disposable overalls, N95 mask, disposable gloves and face protectors. On their backs they write down on the disposable overall slat their name and specialty. In China they are waging a brutal battle against the epidemic. So I'm surprised that the Mexican government is taking so long to strengthen stocks of these products, to be prepared when the virus arrives. As a country we fell asleep. Now it will be very difficult for us to supply at a good price and in time. The Mexican factories of these products have a very limited capacity. Returning to the economic impact, as you know, they postponed the return of Chinese New Year's vacation to prevent contagion in workplaces. Many companies are back to work on the 14th, but this date is still uncertain. This will affect the delivery times of many products. Think about things you use every day, how many of them or their components are made in China. This is also why a hike in commodities and some products of Chinese origin is expected. No matter what brand they are. Finally, what will happen to companies that have to wear masks in their day-to-day operations to protect their workers? The more formal ones will be heavily pressured and will buy at higher prices. The more informal ones will simply tell the worker they couldn't get. That will have a serious impact. In short, thecoronavirus, in addition to being a risk to global health, is accompanied by social and economic impacts. We must not take this matter lightly. What happens in China has global effects. All the strength to all our brothers in the world who contracted this virus and to the nurses and doctors who do an exceptional job in healing the sick.       Load-Date: February 13, 2020End of Document

Huawei's Catch-22The Commentator: Yeshiva UniversityFebruary 2, 2020 SundayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 737 wordsByline: Nathan Hakakian Nathan Hakakian BusinessBodyOn January 24th, the U.S. Commerce Department's plan to further limit trade with Chinese tech giant Huawei (pronounced Wah-Way) was thwarted with the Pentagon opposing the ruling. At first glance, the headline seems confusing and conflicting as the Pentagon had been fighting tooth and nail to try to limit Huawei's presence in the U.S - viewing the company as a potential national security threat. Furthermore, in August, President Trump had declared "We're not doing business with Huawei." Why the sudden contradictory stance?Founded by a former Chinese army officer in 1987, Huawei has become one of the world's largest players in the telecommunications market, occupying a significant presence in China and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific) regions. In addition to being a smartphone producer and competitor to Apple and Samsung, Huawei has also created a worldwide cellular empire. Many U.S. companies had relied on their cell towers until 2012, where a U.S. panel feared that the Chinese government was using Huawei's technology as a possible way to spy inside the U.S. Since the panel, many U.S. companies such as Verizon and AT&T succumbed to U.S. pressure and severed ties with the company.Despite the U.S. blacklisting, Huawei has still seen significant growth, growing 18% from 2018 to 2019 and reporting $122 billion in annual revenue. Responsible for a significant portion of growth, has been the release of their latest smartphone, the Mate 30. Paired with its quest to become the first and largest producer of 5G network components and devices, Huawei was in great need of cell phone chips. In the past, they had relied heavily on U.S. companies such as Intel Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. Instead, Huawei has turned to both Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors and to Chinese power amplifier producer HiSilicon as the main suppliers for the Mate 30. These products and producers are cheaper than their American equivalents. Additionally, Huawei has also looked at non-U.S. markets such as the U.K and Germany to expand. Both countries have also shown interest in allowing Huawei to operate within their respective countries. Huawei's ability to rapidly grow despite an intense U.S. ban shows not only their global influence but also their ability to rapidly shift from U.S. dependence. In an interview conducted by the WSJ, Huawei Founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei stated, "We can survive without the U.S." John Suffolk, Huawei's top cybersecurity official, also added, "All of our 5G is now America-free." Some of this optimism can be attributed to Huawei's new operating system, Harmony which will soon become a platform compatible with smartwatches, televisions, and computers. While the Pentagon's main objective has and always will be the nation's safety, a significant loss in revenue from the Huawei ban could lead to the U.S being unable to fund their various defense programs including cybersecurity. Pentagon officials have also reasoned that Huawei will find ways to receive chips and other equipment regardless of the U.S. ban. Better it be the U.S. profiting, as opposed to rival countries or China itself. Pressured by the Pentagon, the Commerce Department decided to pull-back from signing a proposal that would have limited sales with Huawei. The standing agreement allows U.S. companies to sell chips and electronic goods to Huawei under the condition that the products are made with less than 25% of non-U.S. materials. The proposal, however, would have shaved down the percentage of the non-American material to 10%. Although this may seem advantageous from the U.S.' perspective, as many American products are created using Chinese products, many U.S. manufacturers would be left in a very precarious situation.In many ways, Huawei is the ultimate litmus test in the U.S.-China trade tensions. Although the Trump administration has remained firm on their demands, limiting Chinese trade could severely backfire. China, through Huawei's success, has left the U.S. in an economic headlock. Huawei holds the keys to success for the telecommunication, manufacturer, and software industries, as they have billions of customers both domestically and internationally. For the foreseeable future, with its innovative and dynamic business model, Huawei is positioned for continuous growth.Photo Caption: Chinese Electronics Huawei continues to grow Photo Credit: https://1000logos.net/huawei-logo/Load-Date: February 2, 2020End of Document

Uk authorizes restricted use of Huawei on its 5G networkCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 28, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 618 wordsBodyBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday decided to restrict access to its 5G network on Tuesday at the risk of anger at Washington within days of Brexit."High-risk providers will be excluded from sensitive 'central' parts of high-speed mobile internet 5G networks, the ministry in charge of the digital sector was informed at the end of a national security council (NSC) meeting, composed of a handful of ministers and chaired by Johnson.The statement did not specifically mention China's controversial telecoms giant, but Huawei immediately claimed to be "reassured by the British government's confirmation that we can continue to work with our customers to continue with the deployment of 5G" in the country.The Chinese manufacturer already participates in the 4G network offered by several operators, including BT, Vodafone and Three.And with this decision London allows you to participate in non-strategic infrastructure but excluding you from the most sensitive areas through which customer data flows.The government also limited the presence of these providers to "no more than 35% on the periphery of the network, known as the access network, which connects devices and equipment to mobile towers."In addition, this cap will be "reviewable in determining whether it should be further reduced as the market diversifies."- U.S. pressure -The United States has been demanding that European countries, and in particular the United Kingdom, be demanded for many months, to exclude Huawei from its networks, claiming its close ties to the Chinese government and the risk of espionage, which the Chinese group has always denied.By authorizing his participation even on a limited basis, Johnson risks angering Washington at a time when the UK hopes to strengthen its bilateral ties in the face of negotiating an ambitious trade deal following Brexit.However, The Times newspaper had called him on Tuesday to resist American pressure."The UK is not moving away from Brussels so that it is now Trump who tells him what to do," he wrote in an editorial.American leaders spared no effort to try to get London to bend to its demands, between closed-door meetings and warnings from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who called the impending British decision "capital."Johnson himself spoke about it on Friday with US President Donald Trump.- The fox in the chicken coop? -Johnson had already warned in the middle of the month that there are few alternatives to Huawei, as it has a technological advantage over its two main competitors, Nokia and Ericsson.In addition, if the Chinese group were excluded it would be necessary to remove its base stations from the existing 4G infrastructure, which would be costly and impact on customers' invoices in addition to delaying the move to 5G.British security services repeatedly assured that it is possible to work with the Chinese manufacturer without compromising security.However, opening up to Huawei worried some in the Westminster Parliament and within the government.While Finance Minister Sajid Javid favored himself, other heavyweights such as Interior Minister Priti Patel and Defense Minister Ben Wallace opposed it, according to the press.Similarly, Conservative MPs expressed their concerns. For example, Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the foreign policy committee, warned that it would be like "introducing the fox into the chicken coop."Australia and Japan followed the US example by banning the use of Huawei,but European countries, still undecided in choosing the manufacturers of future 5G networks, seem divided.For their part, most large emerging markets, led by Brazil and India, are opening their arms to the Chinese equipment manufacturer.jbo-acc/zmLoad-Date: January 29, 2020End of Document

Coronavirus Outbreak Affecting Vape Industry, Online Vape Retailer ProVape SaysPR NewswireFebruary 26, 2020 Wednesday 11:50 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 634 wordsDateline: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 26, 2020 BodyPR Newswire Burbank, California-based online vape retailer ProVape says the vape industry is bound to feel the impact of the Coronavirus outbreak sooner than expected. With the continuing crisis, the Chinese government is torn between restarting the economy and containing the virus from spreading by announcing massive quarantine of millions of people. There seems to be no rush in putting the economy back on track. Many Chinese companies have opted not to resume normal operations despite the encouragement of local authorities.The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the Coronavirus outbreak has originated in Wuhan City, Hubei Province. Since the outbreak, over 2,442 have died as of this writing, while more than 78,000 people have fallen ill with the virus in China. There have been confirmed Coronavirus death-related cases outside China. Iran confirmed eight deaths, South Korea reported six deaths, and the Italian government confirmed the death of three people.In Shenzhen, the vaping capital of the world, businesses have been allowed to resume operation if they have put stringent measures to prevent further spread of the devastating virus. Local officials have approved plans that would protect its citizens when they return to work.Companies have been ordered to give out at least two masks a day to employees, as well as to conduct temperature checks. However, there is still a wide gap between reality and the regulations, which prevents many employees from going to work.  "We started today, but the boss only gave us one mask when we all know he is supposed to give out two," said a 52-year old woman employee at one of the Shenzhen factories. [The Guardian, Feb 23, 2020: China encourages citizens to return to work as coronavirus hits economy]Coronavirus is creating a global problem in the vape industry as manufacturers of vaping products will not be able to produce and deliver before coils, pods, and other vape hardware dwindle to a frightening number in the U.S. and around the globe.Chinese manufacturers are not rushing to resume regular operations, and there are few or almost no domestic alternatives. About 1,000 factories in China produce 90 percent of the world's e-cigarettes and vaping devices. If these factories remain closed and cannot resume regular operations, there could be a significant delay in the shipment of vaping supplies, if not a total outage.In the U.S., the first wave to hit the vape industry was the Trump administration's trade war with China and a partial ban on flavored vape products [e-juices]. The above-mentioned have already caused the removal of many vape products from local and online stores.Moreover, Chinese manufacturers produce almost all cannabis vaporizers, cartridges, and batteries. With the timing of the outbreak, the Coronavirus could significantly affect the vape and cannabis industry in the U.S., if supply from China fails.There is a massive problem with the timely shipment of supplies. Wholesale vape suppliers must wait for the Coronavirus crisis to end before they can get a steady supply of vaporizer products. Thus, retailers have been told to anticipate the worst and encouraged to stock up now to ensure that they have products available for their customers. "We are constantly told that products are on backorder, and are encouraged to stock up with vape hardware [coils,vape kits, pod systems, mods, tanks, anddisposable vape devices] to avoid any issues in coming months," according to Art Harutyunyan, a senior executive of ProVape.Media Contact:Cathy TorresEmail:cathy@rencomusa.comRelated LinksOnline Vape Retailer View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/coronavirus-outbreak-affecting-vape-industry-online-vape-retailer-provape-says-301011750.htmlSOURCE ProVapeLoad-Date: February 27, 2020End of Document

Could We Be Past the Peak in Coronavirus Cases?RealMoneyFebruary 10, 2020 Monday 11:02 AM EDTCopyright 2020 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 913 wordsByline: Maleeha BengaliHighlight: The PBOC is taking measures to make sure the economy is insulated from any long-lasting effects from the virus slowdown. But how much ammunition does China really have?BodyWith over 400 million people across multiple cities in China in lockdown as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with supply chains and businesses coming to a grinding halt, the billion dollar question on everyone's minds is, "Is it time to buy or sell this market?"Over the past 40 years, China has grown to now become the world's second largest economy with a GDP of $13.6 trillion vs. the U.S. of $20.5 trillion. It is the largest trader of merchandise in the world, and central to global supply chains as a host of world's raw materials are consumed by China to then turn them into finished manufactured goods. China accounts for roughly 16% of world GDP. With most factories and businesses shut for weeks, due to open as late as 14th February, there will no doubt be an impact to Q1 GDP. According to Reuters, Apple's  main iPhone production partner, Foxconn, had received Chinese government approval to resume production at a key plant in northern China city of Zhengzhou, where 50% of the world's iPhones are made. There was some suggestion at the end of last week that they would not be allowed to reopen till 19th February, so this comes as a welcome surprise.According to China's National Health Commission, daily increase of coronavirus cases across China excluding Hubei province has been falling, 444 on 9th Feb and 509, 558, 696, 707, 731, and 890 for the previous six days. China confirmed 40171 cases by end of 9th Feb with the death toll rising to 908. This virus has a much lower fatality rate than SARS even though the rate of transmission is much more severe. According to a Bloomberg article today, the virus may infect up to 500,000 people before peaking in mid to late February. There was a headline today suggesting a vaccine was developed by Chinese scientists which had been tested on animals and the clinical trial is likely to be launched in April.China's economy grew by 6% GDP last year, the lowest rate in 30 years. After the Phase One trade deal was signed, it was hoped that 2020 would be a recovery year. Those hopes are now clearly dashed. However, if China is to meet its 5.5%-6% GDP target, with Q1 reporting even sub 5%, it can only mean one thing: massive monetary easing to boost growth to get the average higher in the coming quarters. Last week China injected about 1.7 trillion yuan in liquidity, some was to offset reverse maturing repos, cut 7-day and 14-day repo rates, as well as lowered tariffs on $75 billion worth of U.S. goods imported. The PBOC is taking measures to make sure the economy is insulated from any long-lasting effects from the virus slowdown.But how much ammunition does China really have? This morning it reported its January CPI (Consumer Price Inflation) at 5.4% year over year, highest print in nine years, driven by a surge in pork prices. China's food CPI rose 20.6% in January. These are concerning numbers as it ties the hands of the government to inflate the economy, lest inflation spirals out of control. A delicate balance to say the least. There is also growing concern of more bank defaults and subprime structures that all rest in the financial system like a house of cards. Any further delay or protracted slowdown can cause a ruffle in broader asset classes which can exacerbate the slowdown.One thing is certain, a lot of the hibernating bears are out and about highlighting all the valid reasons why this market should fall, but yet it is not because most investors are waiting for a pullback only to buy more. Sod's law, when one waits for that, never happens. It almost appears that the pain trade is higher from here, not lower. The Fed has also extended its repo operations till April. To debate the veracity of this is beyond my pay grade as the problem is shoved under the carpet for a bit longer, and the Fed knows it. Regardless, liquidity is the key to where markets and asset classes go from here. For now, both the Fed and PBOC are injecting money into the market.The oil sector and its stocks have gotten hit the hardest as Chinese Oil demand is set to reduce by ~ 4mln bpd. In a market that was already dealing with excess inventories and delicately balanced with OPEC+ cuts, this can be a big hit if the virus is not contained in a matter of weeks, let alone businesses restart towards end of February. Last week OPEC+ recommended a cut of 600k bpd to start as soon as March which could very well support the market as Libyan Oil has dropped as well. Be careful what you wish for as a toxic cocktail of OPEC+ cuts, central bank liquidity together with U.S. shale production plateauing or even slowing, could very well be the harbinger of a massive squeeze in Oil in a short period of time. Copper only fell 10% in comparison to Oil, but then again it is a market in severe deficit assuming very conservative demand assumptions.The markets may have been holding up, but Commodity stocks are valued extremely cheaply. The investment case rests on the rate of spread of the virus slowing to almost being contained and central banks supporting the market. Barring a new type of transmission or increased global cases, these stocks are a buy now. Not to forget the whole world was talking about the Fed/reflation trade back in December as they will not raise rates, possibly even cut lower to boost inflation sustainably above 2%. What has changed now that these stocks are 25% cheaper?(Apple is a holding in Jim Cramer's  .

President Trump is considering Congressman Doug Collins to become the new director of National Intelligence. If selected, the Georgia lawmaker would permanently fill the position.Joining me in a first-on Fox Business interview right now is Georgia Congressman, House Judiciary Committee ranking member himself, Doug Collins. Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you, thanks so much for being here.REP. DOUG COLLINS (R-GA): Maria, it's always good to get on with you.BARTIROMO: Congratulations to you, what an honor to have this distinction that President Trump would like you to be the new head of the DNI.COLLINS: Wow, you know, it is humbling. I mean, it is amazing for a true first gift in a tall order to have the president think that much of you, to mention my name and among others to be this position. But let me just tell you right now, thus, I know the problems in our Intelligence community. But this is not a job that interest me, at this time, it is not one that I would accept because I'm running a Senate race down here in Georgia in which, you know, everybody knows that I'm a supporter of the president.They know how much I have supported this president through this sham impeachment and everything else. But I'm running against a senator who is just nearly an opponent who decided to support the president three weeks before she got the appointment. And also polling down here is showing that we have a candidate down here that could actually put this seat in jeopardy because of the flaws that she has.So, look, I'm very humbled by the president. I'm a supporter of this president. I'll continue to fight for this president in the house this year, and we'll be in the Senate next year because this intelligence community has to get right, and I'm sure the president will pick somebody that's appropriate for that job.BARTIROMO: The governor obviously named Kelly Loeffler as that senator that you refer to. What are you going to do to win this Senate seat come November, given the fact that you've got the governor obviously backing her, right?COLLINS: No, will do. Look, this governor has one vote. He made that vote. Now, it's time for the people of Georgia to get a choice. And what they're going to see is someone who has ideas, someone who has actually fought against the swamp in Washington D.C., who have actually fought against this Intelligence community. Who fought sham impeachment, but actually who's partnered with this president to do first step act, criminal justice reform to work on the tax cuts.And when you have a record that you can run on, and you have something that is probably, you can understand that just simply being appointed and having a lot of money and ability to spend it against someone is not going to win this race. The people of Georgia have been coming to us, and they're thanking us for being in the race because they know that I'm a supporter of the president. I'm the one that he actually wanted to be appointed to this job, and we're looking forward to continuing this Senate race.BARTIROMO: You've got an incredible record, what you and your colleagues have done in terms of exposing what took place in the Intel agencies throughout 2016, as early as the end of 2015, it was just stunning. I want to talk to you about that because you say that you're not interested in the DNI position. But you know, congressman, something needs to be done to clean up these agencies.They've all been politicized, whether it's the CIA, the FBI or just the Intel Committee where, you know, Adam Schiff can be looking at the same exact information that John Ratcliffe and Devin Nunes are looking at, and they -- and they have completely different narratives. For three years, we heard Adam Schiff say that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians and the collusion was, quote, unquote, "in plain sight", something that the media refuses to push Adam Schiff on.COLLINS: No, they're not going to push Adam Schiff, and even if they push him, all he's going to do is tell more lies and make up stories to tell because he has a narrative that he doesn't like the president. He has a narrative that he just wants this president to fail. But let me just say, we've looked at this and Devin Nunes and I just got this, he's sending a letter to Chairman Nadler about the FISA issue that a we have before us right now.And the Horowitz report which showed the fatal flaws that we see in the FISA process, and especially when it comes to attacking American citizens like Carter Page who received the fake dossier, who received the information that was used, they should have never have gotten there and should have had more checks and balances. And I believe as you just mentioned a moment ago -- I think going back to 2016, we look at this corrupt cabal of Comey and Page and Strzok and McCabe and Brennan and Clapper, it is time that we continue this process of cleaning this out, and that's what we're still doing every day as the ranking member right now of the Judiciary Committee because it needs to be exposed.We cannot let another president go through what we have just seen because it's just wrong. Our intelligence communities need to be arbiters of what's going on in the world and keeping us safe --BARTIROMO: So --COLLINS: Not being used with Adam Schiff, Jerry Nadler or Speaker Pelosi to get political dirt on a president that they don't like. This has got to stop.BARTIROMO: It's exactly right. I mean, for three years I've been outraged by this because it's about fairness and it's about America. You can't make up stories that President Trump colluded when it's absolutely not true, and then get the entire country in hysteria. Congressman, let me ask you about this letter that you and ranking member Devin Nunes sent -- you sent the letter to the House Judiciary Chairman, Jerry Nadler, as you just said, urging him to not miss this opportunity to amend FISA as this March 15th deadline is approaching.What do you want to see different in terms of FISA? We know that the DOJ just told us that two of the four warrants that were used to spy on Carter Page were unlawful. And by the way, they didn't say the first two were lawful. They're still looking at the first two. So it may very well be --COLLINS: Right --BARTIROMO: At the end of the day all four warrants to spy on Carter Page were unlawful.COLLINS: Well, I think they have a lot of problems to answer with most of those warrants. And I think this is why it's important to me. I want to know why Chairman Nadler is scared to have a hearing with Mr. Horowitz? Why is he scared to bring in the Inspector General and talk about the findings? I mean, we had Director Wray in just the other day who dealt with it from his perspective, of being talked about what the report said.But I want Mr. Horowitz to come in. But also why is my chairman scared to actually have hearings on FISA, we can do them in public, and we also can do classified hearings. But he's not willing to give in an answer to deeper questions of what needs to happen in our FISA courts. What the abuses were, I think the problem is, he doesn't want to show what happened under the Obama administration and the corruption that took place and the politicization that took place.To get to the answers, he would rather just have a mark up in hearing, and it's like, these are the things that we think might help. But that's what I think the letter folks is on, saying you can't have a corrupt process and then go to reauthorize this without taking on the findings and the reports from Horowitz, and saying we've got to make changes.The American people must know the these secret courts are not attacking Americans based on faulty paid for by the DNC information to attack a president.BARTIROMO: But how is this going to be cleaned up? I mean, you, if you're offered this deal, and I position, people have confidence that you will lead a cleanup of this. How are we going to trust the DOJ and the intelligence agencies again, knowing now that they've been completely politicized and used for political reasons. Hillary Clinton paid for the dossier that was used to frame Donald Trump. It was used to get these warrants to spy on his campaign.COLLINS: Well, the president's got a lot of choices to make there, and he'll make a great one. I know, he is the acting director, Grenell is going to be great. And there will be plenty of times ever. They're going to have people like myself and John Ratcliffe and Devin Nunes and Jim Jordan and all out here. We're never -- we're not going to let this go.Every time we talk about it, people are going to write about it. When they see that we know that what they did and we caught them, it's amazing to me how Durham is out there doing his investigation, he's ramped up that investigation, Bill Barr is working with him on that, and how some of these characters have now sort of quieted down.They're not as bold as they used to be about their predictions of what the president will happen to him and what's going to happen to him. Because after investigation after investigation after sham impeachment, after Mueller, after going back through the cross-fire hurricane where we see all of these problems. The American people are now beginning to see through that frankly, the -- what was happening under the Obama administration, coming into this administration was simply corruption.It was aimed at a political president and a candidate at the time, and that's why many of us are continuing to beat on this every chance we get because we're not going to let it fall off the front burner because something has to be changed.BARTIROMO: I know, but congressman, it is so incredibly irresponsible of people like Jim Comey, like John Brennan, who continue to trash this president, and you would think that when, you know, someone like the former CIA director goes on national television and says that Donald Trump committed treason, that you would think that there is some truth to it since you're the former director of the CIA, only to learn later that it was a complete lie, that it was all politics.This morning, John Brennan tweeted just this morning, so you say that they're backing down, here's what John Brennan just tweeted. We said it earlier in the show. We are now in a full blown national security crisis by trying to prevent the flow of intelligence to Congress. Trump is abetting a Russian covert operation to keep him in office for Moscow's interest, not America's -- John Brennan is still at it --COLLINS: Well, let's just say -- well, let's just say he's trying -- I guess trying to go down fighting. This man is one who has so politicized our country. He is the problem that we're seeing right now. He is the face of him and Clapper and also Comey standing out in the middle of woods looking at trees that he tweets about. This is -- these are people who put their interest before the American interest. These are people who simply hate a president because they don't like what he's done and they're doing anything they can do about it.That's why I'm so confident that Mr. Durham is going to get to the bottom of this, and we're going to continue to have those in Congress, continuing to point this out. And here's my challenge, instead of going on and tweeting about things, instead of going on soft ball media shows, why doesn't he come on to your show? Why doesn't he come on and let you ask questions of it?Why doesn't he sit there and actually have to answer for the things that he has done because they've hinted about it for so long. Remember, Adam Schiff is able to say whatever he wants to, and say the president was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt -- you know, everything he wants.BARTIROMO: Yes --COLLINS: But yet he never had the courage to sit before our Judiciary Committee and talk about the findings of his own committee. This lack of moral fortitude to actually stand up for what they believe under scrutiny is why the American people are losing faith in our -- lost faith in our intelligence community, and why it's being rebuilt under Donald Trump, and why I believe that we're going to get to the bottom of this and that faith will be restored.BARTIROMO: Well, he's not going to be asked for accountability on "MSNBC". Nobody on "MSNBC" --COLLINS: Definitely not --BARTIROMO: Or "CNN" is going to say to him, hey, for three years, you told us the president committed treason. We know for a fact that's not true. For three years, Adam Schiff, you told us that the president had colluded with the Russians and it was in plain sight. We know that for a fact it's not true. No one is asking them that those questions. I guess that's why he doesn't want to come on with me. You do think we'll see accountability? Because we just saw Andrew McCabe get off last week.COLLINS: Yes, I was hoping that -- my still view is Andrew McCabe should have been charged even if it went to a trial and it didn't turn out the way I thought it would. He still need to be tried because I think lying is something that needs to be held accountable for. That was a disappointment, we'll see how that handles out. But I'm still of the belief that accountability is coming.Where we've talked about this for months. I believe it's coming. I believe the Durham investigation is not for naught. And we're going to see these things held accountable and we're going to see why -- how it got to where it is and how we can fix it. And I'm confident that through the Department of Justice and others, we can restore that confidence.BARTIROMO: Congressman, it's great to see you this morning, thanks so much.COLLINS: Maria, take care, thank you.BARTIROMO: Thanks for your leadership. Congressman Doug Collins joining us there. Coming up, the mother of two missing Idaho children behind bars this morning, just hours away from facing a judge. Nancy Grace will join us next as we look at the charges that Lori Vallow will be now facing. And then a new decade of cars, the top picks for hitting the road in 2020, we'll be right back after this short break.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The mother of a missing Idaho children, Lori Vallow, behind bars this morning. Vallow was arrested in Hawaii late yesterday on multiple charges following the disappearance of her two children, Joshua Vallow and Tylee Ryan missing since September. Lori Vallow now just hours away from facing a judge. Joining me right now on the phone is "Crime Stories With Nancy Grace", host, Nancy Grace. Nancy, thanks so much for joining me this morning. Tell us what happens next?NANCY GRACE, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR (via telephone): Well, this is what we know. We know that she's been arrested on multiple charges. And just to give you an idea on one of these charges of felony desertion of children, there's a maximum of 14 years behind bars, a maximum for one count of that. She's been arrested on felonies. That's what's been confounding everyone is why she hasn't been arrested if her children can't be found.They needed a felony in order to extradite her back from Hawaii. You can't extradite someone based on a misdemeanor or a contempt of court charge. There had to be a felony, and it took time to work up a felony. They did it. She'll be facing a judge. I predict she will not make bond, not get out of behind bars until she tells the court where those children are.BARTIROMO: So, what is her explanation for going to Hawaii, and what about her husband, Chad Daybell, they fled to Hawaii together last Fall with no sign of her children. Daybell has evaded all questions from the police. Do we know what she's saying as far as that -- the fact that her kids are missing and the two of them are in Hawaii?GRACE: Well, I know this much. She got married and they had a -- apparently a sea-side wedding because there's pictures of them dressed out in all white and Hawaiian lace around their neck, doing the hula while nobody can find their children. There's a lot to answer up to, specifically, not only where the children are, but what happened to her husband, Charles Vallow and his wife, Tammy Daybell, both dead just before these two get married.That's a whole another can of worms. Right now the court is going to be asking about the children and there are multiple charges including obstruction of the police and their investigation of where the children are. We also find out that her daughter, Tylee's cell phone was with Lori Vallow. So that makes me think these texts that the daughter sent back in September were really from her mother. That paints a very nefarious picture of where these children are.BARTIROMO: And what about the spouses that you just mentioned? I mean, how much of a consideration is the fact that they're dead?GRACE: You know what? Those are just two dead bodies connected to this couple. There are others, such as Lori's brother, Alex Cox, you know, it just goes on and on and on.There's multiple bodies connected to them whose circumstances of death still remain a mystery. I think right now, the ultimate concern, the first concern is where are the children? Are they tucked away with this doomsday cult? I mean, you can't even write this. It's beyond fiction, it's more like SCI-FI. That will be the first concern.Once the autopsies are made public on his wife and her most recent husband, I think that the courts will proceed on those matters as well.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. What a story. Nancy, thank you so much for weighing in here. We will be following the story with you over the coming days and weeks. Nancy Grace, thank you so much --GRACE: Thank you --BARTIROMO: For calling in, good to talk with you, Nancy. Meanwhile there's coronavirus quarantine, I'll be speaking with married couple recently quarantined on the Diamond Princess Cruise ship. The husband has the highly contagious illness, they will joins us. Plus, turning the tables on me, I'll be answering your questions in our "ASK MARIA SEGMENT" coming up later this hour, don't miss that.And then the '90s had Furby, this decade has a different force. We will show you the hottest new toy coming up. Don't miss that, back in a minute.BARTIROMO: Well, welcome back. Oil under some pressure this morning, down 1.76 percent, there is uncertainty over coronavirus that's weighing on investors. Joining us right now is the publisher of "The Schork Report" Stephen Schork. Great to see you, Steven, and thank you so much for joining us. What's your take on oil in terms of today's move and where it's going?STEPHEN SCHORK, FOUNDER & EDITOR, SCHORK REPORT: You know, absolutely, Maria. It's been a demand story for the past year. I mean, we look back to 2019, and we've had numerous disruptions to the flow of oil around the globe and had no impact on price. Then we look at the loss of oil coming out of places such as Iran, Libya and Venezuela.And once again, that loss of supply has led to no impact on price. And now, we're getting to the coronavirus, and oddly enough, there seems to be, Maria, this narrative on Wall Street that, it's not so bad, this is like SARS 2003, perhaps it is, perhaps it isn't. So, right now, this market is living with every headline with regard to coronavirus. Over the last couple of days, it's been a bullish driver for the market -- coronavirus isn't that bad.Now we're getting headlines once again that maybe it is pretty bad and markets are pulling back. So, it is the demand story for the next few months going into the Summer demand season.GARY SMITH, PRESIDENT, KADINA GROUP: Stephen, Gary Smith here. Question. I just looked at a stock chart of Exxon, and it is almost at 20-year lows. Based on this selloff, would you -- do you start to think some of these major oil producers, distributors, if you will, are buys right here or do you think they're going to go lower as the price of oil continues to drop?SCHORK: I do think that, Gary, they are going to go lower at this point. If we just look at SARS back in 2003, with China demand for jet fuel, we saw a 30 percent drop in demand in the second quarter of '03 because of the lack of fliers. Now, that was back in 2003 when China was only 4 percent of the globe's GDP.Today, China is the second largest economy at 17 percent of the globe's GDP. So any sort of material impact in our model suggest we will see a 25 percent to 30 percent pullback in jet fuel demand going into the peak Summer vacation season. So, no, I don't think they're at a buy right now because I do think there's a greater risk of oil prices headed lower as we see demand disruption first from the shoulder months, we're into the refinery turnaround season, so refineries are buying fewer barrels of oil as they go into their maintenance.And then when we go into the Summer with the knock-on from coronavirus, I do think it is a potential risk for lower prices.BARTIROMO: Right --SCHORK: So, I do not like those buys at this moment.BARTIROMO: We will -- we will leave it there. Stephen, great advice always from you. Thank you sir, thank you so much. Stephen Schork joining --SCHORK: Thanks, Maria --BARTIROMO: Coming up, I'll be speaking with a married couple who were quarantined on the Diamond Princess Cruise ship because of the coronavirus, the husband has contracted the virus. That is next. And then hitting the road in 2020, we will tell you the top car picks for 2020 and beyond. Back in a minute.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. Google reportedly resisting efforts that it turned over documents to investigators. Lauren Simonetti with the details, Lauren.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Maria, that's right. Nearly every state in the U.S. led by Texas wants Google to surrender texts, e-mails and other documents, that according to the Wall Street Journal, all part of an investigation to potential anti-competitive practices.Google says it's cooperating but remains concerned that outside business consultants could share confidential information with its rivals. Google shares down $10.00.The Trump campaign advertising on YouTube's home page, days before the November election, that's a big deal. Now, the specifics of the ad buy have not been disclosed. The Obama campaign made the same deal with YouTube that was back in 2012. The digital space is highly coveted; it's compared to buying a Super Bowl ad.And Consumer Reports Maria, listing its top cars, trucks and SUVs for 2020. The Toyota Corolla landing on top of the under $25,000 category. The Subaru Forester and Legacy as well as the Toyota Prius both snagging a highest honors in the $25-35,000 range. And the magazine including the Tesla Model S for the very first time in the $45-55,000 range. So there you have it.They also noted Maria, that -- you know, the cheaper cars are getting better, so there's not much of a distinction anymore in the type of car that you can get for the price tag. They're all good.BARTIROMO: That's interesting that it's tightening in terms of the price. Thank you, Lauren.Meanwhile, coronavirus victims in the United States, the CDC is announcing 11 of the passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship to a medical facility in Omaha, Nebraska have contracted the disease.Joining me right now is one of the patients, Carl Goldman and his wife and fellow Diamond Princess passenger Jeri Seratti-Goldman. Thanks very much for joining us to you both. We appreciate you joining us.And Carl, you are on the phone. Is it true that you have contracted the coronavirus?CARL GOLDMAN, CORONAVIRUS PATIENT (via telephone): Yes. So I came down with the virus when we landed here in Omaha, they tested me and confirmed I have the virus.Interestingly enough, I had been tested in Japan a few days before we left and I just learned that came out positive yesterday.BARTIROMO: How are you feeling? What are the symptoms, Carl? Tell us what you're feeling. Does it feel like just an average flu or something worse?GOLDMAN: Yes, apparently people get it in different levels. So mine is fairly mild. It's like a flu, but high fever that spiked very, very quickly. That seems to be the common denominator is that -- and that's why it's so pervasive out there right now is as I did, and one can go for days and days not realizing you have the virus. There are no symptoms. Then all of a sudden, a high fever hit last for -- probably for me it was about 18 hours and then it disappeared. It came back a little bit the next night.I've done -- I'm bummed right now because I got three night, three days without fever and then last night it hit.BARTIROMO: Wow.GOLDMAN: But low grade -- low grade right now.BARTIROMO: Jeri -- yes, Jeri Seratti-Goldman, you're with us this morning as well. How are you feeling? You do not -- you do not think you have it, right? I mean, you can -- you can contract this even without any symptoms. You can be contagious.JERI SERATTI-GOLDMAN, WIFE OF THE CORONAVIRUS PATIENT: Yes. So I was tested on the ship, got no results back whatsoever. Then -- when we got to Nebraska Monday morning I was tested. We found out Monday night that I was clear and we are being tested both of us today again.So anxiously awaiting because we just -- like you just said, out of the 14, 11 of us that are here now, so I'm one of three that doesn't have it.BARTIROMO: What a nightmare scenario. The two of you went on a vacation. Tell me what happened. You went on this Diamond Princess ship. You had to dock off the coast of Japan and tell us how this all played out, Carl.GOLDMAN: Sure. It was a vacation. I had purchased a gift for my wife for Christmas and for her birthday to travel through Southeast Asia on the Diamond Princess. We left January 17th, we're now February 21st, so were past the one month. That was supposed to be a 16-day cruise.We enjoyed all of Southeast Asia. On the last day we learned -- we had already packed our bags, learned that a passenger who had gotten off in Hong Kong days earlier had come -- had the virus. He came down with the virus.That's why this thing, as I said earlier, is so pervasive. He came down with the virus four days after he left the ship when he realized he had it.BARTIROMO: So in other words, he didn't have any symptoms, he went to Hong Kong, got back on the ship, he didn't have any symptoms and then four days later people were sick.GOLDMAN: Yes, and that's what's happened with everybody. Everyone we know who's gotten the virus including me has no symptoms, so you're going around in your life and like in the norm. And then three, four, five days later that fever hits and that's when we realize we had the virus.The only other symptom seems to be a dry cough but I had the dry cough, my wife had a little bit of a dry cough. She was negative. I'm positive. So that's not the common denominator but that's definitely one symptom.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. Jeri, tell us your side of this. I mean, you get this trip vacation as a gift from your husband to go be on this beautiful ship to look at Southeast Asia and this is what happens. How did it happen from your standpoint?SERATTI-GOLDMAN: Well, not only that, we were with our good friends and she came down with the virus the day after Valentine's Day. And was heart wrenching because they gave her an hour to get off the ship. And when they gave her that hour, she was only able to pack a backpack. So that was very emotional.And during the time in quarantine, where we're -- we had an open balcony with them from the time we got on the ship. So we were spending that time with them. We were working during the day and we would have dinner and movie at night and making the best of it, our circumstances. And then she got taken away and then it became a whole another ballgame of holy heck.And her husband now is in California at Fort Travis and the state department, he did not really want to go and the state department really did not give him -- we weren't getting enough communication. The embassy said, you know, we'd highly -- you know, encourage you to leave.So part of the problem that we're having is there just so much communication and as we're -- you know, days go on, we're learning that the ship wasn't contained the right way, our luggage is still lost.I mean, there's just so many unanswered questions that we went from OK we can get through this, we're doing a really good job to wait a minute, now I want questions answered.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. And when you were with this other couple, Jeri, do you remember -- you know, anybody coughing on you or sneezing on you or you just were next to them breathing in the same air?SERATTI-GOLDMAN: No, it's so ironic, because out of the four of us, she's the most healthiest. She's a mountain biker. And we had gone out, it was our third time to go on deck, because we had many sleep so we were able to go outside during our quarantine on our own decks. We -- her and I had (INAUDIBLE) did like 3-1/2, almost four miles in that one hour because we just wanted to move.We get back, we all had to take our temperature. She had no -- not even feeling of a temperature, went oh, my gosh, I've got a temperature.BARTIROMO: Wow.SERATTI-GOLDMAN: Crazy.BARTIROMO: Carl, what are the doctors telling you now, Carl? And by the way, you're both in the same hospital but you're in different places, right?SERATTI-GOLDMAN: Correct.GOLDMAN: Yes, we're about three blocks away from each other but it might as well be 3,000 miles. Jerri Jorgensen as my wife Jeri was mentioning is recovering in a hospital in Fukushima, Japan. Her husband Mark who flew back with us is sitting in quarantine at Travis Air Force Base just outside of Sacramento, California.I'm in the bio -- the special -- fitness special hospital section that I am in and then Jeri's about three blocks away. I'm in a -- in a special -- the wing that they have here was set up in 2001 for the anthrax scare that happened in the United States. This was set up by the CDC along with one in Atlanta and New York.So it's one of three as I sit here in Omaha and everyone has to come in here in hazmat outfits, it's totally sealed off and it's quite an experience here. It's like I'm in the middle of a movie.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. So the medical staff has hazmat outfits on. What are they treating you with, Carl? Do you know what they're treating you with and what are they telling you in terms of what happens next for you?GOLDMAN: Yes, it's very funny. There's no antibiotic for this. This virus is still so new, so unknown, there's no cure for it. There's nothing you can give me except the one thing I've been having is Gatorade that seems to be the common denominator here, giving plenty of Gatorade so that I stay hydrated. I've been through every flavor in the rainbow of Gatorade, at least five or six times. I'm just downing a lot of Gatorade.My fever did come back a little last night, so they are giving me ibuprofen for that as they would with -- as you would take when anytime you ended up getting sick.BARTIROMO: And do they -- do they both tell you that you're here now for the next 14 days? I mean, that seems to have been the period that you've got to be quarantined and kept away from people.Jeri, what are they telling you in terms of how long you're going to be there?SERATTI-GOLDMAN: They said 14 days. I am in single digits today. I'm day five. They haven't said any more than 14 days. The CDC came in and gave us -- you know, these legal papers that said, you know, we can't leave the hospital. But in my -- for me, I'm on day five. So I am day not -- I have nine days left.BARTIROMO: Wow. Carl, you too, what do they say in terms of your 14-day period?GOLDMAN: Yes, same thing. Now for me, they're going to have to do two tests at the end of my stay here. So when I no longer show any signs of the virus, I look like I've recovered, getting to that 14-day period, they'll do another laboratory test which are -- they take a swab, put it down the back of my throat, they do it in both nostrils and then take that to a lab.Luckily here, that was the problem in Japan too, on the ship they were doing that and sending it to a lab in Tokyo and there was a two, three, four-day process. And in our case, we didn't learn I was positive until yesterday from that lab.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.GOLDMAN: When we landed here, the Omaha hospital and the bio-containment unit, they've got a lab on the premises. So in four, five hours I'm finding out if I'm positive or negative.BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.GOLDMAN: They'll do that test. If I make it through negative on that, they'll test me again 24 hours later before I'll be released.BARTIROMO: Yes, because you didn't even have the symptoms but you are contagious with being anti-symptomatic.Well, look, we are all wishing the both of you our best and hopes for strong health soon. Carl Goldman, Jeri Seratti-Goldman, thank you very much for telling us your story. We wish you well. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, the 5G fight, the 5G opportunity, Huawei's chief technology officer Paul Scanlon says that if the United States wants to build its own 5G infrastructure the process will be a challenge. This as the Trump administration plans a crackdown on China over the use of U.S. technology to manufacture Huawei chip technology.Joining me right now is the Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment, Keith Krach. And it is great to see you, Secretary. Thanks for being here.KEITH KRACH, UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE, ECONOMIC GROWTH, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT: By the way, it's so great to be back on your show, Maria. You know, now as leading economic diplomacy for United States state department, after all those years.BARTIROMO: Well, we go back. I interviewed you when you were the CEO of Ariba, you were the CEO of DocuSign. I remember you and I spending time on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.KRACH: Yes.BARTIROMO: And you were there building these companies. You just told me how well Ariba's doing and DocuSign as well, congratulations.KRACH: Well, thanks so much. I appreciate. And now it's just a great privilege to give back to the country that has given so much to my family and me.BARTIROMO: Especially at this moment in time where there's this big fight over Huawei and over China and what China is doing. Assess the story for us, first. Put it in context in terms of what the threats are around China.KRACH: Yes. Well, I think the threats are -- you know, they are playing the long game. They're playing for keeps. They're playing a four dimensional game of military, diplomatic, economic, cultural chess.BARTIROMO: They want to be number one in all of that.KRACH: They've stated that. Global dominant super power. So --BARTIROMO: So you're working on economic security for this country.KRACH: Yes.BARTIROMO: How do we do that? How do we stay secure when you've got all these countries coming at us, in particular, China, the most aggressive?KRACH: Yes. Well, I look at it as a three-pronged strategy. So the first one is really to -- it's the American model of freedom and pro-growth and innovation and optimism because a lot of these countries are looking at China's model versus the American model.And I mean, what a great time because results speak for themselves when you look at all those metrics, the great job President Trump has done.The second one is really leveraging the innovation of the resources of the private sector. This is where I think the greatest opportunity lies, at least in my mind.And then the third one is further strengthen our relationships with our allies, partners and friends. And really build a trusted economic growth network of like-minded nations, companies, and civil society.BARTIROMO: To make sure the world understands the threat that China represents, to have allies around this issue.But I want to get back to the private sector. Because you come from the private sector, this is something that you know really well and yet you've got resistance from, well, the resist movement.Look what happened at Oracle and the Silicon Valley protest. Oracle employees walking out yesterday over founder Larry Ellison's fundraiser for President Trump.This is another example of this ongoing fight over the Pentagon's JEDI Cloud contract awarded to Microsoft. Google originally had the contract, it dropped out due to employee protests, political tensions are high.I mean, what do you do in a situation where you know that there is certain companies that you need to work with? That -- I mean, the jewel of Google is their A.I. business and their A.I. business is sitting there in Beijing.You know, and then you've got these protests. We don't want to work with the department. Look what happened at Oracle, how do you deal with that?KRACH: Well, you know, one of the things that I did right at the beginning of the year, I hosted Secretary Pompeo in Silicon Valley and we talked about the China challenge. We talked about military, civilian fusion. We gave some examples. We actually had everybody go around the room and tell their China story.And, you know, in Silicon Valley we always say corporate responsibility is social responsibility. But it's also corporate responsibility is national security.BARTIROMO: Definitely.KRACH: And the threats to democracy are real and urgent and the threats to the companies are real and urgent because the Chinese government wants to - - wants to put -- particularly the high tech companies out of business.BARTIROMO: Yes, and not only that, but they want to learn everything they can from us.I had Andy Purdy on the other day, the chief security officer at Huawei who continues to deny that there are back doors in Huawei equipment. And I've said this now for years. I keep sparring with Andy Purdy saying I have evidence that you guys settled with a number of companies because you stole their trade secrets and because there were back doors. With those back doors going right to the Chinese Communist Party, right?KRACH: And by the way, anybody who comes from the software business or high tech business knows that not only there's back doors, but there's a front door every few days because they're always updating software.You know, that's one other things as we go out, we talk to government officials. And you know, they say, hey, it's going to be so expensive to do this upgrade. We sign the deal. No back doors. We're just going to put them on the edge.It comes down to, Maria, who do you trust? Because there's that front door every day and by the way, also there's the National Intelligence Act in China that says any company, state owned or otherwise, or any citizen has to turn over any information proprietary technology, intellectual property, data or genetics to the Communist Party, the PLA and the government upon request or suffer the consequences.BARTIROMO: Well, hopefully the corporate sector understands this, keeping - -BARTIROMO: Welcome back. You asked, I'm answering. Usually I'm the one asking the questions but the tables have turned. Every Friday I'm answering your questions from social media. So let's get started.The first question, what region and/or town in Italy does your famiglia di Bartiromo come from? My father's family including my grandfather Carmine Bartiromo came to this country in 1906. He came from the town of Nocera in Naples.First thing he did was help allies and served in the World War I. Then he came back to the U.S. and settled in Brooklyn. He built a restaurant in Brooklyn named it the Rex Manor after the ship, the Rex which was a possible -- a popular ship for transporting Italians from Italy to America.He built the restaurant, the Rex Manor, there it is, on the 60th and 11th avenue in Brooklyn. That was my first job, I was the coat check girl at the Rex.My mother's family on the other hand came from Sicily. They arrived earlier than the Bartiromos. My mother's grandparents came in nine -- in 1898 from Agrigento, Sicily. They also settled in Brooklyn and they bought a house that my mom eventually grew up in in Brooklyn.I visited my grandmother's old neighborhood in Agrigento a few years ago with my sister to see my friend who lives there. Sicily is so beautiful. There's my mom and I right there.Next question this morning, what equity or stock mutual fund was your first investment? My first individual stock ownership was Turner Broadcasting stock which at that time was the owner of CNN. That was my first job in television after my internship at WMC Radio. I was happy to own it in my 401-k as well as individual shares when it was acquired by Time Warner years later after I was long gone.You've seen my CNN internship I.D. card back in the day. I stayed there five years before moving to CNBC, and then Fox.I want to hear from your -- from you all the time. Please send me your questions through Instagram and Twitter or @MariaBartiromo. I'll be answering a new round next Friday. Thank you so much for those questions. We'll be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.

All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 7ALength: 764 wordsByline: Justin SteeceBodyThere are many things in life a person should worry about -- what to eat tonight or how to get that bill taken care of. But what if you were trapped at home while a highly infectious virus was spreading through your city of 11million people? What thoughts would go through your head?I am a 26-year-old American living in Wuhan, China, with my wife and our newborn son. I came to China in November 2018 to be with my then-girlfriend and future wife, Li Ling. My initial reasons for coming to China were simple: Explore a new country, marry the woman I love, help her get her paperwork done so we can finally go back to America, and start a family.Well, things got complicated. Ling became pregnant,  which made our schedule busier and delayed our ability to get meetings with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which we needed to get her a visa.Now, we're stuck in Wuhan while the coronavirus makes its way around the city, China and the world. According to Chinese officials, more than 300 people have died since December. The World Health Organization has dubbed it a global health emergency.Luckily, my son, Colm, was born safely in early January. However, this posed a predicament. The Chinese government started putting out more and more information about the spread of the disease through various news organizations, and our expatriate group on WeChat (a popular social media and messaging app in China) diligently posted articles as soon as we could get them. Since my wife delivered our son through a cesarean section, she has spent the past few weeks recovering, and it will still be quite a while before she's up to full strength and able to move around.Mass quarantineOn Jan. 23, we heard that Wuhan is being locked down, and that the government is launching a mass quarantine. This means there is no transportation in or out of the city. Public transportation like the metro, buses and flights from the airport have all been shut down. We are essentially trapped.When the news about the lockdown initially hit, many of the foreigners here started stocking food ahead of time. We knew that most shops would have a rush of people trying to buy up everything they could to last for the next few weeks -- but I did not expect the shelves to be so bare. When I went out just days before the lockdown to buy some simple vegetables to go with my already-stocked dry and canned food, almost everything was sold out. People were carrying big carts of food home, full of whatever they could carry.Now, we sit and wait, unable to leave. The government is telling us to be calm and resolute during this time.The Chinese people I know and see have had mixed reactions. Most are fairly calm and not worried about contracting the coronavirus. A few are worried, and others are actively spreading false rumors to try to mislead people.The other expats and I are a little disappointed. The government apparently knew about this virus since early December but really underreacted and only alerted the world about the outbreak on Dec. 31. They just talked calmly and let everyone lead their lives, only reacting when things got out of hand.There are about 1,000 U.S. citizens in Wuhan, and Washington evacuated 195Americans last week, but the process has been confusing.$1,000 per personI first heard about the evacuation flight from the WeChat group, and I was told that Americans who do not work with the U.S. Consulate had to pay $1,000 per seat. Sadly, my wife and I were not able to get on this flight, not only because she is not an American citizen and is still recovering from her surgery, but also because they would not allow my son to board the flight. Because of the city's lockdown, my son does not have any paperwork showing he is a U.S. citizen.I won't leave Wuhan without my family or get evacuated to America without them because of some minor paperwork, and $3,000 is a lot to ask one family to pay to leave. At least one other flight is being planned, according to the State Department, but information about the flight is not clear.I am a little afraid, because I am the only one who can leave the house to get essential supplies every few days. I would be devastated if I were to get sick and spread the infection to Ling or Colm. This is not just what I worry about, but what many of the American expats here are worried about. We care about our country and are trying to help others while still helping our families.Justin Steece is an American working as an online English teacher in Wuhan, China.

Beijing endorses Mastercard's electronic payment unitCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 12, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 530 wordsBodyMastercard obtained Chinese government approval to enter the country's electronic payment services market, 17 years after the sector was theoretically opened for the first time to foreign investors.In a statement, China's central bank and banking regulator noted that the U.S. card application to launch a joint venture with a local company was approved.Securing china's delayed access to the China market for Mastercard, Visa and American Express was a key target for Donald Trump administration officials during the "phase one" trade talks of the two countries, which they gave as resulted in a preliminary trade agreement last month.Accelerating approvals for U.S. card companies was one of the provisions of the 90-page agreement.Under the terms of the pact, China said it would formally rule on requests from U.S. card companies within one month of filing. Mastercard, Visa and American Express are specifically quoted in the text of the agreement.US executives have long complained that the People's Bank of China refused to accept their applications to start operating in the country.In 2012, the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled in favor of an US lawsuit challenging China's de facto ban on foreign payment providers, stating that the market should have opened when the country joined the WTO in December 2001 However, Beijing ignored the ruling.Early last year Financial Times reported that the central bank refused to recognize applications filed by Mastercard and Visa more than a year earlier.Visa is still awaiting a decision on your application, but Chinese financial regulators confirmed that they were reviewing an American Express application that is likely to be approved.In its statement Tuesday night, the People's Bank of China said it will be "open, fair and impartial" as it continues to open up the bank card market. Privately, Chinese officials say they were prepared to grant US card companies market access by the end of 2017, but President Trump's decision to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese imports in 2018 made it politically impossible for Beijing to do so.Most U.S. tariffs—and retaliatory tariffs imposed by Beijing—remain in place pending a new round of negotiations expected this year or 2021. Earlier this month, however, China's Finance Ministry said it was halved rates on some of its retaliatory tariffs, as agreed in last month's deal.During the nearly two decades that foreign card companies have waited to enter the Chinese market, the competitive landscape of the country's electronic payments sector changed dramatically.The groups will face an entrenched state monopoly, China Unionpay, which was established after China's entry into the WTO.Alibaba and WeChat dominate the industryCredit and debit cards account for less than 15 percent of all online payments made in China; the Asian country is estimated to have 8.2 billion bank cards in circulation, 90 percent of them are debit. Instead, the industry is dominated by e-wallet services provided by technology companies Alibaba and WeChat, which own more than 60 percent of the market.Despite initial approval, Mastercard has yet to wait for the final decision of theAuthorities.Load-Date: February 13, 2020End of Document

Rutgers community weighs in on discrimination due to coronavirusDaily Targum: Rutgers UniversityFebruary 10, 2020 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 757 wordsBodyRutgers community weighs in on discrimination due to coronavirusFebruary 10, 2020 12:00am|By Aparna RagupathiPhoto by Wikimedia |The Daily TargumCasey Xu, a School of Arts and Sciences sophomore, said many Chinese students wear masks to stay healthy, not because they are already sick.University President Robert L. Barchi sent an email on Thursday to staff and faculty addressing student claims of discrimination related to the spread of the novel coronavirus.University administration learned that some Chinese and international students have faced inappropriate questioning by faculty and staff about their health and exposure to the virus, Barchi said in his email. He asked that staff and faculty hold to values of respect, diversity and inclusion during this time."Faculty and staff have no right to a student's private medical information, and I ask that you not question them," he said. "It is also not permissible to require documentation from a healthcare provider to attend or return to class."Casey Xu, a School of Arts and Sciences sophomore, said he has not experienced stereotyping or discrimination at Rutgers but has seen offensive comments on social media outlets like Instagram."People think not allowing Chinese people to come can solve the problem. I mean in some ways it really can, but I'm feeling offended," he said.These comments, he said, are not from the Rutgers community but from people around the Rutgers area."I think they are talking about the general situation in America. I can understand that worry," he said.Xu said he would describe Rutgers as a family that does not discriminate against anyone."That's one reason I feel loved in the Rutgers community. My friends, my teammates, they are not trying to stay away from me (due to) the coronavirus," he said.With students and faculty from all over the world, Barchi said that faculty and staff should treat students with care."Our community includes thousands of students from China, many of whom may be experiencing anxiety about this illness because they have friends and family in the affected region of that country," he said. "I ask that you be sensitive and respectful in supporting your students. Stereotyping students or others (due to) their ethnicity is not only unlawful, (but also) it is a violation of University policy and goes against our values as an inclusive community."Some students from Wuhan, China, said Yuhui Xiao, a School of Arts and Sciences first-year, have pledged to distance themselves from others despite not being affected by the coronavirus."The thing is I don't know what's going on either," Xiao said. "But (what) I do know is that those students who came back from Wuhan made an announcement in our WeChat group chat. They said they will isolate themselves while having class. People shouldn't be afraid of them."Barchi said, staff and faculty are responsible for creating a supportive climate for students. The University, he said in the email, is working to assist students affected by this situation with concerns related to courses, housing and dining.In his email, Barchi also said that faculty and staff should not assume a student is sick if he or she is wearing a mask.Xu said there is a misunderstanding of why some students wear masks."I think that's different thoughts between Chinese students and American people," he said. "For the students, they are not sick, they are worried about being infected so they wear the mask to prevent the virus. For other people, they think the reason why Chinese students wear masks is because they are sick."Xu said he wore a mask once to his church's Sunday service to be safe in a public area, but because people thought he was sick, he has not worn a mask since then."Anyone may get sick, so please don't isolate the Chinese or anyone who is connected to China. Your discrimination against the patients will make them ashamed of themselves," Xu said. "Your discrimination may let them hide the illness or reject protecting others."Xu said he feels the Chinese government is trying their best to shut down a difficult virus."We are fighting against the virus, not the Chinese," he said. "The more the emergency arises, the more need for calm, humanity and unity."Everyone can make a little change to combat the coronavirus, Xu said."Remember to wash your hands frequently, use your elbows to cover when sneezing or coughing," he said.In his email, Barchi said that there are no actual or suspected cases of coronavirus at Rutgers and there is no need to interrupt daily life.Load-Date: February 10, 2020End of Document

TikTok says it will explicitly ban Holocaust denial and other conspiracy theories denying violent eventsBusiness Insider USJanuary 8, 2020 Wednesday 07:10 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 726 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Isobel Asher Hamilton)Highlight: TikTok appears to be trying to sidestep moderation problems that have plagued large social media companies like Facebook and YouTube.Body• TikTok released an updated set of community guidelines on Wednesday.• Its rules now explicitly ban "content that denies well-documented and violent events have taken place." This includes Holocaust denial, and other similar conspiracy theories.• TikTok appears to be trying to sidestep moderation problems that have plagued large social media companies like Facebook and YouTube.• Last year internal documents leaked by The Guardian showed that TikTok moderators were directed to remove content likely to upset the Chinese government, including mentions of Tiananmen Square.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.TikTok released a new set of updated community guidelines on Wednesday, and among them is a rule explicitly banning content that "denies well-documented and violent events have taken place."The rule falls under the "hateful ideology" section in the new guidelines, and would apply to Holocaust denial, a TikTok spokesman confirmed to Business Insider.How social media companies deal with conspiracy theories rooted in bigotry has become a thorny issue for social media companies.In a 2018 interview Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he wouldn't ban Holocaust denial on Facebook. "I find [Holocaust denialism] deeply offensive. But at the end of the day, I don't believe that our platform should take that down because I think there are things that different people get wrong. I don't think that they're intentionally getting it wrong," Zuckerberg said.Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesZuckerberg's stance has drawn sharp criticism from civil rights organisations like the Anti-Defamation League, and continues to do so.            Actor Sacha Baron Cohen attacked Zuckerberg in a speech at the ADL late last year. "We have, unfortunately, millions of pieces of evidence for the Holocaust - it is an historical fact. And denying it is not some random opinion. Those who deny the Holocaust aim to encourage another one," Baron Cohen said.YouTube has also struggled with deluges of conspiracy theories proliferating on the site. It wasn't until June last year that YouTube put an explicit ban on Holocaust denial.  And right-wing YouTuber Alex Jones was sued by the parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre,            after peddling conspiracy theories on his show that the attack was a hoax. YouTube            subsequently booted Alex Jones from its site, and the conspiracy videos are no longer visible.TikTok also confirmed that its new rule would also apply to Sandy Hook conspiracies.By including this line in its community guidelines TikTok appears to be setting itself apart from older Silicon Valley behemoths like Facebook and YouTube.However, TikTok has had its own problems with historical erasure.Last year The Guardian viewed guideline documents for TikTok moderators that directed them to remove content that could upset the Chinese government, including mentions of Tiananmen Square and the Cambodian genocide. TikTok is owned by Chinese company ByteDance.Responding at the time, TikTok said the guidelines in question were outdated, and it had taken a "blunt approach to minimizing conflict" in its early days.Reports of Beijing-friendly censorship is one of the elements of TikTok's Chinese ownership which has placed it in the crosshairs of US lawmakers. TikTok has been making concerted attempts to reassure America,            publishing its first ever transparency report last week and claiming it received more censorship requests from the US than from China in 2019.Enforcing the new guidelines and actually monitoring the app for conspiracy theories may also be tricky. A spokesman declined to say how many moderators TikTok deploys, and would only say that the number has grown over the past year.Do you work at TikTok? Got a tip?

From The Daily: Don't panic over coronavirus outbreakMichigan Daily: University of Michigan-Ann ArborFebruary 6, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 951 wordsBodyFrom The Daily: Don't panic over coronavirus outbreakThursday, February 6, 2020 - 11:57am- Buy this photo-The Michigan Daily Editorial Board -As of Thursday morning, the New York Times reported that there are 12 cases of the coronavirus in the United States, including six cases in California and two in Chicago. The announcement came after the first confirmed U.S. case arose in Washington State over two weeks ago. While the illness has barely made its way to the U.S., the lack of understanding surrounding the Wuhan coronavirus's contagion and cure has placed the issue at the forefront of American consciousness. This attention, compounded with a 24-hour news cycle, has captured the West's attention for days on end. While media coverage can often over-dramatize public health crises like this one, The Michigan Daily Editorial Board believes this attention remains especially imperative given China's opaque nature in discussing the thousands of cases within their country. A report from the Washington Post recently said the Chinese government has quarantined over 35 million people. The same article referenced several public health experts worried that these drastic measures will serve to undercut the trust between the Chinese population and its public health officials, a move that could prevent those infected from receiving the correct education and treatment. While the American media may be overreacting to the few confirmed cases within U.S. borders, their over-coverage may prove important in accumulating the most accurate information possible if the Chinese government continues to operate with a lack of transparency.  While accurate coverage is important, University of Michigan students and the Ann Arbor community alike should keep in mind the warnings of public health officials to avoid any apocalyptic predictions and hysteria, as "Americans should not worry for their own safety." In typical fashion, social media has had a significant response, with a plethora of memes about the virus populating Facebook and Twitter feeds. While humor can be a coping mechanism, this memetic social media reaction could contribute to misinformation and undue panic. More locally, the University has responded to the outbreak in an official capacity, issuing a travel restriction on the entire country of China and cautioning U-M affiliates to avoid all non-essential travel to the area. While these diligent responses are meant to protect the U-M community, it is important to maintain the line between "urging vigilance without inciting panic." As a diverse and global institution, we must avoid any rhetoric or practices that forcefully divide Asian-American students or any other members of the U-M community. While the disease may not seem like an immediate threat to the U.S., we should keep in mind the many real lives being impacted by the outbreak, making an effort to be attentive to our community rather than alienating.This certainly is not the first time we have seen such widespread hysteria over a novel disease. In 2003, Severe Acute Respiratory System , another member of the coronavirus family, caused similar panic when 29 of the 8,098 reported cases occurred in the U.S. - yet none of these patients died. Similarly, panics over Bird flu, Ebola virus and Zika virus have all garnered significant media coverage and societal alarm. In each instance, reported cases in the U.S. composed a small minority of worldwide infections and deaths. The coverage of Wuhan coronavirus seems to be following this trend. It seems panic is often generated over the most new and noteworthy diseases - not necessarily the most dangerous ones. On the other hand, the common flu kills an average of 35,000 people each year, hospitalizing about 200,000. In 2018, the flu took its highest toll in 40 years, causing 80,000 American deaths. These numbers serve as a reminder that we should always be diligent about protecting our health against both newsworthy and seemingly mundane illnesses. The defenses are relatively simple: disinfect porous surfaces, avoid touching your face and wash your hands frequently. Additionally, everyone who is able should be proactive in receiving the flu vaccine every year. U-M offers flu shots at walk-in clinics for students, faculty and staff throughout the fall and early winter, or through appointment at UHS.Finally, it's important to keep in mind that the greatest threats to human health in America are much less newsworthy than the Wuhan coronavirus or other infectious diseases. Chronic illnesses have a significant impact in the U.S., with heart disease and cancer being the leading causes of death by a significant margin. Unfortunately, the defenses to these health issues aren't as simple as good hygiene. A more structural reform will be necessary to tackle these causes of death, one involving health policy, nutrition, insurance markets and more. Every time a hot-button disease makes headlines, it's important to keep in mind the less glamorous reality of health in the U.S., and what we should be doing to improve it.Regardless of novelty, everyone should always take public health seriously. Good hygiene, proper hand-washing and updated flu shots may feel like small acts on the individual level, but when taken in context of a larger population, these simple habits are exceptionally powerful in keeping everyone healthy - especially those with pre-existing conditions that place them at higher risk for health complications due to illness. We as the Michigan Daily Editorial Board urge the U-M community to stay informed for updates on the coronavirus and use the illness as an opportunity to check in with our regular public health habits. Load-Date: February 7, 2020End of Document

The European Union agreed to restrict access by "high-risk" suppliers to future 5G networksCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 29, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 719 wordsBodyMember States of the European Union (EU) undertook to restrict the participation of suppliers considered "high risk" in the deployment of future 5G mobile networks in Europe, as part of a series of measures supported on Wednesday by the European Commission (EC).This approach also includes the ability to perform "necessary exclusions" to effectively reduce risks in "key" elements, defined as "critical and sensitive," such as basic network functions, management and site functions, or network access functions.While no mention of any particular company in this agreement, Huawei had a positive assessment of these new EU "unbiased" guidelines regarding the deployment of 5G, as published by AFP on its Twitter account.It should be recalled that yesterday the European Commissioner for Industry, Thierry Breton, had anticipated that the European Commission would not, in principle, exclude the Chinese manufacturer Huawei from the development of the 5G network in the bloc, although it would set strict rules, as a measure of protection."It's not about discriminating, it's just about setting rules. They will be strict, demanding and we will obviously welcome in Europe all the operators who want to implement them," Breton told MEPs.Huawei had a positive assessment of these new "unbiased" EU guidelines regarding the deployment of 5G, as posted by AFP on its Twitter account. (REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration) (RUVIC/)Yesterday the British government authorized the limited participation of "high-risk providers" in the development of 5G. In this regard, it was clarified that these companies will be excluded from the 'central' and sensitive parts of high-speed mobile internet networks, as reported by the ministry in charge of the digital sector at the end of a meeting of the National Security Council (NSC), composed of a handful of ministers and chaired by Johnson.After this development spread, Huawei claimed to be "reassured by the British government's confirmation that we can continue to work with our customers to continue the 5G" rollout in the country. For its part, the US said it was disappointed with the UK's decision.Huawei already participates in the 4G network offered by several operators, including BT, Vodafone and Three. And with this decision, London allows you to participate in non-strategic infrastructure but excluding you from the most sensitive areas through which customer data flows. The British government also limited the presence of these providers to "no more than 35% on the periphery of the network."The risks associated with Huawei's participation in the 5G deployment, according to the United StatesThe United States has expressed more than one occasion concern about the possibility of a Chinese company like Huawei advancing the 5G deployment. "There can be no trust when sellers are subjected to secret manipulations by a government authoritarian as that of the People's Republic of China, which lacks an independent judiciary and a rule of law that prevents misuse of data," warn from an official government publication.The same text states that no technical arrangement can mitigate the risks involved in including Huawei or ZTE equipment in any segment of the5G infrastructure. It is mentioned there that there are other companies like Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung that have "excellent equipment and competitive costs and are not subject to the whim of authoritarian regimes".The country ruled by Donald Trump warned on several occasions that using teams of companies in China anywhere on 5G's infrastructure poses risks to national security, privacy, critical infrastructure and human rights.In fact, the United States has for many months demanded that European countries, and in particular the United Kingdom, exclude Huawei from its networks, claiming its close ties to the Chinese government and the risk of espionage that this would entail, something that the company has always Denied. The United States, Australia and Japan have already excluded it from their territories, but, as you can see, European countries do not have such a sharp view on this issue.(With EFE and AFP information)MORE ON THIS THEME:Why a 5G network held by Huawei is dangerousHow 5G will change our livesTech Trends for 2020: Quantum Supremacy, 5G and the Fight Against MisinformationLoad-Date: February 26, 2020End of Document

In snub to US, Britain will allow Huawei in 5G networksAssociated Press InternationalJanuary 28, 2020 Tuesday 6:45 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 964 wordsByline: By KELVIN CHAN and DANICA KIRKADateline: LONDON BodyLONDON (AP) - Britain decided Tuesday to let Chinese tech giant Huawei have a limited role supplying new high-speed network equipment to wireless carriers, ignoring the U.S. government's warnings that it would sever intelligence sharing if the company was not banned.Britain's decision is the first by a major U.S. ally in Europe, and follows intense lobbying from the Trump administration as the U.S. vies with China for technological dominance.It sets up a diplomatic clash with the Americans, who claim that British sovereignty is at risk because the company could give the Chinese government access to data, an allegation Huawei denies."We would never take decisions that threaten our national security or the security of our Five Eyes partners," Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said, referring to a security arrangement in which Britain, the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, share intelligence. "We know more about Huawei and the risks that it poses than any other country in the world.''The decision was awkward for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who risks the fury of one of Britain's closest allies at just the moment it needs the Trump's administration to quickly strike a trade deal after Brexit. Britain officially leaves the European Union at the end of the week, and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is due to pay a two-day visit starting Wednesday to meet with Johnson and Raab to reaffirm the tran-Atlantic relationship.A senior Trump administration official said the U.S. is disappointed by the decision, adding that the U.S. government would work with the U.K. on a "way forward" that leads to the exclusion of "untrusted vendor components" from 5G networks. The official was not authorized to comment on the sensitive diplomacy between longstanding allies and spoke on condition of anonymity.In its decision, the British government said it was excluding "high risk" companies from supplying the sensitive "core" parts of the new fifth-generation, or 5G, networks. The core is the brain that keeps track, among other things, of smartphones connecting to networks and helps manage data traffic.But Britain will allow high risk suppliers to provide up to 35% of a carrier's less risky radio network, based on factors including the amount of data traffic and the number of base stations.The announcement did not mention any companies by name but said "high risk vendors are those who pose greater security and resilience risks to U.K. telecoms networks" - a clear reference to Huawei.Huawei said it was reassured by the "evidence-based decision," portraying it as a victory. Executives said 35% of a market would be a good result for most companies."We need to have strong competition to make sure the consumer can enjoy the best possible technologies," Vice President Victor Zhang said on a conference call with reporters.By giving Huawei limited access, Johnson's government is attempting to thread a path between the U.S. and China, analysts said."In truth the U.K. had little room to manoeuvre," said Emily Taylor, CEO of Oxford Information Labs, a cyber intelligence company. The decision "seeks to carve an acceptable middle ground that will keep various contending forces happy," she said, noting that British wireless carries have already been using Huawei gear for 15 years.The 5G technology is expected to drive the next wave of innovation, transmitting massive amounts of data from more objects and locations. It would, for example, help make possible self-driving cars or remote surgery.Huawei is the top global supplier of mobile networks, and it's considered a cost-effective and high-quality alternative to its main rivals, Finland's Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson.The United States says that China's communist leaders could, under a 2017 national intelligence law, compel Huawei to carry out cyberespionage. The U.S. has threatened repeatedly to cut off intelligence sharing with allies that use Huawei."Here's the sad truth: our special relationship is less special now that the U.K. has embraced the surveillance state commies at Huawei,'' said U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. "During the Cold War, Margaret Thatcher never contracted with the KGB to save a few pennies.''With 5G, U.S. officials also worry that because the "core" will run extensively on software, it could be nearly impossible to spot an accidental vulnerability or a malicious "backdoor" among millions of lines of computer code. Huawei denies the allegations, saying there's never been any evidence it is responsible for a breach.For Britain, the 5G infrastructure program is considered critical as it leaves the EU and aims to position its economy to benefit from technological innovation.The government said Tuesday it is taking some steps that will allow it "to mitigate the potential risk posed by the supply chain and to combat the range of threats, whether cyber criminals, or state sponsored attacks.'' The plans include encouraging smaller suppliers such as South Korea's Samsung and Japan's NEC to enter the British market.The government will draft legislation to make the security requirements mandatory. In the meantime, cybersecurity officials will advise wireless carriers, some of whom have already installed Huawei 5G-capable gear that exceeds the 35% cap, on how to comply.Mobile phone companies said they were analyzing the decision. Vodafone, which uses Huawei for parts of its radio network but not in its core, said that using multiple suppliers "is the best way to safeguard the delivery of services to all mobile customers."___Associated Press Writer Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this story.___Follow the AP's coverage of technology at: https://apnews.com/apf-technologyLoad-Date: January 29, 2020End of Document

THE LAUGHABLE "SECURITY" JUSTIFICATION FOR CRACKING DOWN ON BIRTH TOURISMStates News ServiceJanuary 23, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 871 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Cato Institute:By David BierThe U.S. Department of State announced a new rule for tourist visa applicants today: prove you're not going to give birth in America. The rule will not protect national security, will create more fraud and crime, and will cost America people who will contribute productively to this nation.The tourist visa statute allows noncitizens to visit the United States for "pleasure," which State has always interpreted to mean "legitimate activities of a recreational character, including tourism, amusement, visits with friends or relatives, rest, medical treatment, and activities of a fraternal, social, or service nature."""in other words, most anything. But now, "The Department is revising the definition of 'pleasure'" (p. 2) to exclude giving birth in the United States.The State Department asserts that the "rule addresses concerns about the attendant risks of this activity to national security."The previous regulation failed to address the national security vulnerability that could allow foreign governments or entities to recruit or groom U.S. citizens who were born as the result of birth tourism and raised overseas, without attachment to the United States, in manners that threaten the security of the United States.The State Department not only doesn't present any evidence that this is occurring or has ever occurred, but it doesn't even explain what the threatening "manners" might be that could somehow harm America. It can't even imagine a hypothetical scenario to give flesh and bones to nightmare. The evidence that it does provide is that "Birth tourism companies advertise their businesses abroad by promoting the citizenship" related benefits of giving birth in the United States" (emphasis added). In other words, these are capitalist enterprises led by the market, not governmental efforts led by foreign security agencies.I have dug through hundreds of national security and terrorism cases over a 30" year period to identify the origins of the offenders, and not a single case that I have reviewed followed this fact pattern.The State Department lists the following reasons for people choosing to give birth in the United States:obtaining a second citizenship for their child, the perceived low" cost medical services available to women in the United States, the lower cost of obtaining U.S. citizenship through birth tourism than through a U.S. investor visa, and the perceived guarantee of a better socioeconomic future for their child.Not included on this list: developing stealth agents to (somehow) undermine America.It's also interesting that the State Department didn't include the evasion of China's 1-child/ 2-child policy. One woman named Liou said in 2015 that she only came to the United States to "skirt China's one" child policy" and will return to China after giving birth. The reason is that the child limit only applies to children born in mainland China. A Shanghai reporter assessed the situation this way in 2011:American journalists continue to generate stories about birth tourists from China, most often explaining them as seekers of the American dream. They rarely touch on what the Chinese people, and their media, know is a leading cause of the phenomenon: an attempt to evade the Chinese government's population controls.This explains why""as I described in 2015out" of" county births to mainland Chinese have spiked all around the world, not just in the United States. You would think that the State Department would want to treat people thwarting Chinese totalitarianism as potential allies, rather than threats. Obviously, these women choose to give birth in the United States rather than elsewhere because they believe their children could benefit from having the option to come and live here, but it takes a bizarre sort of nativist paranoia to see this aspiration for the American dream as a threat rather than an opportunity.The State Department cites a few instances of birth tourism companies defrauding immigrants, hospitals, and property owners, but those actions are already illegal and this rule does nothing to stop fraud. Indeed, by banning this activity, this rule will inevitably push the industry underground and lead to more fraud. Far from protecting women seeking to give birth here, it will place them in much more vulnerable situations.This rule has no justification other than a desire to keep out foreigners. Indeed, it repeatedly cites the fear that parents of the child could eventually receive green cards when their children reach adulthood. That's not a fear any reasonable person would treat as a security threat. In fact, the State Department notes that the birth tourists are hoping their children will eventually return to contribute to America. How is this a problem?The State Department is denying the public the ability to comment on the rule before it becomes finalized""as all other rules must do""because it wants to avoid having to "respond publicly to pointed questions regarding foreign policy decisions." It must be nice to have the power to harm the lives of tens of thousands of peaceful people, all without the fear of having to answer any questions about it.Load-Date: January 24, 2020End of Document

Virus: Hong Kong researchers say number of cases exceeds 40,000CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJanuary 27, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 642 wordsBody       Hong Kong researchers said today that mathematical models estimate that the number of cases of the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is higher than 40,000 and that governments should take severe measures to restrict population movements.                                  Scientists at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) have warned of an accelerated spread of coronavirus, which has killed 80 people in China and affected 2,744 others.The number of suspected cases doubled within 24 hours to nearly 6,000."We need to prepare for the fact that this particular outbreak is becoming a global epidemic," said Gabriel Leung, head of HKU's research team."Important and draconian measures to limit population movements should be taken as soon as possible," he said.Ma Xiaowei, head of the National Health Commission (CNS), which is considered a ministry in China, said on Sunday that the new virus has an incubation period of up to two weeks and that contagion is possible during the incubation period, that is, even before the ntomas appear.Based on mathematical models of the spread of the virus, Leung's team argued that the actual number of infections was much higher than the evaluation of the authorities, which only takes into account the formally identified cases."The number of confirmed cases with symptoms was expected to be between 25,000 and 26,000 in Chinese New Year (which was celebrated on Saturday)," Leung said at a press conference in Hong Kong today, based on theoretical curves.By including people who are in the incubation period and who do not yet have symptoms, "the number reached 44,000" as of Saturday, the investigator said.Gabriel Leung added that the number of infections could double every six days, peaking in April and May in areas that already face an epidemic, while acknowledging that effective public health measures can reduce the contagion rate.The epicenter of the disease remains in Wuhan and Hubei province, but cases have also been found in the country's major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou."We hope to see these other major cities as hot spots of the epidemic," the investigator said.As these cities are regional and international transport centers, it is "very likely" that the virus will spread further away from these new outbreaks.The virus has already been detected in a dozen countries, even in North America and Europe, through people who have arrived from Wuhan.In an effort to contain the virus, the Chinese Government on Saturday expanded the health cord around Wuhan, which now includes nearly 20 cities, with the consequence of isolating a population of 56 million people.Leung said the confinement is "absolutely correct", while noting that these measures "may not be enough to change the course of the epidemic in other major cities."The HKU School of Medicine team is one of the World Health Organization (WHO) collaborating centers for infectious disease control.In addition to mainland China, cases of infection have also been reported in Macau, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, the United States, Singapore, Vietnam, Nepal, Malaysia, France, Australia and Canada.China has already extended the Lunar New Year holiday for three days until February 2 to discourage travel and trycontain the spread of coronavirus.Mongolia, which shares a long border with China, decided today to close road crossing points with this country to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.Some countries, such as the United States, Australia, Sri Lanka, Japan and France, are preparing with the Chinese authorities to withdraw their citizens from Wuhan, where two dozen Portuguese are also located.The government Portuguese advised "non-essential travel" to China and admitted the withdrawal of Portuguese from Wuhan if the measure is feasible in the light of public health rules.Load-Date: January 28, 2020End of Document

Railway Supply Institute Issues Public Comment on DOT NoticeTargeted News ServiceFebruary 20, 2020 Thursday 5:19 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1583 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, Feb. 20 -- Nicole Brewin, vice president for government and public affairs at the Railway Supply Institute Inc., has issued a public comment on the Department of Transportation's notice entitled "Request for Information: National Freight Strategic Plan". The comment was posted on Feb. 18, 2020:* * *The Railway Supply Institute (RSI), on behalf of itself and its member railway suppliers, submits these comments in response to the invitation from the Department of Transportation to the public to provide input on the development of a National Freight Strategic Plan. RSI is a trade association representing more than 200 companies involved in the manufacture of products and services in the freight car, tank car, locomotive, maintenance-of-way, communications and signaling, and passenger rail industries. America's railway suppliers represent a $74 billion/year industry supporting more than 125,000 American workers.Rail suppliers serve as a critical component to the railroad industry, and our economic impact on the communities in which we manufacture our products is vitally important. From rail cars and tracks to signals and switches, the railway supply industry has been a vital and dynamic part of the U.S. economy for over 200 years. Railway suppliers play an essential role in supporting the rail system here in the U.S. and have done so since the origin of U.S. railroads in the early 1800's. In 2017, the North American railroad system comprised more than 1.6 million railcars powered by more than 38,000 locomotives over more than 140,000 miles of rail. Nearly every piece of this intricate puzzle was shaped and put into place by railroad suppliers for their railroad customers. Today, the rail industry is leading the transportation world in technological advancements and has embraced digitization and the Internet of Things (IoT). Such technology has generated significant improvements in operational safety and network efficiency and much of it was developed and driven by the railway supply community. Beyond this support of the railroad system, the railway supply and manufacturing industry is essential to the national economy--generating value for the economy, stimulating jobs, and contributing taxes.The railway supply industry represents American innovation at its best. Through investment in the research and development of new technologies, the rail supply industry has helped their railroad customers become one of the nation's safest industries. RSI supports regulatory reforms that encourage the growth, innovation and jobs that are necessary for a robust and safe rail industry. Our member companies are constantly seeking to solve problems for their railroad customers and look forward to continuing our working relationship with them and the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) as we advance the development of innovative technologies.The adoption of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 dramatically altered the provision of rail services in the United States, enabling railroads to invest significant amounts in their people and core infrastructure. This has led to substantial improvements in safety and a stronger rail network while prices have gone down on an inflation-adjusted basis. As railroads have made significant investments in their infrastructure, investments in the non-railroad owned railcar fleet have also grown to meet the transportation needs of both railroads and shippers. Today, the replacement value of the non-railroad railcar fleet is estimated to be in excess of $100 billion as more than 70% of the 1.6 million railcars in North American are owned by non-railroad companies. The current boxcar fleet has shrunk by 33% in the last 10 years, and thousands more cars are projected to fall out within the next five. We encourage the car owners, shippers and railroads to explore changes to the current car-hire system that would incentive continued investment in new railcars.RSI strongly supports an infrastructure package that helps to improve the safety, reliability and productivity of the nation's transportation system. The federal government should authorize a longterm surface transportation authorization act, with funding from predictable, dedicated and sustainable sources for the Highway Trust Fund (including the Mass Transit Account). This legislation should include increased capital investments in our intercity passenger rail system and with investments designed to improve the efficient movement of freight through public-private partnerships. Continuation of policies helping to sustain significant private sector investment in our nation's privately-owned freight rail systems is also vital.In addition, RSI believes that the federal government should explicitly recognize and incentivize digital infrastructure applications as part of eligible public investments to provide better reliability, efficiency, and lengthen the life of rail assets. These applications should advance rail and transit automation for both commuter and intercity passenger rail, and intermodal applications including seaport-rail network connections where appropriate. Today's rolling stock manufacturers and rail technology suppliers offer IoT platforms to virtually monitor, analyze and predict rail operations for smarter, safer and more reliable systems. By incentivizing the increased deployment of the "Internet of Trains," commuter and intercity passenger rail operators can bring their operations into the digital era. Public benefits include reduced unplanned downtime, improved operational efficiency, better business planning, improved performance, as well as energy savings. Digitalizing rail operations that receive federal funds is the single best way to maximize the use of public funds granted to localities and take advantage of technologies that have already been widely deployed by America's privately-owned railroads.Another federal program that is extremely important to RSI members and domestic manufacturer's is the Buy America program. The Buy America program was created to promote U.S. manufacturing and help the domestic economy by creating jobs for Americans and maximizing the use of American-made materials. By design, Buy America laws were written to ensure that taxpayer dollars made available for constructing and sustaining our public transportation systems would flow back into the U.S. economy and discourage the outsourcing of these manufacturing jobs to other countries. Unfortunately, RSI believes that the USDOT currently lacks adequate resources to ensure strict compliance with Buy America provisions. Congress and USDOT should work together to ensure stricter oversight to help keep grant funding in the United States and spur the domestic jobs critical to maintaining a strong American manufacturing base. Allowing the Federal Transit Administration to conduct audits in-house would help ensure better consistency and efficacy of this important program.While our members have a strong presence across the United States, they also market their products around the world and have complex global supply chains that support their manufacturing operations. Over the past few years, our members have witnessed increased government intervention in the global rail marketplace specifically from Chinese State-Owned Enterprises (SOE).National Security threats cannot be negotiated down or tabled for later discussion. In order to protect the security interests of the U.S., RSI supports swift implementation of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2020 provision barring mass transit agencies from using federal funds for purchasing rail cars or buses from Chinese-owned or Chinese-domiciled companies and requiring that any transit operator must develop and execute a plan for identifying and reducing cybersecurity risks, should they receive federal dollars. Any increased reliance on China-based manufacturing and strategic materials would worsen U.S. vulnerabilities to a supply disruption and Chinese government tampering with delivery of critical products and services as well as jeopardizing American manufacturing jobs.In closing, RSI continues to seek dedicated investment in infrastructure, balanced economic regulation, and the promotion of domestic manufacturing to drive American innovation. We are encouraged by the interest shown by the Administration to bring America's transportation systems into the 21st century. We are also pleased with the Administration's effort to scrutinize existing and proposed regulations to ensure they do not unduly burden industry and hamper economic growth.We look forward to working with DOT as we continue to look for ways to innovate, enhance and promote investment in rail infrastructure and our national freight system.Thank you for consideration of our comments to the request for information.

Weekly RoundupJim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUSFebruary 14, 2020 Friday 5:14 PM EDTCopyright 2020 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 11322 wordsByline: Jim Cramer and the AAP TeamHighlight: Stocks grind higher as investors shrug off coronavirus worries.BodyMarkets continued to grind higher this week, ahead of the three-day holiday weekend, shrugging off coronavirus concerns and the continued momentum of Democratic nominee hopeful Bernie Sanders. While there is no denying that traditional valuation metrics are being stretched at current levels, the U.S. economy continues to show signs of expansion and the Fed remains supportive of growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell offered little reason to believe the Fed's dovish stance will change in the near-term given his commentary on Capitol Hill this week.Additionally, while certain companies and sectors may be feeling the pain from the impact of the coronavirus, money has flooded into the high flying cloud/Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) stocks as they are for the most part, insulated from China, exposed to the secular shift toward cloud computing and largely generate sales in the form of recurring subscriptions, providing a safe haven for those seeking reliable earnings streams -- even if it means paying up more than usual for those earnings streams, or in many cases, potential earnings streams.The other trend taking place, in addition to seeking out names insulated from the coronavirus, is that the market appears to be in the mode of valuing not only earnings but adding a "magnitude of the beat premium" on top of earnings expectations for those names that have a history of surprising to the upside. This is a dynamic we delved into deeper in our Nvidia  earnings follow up,  . While we analyzed Nvidia in particular, we believe the same trend can be applied to many of the stocks in today's market that have historically looked expensive on forward valuations when using out year estimates, only to appear cheap in hindsight when the actual results come in.Ten-year Treasury yields remain around the 1.5% level while gold prices hover in the upper-$1,500s. The dollar index is sitting at roughly the 99 level, while WTI oil prices hold in the lower-$50s per barrel area.We're in the heart of fourth-quarter earnings season. Within the portfolio, we heard from CVS Health  , Cisco  , PepsiCo  and Nvidia.CVS Health reported a solid top- and bottom-line beat with its fourth-quarter results. Revenues of $66.9 billion (+22.9% year over year) topped the consensus of $63.97 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $1.73 (-19% YoY) exceeded the consensus of $1.68 per share.For the full year 2020, management expects consolidated total revenues of $261.97 billion to $265.48 billion, up 2.0% to 3.5% YoY, representing a strong forecast compared to consensus forecasts of $256.845 billion. Adjusted operating income is expected to increase 1.25% to 2.75% YoY to $15.53 billion to $15.76 billion. This translates to adjusted EPS in the range of $7.04 to $7.17, up 3.0% to 5.0% YoY when calculated against a 2019 baseline EPS of $6.83, which excludes net realized capital gains and favorable prior years' development of approximately $0.25 per share. We note that growth rate is favorable to the outlook originally provided at the June Investor Day.At a midpoint of $7.105, this EPS guidance is on the lighter side compared to consensus of $7.15. However, as we said earlier in the week in our Alert  , we think there is an element of conservatism at play and we think this can be a beat-and-raise story throughout 2020. What gives us this confidence? Look no further than to how management guided 2019. Around this time last year, management said they expected to do $6.68 to $6.88 in adjusted earnings per share in 2019. This outlook was not even in the stratosphere of the $7.41 consensus at the time. But after steady beat and raises with every quarter, the company delivered $7.08 in 2019, well ahead of the top range of their initial guidance.From a quarterly perspective, management said on the call that they will no longer provide guidance and instead will focus on directional color and insights. This decision might give investors some pause, but the 2020 outlook plus directional color should be enough. For the first quarter, management expects it will be the lowest earnings quarter of the year due to seasonality in both Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC.Cisco Systems reported a top- and bottom-line beat with its fiscal second quarter 2020 results. Revenue of $13.20 billion (-4% YoY) edged past the consensus of $11.974 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of 77 cents (+5% YoY) beat the consensus by a penny.For the third quarter of fiscal 2020, revenue is expected to decline in the range of 1.5% to 3.5% year-over-year to about $12.5 billion to $12.76 billion -- in line with Street estimates of a 2.5% decline to about $12.616 billion. Moving through guidance, adjusted gross margins are expected range from 64.5% to 65.5% (vs. the Street's expectation of 64.9%) with an adjusted operating margin rate of 32.5% to 33.5% (vs. Street 32.9%). All of this leads to an adjusted earnings-per share guidance in the range of 79 cents to 81 cents, bracketing the consensus of 80 cents.PepsiCo reported a top- and bottom-line beat with its fourth-quarter results. Revenues of $20.64 billion (+5.7% year over year) topped the consensus of $20.27 billion, and earnings per share of $1.45 (-2.5% constant currency year over year) exceeded the consensus by one penny. In addition to the solid earnings beat, organic revenue growth of +4.3% exceeded consensus expectations in the range of +3.5% to +4.0%. For the full year 2019, PepsiCo delivered organic revenue growth of 4.5%, the fastest rate of growth since 2015 and well above 2018's +3.7% figure.For 2020, management expects full year organic revenue growth of 4% compared to street expectations of +4.1%. The core effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21%. Core constant current EPS is expected to increase 7%, and approximately $11 billion is expected to be generated from operating activities with $6 billion in free cash flow. Also, management expects to return $7.5 billion in cash to shareholders -- $2 billion in repurchases and $5.5 billion in dividends.Based on a one percentage point foreign exchange translation headwind and the above guidance, management expects 2020 core earnings per share to be $5.88, up 6% compared to 2019 core earnings per share of $5.53. That $5.88 number is lighter than the current Street consensus of $5.96, however we are pleased to see PepsiCo return to EPS growth following 2019's reinvestment year.Nvidia reported a top- and bottom-line beat with its fiscal fourth quarter 2020 results. Revenue of $3.105 billion (+41% YoY) outpaced the $2.964 billion consensus, while adjusted earnings per share of $1.89 (+136% YoY) blew past expectations of $1.67 per share. On the margin front, Nvidia outperformed its own guidance with adjusted gross margins coming in at a strong 65.4% (+940bps YoY, +13obps QoQ), a solid beat vs. prior guidance of 64.5% +/-50bps.In the upcoming quarter management expects revenue in the range of $3 billion +/-2%, which at the midpoint is well ahead of the $2.849 billion consensus coming into the quarter. Moreover, while management acknowledged that the full effect of the coronavirus outbreak is "difficult to estimate," the guidance provided was cut down by $100 million compared to what it would have been in an attempt to factor in the outbreak.As for margins, management expects adjusted gross margins for FY1Q21 to come in the range of 65.4% +/- 50bps, a strong forecast vs. the 63.95% consensus heading into the print. Adjusted operating expense guidance of $835 million, better than the $901 million expected, however, up slightly from fourth-quarter's adjusted operating expenses of $810 million, which was roughly in line with the $811 million we were looking for.EconomyOn Thursday, The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) advanced 0.1% in January on a seasonally adjusted basis, missing expectations for a 0.2% monthly advance following December's 0.2% monthly gain. Over the last 12 months the CPI has increased 2.5% before seasonal adjustment, exceeding the 2.4% consensus and representing an acceleration versus the 2.3% rate seen in December. Notably, the annual increase was the largest since the 12-month period that ended October 2018.The core CPI, which excludes food and energy costs due to their volatility, rose 0.2% in January, matching expectations of 0.2% and following a 0.1% advance in December. Over the past 12 months core CPI has risen 2.3%, exceeding expectations for a 2.2% increase and on par with the annual advances seen in October, November and December. See  for our full analysis.Also on Thursday, the Department of Labor reported that initial jobless claims for the week ending February 8 were 205,000, an increase of 2,000 from the previous week's revised level of 203,000 (revised up from 202,000), and 5,000 claims below expectations of 210,000. Importantly, the four-week moving average for claims (used as a gauge to offset volatility in the weekly numbers) was 212,000, unchanged from the previous week's revised average (revised up from 211,750). The low rate of layoffs reflects a strengthening labor market as claims have remained below 300,000 - the threshold typically used to categorize a healthy jobs market - for an incredible 257 consecutive weeks, the longest streak for weekly records dating back to 1967. The previous longest stretch ended in April 1970 and lasted for 161 weeks. For the official weekly release, please see  .On Friday, The U.S. Commerce Department reported Friday that retail and food-services sales advanced 0.3% in January to $529.8 billion, matching expectations, following a 0.2% increase in December. On a monthly basis, excluding auto sales, retail sales were up 0.3%, also matching expectations. Excluding autos and gas, sales were up 0.4% in January, a tick above expectations for a 0.4% increase. Core retail sales were unchanged in January, missing expectations for a 0.3% advance. See  for our full analysis.Also on Friday, the Federal Reserve announced that industrial production fell 0.3% in January, missing expectations for a 0.2% monthly decline. Compounding the miss, December's reading was revised lower to indicate a 0.4% decline (from -0.3% previously reported). Capacity utilization on the other hand was in-line with expectations, coming in at 76.8% in January. Total industrial production is down 0.8% from the same time last year, while capacity has grown by 2.0% annually. See  for our full analysis.(Note: T is the most recent period, T-1 is the prior period's reading and T-2 is two periods back, the intent being to illustrate any trends)OilOn the commodity front, oil prices remain in the low $50s as global oil demand remains under pressure from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak which continues to take a heavy toll on the Chinese economy, with the IEA  1Q20 to be the first quarterly demand contraction in over 10 years and OPEC downwardly revising its 2020 oil  causing  between the cartel and Russia, as the latter is hesitant to deepen production cuts.On the domestic front, on Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), reported that in the week ending February 7, U.S. stockpiles (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) increased by 7.5 million barrels to 442.5 million barrels, a bearish reading versus expectations for a 2.99 million barrel increase. Additionally, U.S. production ticked back up to all-time highs of 13.0 million bpd. Lastly, net imports increased by 806,000 bpd as imports increased by 363,000 bpd, while exports decreased by 443,000 bpd. See  for the full report.Lastly, we note that the spread between WTI and Brent sits at around the $5 per barrel level. Recall, this is a key metric as the wider the spread, the more attractive US based crude (WTI) becomes to foreign buyers, though we note that strength in the dollar can offset this effect as foreign buyers convert their home currencies to the dollar.StocksIn the portfolio this week, we added to our position in Tyson Foods TSN (  ), General Electric GE and Costco COST (  ).Moving on to the S&P 500, fourth-quarter earnings season is underway, with 71.1% of companies reporting a positive EPS surprise. For the fourth quarter, earnings growth is up roughly 0.9% year over year vs. expectations for an overall 0.8% advance throughout the season; for the 281 non-financials that have reported, earnings are down 0.5%. Revenues for the S&P 500 are up 2.9% vs. expectations throughout the season for a 2.79% increase; 71.1% of companies beat EPS expectations, 20.1% missed the mark and 8.7% were in line with consensus. On a year-over-year comparison basis, 68.80% beat the prior year's EPS results, 28.57% came up short and 2.62% were virtually in line. The best performing sectors so far have been Information Tech, Consumer Services and Healthcare, while the worst performing have been Industrials, Energy, Real Estate.Next week, 88 companies in the S&P 500 will report earnings. Within the portfolio, we will hear from ViacomCBS VIAC on Thursday before the opening bell.Other key earnings reports for the market include: Walmart (WMT), Medtronic (MDT), Fluor (FLR), Ecolab (ECL), Leidos (LDOS), Wabtec (WAB), Expeditors Intl (EXPD), Advance Auto (AAP), Westlake Chemical (WLK), Athene Holding (ATH), Vulcan Materials (VMC), JELD-WEN (JELD), Bloomin Brands (BLMN), GSX Techedu (GSX), Crestwood Equity Partners (CEQP), Allegion (ALLE), TransUnion (TRU), Tower Semi (TSEM), InMode (INMD), Nutrien (NTR), Ternium S.A.

Price Change: 2.04%; Yield: 1.61%INVESTMENT THESIS: Strong underlying performance with an achievable (and beatable) 2019 organic sales growth expectation in the 6.5% to 7.5% range. The company boasts high-performing franchises in Medical Devices (with strong growth in Diabetes Care) and Diagnostics (with strong gains in Core Laboratory), while Nutrition and Established Pharmaceutical remain strategic parts of its total portfolio. We believe the company's opportunities for upside rest with additional Libre uptake, the Alinity U.S. launch, and an expanded indication of the MitraClip. We believe in CEO Miles White and the Abbott management team, which has a strong track record of integrating acquisitions and delivering double-digit earnings per share growth. Lastly, Abbott has plenty of financial flexibility to pursue mergers/acquisitions and other strategic actions.

While the we await further details, this new development, regardless of the ultimate outcome, does not alter our view on shares as we maintain that with or without this contract, AWS remains the public cloud leader and we continue to view cloud computing as a secular growth trend. 1-Wk. Price Change: 2.67%; Yield: 0.00%INVESTMENT THESIS: We believe upside will result from Amazon's continued Commerce dominance, AWS' continued leadership in the public cloud space, and ongoing growth of the company's advertising revenue stream, which feeds off Amazon's eCommerce business. Additionally, we believe profitability will continue to improve as AWS and advertising account for a larger portion of total sales as both these segments sport higher margins than the eCommerce operation. And while we believe the increasing share of revenue from these higher margin businesses will be key to driving profitability longer-term, we believe margins on ecommerce stand to improve as the company's infrastructure is further built out and economies of scale further kick in. The embedded call option is that management is always looking to enter a new space and generate new revenue streams. Target Price: Reiterate $2,300; Rating: OneRISKS: High valuation exposes the stock to volatile swings, eCommerce has exposure to slower consumer spending, competition, management is not afraid to invest heavily, potential headwinds resulting from new eCommerce regulation in India, management is not scared to invest aggressively for growth, which can at times cause volatile reactions as near-term concerns arise relating to the impact on margins.ACTIONS, ANALYSIS & MORE:  ,  ,  ,  ,   ,   (1/10/19), , AbbVie  ; $94.05; 1150 shares; 3.45%; Sector: HealthcareWEEKLY UPDATE: none 1-Wk.

Despite the incredible selling strength of this product, investors have shied away from this name due to Humira's lost patent protection in Europe and risk in the United States in 2023. Key to the AbbVie's future is the acquisition of Allergan, a deal that will diversify the company's revenue stream and give it exposure to Medical Aesthetics, neuroscience, and eye care, while also increase operating cash flow. Lastly, the company pays a high yielding dividend that we believe is supported by the balance sheet and well covered by the cash flow.

Key drugs include Eliquis, which has a best-in-class profile and is used to prevent strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation; Opdivo, a drug designed for people with previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer; Orencia, which is used for the treatment of adult rheumatoid arthritis; Sprycel, which is used to treat certain types of leukemia; and Yervoy, which is used to treat certain types of skin cancer. That in mind, the big, "control your own destiny move" the company made was the Celegene deal. From a financial perspective, the deal is expected to achieve greater than 40% accretion in the first full year with roughly $800 million in synergies in 2020, 2021, and 2022.

The strength of this model has created an incredible loyal customer base with low churn and continued share gains in both brick and mortar and e-commerce. And this is a global concept, evidenced by the strength of sales both in the U.S. and abroad, which includes an emerging China opportunity.

We believe the new CVS Health will transform into a diversified pharmacy/healthcare retailer that is integrated with a managed care operation, creating a more personalized and analytic-based experience that all patients will want.

We appreciate Culp's quick, aggressive work on the balance and see General Electric transitioning to offense from defense in the years ahead. Business wise, though exposed to Boeing's 737 Max program we view General Electric's Aviation business as an industry leader.

Additionally, while the analysts concede that problems in China (think the coronavirus) may impact operations in the area and lead to share price volatility, they ultimately justify their view stating, "Over the longer-term, the company has been able to produce a low-double-digit total shareholder return model." On another note, we would also call out that on the PepsiCo conference call, CEO Ramon Laguarta mentioned "we continue to see very strong performance in our coffee business, and our partnership with Starbucks is more robust than ever." Bottom line, while the near-term may be rocky given the dynamic in China, the company's key growth region, we believe patience will ultimately be rewarded as the underlying business remains healthy and management continues to execute on those factors within their control -- including by  to fix customer service issues at airport locations, which Jim has called out previously as being one of the few places where a Starbucks experience could use a good deal of improvement. 1-Wk.

The company has a broad portfolio of products and brands like Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, Ball Park, Wright, Aidells, IBP and State Fair. We think this company will be one of the biggest winners of the Phase One trade deal with China because of the country's pledge to increase imports U.S., and more specifically, its need for more pork (and substitutes like Chicken) to offset falling supplies related to the African Swine Flu.

This deal is a marriage of the second largest sports property in the U.S. (CBS Sports Digital) with a leading book operator.

On the synergy side, management expects to deliver an estimated $500 million in annualized run-rate cost synergies within 12-24 months of the merger closing date, and we think there is room for upside here in both value size and timeline.

Price Change: 1.54%; Yield: 0.95%INVESTMENT THESIS: While we acknowledge that near- to- midterm performance remains heavily influenced by iPhone sales, we believe longer-term upside will come as Services revenue grows its share of overall sales. Services provide for a recurring revenue stream at higher margins, a factor that serves to reduce earnings volatility while allowing for a higher percentage of sales to fall to the bottom line, as a result, we believe that Services growth and the installed base, are much more important than how many devices the company can sell in a given 90-day period. In addition to improved profitability we also believe the transparent nature of this revenue stream will demand an expanded price-to-earnings multiple as segment sales grow. Furthermore, we believe that Apple's desire to push deeper into the healthcare arena will help make its devices invaluable as more life-changing features are added and the company works to democratize health records. Lastly, also see upside resulting from increased adoption of wearables (think the Apple Watch) and potential new product announcements such as an AR/VR headset or an update on project Titan, the company's secretive autonomous driving program.

In addition to strong title launches, we continue to view Activision Blizzard as being at the forefront of the esports industry (though we place little emphasis on this in the near-term as esports profitability remains a longer-term story) thanks to significant investments in the Overwatch league and decision to launch a Call of Duty league in calendar year 2020. Finally, compounding the improving company-specific fundamentals, we believe the industry-wide shift toward digital downloads and in-game monetization to be a material factor that will aid in margin expansion overtime.

It monetizes its platforms and delivers targeted advertisements across all major demographics at a high ROI. Although revenue is expected to decelerate as the company transitions its monetization emphasis to Instagram Stories from Facebook's NewsFeed, and there are additional risks to margins related to increased OpEx spending, we believe both processes have become well understood by investors at this point. Plus, we think future growth opportunities exist through increased monetization of the WhatsApp and Messenger verticals. While critics claim the member base has become disengaged, Facebook's first quarter results showed trends have held with daily active users (DAUs) of 1.56 billion and monthly active users (MAUs) of 2.375 billion.

Price Change: 2.68%; Yield: 0.00%INVESTMENT THESIS: We believe that while Search and digital ad dominance is what will carry shares in the near- to- midterm, longer-term it is the company's artificial intelligence (AI) "moat" that will provide for new avenues of growth. AI is what has made the company's Search, Video (YouTube) and targeted ad capabilities best-in-class and is the driving force behind the company's success in voice (Google Home) and autonomous driving (Waymo). Furthermore, we believe it is this AI expertise that will also make the company more prevalent in other industries, including healthcare via subsidiary Verily, as AI and machine learning continue to disrupt operations across industries. We believe Alphabet's willingness to invest in new areas, knowing most will fail, is a recipe for long-term success as while most "  " projects may fail, every once in a while, you end up with a Waymo, perhaps the division's, most successful graduate to date. Lastly, compounding out positive view of the company's future opportunities, we believe that Alphabet's free cash flow generation and solid balance sheet set it apart and are what will allow the company to continue taking chances on far-out ground-breaking and potentially world changing projects.

Meanwhile, the firm has delivered consistent improvements to its return on equity and return on tangible common equity metrics-which are drivers of a premium over book price-while tangible book value has continued to grow. Another reason why we think the share price deserves a greater premium is because of management's emphasis on fee-based, or more recurring, revenue streams. At the end of 2018, 61% of Goldman's revenues were fee-based, up from 48% in 2013. The firm's tangible book value per share as of the end of the second quarter 2019 is $203.05.

We initiated our position shortly before the Spring--Home Depot's "Holiday season" --expecting the company to outperform expectations. Longer term, management's 2020 financial targets include sales to increase to the range of $115 billion to $120 billion, with operating margins in a range of 14.4% to 15% and return on invested capital of more than 40%.

According to the report, which cited people familiar with the matter, this business could get a sale price as a high as $2 billion. We think it makes sense that management may part with this business because sales have lagged during the past few quarters due to weaker volumes. Plus, we know management is currently emphasizing digitization and software sales, making personal protective equipment a possible non-core asset. If a deal is made, we are interested in learning what management plans to do with all that cash because the market wants to see CEO Darius Adamczyk make a signature acquisition despite his discipline to current market multiples. 1-Wk. Price Change: 3.15%; Yield: 1.99%INVESTMENT THESIS: Following a 2018 year when the company spun off two businesses, we believe the new Honeywell is worthy of a premium to its peer group as it has become less cyclical and more focused with stronger organic sales growth trends. The two segments we remain most positive on for their long-term growth profiles are Aerospace and Safety and Productivity Solution, as both stand to benefit from strong secular trends. Additionally, we appreciate management's ability to drive operational improvements in areas such as margin and free cash flow.

Price Change: 4.27%; Yield: 0.47%INVESTMENT THESIS: We believe upside will result from the secular shift toward digital payments and a growing "network effect" as acceptance rates of digital payments increase among merchants. In line with this view, we also believe the shift to ecommerce to be a tailwind as online purchases inherently require some form of digital payments. In the near-term we also expect a tailwind to result from the coming release of the Apple Card as MasterCard was selected as the card's payment processing platform. Furthermore, we value MasterCard for the strong three-year Performance Objectives management laid out on their fourth quarter 2018 and full year 2018 financial results conference call.

Additionally, we believe the Cavium deal was a big step in the company's transformation while the acquisition of Aquantia, a leader in Multi-Gig Ethernet connectivity, will help in broadening Marvell's connectivity solutions portfolio and capitalizing on the future of high-speed networking requirements in cars that are needed to enable autonomous, electric, and safety/security applications.

While companies may look to build out multi-cloud environments, Microsoft's Azure offering will be a prime choice thanks to the company's decision to provide the same "stack" used in the public cloud, to companies for their on-premise data centers. Additionally, we would note that hybrid environments are currently the preference for most companies because it allows them to maintain critical data in house while taking advantage of the agility and scalability provided by public clouds. Outside of the cloud opportunity, we maintain a positive view on the company's growing gaming business, which we believe is becoming an increasingly prominent factor in the Microsoft growth story as gaming becomes more mainstream, management works to convert its gaming revenue from one-time license purchase to a recurring subscription model and as technologies like augmented/virtual reality evolve. Finally, as it relates to LinkedIn and other subscription-based services such as O365 and various Dynamics products, we continue to value them highly for their recurring revenue streams, which we remind members, provides for greater transparency of future earnings.

The Global Wireless M2M/IoT MarketPR NewswireFebruary 4, 2020 Tuesday 5:05 PM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1268 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, Feb. 4, 2020 BodyPR NewswireThe analyst estimates that the global number of cellular IoT subscribers increased by 70 percent during 2018 to reach 1.21 billion at the end of the year - corresponding to around 13 percent of all mobile subscribers. Until 2023, the number of cellular IoT subscribers is forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 49.4 percent to reach 9.03 billion at the end of the period. During the same period, cellular IoT network revenues are forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34.4 percent from (EURO) 6.7 billion in 2018 to approximately (EURO) 29.4 billion in 2023. Meanwhile the monthly ARPU is expected to drop to (EURO) 0.27. Read the full report:https://www.reportlinker.com/p05794604/?utm_source=PRNEast Asia was the largest region with 848.0 million IoT subscribers at the end of 2018, far ahead of Western Europe and North America with 157.6 million and 111.7 million respectively. Altogether the main regions accounted for over 95 percent of the global installed base. Latin America, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Russia & CIS had in the range of 19-32 million cellular IoT subscribers each, while Africa, Middle East, Central Eastern Europe, and Australia & Oceania were in the span 7-19 million. China is the world's largest market for cellular IoT connectivity services by volume. According to operator subscriber data, the installed base grew by 124 percent year-on-year to reach 767 million at the end of 2018. This corresponded to 63 percent of the global installed base. The spectacular numbers reported by the domestic mobile operators leave no doubt that China is leading the global adoption of massive IoT. The country has surpassed Europe and North America in terms of penetration rate - 54.7 IoT connections per 100 inhabitants at the end of 2018 - and is on track to reach 1 billion IoT connections during 2019. The Chinese government is actively driving adoption as a tool for achieving domestic and economic policy goals, at the same time as the private sector implements IoT technology to improve efficiency and drive innovation. Berg Insight believes that the role of the government is the main explanation for why China is ahead of the rest of the world in the adoption of IoT. Like other advanced economies, the country has widespread adoption of connected cars, fleet management, smart metering, asset monitoring and other traditional applications for cellular IoT. It has also given rise to new consumer services enabled by connectivity like bike sharing. The most distinctive characteristic of the Chinese IoT market is however the way that the government is systematically using new technology to implement its vision for urban life in the 21st century. China Mobile is the world's largest provider of cellular IoT connectivity. At the end of 2018, the operator reported 551 million IoT connections and a year-on-year growth rate of 141 percent. China Unicom and China Telecom ranked second and third with 110 million and 106 million connections respectively. Vodafone ranked first among the Western operators and fourth overall with 81 million connections, followed by AT&T in fifth place with 51 million. Verizon, Deutsche Telekom and Telefónica had in the range 25-35 million cellular IoT connections. Softbank/Sprint and Telenor were the last players in the top ten with 21 million and 17 million connections respectively. Year-on-year growth rates for the mentioned operators were in the span 20-35 percent, except for Softbank/Sprint that only grew 3 percent. IoT connectivity revenues are growing at a considerably slower rate than the number of connections. Berg Insight's analysis of the IoT business KPIs released by mobile operators in different parts of the world suggests that global IoT revenues increased by around 19 percent during 2018, while the monthly APRU dropped by 30 percent. Excluding China, the trend was less dramatic with revenues growing by 16 percent and ARPU declining 7 percent. Indeed, there is a negative correlation between growth in connections and monthly ARPU as the bulk of net additions are cost sensitive devices. Verizon reported the highest IoT revenues of (EURO) 1.4 billion (US$ 1.6 billion) in 2018 and the highest monthly ARPU of an estimated (EURO) 3.65. Around 60 percent of sales derived from the Verizon Connect fleet management and telematics business. China Mobile ranked second with yearly IoT sales of (EURO) 964 million but had the lowest monthly ARPU of just (EURO) 0.21. Vodafone and AT&T were not far behind. Annual IoT revenues for the Vodafone group in 2018 were approximately (EURO) 830 million, with a monthly ARPU of (EURO) 0.82. AT&T does not report IoT revenues but is believed to have generated approximately (EURO) 750-800 million. The Internet of Things is weaving a new worldwide web of interconnected objects. At the end of 2018, approximately 1.3 billion devices were connected to wide area networks based on cellular or LPWA technologies. The market is highly diverse and divided into multiple ecosystems. This report will focus on the four most prominent technology ecosystems for wide area IoT networking - the 3GPP ecosystem of cellular technologies, the emerging LPWA technologies LoRa and Sigfox and the 802.15.4 ecosystem. The 3GPP family of cellular technologies support the biggest ecosystem in wide area IoT networking. Berg Insight estimates that the global number of cellular IoT subscribers increased by 70.0 percent during 2018 to reach 1.2 billion at the end of the year - corresponding to around 13.0 percent of all mobile subscribers. Yearly shipments of cellular IoT devices increased by 76.2 percent in 2018 to reach 651.9 million units. Growth was fuelled by an exceptional market expansion in China, where the installed base of cellular IoT connections increased by 124.1 percent year-on-year to reach 767.0 million at the end of 2018. The cellular IoT technology landscape is in a phase of rapid transformation. Developments in China accelerate a global shift from 2G/3G to 4G technologies. As the initial focus for 5G will be high-bandwidth applications, Berg Insight believes that 4G will become the preferred platform for IoT in the foreseeable future. The move from 2G to 4G began in North America with 3G as an intermediate technology. The region has seen rapid uptake of LTE CAT-1 since 2017 and CAT-M starting in 2018 at the same time as GPRS and CDMA are fading away. Europe began to see adoption of LTE CAT-1 in 2018 and is now followed by an accelerated uptake of LTE-M and NB-IoT in 2019/2020. China is moving fast from GPRS to NB-IoT in the mass-market segment and cumulative NB-IoT shipments are expected to exceed 190 million units by the end of 2019. At the same time there will also be fast-growing demand for LTE CAT-1 and LTE- M, as well as LTE CAT-3+. 2G and 3G will be in steady decline in all developed markets with demand shifting to developing countries with limited availability of 4G networks. The analyst expects that 5G will become commercially available for verticals such as automotive in 2020.Read the full report:https://www.reportlinker.com/p05794604/?utm_source=PRNAboutReportlinkerReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

Hickey: DOJ Actively Pursuing Chinese Economic Espionage CasesThe FrontrunnerJanuary 9, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: WASHINGTON NEWSLength: 141 wordsBodyThe Washington Times (1/8, A1, Gertz, 492K) reports that the "technology theft and other illicit activities" by Chinese spies and government officials are being prosecuted by the Justice Department's special China, according to Adam Hickey, Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the national security division. According to US officials, China "was implicated in more than 80% of all economic espionage cases" brought by the Department since 2012, and "more than 60% of all trade secrets theft cases were linked to Beijing's aggressive spying and acquisition programs." Hickey told the Times, "It's an objective fact that the number of economic espionage investigations has increased dramatically in recent years. ... That could be a function of us seeing more or the private sector reporting more. It also could suggest that China is doing more."Load-Date: January 9, 2020End of Document

DAILY PRESS BRIEFING BY THE OFFICE OF THE SPOKESPERSON FOR THE SECRETARY-GENERAL JANUARY 27, 2020States News ServiceJanuary 27, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 3724 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyThe following information was released by the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC):The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today's noon briefing by Stephane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General.Good afternoon.**Holocaust RemembranceEarlier this morning, the Secretary-General spoke at the UN's Holocaust Memorial Ceremony, which this year marks the seventy-fifth anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau camp.The Secretary-General spoke of the recent resurgence of antisemitic attacks around the world, saying that our solidarity in the face of hatred is needed today more than ever. He said we need to name this phenomenon for what it is: there is a global crisis of antisemitic hatred; a constant stream of attacks targeting Jews, their institutions and properties. He also drew attention to the initiatives designed to counter such hatred, including the UN Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech that he launched last year and the UN Plan of Action of Safeguarding Religious Sites.The Secretary-General added that new surveillance technology can also be abused by both Governments and corporations to enable discrimination and deny people of their rights. He said the High-Level Panel on Digital Cooperation had recommended actions to safeguard human rights in the digital age, which will include working with partners to develop standards for fair, accountable and transparent artificial intelligence.On Saturday, the Secretary-General also spoke at Park East Synagogue, on the Upper East Side, here in New York, which he has visited every year since becoming Secretary-General, and in his remarks there, he stressed that "The United Nations stands with you every day, together with many people around the world who believe that an attack on one is an attack on all."**Press ConferenceAnd also, I just wanted to flag that due to scheduling considerations and issues, we are postponing the Secretary-General's press conference by a week, and we will see you next Tuesday, in a week, on [4] February, for the press conference.**SyriaTurning to Syria, the UN remains deeply concerned about the safety of over 4 million civilians in north-west Syria, over half of whom are internally displaced, following reports of ongoing air strikes and shelling over the weekend.The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reports that over 1,500 civilians in the north-west of Syria have been killed since April, when the current military escalations began, including over 430 children and 290 women.Since 1 December, an estimated 389,000 people have been displaced. That's an increase of more than 30,000 since last week. The vast majority, about 80 per cent of those people who are being displaced, are women and children.The latest displacement compounds an already dire humanitarian situation on the ground in Idlib, where more than 400,000 people were displaced between the end of April and the end of August, many of them multiple times.We continue to call for a cessation of hostilities and urge all parties, and those with influence over the parties, to ensure the protection of civilians, the protection of civilian infrastructure, and that's in line with their obligations under international humanitarian law.**LibyaTurning to Libya, the UN Human Rights Office, in a new report today on the air strikes last July on the Tajoura detention centre in Libya, renewed its call on all parties to the conflict in that country to conduct independent, impartial and thorough investigations to ensure accountability for the violations of international law.The report concurs with previous UN findings that the air strikes were likely conducted by aircraft belonging to a foreign State, noting that, "it remains unclear whether these air assets were under the command of the Libyan National Army (LNA) or were operated under the command of that foreign State in support of the LNA". The report quote "calls on all parties, as well as any States supporting either party, to conduct investigations in the air strikes with a view to ensuring the swift prosecution of those responsible."Over the weekend, the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) deeply regretted the continued blatant violations of the arms embargo in Libya, even after the commitments made in this regard by concerned countries during the Berlin Conference.The UN Mission said that over the last 10 days, numerous cargo and other flights have been observed landing in Libyan airports in the western and eastern parts of the country, providing the parties with advanced weapons, armoured vehicles, advisers and fighters. The UN mission condemns these ongoing violations, with a risk of plunging the country into a renewed and intensified round of fighting.Meanwhile, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Libya, Ghassan Salame, is currently in Tunisia, holding meetings in preparations of the security track and the political tracks of the peace process.**CoronavirusAnd on the coronavirus, I wanted to flag that the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr. Tedros [Adhanom Ghebreyesus], arrived in Beijing today.He is expected to meet with senior Chinese Government officials to discuss the coronavirus outbreak.WHO has stressed that we have a chance to get ahead of the virus if we all work together. It has provided advice to countries on how to identify and care for people sick with the virus, as well as those individuals and how individuals can protect themselves and others. You can find information on the WHO's website.**ColombiaAnd a new report from Colombia on the situation of children and armed conflict concludes that the peace agreement between the Colombian Government and the FARC-EP (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People's Army), which contained child protection provisions, contributed to a significant decrease in violations committed against boys and girls.Ms. Virginia Gamba, the Secretary-General's Special Representative on this issue, commended the Government of Colombia for its efforts to protect boys and girls, but, she pointed out that more than 3 years after the signature of the peace agreement, children continue to be exposed to grave violations as other groups are occupying the space left by the withdrawal of the FARC-EP.More information online.**Democratic Republic of CongoAnd also, we have an update on the measles outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Although case incidence showed a decreasing trend in December, the cumulative number of cases and deaths has continued to increase, with over 6,000 deaths reported last year.Cases of measles continue to be reported in all 26 provinces, including the provinces of Ituri, North Kivu and South Kivu, which are also affected by the Ebola outbreak. The majority of measles cases 75 per cent of those cases are impacting children under the age of 5.The emergence of new cases is likely a result of persisting gaps in the vaccination coverage, which needs to be scaled up accordingly. Forty million dollars are needed urgently, in order to extend the vaccination to children over 5 and to reinforce outbreak response activities beyond vaccination.Another reminder to vaccinate when you can.**MadagascarAnd in Madagascar, last week, following heavy rain and flooding, caused by a tropical disturbance, there has been an impact to 107,000 people, and caused at least 31 deaths. More than 16,000 have also been displaced.The Government is leading the response, with support from the UN and humanitarian partners who have mobilized and pre-positioned stocks to assist people affected by the floods.**TurkeyAnd as you may have seen, over the weekend, we issued a statement, where the Secretary-General said he was deeply saddened by the loss of life and destruction of property in the wake of an earthquake in the Elazig province of Turkey. And that statement was shared with you.**Questions and AnswersMr. Bays?Question: Couple of questions. First, a clarification, you say the Secretary-General can't be with us tomorrow because of a scheduling conflict. Can you tell us, is he in New York at 12:30 tomorrow? And what is he doing?Spokesman: There is the global town hall meeting with staff and other issues, which may run over, and there are other issues that have come up.Question: But these were... that was pre-planned, wasn't it? I mean, it raises the question that the only problem is that he's scheduled to give a news conference on the same day as the Middle East peace plan and would face some difficult questions. [cross talk]Spokesman: I think the Secretary-General is experienced and can face difficult questions.Question: Okay. My question is on the Middle East peace plan. Has the Secretary-General been given an advanced copy by the US Administration?Spokesman: I'm not aware of that, and at this point, obviously, we have to see what the release is, and I have no other comment.Question: So, if he hasn't been given, you're not aware of an advanced copy being given to the Secretary-General, does he believe that, given his very important role in this, as a member of the Quartet, as the Secretary-General of the United Nations, where the UN is, where all the Security Council resolutions are... does he feel that it's disrespectful of the Trump Administration not to be consulting him and giving him an advanced copy?Spokesman: As I said, I think we all have to wait for this plan to be released, whenever that will be. We will have further comment at that time. In the meantime, the Secretary-General's own positions on it have not changed.Question: You didn't answer my question, though: Does he believe it's disrespectful... [cross talk]Spokesman: I answered it to the best of my ability. Yes, Madame?Question: Follow-up on the same subject. Do you... was he consulted in any of the... if... you said he wasn't given any advance copy of the plan. Was he consulted or his envoy in Jerusalem was consulted regarding this plan anytime?Spokesman: Over the last three years or two... I mean, since the Secretary... since the announcement of... that the plan would be coming, there had been contacts at various levels, including the Secretary-General and Mr. [Nickolay] Mladenov.Question: So, are you saying that you are aware of the details of the plan, or what exactly are you saying?Spokesman: No, that's... I'm just saying that there have been conversation over the last two... two, three years on this but... and I will leave it at that. Yes, Edie?Question: Thank you, Steph. On the new coronavirus, last week, there was a closed meeting of the major emergency experts from OCHA (Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs), UNICEF (UN Children's Fund), WHO, etc. Can we have some kind of a reading on what they have decided to do, because we were told that meeting was aimed at helping fragile countries that might not be able to deal with such a virus themselves?Spokesman: Yeah, unfortunately, I have nothing for you on that meeting. Erol?Question: Yeah. Just, actually, it's a follow-up, although I have a separate one on Libya, but it's also... all the time raises the question, Stephane, how much UN is involved in these kind of processes, whether it's more passive, more active role. So, what... how would you characterise the involvement of the UN?Spokesman: Our involvement is regulated through relevant Security Council resolutions. We have a Special Coordinator on the ground, Mr. Mladenov, and as you know, the UN has extensive humanitarian operations in the area.Question: And what would be the leadership of the Secretary-General in that direction, to move a little bit forward beside that...? [cross talk]Spokesman: I think the Secretary-General's position on the Middle East peace process are regularly shared with you through public briefings in the Security Council.Question: May I ask one on Libya?Spokesman: You may ask one on Libya.Question: Thank you. Today, Foreign Minister for Germany was very disappointed by the progress, actually lack of progress, of the follow-up on the Berlin peace process... peace conference. He said that the Security Council should be informed. What is, again, the role... role or what is the position of Secretary-General on that?Spokesman: I mean, we share the disappointment expressed by Mr. Salame of this continuing violation of the arms embargo. I mean, as I just flagged, we're seeing flights continue to arrive in different parts of Libya, disgorging weapons, troops, armoured carriers. Those are blatant violations of the Security Council resolution.Mr. Salame, for his part, is pushing forward, as we always do, on the political track, with trying to organize and set up the number of meetings that he had flagged, on the military issues, on political issues, on economic issues. We will continue to persevere and push for the political track, but, obviously, the parties on the ground need to honour the cessation of hostilities and all those parties who are helping one side or another need to abide by the commitments made in Berlin and need to abide by Security Council resolutions.Nabil?Question: Thank you, Steph. Back to the peace plan. It seems that the plan will address the borders issue. So, can you please remind us, what's the UN position on Israel's borders and the Palestinian state border...?Spokesman: The Secretary-General, the UN's position are reflected every month or more than once a month in the Security Council briefings. And you can refer those... to that. His... Secretary-General's positions are unchanged.Question: And... sorry, on corona, did the UN evacuate any personnel from China...? [cross talk]Spokesman: No, not that I'm aware of. Yep?Question: Hi, Steph. It's related to the coronavirus, and it's going to take a second to lay out the question, so I appreciate your patience.The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has recently been blocking people on social media. It looks like it's at least a couple dozen people that include think tank experts, researchers, writers, journalists, citizens. And they all have a common thread, which is that they're saying Taiwan should be receiving information directly from the ICAO, not that they should be a member of the ICAO but that they should be receiving, as a regional transport hub, information directly from them.ICAO has responded saying that it reserves the right to get rid of irrelevant, compromising and offensive material. So, I wanted to see your thoughts... the head of the ICAO, by the way, right now is a Chinese national, someone from the PRC (People's Republic of China). And so I'm wondering if you see this as a politically motivated way to silence opinions.Spokesman: One of your colleagues just emailed me the same question. I'm in touch with... I've reached out to ICAO to see what exactly is the issue, but ICAO is an agency with its own governing body, not under the authority of the Secretary-General, but let me see what I can find out from ICAO.James?Question: Thanks, Stephane. It's another question on the Middle East peace plan. You said a few times that the Secretary-General... his position hasn't changed. It's been stated in the Security Council again and again. Are you saying that you don't think now is a time to make any changes to this? Or are you willing to see what the Americans put forward tomorrow and are you willing to... [cross talk]Spokesman: I'm not... that's not... All I'm saying is that the Secretary-General's positions are unchanged, and they've been related to you repeatedly.Question: Does he have an open mind then? Is he willing to look again at some of these bedrock principles?Spokesman: I will leave it at that for the time being. Yes, Madame?Question: A follow-up on Middle East plan. So, let me preface my question this way. So, does the Secretary-General... or is the Secretary-General disappointed regarding the fact that a peace plan will be announced... so-called peace plan will be announced tomorrow when... where a part... a partner or a main partner to this plan is made absent? So, what's your comment on that?Spokesman: I'm not... I understand what you all are trying to get and what you need... [laughter] ... but I'm not going to get into saying anything further until there's an announcement.Question: No, but I'm not asking about the plan itself.Spokesman: No, no, I... [cross talk]Question: I'm asking about a fact that somebody who is a main partner is made absent.Spokesman: No, I understand, but I will not get into it.Question: Okay. I have some... a question about Iraq.Spokesman: Lovely. [laughter]Question: I'm not sure... I mean, the demonstrations in Baghdad and other parts of Iraq have... they have been continuous, peacefully mostly, and the killing and injuring of civilians is also continuing. Any comments? And is your representative there in contact and negotiation with different parties?Spokesman: Yes, I mean, the UN on the ground continues to be engaged with the Iraqi authorities and Iraqi civil society. I think the... in Iraq, as in other places around the world, there is a discontent, and leaders need to move forward, listen to the people. The new Government needs to be formed, but this is... Iraq is a sovereign country, and it is... will be the decisions of the Iraqi leaders. But we have been concerned by the continued violence, by the attack on demonstrators. Some of them, we understand, have been subjected to horrendous treatment, and these things are of concern to us, and they've been raised directly with the Iraqi authorities.Question: Are you... there... or is there somebody... I know that the... Mrs. Jeanine [Hennis-Plasschaert]... she went once since October. I'm not sure if she went again to the square in Baghdad. Is there somebody from the UN who is monitoring or...Spokesman: We are... I will find out how detailed the monitoring is, but I mean, we are... we have quite a large presence in Baghdad, and our team there is full... well aware of what going on, on the ground.Edie, and then we'll go back to Mr. Bays.Question: Thank you, Steph. Does the Secretary-General have any comment on an attack yesterday that killed 20 Malian soldiers at a base near Mauritania, which appears to be an extremist attack?Spokesman: Yes. Our... the Head of the Mission, Mr. [Mahamat Saleh] Annadif, condemned the attack on... the cowardly attack on... via Twitter. He expressed his heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families and wished a swift recovery to those injured.We are... the Mission itself deployed to the area of the attack today to support the Malian armed forces and reiterate its commitment to support peace and stability in Mali.James, and then...Question: Yes. So, two questions. One is a follow-up on Libya. Eight days now after the Berlin conference, General [Khalifa] Haftar is clearly pursuing an offensive on a number of fronts. And now the GNA (Government of National Accord) Prime Minister [Fayez al] Serraj saying that they are debating whether to continue in this process.How disappointed is the Secretary-General that, rather than after Berlin there's an improvement in the situation, things seem to have deteriorated so badly? And, specifically, can you tell us whether the meeting that is supposed to take place in Geneva tomorrow of both sides is going ahead?Spokesman: I need to get some details on the meeting. I know Mr. Salame is working hard towards making those things happen, but I need to get some details. Listen, doesn't take a genius to see that we're going in the wrong direction, right, on the ground. As I said, the arms keep flowing in. The fighting is continuing, and the Libyan people keep suffering.We're, of course, very disappointed in the situation, but we will continue to push ahead for a political solution with Mr. Salame in the lead, and we will continue to support... to provide whatever humanitarian assistance we can.Question: And my other question was just an update for us. You told us a number of times and I know this is drifted...Spokesman: I always get nervous when you say, "you told us". [laughter]Question: No, about... about the timeline for the Board of Inquiry on Syria.Spokesman: Yeah.Question: And you said that you were hoping now the new timetable was by the end of the month. We have four days left. Will it happen by the end of the month?Spokesman: We do have four days left. [laughter] Yes, sir?Question: Thank you. Stephane, today is the seventy-fifth anniversary of one of the darkest events of the humanity, the Holocaust. But throughout all these years, many other dark events did happen genocides, mass killings, starting from Rwanda, Bosnia, Kosovo, Syria, even denial of those crimes. What it can be done to stop this craziness? By not just being reactive to this...? [cross talk]Spokesman: It's a...Correspondent: That's for another peace prize question, sir.Spokesman: First of all, is to never forget, never be complacent, and continue to speak up every time atrocities occur.Nabil?Question: Thank you. On Lebanon, the violence against protests in Lebanon has escalated dramatically in the last week, and now we have a new Government in the country. Do you have a new message to authorities in Lebanon on this?Spokesman: You know, I haven't gotten an update from Mr. [Jan] KubiÅ', but I will try to get one.Question: Also, in Lebanon, there's a big crisis in flow of cash, US dollars in the country. Did the UN suffer by any way sorry from this crisis in the country? How do you get your funds to Lebanon? [cross talk]Spokesman: I'm not aware that there have been any repercussions on the UN's programmes, whether on humanitarian development or peacekeeping in Lebanon.Question: So, does the UN use the banking system in Lebanon to transfer or to wire funds? [cross talk]Spokesman: Well, we... Listen, I will just say that I have not been made aware of any issues. We, of course... like in any country, whenever possible, and that's a vast, vast majority of places, we use the local banking system.Question: Can... is it possible to get more details on this?Spokesman: It is always possible to ask for more details. We'll see if more details can be had.Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.Syria, Libya, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, TurkeyFor information media.

Don't believe the media panic about coronavirusMassachusetts Daily Collegian: University of Massachusetts - AmherstFebruary 3, 2020 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPED; Pg. 1Length: 848 wordsByline: Greg FournierBodyIf you have been following the news at all for the past few weeks, you would be forgiven for thinking a plague of biblical proportions has descended upon us. A novel coronavirus has been rapidly spreading throughout the globe, with most cases concentrated in China. The number of infections continually increases, accompanied by disease-caused deaths. The fast-spreading nature of the new virus has the world reeling in response.Twitter, of course, only adds fuel to the fire. One recent viral tweet includes a close-up picture of a Chinese man saying goodbye to his wife as he departs for, what seems like, a sure death in the service of treating coronavirus patients in Wuhan. The doctor's wife has tears streaming down her face. This image tugs at the heartstrings of even the most hardened viewers. It's indicative of the general feeling of anxiety felt by many regarding the virus.The panic seems to have also set in among many governments worldwide. The U.S. State Department "issued a travel advisory telling Americans not to travel to China because of the public health threat posed by the coronavirus." This is a Level 4 advisory - the highest level that is "reserved for the most dangerous situations." In Italy, "thousands of passengers had been blocked from leaving a cruise ship...for more than 12 hours over concerns that someone aboard might have had the virus." This case ended up being "a false alarm," which goes to show how seriously governments everywhere are taking this virus.International organizations are similarly worried. The World Health Organization declared a public health emergency over the coronavirus last week. As a result, "various countries have taken steps to close borders or cancel flights in recent days, and companies like Google, Ikea, Starbucks and Tesla have closed their shops or stopped operations."In doing the research for this article, I found myself being swept up in the paranoia. The circumstances seem never to have been more dire - and, since governments are reacting this way to the disease, shouldn't everyone be concerned about it?So far, the reality of the coronavirus is actually less serious than media reports would suggest. For instance, "'the main reason for [the WHO] declaration is not what is happening in China but what is happening in other countries'.... The concern is that it could spread to countries with weaker health systems." Though most of the confirmed cases have been confined to China, "declaring a global emergency allows the WHO to support lower and middle income countries to strengthen their disease surveillance and prepare them for coronavirus cases."Moreover, the symptoms of the coronavirus are relatively mild. According to the Centers for Disease Control , "common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death." However, preliminary estimates of the death rate are around two percent. Compare that to SARS, an outbreak of which occurred in the early 2000s, which had a death rate of 9.6 percent.The most astounding metric of this coronavirus is who is actually being infected. According to the New York Times, "an examination of the information provided by the [Chinese] government about the initial deaths show [sic] a disease that has thus far largely killed older men, many of who had underlying health problems." Among the victims from the first few weeks, "the median age was 75." Some of the underlying health problems included "cirrhosis of the liver, hypertension, diabetes and Parkinson's disease." Additionally, no deaths have been reported outside of China, and U.S. officials are confident that Americans are at low risk of being infected provided they have had no contact with people who have recently traveled to China.It seems like every few years, a new disease rises from the ether and threatens our very way of life. The reader may recall Ebola, the virus from Africa that spread to the U.S. and caused a media panic beyond even that of the coronavirus. While Ebola actually had serious symptoms, the panic died down within weeks of the first reported case. Similarly, there was a seemingly very serious vaping illness that was sweeping the American youth at the end of 2019.The coronavirus panic seems, to me, to be an overblown media spectacle, repeated every few years with new symptoms and a different origin country. I'm not sure if this happens as a result of newspapers feeling the need to attract clicks on their websites, or a general lack of due diligence on the part of journalists, or a genuine concern for people to be aware of the issue. Probably it is a combination of the three. Either way, this just goes to show that media consumers should be more skeptical of the bottom-line message being given to them - particularly when the news is apocalyptic in nature.Greg Fournier is a Collegian columnist and can be reached at [email protected] and followed on Twitter @greg_fournier.Load-Date: February 3, 2020End of Document

Don Kahle: A referendum on openessThe Register Guard (Eugene, Oregon)February 20, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 The Register GuardDistributed by Tribune Content AgencySection: COMMENTARYLength: 567 wordsByline: Don Kahle, The Register-Guard, Eugene, Ore.BodyFeb. 21--The rapid spread of the coronavirus has quickly morphed from a public health story to a public policy debate. As the disease nears pandemic proportions, it has become the touchstone for a worldwide referendum on openness versus control.As if to underscore its place on this spectrum, China this week revoked visas for three journalists for The Wall Street Journal, in retaliation for a column written weeks ago by Walter Russell Mead. In his Feb. 4 column, Mead pointed out that China's coming economic dominance is far more fragile than its leaders are willing to admit.Before we get too smug on the matter of political openness, remember that the head of the Democratic party in Iowa assured a reporter that Iowa has "never been better prepared" for its quadrennial caucus. He also refused to divulge in advance who had written the new app they intended to use or how it had been tested.Thanks to an army of reporters who suddenly couldn't file stories about who had won the caucuses, it quickly became known that the app was written by Democratic operatives under the company name of "Shadow." And that Iowa party leaders had refused to allow the app to be stress tested in advance, for fear of the system getting hacked.Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price resigned after the caucus debacle, which demonstrates the importance of openness, even if it came too late for Price and for Iowa. China has handled their crisis very differently.In December, eight doctors reported to Chinese officials that patients in Wuhan were getting sick with an untreatable virus. It resembled SARS, but known remedies weren't working. Chinese leaders thought their reports made the government look bad, so these doctors were punished. One of them, Dr. Li Wenliang, has since died from the coronavirus.In between the coronavirus story and the Iowa caucuses came another news event that turned on this same axis. After years of forensic studies, it was determined that the sprawling identity theft from Equifax in 2017 came from hackers sent by the Chinese government.The Equifax data breach exposed the identities of 145 million Americans. It was all caused by Equifax's failure to install a software patch. The open-source software association Apache announced the software patch in March of 2017. The hacking began in May.So the contours of this international debate began almost three years ago. Apache was open about the vulnerabilities of its software and issued a free software upgrade that fixed the problem. Equifax was less forthcoming about its diligence to protect its customers' accounts.China took advantage of Equifax's opaque corporate culture. When no announcement had been made of the upgrade, China's hackers began probing. They exploited the vulnerability and then covered their tracks, using Equifax's opacity to its advantage twice.The lesson for China, Equifax, and Iowa's Democratic leaders is the same. The sooner a wide range of people know about any vulnerability, the better defended everyone can be. Unfortunately for Wenliang, his willingness to warn others cost him his reputation. And then it cost him his life.Don Kahle (fridays@dksez.com) writes a column each Friday for The Register-Guard and blogs at www.dksez.com.___ (c)2020 The Register-Guard (Eugene, Ore.)

House Homeland Security Committee Issues Report on Drone Origin Security Enhancement ActTargeted News ServiceFebruary 6, 2020 Thursday 3:07 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1699 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON, Feb. 6 -- The House Homeland Security Committee issued a report (H.Rpt. 116-301) on the Drone Origin Security Enhancement Act (H.R. 4753), which prohibits the secretary of Homeland Security from operating or procuring foreign-made unmanned aircraft systems. The report was advanced by Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, D-Mississippi, on Nov. 19.Excerpts of the report follow:Purpose and Summary...1Background and Need for Legislation...2Hearings...2Committee Consideration...2Committee Votes...3Committee Oversight Findings...3C.B.O. Estimate, New Budget Authority, Entitlement Authority, and Tax Expenditures...3Federal Mandates Statement...3Statement of General Performance Goals and Objectives...3Duplicative Federal Programs...3Congressional Earmarks, Limited Tax Benefits, and Limited Tariff Benefits...Advisory Committee Statement...Applicability to Legislative Branch...Section-by-Section Analysis of the Legislation...4PURPOSE AND SUMMARYH.R. 4753, the "Drone Origin Security Enhancement Act," would prohibit the Secretary of Homeland Security from operating, providing financial assistance for, or entering into or renewing a contract for the procurement of certain unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). Specifically, the prohibition applies to UAS manufactured in or consisting of parts made in foreign countries that the Department of Defense defines as "strategic competitors" in its 2018 National Defense Strategy.BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATIONAmong its many missions, the Department of Homeland Security is tasked with protecting Americans from terrorism and other threats and securing cyberspace and the nation's critical infrastructure. In order to effectively carry out these tasks, the equipment that the Department uses must be secure. However, reports over the last several years suggest that Chinese- manufactured drones could be used to send sensitive information to the Chinese government./1/ The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has similarly noted that the use of UAS technology manufactured overseas creates a risk that data may be compromised./2/--/1/Mozur, Paul. "Drone Maker DJI May Be Sending Data to China, U.S. Officials Say," New York Times (November 29, 2017). https:// www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/technology/dji-china-data-drones.html./2/Johnson, Bridget.

"`Quads for Squads' Grounds Over Cyber Concerns," Marine Corps Times (June 15, 2018). https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/ news/your-marine-corps/2018/06/15/quads-for-squads-grounded-over-cyber- concerns/.--HEARINGSFor the purposes of section 103(i) of H. Res. 6. of the 116th Congress, the following hearings were used to develop H.R. 4753: On June 25, 2019, the Committee held a hearing entitled "Cybersecurity Challenges for State and Local Governments: Assessing How the Federal Government Can Help." The Committee received testimony from Keisha Lance Bottoms, Mayor, City of Atlanta; Thomas Duffy, Senior Vice President of Operations and Chair of Multi-State ISAC, Center for Internet Security; Ahmad Sultan, Affiliated Researcher, Center for Long Term Cybersecurity, University of California, Berkeley; and Frank J. Cilluffo, Director, McCrary Institute for Cyber and Critical Infrastructure Security, Auburn University.On September 10, 2019, the Committee held a hearing entitled "Global Terrorism: Threats to the Homeland, Part I." The Committee received testimony from Peter Bergen, Vice President, Global Studies and Fellows, New America; Ali Soufan, Founder, the Soufan Center; Brian Levin, Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism; and Thomas Joscelyn, Senior Fellow, Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.COMMITTEE CONSIDERATIONThe Committee met on October 23, 2019, with a quorum being present, to consider H.R. 4753 and ordered the measure to be reported to the House with a favorable recommendation, without amendment, by unanimous consent.COMMITTEE VOTESClause 3(b) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives requires the Committee to list the recorded votes on the motion to report legislation and amendments thereto.No recorded votes were requested during consideration of H.R. 4753.COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGSIn compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee advises that the findings and recommendations of the Committee, based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in the descriptive portions of this report.CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE ESTIMATE NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY, ENTITLEMENT AUTHORITY, AND TAX EXPENDITURESWith respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements of clause (3)(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Committee has requested but not received a cost estimate for this bill from the Director of Congressional Budget Office.FEDERAL MANDATES STATEMENTAn estimate of Federal mandates prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act was not made available to the Committee in time for the filing of this report. The Chairman of the Committee shall cause such estimate to be printed in the Congressional Record upon its receipt by the Committee.DUPLICATIVE FEDERAL PROGRAMSPursuant to clause 3(c) of rule XIII, the Committee finds that H.R. 4753 does not contain any provision that establishes or reauthorizes a program known to be duplicative of another Federal program.PERFORMANCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVESPursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the objective of H.R. 4753 is to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to halt the procurement or use of UAS technologies manufactured in or consisting of parts made in foreign countries that the Department of Defense defines as "strategic competitors" in its 2018 National Defense Strategy. The prohibition also applies to UAS that use software developed in countries labeled as strategic competitors as well as UAS that use network connectivity or data storage located in such countries. The DHS Secretary may waive the prohibition on a case-by-case basis by certifying to the homeland security committees in both the House and Senate that the purpose of the waiver is required in the national interest, for counter-UAS surrogate testing, or for intelligence operations, testing, analysis, or training.The goal and objective of H.R. 4753 is to protect the Department of Homeland Security from cybersecurity vulnerabilities associated with the use of foreign-made UAS.ADVISORY ON EARMARKSIn compliance with rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives, this bill, as reported, contains no congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined in clause 9(d), 9(e), or 9(f) of the rule XXI.SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATIONSection 1. Short titleThis section provides that the bill may be cited as the "Drone Origin Security Enhancement Act." Sec. 2. Prohibition on operation or procurement of foreign-made unmanned aircraft systems This section prohibits the Secretary of Homeland Security from operating, procuring, or providing financial assistance for a UAS that is manufactured in or uses (1) technology or systems manufactured in, (2) ground control systems or operating software developed by, or (3) network connectivity or data storage located in a covered foreign country. Moreover, it prohibits the use of any of those technologies if they are manufactured, developed, or administered by a corporation domiciled in a covered foreign country.For the purposes of this prohibition, a "covered foreign country" means a country labeled as a strategic competitor in the "Summary of the 2018 National Defense Strategy of the United States of America: Sharpening the American Military's Competitive Edge," issued by the Department of Defense.This section also sets forth the limited circumstances under which the Secretary would be permitted to waive the prohibition. Such a waiver requires that the Secretary certify in writing to the homeland security committees of the House and Senate that the operation or procurement subject to the waiver is required (1) in the national interest of the United States, (2) for counter-UAS testing and training, or (3) for intelligence, electronic warfare, or information warfare operations, testing, analysis, or training.Once enacted, the Department of Homeland Security should immediately halt the use or procurement of any qualifying UAS. Should any of those uses or procurements meet the circumstances permitting a waiver, the Secretary should submit its waiver certifications to Congress in an expedited manner to ensure that the Department continues to serve those interests.The full text of the report is found at: https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/116th-congress/house-report/301/1?s=3&r=88TARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

The real virus Canadians should worry about is misinformationThe Brunswickan: University of New BrunswickFebruary 21, 2020 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 577 wordsByline: Alexandre SilbermanBodyThe coronavirus outbreak has killed hundreds and infected thousands. But this crisis is yet another reminder of a greater threat facing Canadians, spreading faster than a deadly illness. Misinformation is going viral and is a second virus just as worrisome, if not more than the actual disease. Photo manipulation and deepfake technology is allowing fake images, posts and videos to appear practically unnoticeable. It's time that our government requires social networks to take action and combat rumours and hoaxes online. False claims around the coronavirus are leading to unwarranted panic, dispelling useful health information and scapegoating Asian Canadians. A widely circulated rumour claimed the virus was created by Chinese spies in a Winnipeg lab, who sent the pathogens to Wuhan. Fact-checkers are finding posts shared through Whatsapp with slightly altered wording than that used by official government health authorities. People are believing unsubstantiated advice, including to avoid ice cream for 90 days or smoke cannabis to protect themselves. A widely circulated list falsely claims to show Toronto schools affected by the virus. And several Canadian universities, including McMaster and Ryerson, have had to dispel fabricated statements and fake news releases announcing students had tested positive for the virus.The Chinese government has even spread lies about its response through official Twitter accounts. During conversations about the outbreak last week, several people told me about how China had supposedly built a new hospital in Wuhan in only 16 hours. I was also shown photos of a woman eating bat soup. Both are completely false. The "so-called" hospital was actually a cropped photo from an apartment building listing. And while the disease originated in a fish market, there is no evidence connecting the bat images to the virus.The list of false claims goes on and on. The number of likes and shares these posts have received is alarming. Some fake stories are even doctored to include logos of real, credible news organizations such as NBC.Outbreaks such as the coronavirus provide an opportunity for hostile foreign governments to carry out deliberate disinformation campaigns, designed to create mistrust of authority. These rumours sow division in our society. A review on a Toronto blog of a new Chinese restaurant became filled with spiteful comments linking the community with the disease. This is just one example of the rise in anti-Chinese rhetoric in Canada.Falsehoods were swirling through the pages of newspapers when the plague hit Europe in the 17th century. But now the power to publish information has been extended to anyone with an internet connection and a device. Social media from Facebook to Twitter are becoming permanently swamped with misinformation.These platforms created this problem and have a responsibility to address it. Social networks must develop advanced technology to filter false claims and altered images, and hire more employees to review user reports. It's time our government holds these immensely powerful companies accountable for their actions. If Facebook, for instance, lets a lie circulate unhindered for 24 hours, they should be slapped with a fine or comparable penalty.We are living in an age with a climate of misinformation where marginal and unreliable voices are easily elevated during times of public anxiety. It's time to take action before this virus infects us all.Load-Date: February 21, 2020End of Document

Wuhan coronavirus death toll rises to 56 as healthcare workers say medical supplies are running outCNN.comJanuary 25, 2020 Saturday 3:12 AM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: CHINALength: 1464 wordsByline: By Yong Xiong, Natalie Thomas, David Culver and Helen Regan, CNNDateline: Beijing BodyThe death toll from the Wuhan coronavirus in China continues rising as authorities and health care workers struggle to contain the outbreak.Fifty-six people have been killed by the novel coronavirus in China, health officials said on Saturday. Over 1,900 confirmed cases have been reported across the country.China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported that 237 patients are in critical condition.Healthcare workers in the Chinese city of Wuhan say hospitals are running low on supplies as they treat an increasing number of patients.The Chinese central government announced it would send more than 1,200 health workers ? as well as 135 People's Liberation Army medical personnel -- to the city in an unprecedented effort to contain the spread of the virus.Lunar New Year celebrations -- the country's most important holiday -- have been greatly impacted in Beijing, Hong Kong and other major cities due to the virus. More than 60 million people are under partial lockdown in the provinces of Hubei and Guangdong.While most confirmed cases of the virus are in China, at least 13 places outside mainland China, including France, Australia and the United States are reporting their first cases.In Canada, health officials on Saturday announced the first "presumptive" positive case of coronavirus. The case is pending additional confirmation from the country's national medical laboratory.In Wuhan, ground zero for the virus, four healthcare workers -- including doctors -- have told CNN of the difficulties facing medical crews on the ground. They have asked to remain anonymous to avoid repercussions.Through telephone conversations with CNN and posts on Chinese social media, they told of low hospital resources. In private groups online, those identified as hospital staff are coordinating with members of the public to import protective equipment as they treat an increasing number of infected patients."In terms of resources, the whole of Wuhan is lacking," one Wuhan-based healthcare worker told CNN by phone. This person said they were looking for more protective clothing, protective goggles and masks. Â "It's really like we're going into battle stripped to the waist," one healthcare worker added, using a Chinese idiom that equates to "going into battle without armor".Â One hospital staff member claims healthcare workers have resorted to wearing diapers to work so as to avoid having to remove their HAZMAT suits, which they say are in short supply. A doctor on her Chinese social media Weibo page described similar accounts at another Wuhan hospital.Â "My family members are definitely worried about me, but I still have to work," another doctor told. But she said that she is hopeful they will ultimately get the gear they need. "Our bosses, our hospital suppliers will definitely find a way to get these stocks to us," she added.It's not clear if these accounts are anecdotal or whether there are widespread shortages across Wuhan.Chinese state media has also shared posts from multiple Wuhan hospitals in which they ask for public donations of medical supplies. They report that one hospital staff member said the current supplies "are only able to sustain three or four days".Â The Wuhan Health Commission has requisitioned over 10,000 beds from 24 hospitals to be used in the treatment of confirmed and suspected cases. Â On Friday, Wuhan officials acknowledged that local hospitals were struggling to accommodate people seeking medical attention and said measures were being put into place to alleviate the situation.State media also reported that the city aims to build a 25,000 square meter (269,100 square foot) new facility within a week, increasing hospital capacity by 1,000 beds, and that several medical centers in Hubei province are asking for medical gear donations.Locking down the virus over Lunar New YearAuthorities have imposed indefinite restrictions on public transport and travel.All motor vehicles will be banned in Wuhan's city center starting Sunday to control the flow of people, according to the Wuhan Command Center, the taskforce set up to combat the virus. Only vehicles with special permits, free shuttles and government vehicles will be allowed to circulate.Amid the lockdown, countries like the US and France have been attempting to evacuate their citizens from the central Chinese city.The US government is arranging a charter flight to evacuate American diplomats and citizens from Wuhan, a US official with knowledge of the matter told CNN.The French government says it's planning to set up a bus service to move French nationals out of Wuhan.Meanwhile, 56 Indian students have been trapped in Wuhan for three days, with some afraid to leave their dorm room and fearful of running out of food.Ganesan Deepshikha, a student at the Wuhan University School Of Medicine, told CNN that the students have been told by the Indian Embassy that they are safe in Wuhan but have not received any assistance.The virus, which was first discovered in Wuhan in December, has spread to every province in China, except the remote autonomous region of Tibet.Among those infected is a 2-year-old girl in the southern region of Guangxi, the local health authority said. She is believed to be the youngest patient infected.The week-long Lunar New Year holiday, which began Saturday, has led to concerns that the outbreak could quickly accelerate, as hundreds of millions of people travel across the country to visit friends and relatives.Lunar New Year is to China what the Christmas-New Year holiday period is to the United States -- except China's 1.4 billion population is more than four times that of the US.In many cities, festivities have been called off. Authorities in Beijing have canceled all large-scale Lunar New Year celebrations, including traditional fairs and celebrations around temples.Shanghai Disneyland has temporarily closed its doors. Seven blockbuster movies that were set to hit theaters this weekend have been canceled or postponed.Businesses are also taking measures to protect staff and the public.On Saturday, coffee giant Starbucks said it has closed all 90 of its Hubei stores indefinitely. The closures will continue throughout the Spring Festival, which runs until the end of January."All Starbucks stores and special star delivery in Hubei will be temporarily closed. Hubei employees are asked to rest at home, minimize going out, take care to protect themselves and their families. All store employees who were scheduled to work during the closing period will be paid as usual," a statement from the company said.A global concernOn Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) moved to declare the coronavirus an emergency within China -- but refrained from classifying the outbreak as an epidemic of international concern.Mounting evidence suggests the virus is spreading outside mainland China, however, with 13 countries and territories reporting confirmed cases, including the United States and France.Australia confirmed that three men who traveled from China to Sydney had tested positive, health authorities in the city said. The country has now confirmed a total of four cases.Nepal also confirmed its first case, a spokesman for the country's Health Ministry told CNN. The patient is a 31-year-old Nepali man studying for his PhD in Wuhan, spokesman Mahendra Kumar Shrestha said. The student flew to Nepal earlier this month and was admitted to a hospital in Kathmandu on January 13 with fever and respiratory problems.In South Korea, the country's Centers for Disease Control has announced a third confirmed case of the virus. A 54-year-old South Korean man who lives in Wuhan and traveled to South Korea on January 20 called a hotline on Saturday to report his symptoms, the agency said.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced that the Hong Kong Disease contingency plan has been upgraded from "serious" to "emergency" level. Schools in the Chinese territory will be suspended until February 17.On Thursday, David Heymann, the chairman of a WHO committee gathering data on the outbreak, said the virus spreads more easily from person to person than previously thought. "We are now seeing second and third generation spread," Heymann said.Coronaviruses are transmitted by animals and people, and the Wuhan strain has been linked to a market in the city that was selling seafood and live animals, including wild species.Third generation means that someone who became infected after handling animals at the market spreads the virus to someone else, who then spreads it to a third person. The announcement marks a development in the progress of the spread of the virus.Heymann said there is no evidence at this point that the virus is airborne and could be spread across a room, as happens with the flu or measles.Load-Date: January 27, 2020End of Document

UK faces choice on Huawei with global implicationsAssociated Press InternationalJanuary 27, 2020 Monday 5:29 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 997 wordsByline: By KELVIN CHAN and DANICA KIRKA, Associated PressDateline: LONDON BodyLONDON (AP) - Britain faces a crucial choice on Tuesday over whether to allow China's Huawei Technologies to build its next-generation wireless networks.The decision has implications for the country's diplomatic relations with the United States, which is pushing allies to shun the Chinese company over cybersecurity concerns.And Britain's choice will feed into a wider battle between the U.S. and China over technological supremacy that has seen the world's two biggest economies engage in a damaging trade war.WHAT'S HAPPENINGBritain's National Security Council is poised to decide whether to allow Huawei to build parts of its new high speed cellular network known as 5G, an infrastructure program the country sees as critical to its economic future. But Huawei has come under scrutiny because of worries that communist leaders in Beijing could, under China's 2017 national intelligence law, compel the company to carry out cyberespionage. The United States has been pressing allies to shun Huawei and has threatened to cut off intelligence cooperation with Britain if it gives Huawei access. Supporters say Britain needs Huawei's expertise and that security issues can be managed. The company denies it would give data access to the Chinese government.WHY IS THIS SO IMPORTANTDays away from leaving the European Union and desperately needing to secure its future outside of the trading bloc, Britain is now caught in the middle of a geopolitical battle between the U.S. and China - both important trading partners. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government finds itself in the awkward position of risking the fury of its closest ally at just the moment it really needs President Donald Trump's administration to quickly strike a trade deal. Britain is also loathe to insult Beijing. The U.K. made a point of courting Chinese investment with the State Visit of Xi Jinping in 2015, a gilded affair meant to underline the dawn of a new era.Johnson hinted Monday that he wants to thread a middle route. "The way forward for us clearly is to have a system that delivers for people in this country the kind of consumer benefits that they want through 5G technology or whatever, but does not in any way compromise our critical national infrastructure, our security or jeopardize our ability to work together with other intelligence powers around the world," he said. "We are going to come up with a solution that enables us to achieve both those objectives and that's the way forward."WHAT IS 5G?Don't be fooled by the name. The fifth generation of cellular networks is not merely an upgrade from existing 4G wireless network technology. It's billed as a radical transformation delivering ultrafast download speeds combined with vastly reduced signal lag - the slight delay that occurs between, say, tapping out a command on your phone and getting a response. The other difference is that it will be built into thousands of new devices, like thermostats and sensors in medical devices. The aim is for 5G to be instrumental for self-driving cars or for telemedicine, allowing doctors to control robots in remote surgery on patients thousands of miles away. Underpinning all this new connectivity will be a lot more software that can lead to more vulnerabilities.WHY IS 5G IMPORTANT?It's not just about letting smartphone users download a high-definition movie in seconds instead of minutes. This next generation of mobile infrastructure promises to usher in a new wave of innovation that can drive economic growth. Supporters say Huawei, the world's biggest maker of networking equipment such as switches and antennas, can help countries meet that goal because it makes cheap, good-quality gear that appeals to wireless carriers. Banning Huawei puts Britain at risk of falling behind economically, they say. Complicating matters, some British wireless carriers have already started installing Huawei 5G gear and don't want to spend more money ripping it out.WHAT ARE THE CYBERSECURITY RISKS?Cell networks have traditionally consisted of two parts. There's the "radio access network" made up of antennas and base stations on rooftops and masts. There's also the "core," the brain keeping track of smartphones connecting to the network so account holders can be billed along with managing data traffic flowing across the entire network. With 5G, U.S. officials worry that the core will run extensively on software. Millions of lines of computer code would present a huge "attack surface" and it could be nearly impossible to spot an accidental vulnerability or a malicious "backdoor" that can be used for siphoning information or crippling vital connected infrastructure like a power grid. These fears aren't entirely unfounded. Huawei equipment has for years been inspected at a lab overseen by British officials, who said in their latest annual report that the company's software was buggy.AREN'T THERE OTHER OPTIONS?Not many. Huawei mainly competes with two Scandinavian rivals, Finland's Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson, for wireless infrastructure contracts. South Korea's Samsung and Cisco in the U.S. are smaller competitors. A big reason the Huawei decision has become so fraught is that the global telecom equipment industry has been whittled down to just a handful of players. U.K. security officials have been hesitant to ban Huawei completely because they want to maintain a diverse range of suppliers to guard against risks. One less company means the security risks are concentrated in the remaining players.IS IT JUST BRITAIN?A similar debate has been playing out in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, whose decision could influence smaller neighbors. And the European Union's executive Commission is set to release on Wednesday non-binding guidelines for 5G. Europe is Huawei's biggest market outside China and it has effectively been barred in the U.S.___Follow Kelvin Chan at www.twitter.com/chanman___Follow the AP's coverage of technology at: https://apnews.com/apf-technologyLoad-Date: January 28, 2020End of Document

Wuhan coronavirus death toll rises to 56 as healthcare workers say medical supplies are running outCNN WireJanuary 26, 2020 Sunday 8:12 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1513 wordsDateline: BEIJING (CNN) BodyBEIJING (CNN) --  The death toll from the Wuhan coronavirus in China continues rising as authorities and health care workers struggle to contain the outbreak.Fifty-six people have been killed by the novel coronavirus in China, health officials said on Saturday. Over 1,900 confirmed cases have been reported across the country. China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported that 237 patients are in critical condition.Healthcare workers in the Chinese city of Wuhan say hospitals are running low on supplies as they treat an increasing number of patients.The Chinese central government announced it would send more than 1,200 health workers --- as well as 135 People's Liberation Army medical personnel -- to the city in an unprecedented effort to contain the spread of the virus.Lunar New Year celebrations -- the country's most important holiday -- have been greatly impacted in Beijing, Hong Kong and other major cities due to the virus. More than 60 million people are under partial lockdown in the provinces of Hubei and Guangdong.While most confirmed cases of the virus are in China, at least 13 places outside mainland China, including France, Australia and the United States are reporting their first cases. In Canada, health officials on Saturday announced the first "presumptive" positive case of coronavirus. The case is pending additional confirmation from the country's national medical laboratory. In Wuhan, ground zero for the virus, four healthcare workers -- including doctors -- have told CNN of the difficulties facing medical crews on the ground. They have asked to remain anonymous to avoid repercussions.Through telephone conversations with CNN and posts on Chinese social media, they told of low hospital resources. In private groups online, those identified as hospital staff are coordinating with members of the public to import protective equipment as they treat an increasing number of infected patients."In terms of resources, the whole of Wuhan is lacking," one Wuhan-based healthcare worker told CNN by phone. This person said they were looking for more protective clothing, protective goggles and masks.  "It's really like we're going into battle stripped to the waist," one healthcare worker added, using a Chinese idiom that equates to "going into battle without armor". One hospital staff member claims healthcare workers have resorted to wearing diapers to work so as to avoid having to remove their HAZMAT suits, which they say are in short supply. A doctor on her Chinese social media Weibo page described similar accounts at another Wuhan hospital. "My family members are definitely worried about me, but I still have to work," another doctor told. But she said that she is hopeful they will ultimately get the gear they need. "Our bosses, our hospital suppliers will definitely find a way to get these stocks to us," she added.It's not clear if these accounts are anecdotal or whether there are widespread shortages across Wuhan.Chinese state media has also shared posts from multiple Wuhan hospitals in which they ask for public donations of medical supplies. They report that one hospital staff member said the current supplies "are only able to sustain three or four days". The Wuhan Health Commission has requisitioned over 10,000 beds from 24 hospitals to be used in the treatment of confirmed and suspected cases.  On Friday, Wuhan officials acknowledged that local hospitals were struggling to accommodate people seeking medical attention and said measures were being put into place to alleviate the situation.State media also reported that the city aims to build a 25,000 square meter (269,100 square foot) new facility within a week, increasing hospital capacity by 1,000 beds, and that several medical centers in Hubei province are asking for medical gear donations.Locking down the virus over Lunar New YearAuthorities have imposed indefinite restrictions on public transport and travel.All motor vehicles will be banned in Wuhan's city center starting Sunday to control the flow of people, according to the Wuhan Command Center, the taskforce set up to combat the virus. Only vehicles with special permits, free shuttles and government vehicles will be allowed to circulate.Amid the lockdown, countries like the US and France have been attempting to evacuate their citizens from the central Chinese city. The US government is arranging a charter flight to evacuate American diplomats and citizens from Wuhan, a US official with knowledge of the matter told CNN. The French government says it's planning to set up a bus service to move French nationals out of Wuhan.Meanwhile, 56 Indian students have been trapped in Wuhan for three days, with some afraid to leave their dorm room and fearful of running out of food. Ganesan Deepshikha, a student at the Wuhan University School Of Medicine, told CNN that the students have been told by the Indian Embassy that they are safe in Wuhan but have not received any assistance.The virus, which was first discovered in Wuhan in December, has spread to every province in China, except the remote autonomous region of Tibet. Among those infected is a 2-year-old girl in the southern region of Guangxi, the local health authority said. She is believed to be the youngest patient infected.The week-long Lunar New Year holiday, which began Saturday, has led to concerns that the outbreak could quickly accelerate, as hundreds of millions of people travel across the country to visit friends and relatives.Lunar New Year is to China what the Christmas-New Year holiday period is to the United States -- except China's 1.4 billion population is more than four times that of the US.In many cities, festivities have been called off. Authorities in Beijing have canceled all large-scale Lunar New Year celebrations, including traditional fairs and celebrations around temples. Shanghai Disneyland has temporarily closed its doors. Seven blockbuster movies that were set to hit theaters this weekend have been canceled or postponed.Businesses are also taking measures to protect staff and the public. On Saturday, coffee giant Starbucks said it has closed all 90 of its Hubei stores indefinitely. The closures will continue throughout the Spring Festival, which runs until the end of January. "All Starbucks stores and special star delivery in Hubei will be temporarily closed. Hubei employees are asked to rest at home, minimize going out, take care to protect themselves and their families. All store employees who were scheduled to work during the closing period will be paid as usual," a statement from the company said. A global concern On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) moved to declare the coronavirus an emergency within China -- but refrained from classifying the outbreak as an epidemic of international concern.Mounting evidence suggests the virus is spreading outside mainland China, however, with 13 countries and territories reporting confirmed cases, including the United States and France. Australia confirmed that three men who traveled from China to Sydney had tested positive, health authorities in the city said. The country has now confirmed a total of four cases.Nepal also confirmed its first case, a spokesman for the country's Health Ministry told CNN. The patient is a 31-year-old Nepali man studying for his PhD in Wuhan, spokesman Mahendra Kumar Shrestha said. The student flew to Nepal earlier this month and was admitted to a hospital in Kathmandu on January 13 with fever and respiratory problems.In South Korea, the country's Centers for Disease Control has announced a third confirmed case of the virus. A 54-year-old South Korean man who lives in Wuhan and traveled to South Korea on January 20 called a hotline on Saturday to report his symptoms, the agency said.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced that the Hong Kong Disease contingency plan has been upgraded from "serious" to "emergency" level. Schools in the Chinese territory will be suspended until February 17.On Thursday, David Heymann, the chairman of a WHO committee gathering data on the outbreak, said the virus spreads more easily from person to person than previously thought. "We are now seeing second and third generation spread," Heymann said.Coronaviruses are transmitted by animals and people, and the Wuhan strain has been linked to a market in the city that was selling seafood and live animals, including wild species.Third generation means that someone who became infected after handling animals at the market spreads the virus to someone else, who then spreads it to a third person. The announcement marks a development in the progress of the spread of the virus.Heymann said there is no evidence at this point that the virus is airborne and could be spread across a room, as happens with the flu or measles.CNN's Pauline Lockwood, Angus Watson, Chermaine Lee, Junko Ogura, Steven Jiang, Sugam Pokharel, Julia Hollingsworth, Joshua Berlinger, Tara John and Vedika Sud contributed reporting. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

In addition, the Company expects aggregate one-time charges of approximately $10 mln related to the China international agreements and certain unrelated litigation matters in the fourth quarter. For 2020, while the Company does not foresee any significant additional one-time costs or expenses irrespective of the outcome of the Six Flags-branded projects in China, the loss of all the China projects would result in no revenue for that market if Riverside does not cure the default and the Company is not able to engage other partners to complete any of the projects. Separately, the Company's North America parks experienced lower attendance in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the same period in 2018 due to softer than expected season pass and membership sales, primarily during the holiday sales periods. As a result, the Company expects total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 to be less than prior year by $8-$10 mln which would translate to revenues of $259.5-261.5 mln vs $285.6 mln Capital IQ consensus.07:47PCRX Pacira Pharma Chief Medical Officer Richard Scranton resigned effective January 24, 2020 (42.90 )Dr. Scranton has decided to pursue an opportunity at a private, early-stage biotechnology company.

Lastly, in order to meet customer delivery expectations, URBN spent more on delivery and logistics expenses than originally planned.16:34CYRX Cryoport expects to report Q4 revenue of approximately $9.2 mln vs CapitalIQ consensus of $10.4 mln (17.84 -0.13)16:34PYPL PayPal discloses expectation to report pre-tax gain of $38 mln on strategic investments in quarter ended December 31, 2019 (112.57 +0.75)PayPal expects to report a pre-tax gain of $38 mln ($29 mln on an after-tax basis) on the company's strategic investments in the quarter ended December 31, 2019.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.8%) also closed at record highs, while the Russell 2000 increased just 0.1%.The ease in tensions with Iran remained conducive for risk sentiment, even as President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau echoed a Newsweek report that Iranian missiles shot down the Boeing (BA 336.34, +4.97, +1.5%) 737-800 jetliner earlier this week. There was no indication the U.S. would reconsider its de-escalation strategy, though.Other positive factors included 1) upbeat holiday sales results, 2) several analyst upgrades, 3) weekly jobless claims returning to lower levels, and 4) China confirming Vice Premier Liu He will visit Washington from Jan. 13-15 to sign the Phase One trade deal.Apple (AAPL 309.63, +6.44, +2.1%) led the information technology sector (+1.1%) higher after Reuters reported that iPhone sales increased 18% yr/yr in China last month. Costco (COST 299.42, +4.73, +1.6%) led the consumer staples sector (+0.7%) higher after it reported 9.0% yr/yr comparable sales growth for the five weeks ended Jan. 5.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 48.97, +1.14, +2.4%), Goldman Sachs (GS 242.60, +4.84, +2.0%), and Coca-Cola (KO 55.34, +0.99, +1.8%) were among today's stocks that were upgraded to the equivalent of a Buy rating.Given the amount of good news today, then, it's easy to see why calls for a pullback remained unanswered. The persistent bullish momentum in the market exacerbated a fear of missing out on further gains amid a lack of detrimental developments.It's worth noting, though, that Kohl's (KSS 46.15, -3.23, -6.5%) did issue an earnings warning and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY 13.45, -3.20, -19.2%) withdrew its full-year guidance on top of reporting disappointing results. The broader market was not surprised or bothered by the news.U.S. Treasuries finished the session slightly higher. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.86%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.44. WTI crude declined 0.1% to $59.54/bbl.Thursday's economic data was limited to the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report:Initial jobless claims for the week ending January 4 decreased by 9,000 to 214,000 (Briefing.com consensus 225,000). Continuing claims for the week ending December 28 increased by 75,000 to 1.803 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims have settled back down at lower levels, which reflect ongoing tightness in the labor market.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Employment Situation Report for December and Wholesale Inventories for November on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +2.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.5% YTDS&P 500 +1.4% YTDRussell 2000 -0.2% YTD16:21PTLA Portola Pharma plunges to $15.20 in extended hours trading after updating Andexxa guidance (24.74 +0.78)16:20NLOK NortonLifeLock announces special, one-time cash dividend of $12 per share of common stock (shares halted) (26.69 +0.08)The dividend is payable on January 31, 2020 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 23.16:19PTLA Portola Pharma guides Q4 Andexxa global net revenues to approx $28 mln; co to host conf call at 5pm ET (24.74 +0.78)Fourth quarter Andexxa net sales in the U.S. were impacted primarily by two factors: A $5 million gross to net adjustment due to a return reserve for short-dated product. The Company expects this to be mitigated going forward by its current longer-dated, 36-month product, which began shipping in November 2019. Flat quarter over quarter demand due to a decrease in utilization, primarily in tier 1 accounts. While physician demand remains strong, the Company believes that in certain of these accounts, hospital pharmacies curtailed use of Andexxa following drug utilization reviews in an effort to manage pharmacy budgets. Following this reduction, re-ordering patterns are stabilizing in many of these accounts16:18COT Cott acquires Clearwater; terms not disclosed (13.91 -0.28)Cott announced that Cott and Eden Springs, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cott, have acquired 100% of the shares of Hungarian company, Clearwater Kereskedelmi s Szolgltat Korltolt Felelossgu Trsasg.

Three cyclical sectors (financials, consumer discretionary, and energy) trade in the red with energy (-0.3%) sitting at the bottom of the leaderboard.The energy sector outperformed earlier this week when concerns about an escalating conflict with Iran led to a spike in the price of oil. However, these concerns have waned in recent days, which has pressured oil, and, in turn, the energy sector. WTI crude is down $0.36, or 0.6%, at $59.20/bbl. The price of oil is now just above its 50-day moving average (58.70) and it is on track to end the week lower by $3.85 or 6.1%. The energy sector, for its part, is now down 0.7% for the week versus a 1.4% gain in the S&P 500.On a side note, Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, are scheduled to hold a press conference at 10:45 ET, when new sanctions against Iran are likely to be announced.Notable movers:Noble Energy (NBL 21.89, -0.56, -2.5%): weakest sector component, falling below its 50-day moving average (21.93) after slipping below its 200-day moving average (22.46) yesterday.

Marathon Petroleum (MPC 60.12, +0.73, +1.2%): refining stock benefiting from lower price of crude. HollyFrontier (HFC 48.45, +0.29, +0.6%): outperforming alongside other refiners.10:23OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:HD Jan 225 calls are seeing interest with 2730 contracts trading vs. open int of 2730, pushing implied vol up around 12 points to ~28%.

The S&P 500 futures trade six points, or 0.2%, above fair value.145,000 jobs were added to nonfarm payrolls in December, which was less than than the Briefing.com consensus of 160,000 and the November and October readings. Average hourly earnings also increased less than expected at 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).The data might temper some economic growth expectations for the fourth quarter and has likely amplified calls for a pullback due to the market's short-term overbought condition. There still doesn't appear to be too much selling interest this morning, though.Instead, many investors continue to buy the semiconductor stocks like NVIDIA (NVDA 246.50, +3.48, +1.4%) and many suppliers of Apple (AAPL 310.98, +1.35, +0.4%) following positive analyst recommendations.09:07PHAS PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals announces financing and co-development collaboration with SFJ Pharmaceuticals to develop PB2452 (shares halted) (5.65 )The collaboration between SFJ and PhaseBio will support the global development of PB2452, which is designed to reverse the antiplatelet activity of ticagrelor in major bleeding and urgent surgery situations.

In addition, the Company expects aggregate one-time charges of approximately $10 mln related to the China international agreements and certain unrelated litigation matters in the fourth quarter. For 2020, while the Company does not foresee any significant additional one-time costs or expenses irrespective of the outcome of the Six Flags-branded projects in China, the loss of all the China projects would result in no revenue for that market if Riverside does not cure the default and the Company is not able to engage other partners to complete any of the projects. Separately, the Company's North America parks experienced lower attendance in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the same period in 2018 due to softer than expected season pass and membership sales, primarily during the holiday sales periods. As a result, the Company expects total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 to be less than prior year by $8-$10 mln which would translate to revenues of $259.5-261.5 mln vs $285.6 mln Capital IQ consensus.07:47PCRX Pacira Pharma Chief Medical Officer Richard Scranton resigned effective January 24, 2020 (42.90 )Dr. Scranton has decided to pursue an opportunity at a private, early-stage biotechnology company.

Lastly, in order to meet customer delivery expectations, URBN spent more on delivery and logistics expenses than originally planned.16:34CYRX Cryoport expects to report Q4 revenue of approximately $9.2 mln vs CapitalIQ consensus of $10.4 mln (17.84 -0.13)16:34PYPL PayPal discloses expectation to report pre-tax gain of $38 mln on strategic investments in quarter ended December 31, 2019 (112.57 +0.75)PayPal expects to report a pre-tax gain of $38 mln ($29 mln on an after-tax basis) on the company's strategic investments in the quarter ended December 31, 2019.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.8%) also closed at record highs, while the Russell 2000 increased just 0.1%.The ease in tensions with Iran remained conducive for risk sentiment, even as President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau echoed a Newsweek report that Iranian missiles shot down the Boeing (BA 336.34, +4.97, +1.5%) 737-800 jetliner earlier this week. There was no indication the U.S. would reconsider its de-escalation strategy, though.Other positive factors included 1) upbeat holiday sales results, 2) several analyst upgrades, 3) weekly jobless claims returning to lower levels, and 4) China confirming Vice Premier Liu He will visit Washington from Jan. 13-15 to sign the Phase One trade deal.Apple (AAPL 309.63, +6.44, +2.1%) led the information technology sector (+1.1%) higher after Reuters reported that iPhone sales increased 18% yr/yr in China last month. Costco (COST 299.42, +4.73, +1.6%) led the consumer staples sector (+0.7%) higher after it reported 9.0% yr/yr comparable sales growth for the five weeks ended Jan. 5.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 48.97, +1.14, +2.4%), Goldman Sachs (GS 242.60, +4.84, +2.0%), and Coca-Cola (KO 55.34, +0.99, +1.8%) were among today's stocks that were upgraded to the equivalent of a Buy rating.Given the amount of good news today, then, it's easy to see why calls for a pullback remained unanswered. The persistent bullish momentum in the market exacerbated a fear of missing out on further gains amid a lack of detrimental developments.It's worth noting, though, that Kohl's (KSS 46.15, -3.23, -6.5%) did issue an earnings warning and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY 13.45, -3.20, -19.2%) withdrew its full-year guidance on top of reporting disappointing results. The broader market was not surprised or bothered by the news.U.S. Treasuries finished the session slightly higher. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.86%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.44. WTI crude declined 0.1% to $59.54/bbl.Thursday's economic data was limited to the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report:Initial jobless claims for the week ending January 4 decreased by 9,000 to 214,000 (Briefing.com consensus 225,000). Continuing claims for the week ending December 28 increased by 75,000 to 1.803 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims have settled back down at lower levels, which reflect ongoing tightness in the labor market.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Employment Situation Report for December and Wholesale Inventories for November on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +2.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.5% YTDS&P 500 +1.4% YTDRussell 2000 -0.2% YTD16:21PTLA Portola Pharma plunges to $15.20 in extended hours trading after updating Andexxa guidance (24.74 +0.78)16:20NLOK NortonLifeLock announces special, one-time cash dividend of $12 per share of common stock (shares halted) (26.69 +0.08)The dividend is payable on January 31, 2020 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 23.16:19PTLA Portola Pharma guides Q4 Andexxa global net revenues to approx $28 mln; co to host conf call at 5pm ET (24.74 +0.78)Fourth quarter Andexxa net sales in the U.S. were impacted primarily by two factors: A $5 million gross to net adjustment due to a return reserve for short-dated product. The Company expects this to be mitigated going forward by its current longer-dated, 36-month product, which began shipping in November 2019. Flat quarter over quarter demand due to a decrease in utilization, primarily in tier 1 accounts. While physician demand remains strong, the Company believes that in certain of these accounts, hospital pharmacies curtailed use of Andexxa following drug utilization reviews in an effort to manage pharmacy budgets. Following this reduction, re-ordering patterns are stabilizing in many of these accounts16:18COT Cott acquires Clearwater; terms not disclosed (13.91 -0.28)Cott announced that Cott and Eden Springs, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cott, have acquired 100% of the shares of Hungarian company, Clearwater Kereskedelmi s Szolgltat Korltolt Felelossgu Trsasg.

The Uighur diaspora fears that coronavirus will spread to detainee campsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 11, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 487 wordsBodyThe Uighur diaspora is now trying to warn about the risks of a "massive contagion" of the new coronavirus in the fields of northwest China, where hundreds of thousands of its compatriots would be detained in deplorable conditions."Panic is settling in. Our families are there, trapped between concentration camps and viruses, we don't know what happens to them, if they have to eat, if they have masks," explains French sociologist dilur Reyhan.A petition in Change.org and multiple social media positions call on the international community to worry about the problem, starting with the World Health Organization (WHO).In these calls, WHO is called upon to send a delegation to the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, whose capital is Urumqi.Experts and human rights organizations accuse Beijing of having at least one million Muslims, mainly Uighurs, Turkic minority, interned in Xinjiang.China denies this and asserts that these are "vocational training centres" to prevent extremism and radicalization through the teaching of Mandarin and professional skills.Questioned by the AFP about any prevention measures taken at these centres, the Xinjiang government did not respond."If the international community fails to obtain adequate measures from China to prevent the epidemic in the region, the nature of its massive network of concentration camps and forced labour adds another dimension to China's ongoing Uighur genocide" , proclaims the petition, which calls for the "release of 3 million Uighurs before the spread of the epidemic to detention camps".If not, "the consequences will be catastrophic (...) as information on these camps gives an account of great overpopulation, famine, forced labour, sexual abuse and torture," he continues- Potential "Disaster" -In a statement issued in late January, the Uighur World Congress (WUC) was concerned about the risks in "Eastern Turkestan" (a term used by Uighur separatists to designate Xinjiang), and especially in the camps, where people are "vulnerable" and is "weakened by the Chinese government's ill-treatment and abuse," its President Dolkun Isa stresses.This opinion is shared by sinologists and experts.The French immigrationist Norbert Gualde says in effect "to ignore precisely what conditions Uighurs and other detainees in The Chinese camps live".But for him, detention is not the best environment to fight the disease. "There is good reason to believe that their detention is synonymous with imposed promiscuity, stress, depression, fear, all of them circumstances that favor the transmission of the virus among those who are obliged to live confined.""Coronavirus could give a different dimension to the Xinjiang crisis," abounded in a tweet, following confirmation of the first case of coronavirus in Xinjiang, sinologist Adrian Zenz.As of 5 February, 32 cases had been officially confirmed in Xinjiang, according to the Chinese embassy in France.jg/mw/mba/me/mbLoad-Date: February 12, 2020End of Document

CRU: Coronavirus: Assessing the Likely Impact on Copper SmeltingPR NewswireJanuary 31, 2020 Friday 7:48 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 584 wordsDateline: LONDON, Jan. 31, 2020 BodyPR NewswireThe number of people infected with the coronavirus in China has reached nearly 6,000, and Hubei province, which is home to 60 million people, has been put on lockdown since the outbreak. From a copper smelting perspective, the province is of limited importance, accounting for only 3.9% of China's 2019 blister production. Any impact on the neighbouring Anhui and Jiangxi provinces would be more significant, but all assessments remain highly speculative at this early stage.Infections in China outnumber the 2003 Sars outbreakIn only a couple of weeks, the number of people infected with the coronavirus in China has reached nearly 6,000, surpassing the number of Sars cases in the country during the 2003 outbreak. The death toll has reached 132 in China, with confirmed cases reported in at least 12 other countries, including the US, Japan, France and Singapore.Wuhan, as well as the wider Hubei province, has implemented strict transport restrictions. On top of this, the Chinese government has extended the Chinese New Year public holidays, to delay the mass migration of people back to work.From a copper smelting perspective, the province of Hubei is of limited importance and centred around the smelting operations of Daye, located around 100 km from Wuhan. The company's smelter produced 320,000 t of blister copper in 2019, accounting for only 3.9% of China's total blister production. Moreover, market participants have confirmed that Daye's smelter is operating at time of writing. The company also has a 400,000 t/y smelter project due online in 2021.In comparison, Hubei's copper mine production last year was minimal at just over 50,000 t out of a country total of 1.6 Mt.Participants wait to assess impact on concentrates marketAny assessment of the likely impact of the virus on the Chinese smelting industry and copper concentrates market remains highly speculative at this early stage. However, we do know that several market participants have confirmed cancelling travel plans to China, while we have also heard that a CSPT meeting scheduled for last week was postponed due to the virus, meaning that any further decisions regarding previously proposed smelter production cuts have not taken place.Read the full story:https://www.crugroup.com/knowledge-and-insights/insights/2020/coronavirus-what-is-the-likely-impact-on-copper-smelting/Read more about CRU:http://bit.ly/About_CRUAbout CRUCRU offers unrivalled business intelligence on the global metals, mining and fertilizer industries through market analysis, price assessments, consultancy and events.Since our foundation by Robert Perlman in 1969, we have consistently invested in primary research and robust methodologies, and developed expert teams in key locations worldwide, including in hard-to-reach markets such as China.CRU employs over 280 experts and has more than 11 offices around the world, in Europe, the Americas, China, Asia and Australia - our office in Beijing opened in 2004 and Singapore in 2018.When facing critical business decisions, you can rely on our first-hand knowledge to give you a complete view of a commodity market.

Business HighlightsAssociated Press InternationalJanuary 15, 2020 Wednesday 10:03 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; Business HighlightsLength: 918 wordsByline: By The Associated PressBody___US, China deal aims to simmer long-running trade tensionsWASHINGTON (AP) - The United States and China have signed what's being called a first phase trade agreement aimed at lowering tensions in the long-running dispute between the world's two biggest economies. The deal signed at the White House on Wednesday by President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is expected to boost exports from U.S. farmers and manufacturers and protect American trade secrets. But the agreement leaves unresolved many of the complaints voiced by the Trump administration when it started the trade war by imposing tariffs on Chinese imports in July 2018. Chief among those complaints is the way the Chinese government subsidizes its companies.___Slight gains send Dow Jones Industrial Average above 29,000NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks ended a wobbly day with modest gains, enough to send the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its first close above 29,000 points, two months after its first close above 28,000. Traders were hopeful that the signing of a preliminary trade deal between the U.S. and China Wednesday would help bring about better relations between the two economic superpowers. Health care stocks led the gains. UnitedHealth rose after reporting solid earnings.___US firm offers free cybersecurity help to federal campaignsWASHINGTON (AP) - A major U.S. web infrastructure and security company says it will provide free cybersecurity support to federal election campaigns. The goal is to help thwart a repeat of the large-scale effort by Russian agents in 2016 to steal and leak sensitive campaign emails and documents. San Francisco-based Cloudflare said Wednesday it will provide access to several of its security services, including enhanced protection of firewalls, which defend networks from unauthorized access.___Groups push for 'Medicare for All' support as primaries nearCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - With just weeks to go until the first contests of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary campaign, several groups are organizing grassroots efforts aimed at convincing voters they should back candidates who fully support the "Medicare for All" legislation from which the phrase is derived. The signature Medicare for All health care proposal of Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential effort has, in concept, stood for a single-payer, government-run health care system. But the phrase has become somewhat of an umbrella term for a variety of plans to revamp and otherwise reconfigure the existing system.___Target, like other retailers, did not have a Merry ChristmasNEW YORK (AP) - Target's rare miss in holiday sales raises concerns about the challenges ahead for the retail industry. The discounter is reporting comparable-store sales that are well below last year's, joining a growing list of retailers with meager performances during the critical holiday shopping season. Target said it experienced weaker-than-expected sales of electronics, toys and home goods. The company's same-store sales climbed 1.4% in the November-December period, compared with a very strong 5.7% increase a year earlier. Still, analysts blame the disappointing sales on increasing competition from online retailers, and say that the consumer is still financially strong.___Does the naked body belong on Facebook? It's complicatedSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The unclothed human body accounts for the bulk of the material Facebook removes from its service and some people are not happy. Facebook is tweaking its original heavy-handed policies to account for modern nuances around gender identity, political speech and self-expression. But some activists, sex therapists, artists and sex educators say the company is unfairly censoring their work, suspending them in "Facebook jail" with no warning and little, if any recourse. Facebook's monitoring systems do a better job with nudity than with hate speech, extremism and misinformation. But deciding when a nipple is art, porn or protest gets murky.___Think tank says UAW deals increased automakers' labor costsDETROIT (AP) - New contracts between the United Auto Workers union and Detroit's three automakers substantially increased the cost gap between Detroit and foreign automakers with U.S. factories. That's according to industry think tank The Center for Automotive Research. It calculated that General Motors and Ford will see their total costs grow $8 per hour, while Fiat Chrysler's will rise by $11 an hour during the new four-year contracts. The center calculated that on average, foreign-owned factories will only see a $2 per hour increase in the same period.___Environmental issues top worries for those heading to DavosLONDON (AP) - A survey of key decision-makers carried out for the World Economic Forum identifies environmental issues as the top five global risks over the coming decade. The World Economic Forum organizes next week's gathering of economic and political elites in the Swiss ski resort of Davos. It sounded the alarm bell Wednesday on potentially catastrophic challenges, like the climate crisis and the mass extinction of animal species. The concerns are especially acute, it added, at a time of growing international division, evident in the trade tensions between the United States and China.___The S&P 500 index rose 6.14 points, or 0.2%, to 3,289.29. The Dow gained 90.55 points, or 0.3%, to 29,030.22. The Nasdaq composite added 7.37 points, or 0.1%, to 9,258.70. The Russell 2000 of smaller-company stocks picked up 6.66 points, or 0.4%, to 1,682.40.Load-Date: January 16, 2020End of Document

Beyond silly videos: Why TikTok matters; With more than 700 million daily active users, the app TikTok has taken the world by storm. What is it and why does it matter?The Christian Science MonitorJanuary 6, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights ReservedSection: TechnologyLength: 766 wordsByline: Eoin O'Carroll Staff writerBodyTikTok, a social network thought to be indispensable to Generation Z and incomprehensible to everyone else, is not just another smartphone app. The video-sharing service has become a cultural phenomenon on a par with YouTube and Instagram, complete with its own lingo, etiquette, and celebrities. As of late last year, it has been downloaded 1.5 billion times, with 700 million active daily users. TikTok is also owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company. As it rises to become one of the world's most popular online services, TikTok is also spreading norms that may stand at odds with the free-speech-über-alles ethos long advanced by Silicon Valley. U.S. military branches have banned the social media app on government-issued smartphones after the Pentagon warned them last month to delete the app.What is TikTok?It began in 2014 as a Chinese-owned platform called Musical.ly, where users could upload short looping videos of themselves lip-syncing songs. In 2018, Musical.ly merged with TikTok, another Chinese-owned video-sharing service launched a year earlier. Today, the app is known for viral lip-sync videos, silly pranks, memes, and "challenges" - some posed by the company itself. Compared with other social networks, TikTok skews very young."The app has become very popular by successfully combining a lot of features of both current and defunct social media popular with youth," writes Ioana Literat, Columbia University communications professor, in an email to the Monitor. "It revolves around creating short, looping, share-worthy videos just like the now-defunct Vine, it includes the aspirational you-can-become-a-famous-influencer-too ethos of Instagram or YouTube, while at the same time also capitalizing on existing friend networks just like Snapchat."But, as with any platform, people have found their own uses for TikTok, including political expression. "Teens are organizing strikes on TikTok, or sharing feminist performance art," says Professor Literat. "Not all content is brainless fun."Does it matter that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company?It does, because it shapes the terms of service and, importantly, determines where the user's data is stored. For instance, Feroza Aziz, a high school student in New Jersey, learned this when she was blocked from her TikTok account after posting a 40-second clip about China's crackdown on Muslim Uyghurs.The company's moderation guidelines, as reported by The Guardian, prohibit any "criticism/attack towards policies, social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, monarchy, parliamentary system, separation of powers, socialism system, etc." In December, TikTok admitted that it had policies suppressing videos of members of the LGBTQ community, people with disabilities, people with neurodiverse conditions, and obese people. The company said that the rules were in place to protect vulnerable users from cyberbullying."All social media platforms censor content, to greater or lesser degrees, and not always in keeping with their official terms and conditions," writes Professor Literat. "However, when the Chinese government, one of the most powerful in the world, is a player in this equation, it all becomes infinitely more complicated, and the stakes are higher."David Carroll, a media design professor at The New School in New York City, understands very well how location matters when it comes to personal data. He was one of 87 million Facebook users in the United States whose personal information was used by the British firm Cambridge Analytica to target ads for Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. He is trying to get his data back through the British legal system's privacy protections."Where our data is stored is extremely significant because we can either gain or lose rights depending on it," says Professor Carroll, whose efforts are chronicled in the Netflix documentary "The Great Hack."Is it OK to use TikTok?"We make the best choices we can about using technologies, but we really don't have enough information to make the most informed choices," says Professor Carroll. "And in the case of TikTok, it's even more difficult to get understandable answers."But, as with most technologies, it really depends on how you use it. "I tend to be generally optimistic about youth online participation, so I do think TikTok can be a place of powerful self-expression, social connection, and yes, even meaningful political talk," says Professor Literat, who also suggests older users might enjoy the app, too. "I'd say approach it with an open mind ... and buy into its very particular weirdness and charms."Load-Date: January 6, 2020End of Document

All rights reserved.This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.Length: 15493 wordsBodyHourly In Play (R)Updated: 10-Jan-20 12:00 ET11:54ENDP Endo Intl subsidiaries settle opioid investigation with the State of Oklahoma for $8.75 mln (4.49 +0.08)The Settlement Agreement fully and finally resolves Oklahoma's investigation of the Settling Parties in connection with the opioid abuse crisis in Oklahoma and includes a release of all associated claims by Oklahoma to the Settling Parties and all of their affiliated entities. In connection with the Settlement Agreement, Endo Pharmaceuticals has agreed to pay $8.75 mln to Oklahoma. The Settlement Agreement includes no admission of wrongdoing, fault or liability of any kind by the Endo Affiliates. The amount paid in connection with the Settlement Agreement is a fraction of the settlement and judgment amounts associated with other opioid manufacturers in Oklahoma to date.11:50TALKX Market Briefing: Starting to turn a little defensiveThe stock market is walking a steady line today, but it hasn't crossed the line yet that involves a broad-based wave of selling interest, which some think is overdue. Instead, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed the 29,000 line earlier, continuing its record-setting run.Today's action has been mixed so far, however, partly on a sense that some exhaustion might be setting in after a busy week filled with a lot of headline angst.The latter point notwithstanding, the S&P 500 is up 1.4% for the week, following through on a great fourth quarter rally to end 2019. So, the idea that it is overbought on a short-term basis and due for a pullback continues to hang out there and has participants on close watch for a reversal trade.Today has had a little more guarded feel to it. The information technology sector (+0.2%) has remained an important leadership group, yet some of the more defensive-oriented areas of the market -- real estate (+0.6%), utilities (+0.5%), health care (+0.3%), and consumer staples (+0.1%) -- are stepping up. Also, long-term yields continue to come down.The 10-yr note yield is down four basis points to 1.82% following the December employment report, which was a bit light on job growth, but noticeably light on average hourly earnings growth and the length of the average workweek, and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announcing new sanctions on Iran.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is flat; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%; and the Russell 2000 is down 0.3%.11:31NLSN Nielsen acquires Precima from Alliance Data Systems (ADS); terms not disclosed (20.04 -0.05)Nielsen Global Connect has completed its acquisition of Precima, an industry-leading, SaaS-based provider of powerful retail and customer data applications and analytics, from Alliance Data Systems. By bringing Precima into its measurement framework, Nielsen Global Connect will achieve a heightened advantage in the loyalty and personalization space, furthering its ability to help brands plan and measure the impact and success of personalized consumer offerings.10:40XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (60.01 -0.14)The major averages started the Friday session on a modestly higher note, but there are a few soft spots in the market. Three cyclical sectors (financials, consumer discretionary, and energy) trade in the red with energy (-0.3%) sitting at the bottom of the leaderboard.The energy sector outperformed earlier this week when concerns about an escalating conflict with Iran led to a spike in the price of oil. However, these concerns have waned in recent days, which has pressured oil, and, in turn, the energy sector. WTI crude is down $0.36, or 0.6%, at $59.20/bbl. The price of oil is now just above its 50-day moving average (58.70) and it is on track to end the week lower by $3.85 or 6.1%. The energy sector, for its part, is now down 0.7% for the week versus a 1.4% gain in the S&P 500.On a side note, Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, are scheduled to hold a press conference at 10:45 ET, when new sanctions against Iran are likely to be announced.Notable movers:Noble Energy (NBL 21.89, -0.56, -2.5%): weakest sector component, falling below its 50-day moving average (21.93) after slipping below its 200-day moving average (22.46) yesterday. Devon Energy (DVN 25.40, -0.45, -1.7%): sliding below its 200-day moving average (25.80). Cabot Oil & Gas (COG 17.15, -0.12, -0.7%): trying to remain above its 50-day moving average (17.10). Valero Energy (VLO 96.58, +1.40, +1.5%): refining name boosted by lower price of crude, rising to its 50-day moving average (96.31). Marathon Petroleum (MPC 60.12, +0.73, +1.2%): refining stock benefiting from lower price of crude. HollyFrontier (HFC 48.45, +0.29, +0.6%): outperforming alongside other refiners.10:23OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:HD Jan 225 calls are seeing interest with 2730 contracts trading vs. open int of 2730, pushing implied vol up around 12 points to ~28%.

The S&P 500 is flat, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the health care (+0.4%) and utilities (+0.4%) sectors outperforming the broader market, while the energy (-0.3%), financials (-0.3%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors underperform.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower. The 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.56%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index is little changed at 97.48. WTI crude is down 0.8% to $59.07/bbl.09:21WIRES On The WiresParsley Energy (PE) has completed its acquisition of Jagged Peak Energy (JAG). The acquisition was previously approved by Parsley shareholders at a special meeting held on January 9, where more than 99.5% of the votes cast by Parsley stockholders were voted in favor of the proposal to issue Parsley common stock to the holders of Jagged Peak common stock as consideration for the acquisition.Western Union (WU) and Du Xiaoman Financial and its network of bank partners today launched Western Union international money transfers to be paid out in real-time into even more bank accounts in China, with coverage now extending to a majority of bank account holders across China.Illumina (ILMN) has filed two additional patent infringement suits relating to BGI's sequencing products, including the DNBSeq-400, DNBSeq-T7, and related chemistry reagents. The first complaint was filed against MGI Tech Co. and Latvia MGI Tech SIA in the UK alleging infringement of four patents. The second complaint was filed against Latvia MGI Tech SIA in Sweden alleging infringement of EP 3 002 289 B1. Separately, Illumina also today announced a non-exclusive, multi-year partnership with ArcherDX to co-market a portfolio of planned in-vitro diagnostic tests. Upon FDA approval, ArcherDX anticipates the first IVD to be marketed under the partnership will be the ArcherDX STRATAFIDE companion diagnostic.Following the popularization of digital payment methods, Linx (LINX) has announced its partnership with PicPay, one of Brazil's largest payment apps with over 13 mln users, to offer retailers a new option for their customers from January. The joint action between Linx and PicPay will bring the potential for users to make QR Code payments at more than 100,000 establishments operating the Linx system.09:12WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +5.90. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +27.90.The stock market is still on pace to open higher despite the December employment report showing jobs growth slow down more than expected. The S&P 500 futures trade six points, or 0.2%, above fair value.145,000 jobs were added to nonfarm payrolls in December, which was less than than the Briefing.com consensus of 160,000 and the November and October readings. Average hourly earnings also increased less than expected at 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).The data might temper some economic growth expectations for the fourth quarter and has likely amplified calls for a pullback due to the market's short-term overbought condition. There still doesn't appear to be too much selling interest this morning, though.Instead, many investors continue to buy the semiconductor stocks like NVIDIA (NVDA 246.50, +3.48, +1.4%) and many suppliers of Apple (AAPL 310.98, +1.35, +0.4%) following positive analyst recommendations.09:07PHAS PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals announces financing and co-development collaboration with SFJ Pharmaceuticals to develop PB2452 (shares halted) (5.65 )The collaboration between SFJ and PhaseBio will support the global development of PB2452, which is designed to reverse the antiplatelet activity of ticagrelor in major bleeding and urgent surgery situations.

The company currently does not expect any material financial impact of the agreement to be realized in its fourth quarter 2019 earnings.Revenue (TRASM) -- The change in midpoint from previous guidance is due primarily to lower than planned yields in the pre-Thanksgiving period and higher completion factor throughout the quarter. Demand remains strong and December revenue performance exceeded the company's expectations. CASM -- The company now expects its fourth quarter total cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and net special items to be up approximately 1% to 3%1 yearover-year versus its previous guidance of up 2% to 4%. The change versus previous guidance is due primarily to improved operational performance and higher completion factor...

In addition, the Company expects aggregate one-time charges of approximately $10 mln related to the China international agreements and certain unrelated litigation matters in the fourth quarter. For 2020, while the Company does not foresee any significant additional one-time costs or expenses irrespective of the outcome of the Six Flags-branded projects in China, the loss of all the China projects would result in no revenue for that market if Riverside does not cure the default and the Company is not able to engage other partners to complete any of the projects. Separately, the Company's North America parks experienced lower attendance in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the same period in 2018 due to softer than expected season pass and membership sales, primarily during the holiday sales periods. As a result, the Company expects total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 to be less than prior year by $8-$10 mln which would translate to revenues of $259.5-261.5 mln vs $285.6 mln Capital IQ consensus.07:47PCRX Pacira Pharma Chief Medical Officer Richard Scranton resigned effective January 24, 2020 (42.90 )Dr. Scranton has decided to pursue an opportunity at a private, early-stage biotechnology company.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.8%) also closed at record highs, while the Russell 2000 increased just 0.1%.The ease in tensions with Iran remained conducive for risk sentiment, even as President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau echoed a Newsweek report that Iranian missiles shot down the Boeing (BA 336.34, +4.97, +1.5%) 737-800 jetliner earlier this week. There was no indication the U.S. would reconsider its de-escalation strategy, though.Other positive factors included 1) upbeat holiday sales results, 2) several analyst upgrades, 3) weekly jobless claims returning to lower levels, and 4) China confirming Vice Premier Liu He will visit Washington from Jan. 13-15 to sign the Phase One trade deal.Apple (AAPL 309.63, +6.44, +2.1%) led the information technology sector (+1.1%) higher after Reuters reported that iPhone sales increased 18% yr/yr in China last month. Costco (COST 299.42, +4.73, +1.6%) led the consumer staples sector (+0.7%) higher after it reported 9.0% yr/yr comparable sales growth for the five weeks ended Jan. 5.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 48.97, +1.14, +2.4%), Goldman Sachs (GS 242.60, +4.84, +2.0%), and Coca-Cola (KO 55.34, +0.99, +1.8%) were among today's stocks that were upgraded to the equivalent of a Buy rating.Given the amount of good news today, then, it's easy to see why calls for a pullback remained unanswered. The persistent bullish momentum in the market exacerbated a fear of missing out on further gains amid a lack of detrimental developments.It's worth noting, though, that Kohl's (KSS 46.15, -3.23, -6.5%) did issue an earnings warning and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY 13.45, -3.20, -19.2%) withdrew its full-year guidance on top of reporting disappointing results. The broader market was not surprised or bothered by the news.U.S. Treasuries finished the session slightly higher. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.86%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.44. WTI crude declined 0.1% to $59.54/bbl.Thursday's economic data was limited to the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report:Initial jobless claims for the week ending January 4 decreased by 9,000 to 214,000 (Briefing.com consensus 225,000). Continuing claims for the week ending December 28 increased by 75,000 to 1.803 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims have settled back down at lower levels, which reflect ongoing tightness in the labor market.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Employment Situation Report for December and Wholesale Inventories for November on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +2.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.5% YTDS&P 500 +1.4% YTDRussell 2000 -0.2% YTD16:21PTLA Portola Pharma plunges to $15.20 in extended hours trading after updating Andexxa guidance (24.74 +0.78)16:20NLOK NortonLifeLock announces special, one-time cash dividend of $12 per share of common stock (shares halted) (26.69 +0.08)The dividend is payable on January 31, 2020 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 23.16:19PTLA Portola Pharma guides Q4 Andexxa global net revenues to approx $28 mln; co to host conf call at 5pm ET (24.74 +0.78)Fourth quarter Andexxa net sales in the U.S. were impacted primarily by two factors: A $5 million gross to net adjustment due to a return reserve for short-dated product. The Company expects this to be mitigated going forward by its current longer-dated, 36-month product, which began shipping in November 2019. Flat quarter over quarter demand due to a decrease in utilization, primarily in tier 1 accounts. While physician demand remains strong, the Company believes that in certain of these accounts, hospital pharmacies curtailed use of Andexxa following drug utilization reviews in an effort to manage pharmacy budgets. Following this reduction, re-ordering patterns are stabilizing in many of these accounts16:18COT Cott acquires Clearwater; terms not disclosed (13.91 -0.28)Cott announced that Cott and Eden Springs, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cott, have acquired 100% of the shares of Hungarian company, Clearwater Kereskedelmi s Szolgltat Korltolt Felelossgu Trsasg.

Fourth quarter 2019 worldwide da Vinci procedures increased approximately 19% yr/yr and FY19 worldwide da Vinci procedures increased approximately 18% compared with 2018.The growth in overall procedure volume in 2019 was primarily driven by growth in U.S. general surgery procedures and worldwide urologic procedures.

The findings build on the previously reported three-month interim analysis, after two vaccinations, announced at the company's R&D Day in September 2019. mRNA-1647 is a wholly owned program in Moderna's prophylactic vaccines portfolio.The second interim analysis of the Phase 1 trial reports safety and immunogenicity of the first three dose levels (30, 90 and 180 g) through seven months (one month after the third vaccination) and the highest dose level (300 g) through three months (one month after the second vaccination). Neutralizing antibody titers were assessed in two assays utilizing epithelial cells and fibroblasts, which measure immune response to pentamer and gB antigens, respectively.Safety data were consistent with those reported at the three-month interim analysis. The vaccine was generally well-tolerated and there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events. As reported in the previous interim analysis, one related Grade 4 adverse event (AE) has been observed, which was an isolated lab finding of elevated partial thromboplastin time, which was elevated at baseline (Grade 1) and self-resolved on the next lab test with no associated clinical findings. Additionally, the company announced that the first participant was dosed in the Phase 2 dose-confirmation study.With the seven-month Phase 1 data and the launch of the Phase 2 study, the company is actively preparing for a global randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy of mRNA-1647 against primary CMV infection. Moderna has solicited and received Type C meeting feedback from the FDA on the preliminary design of the pivotal trial, which will evaluate prevention of primary CMV infection in a population that includes women of childbearing age.16:04EPRT Essential Properties Realty Trust has commenced 6.25 mln share common stock offering (25.48 +0.24)16:03RARE Ultragenyx Pharma reports "positive topline cohort 3 results" and "improved cohort 2" results from Phase 1/2 study of DTX301 (53.76 -0.27)Co announces topline positive safety and efficacy data from Cohort 3 and longer-term data from Cohort 2 of the ongoing Phase 1/2 study of DTX301, an investigational adeno-associated virus gene therapy for the treatment of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.In Cohort 3, there were two confirmed female responders as well a third potential male responder who requires longer-term follow-up to confirm response status.In Cohort 2, one female patient has newly demonstrated a response starting at Week 52 which was confirmed at Week 78. The two previously disclosed responders in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 also remain clinically and metabolically stable at 104 and 78 weeks, respectively. Across all nine patients dosed in the study, up to six patients have demonstrated a response.As of the data cutoff date, there have been no infusion-related adverse events and no treatment-related serious adverse events reported in the study. All adverse events have been Grade 1 or 2.RARE is continuing discussions with the FDA regarding the potential Phase 3 study design. Ammonia is expected to be a primary endpoint based on direct FDA feedback to date, with ureagenesis as a measure of biologic activity that supports the decision for patients to discontinue alternate pathway medications.Co states, "We are encouraged to see a more uniform response at the higher doses including three female responders.

The S&P 500 is flat, the Nasdaq Composite is flat, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.Nonfarm payrolls grew by 145,000 in December, which was less than the Briefing.com consensus of 160,000 and less than the readings for November and October. Overall not a bad report, but it may have tempered some growth expectations for the fourth quarter.The market isn't overly reacting to the data, cognizant that the economy is still in good shape, but selling pressure has been kept in check despite calls for a pullback. Buying efforts, however, have shifted to the defensive-oriented real estate (+0.7%), utilities (+0.4%), and health care (+0.3%) sectors.Conversely, the financials sector (-0.4%) is being pressured by some curve-flattening action in the Treasury market while the industrials sector (-0.4%) is being dragged lower by shares of top-weighted Boeing (BA 332.48, -3.86, -1.2%). The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.82%.Boeing shares are back on the retreat after disparaging employee memos about the 737 MAX were released. On a related, Boeing supplier Spirit Aerosystems (SPR 70.85, -1.94, -2.7%) said it will eliminate 2,800 jobs, according to CNBC.In other corporate news, Six Flags (SIX 35.36, -8.41, -19.2%) issued disappointing Q4 guidance, KB Home (KBH 35.96, -1.10, -3.0%) missed revenue estimates, and GrubHub (GRUB 51.80, -3.93, -7.1%) denied prior rumors about a sale. Dermira (DERM 19.25, +0.91, +5.0%) has agreed to be acquired by Eli Lilly (LLY 137.98, +2.06, +1.5%) for $1.1 billion in cash.Reviewing today's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for December:December nonfarm payrolls increased by 145,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), private sector payrolls increased by 139,000 (Briefing.com consensus 157,000), the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%), and average hourly earnings were up 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The key takeaway from the report, which included updates to the seasonal adjustment factors for the labor force series derived from the household survey, was that average hourly earnings and the average workweek were both weaker than expected. That may temper any inflation concerns, but at the same time it is apt to temper consumer spending activity and overall GDP growth expectations for the fourth quarter.Wholesale inventories decreased 0.1% m/m in November (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing 0.1% in October. Wholesale sales surged 1.5% after declining 0.9% in October.The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity was strong in November, but it will still prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.12:38SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Portola Pharma (PTLA) slumps on fourth quarter Andexxa revenue expectations -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersSRNE (4.71 +38.12%): Received a non-binding proposal from a private equity fund offering to acquire a majority or all of co's issued and outstanding shares for up to $7.00/share. The stock closed yesterday at $3.41, meaning that the cap price indicated in the proposal would represent a more than +100% premium to recent levels. The stock last traded above $7.00 in July of 2018. At nine-month highs.RVNC (18.66 +13.18%): Signed a US distribution agreement with TEOXANE SA that makes co the exclusive commercialization partner of TEOXANE's Resilient Hyaluronic Acid technology, including the FDA-approved RHA 2, RHA 3, and RHA 4 products, which include lidocaine. The agreement also includes RHA 1, currently in clinical trials, as well as an ongoing collaboration for other pipeline candidates and a right of first negotiation to access TEOXANE's "novel cosmeceutical line" incorporating RHA technology. The deal and the RHA line give co "access to the fast-growing, billion-dollar U.S. dermal filler market," further positioning co to be the "innovation leader" in the US market for facial injectables. Co, now building out a US commercial organization, targets introduction of TEOXANE RHA fillers in Q2 of 2020. Co has agreed to issue 2.5 mln of its common shares to TEOXANE SA in consideration for the US distribution rights factored into the transaction. ZYXI (10.75 +10.04%): Continued strength following co's Q4 orders update, which was released yesterday morning; orders grew +129% yr/yr in the quarter and +31% sequentially, leading co to raise its outlook for Q4 revs and adj. EBITDA. At one-month highs.Small Cap LosersPTLA (13.98 -43.49%): Announced preliminary Q4 global net revs for Andexxa of $28 mln, including $4 mln from sales of Ondexxya in Europe. Andexxa/Ondexxya had achieved net product revs of $35.7 mln in Q3. Approx. 90 new accounts ordered Andexxa in the US in Q4. Andexxa's US performance was impacted by a $5 mln gross to net adjustment due to a return reserve for short-dated product and flat demand sequentially due to a decrease in utilization, primarily in tier 1 accounts -- co believes that in certain accounts, hospital pharmacies curtailed Andexxa use following drug utilization reviews to manage budgets. Co anticipates "continued strong demand" for Andexxa in 2020 in connection with Factor Xa inhibitor market growth. Oppenheimer cut co's rating to Perform; the firm had expected Q4 Andexxa revs of approx. $39 mln. At all-time lows. MTNB (1.47 -23.04%): Announced a public offering of 32.26 mln shares of its common stock, priced at $1.55/share, for expected gross proceeds of approx. $50.0 mln, which will be put toward purposes including developing co's product candidates, primarily MAT9001. At one-month lows. SPWH (6.63 -16.98%): Lowered its Q4 revenue and earnings guidance below consensus; the quarter's same store sales are expected to decline by 6-7% yr/yr. Results were impacted by "temporary headwinds," driven by competitors discounting firearm and ammunition inventory while exiting those categories as well as difficult yr/yr comparisons connected to certain legislative changes, all of which, exacerbated by the shorter holiday season, hurt traffic and sales more than co had originally projected. Co emphasizes "outsized growth" in its online channel and normalized store traffic trends noted in January, and it believes that competitive changes and industry consolidation will ultimately bode well for co over the long term, despite the short-term headwinds that they have engendered. At two-month lows.12:24SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (123) outpacing new lows (14) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: A, AAPL, AB, ACGL, ACIA, ACM, ADBE, ADSK, ADUS, AGN, AIZ, AKAM, ALL, AMRC, ANSS, APO, APPF, ARD, ATH, ATRC, AXE, AY, B, BBY, BDX, BIO, BKNG, BLDR, BLK, BMY, BRKR, BRO, CACI, CDAY, CNNE, COLL, COUP, CRL, CRM, CROX, CTXS, DERM, DOV, DXCM, EL, EMR, ENTG, EPAM, EQH, FB, FICO, FIS, FISV, FIVN, FRTA, GBT, GOOGL, GPN, GWW, HESM, HII, HRC, INFO, ISRG, JELD, KMI, KO, KRNT, LAMR, LAZ, LDOS, LLY, LMAT, LVS, MA, MASI, MCO, MDT, MIC, MS, MSA, MSFT, MTN, NLOK, NOW, NUVA, NVDA, PAYC, PCTY, PEGA, POWI, PRFT, RMD, RPAY, SAIC, SEDG, SHOP, SNPS, SNX, SPGI, SPNS, SYNH, TDG, TGTX, TJX, TKR, TMO, TREX, TROW, TRU, V, VAR, VEC, WCG, WLTW, WSC, WSM, XENE, XLRN, YNDX, YUMC, ZNGA, ZYMEStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ASIX, CEIX, CNK, CONN, DD, GCI, GOSS, GPOR, HRTG, MAC, PTLA, S, SIX, WETFThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CABO, CSWI, HURN, SARETFs that traded to 52 week highs: BKF, DIA, EEB, EWC, EWG, GXC, HYG, IGV, IHI, IOO, IWF, IYF, IYH, IYJ, JNK, OEF, PBD, PFF, PHO, PPA, PSK, QQQ, RSX, RTH, SKYY, SOCL, SPY, UYG, VTI, XLI, XLK, XLVETFs that traded to 52 week lows: VXX, VXZ11:54ENDP Endo Intl subsidiaries settle opioid investigation with the State of Oklahoma for $8.75 mln (4.49 +0.08)The Settlement Agreement fully and finally resolves Oklahoma's investigation of the Settling Parties in connection with the opioid abuse crisis in Oklahoma and includes a release of all associated claims by Oklahoma to the Settling Parties and all of their affiliated entities.

The Settlement Agreement includes no admission of wrongdoing, fault or liability of any kind by the Endo Affiliates. The amount paid in connection with the Settlement Agreement is a fraction of the settlement and judgment amounts associated with other opioid manufacturers in Oklahoma to date.11:50TALKX Market Briefing: Starting to turn a little defensiveThe stock market is walking a steady line today, but it hasn't crossed the line yet that involves a broad-based wave of selling interest, which some think is overdue. Instead, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed the 29,000 line earlier, continuing its record-setting run.Today's action has been mixed so far, however, partly on a sense that some exhaustion might be setting in after a busy week filled with a lot of headline angst.The latter point notwithstanding, the S&P 500 is up 1.4% for the week, following through on a great fourth quarter rally to end 2019. So, the idea that it is overbought on a short-term basis and due for a pullback continues to hang out there and has participants on close watch for a reversal trade.Today has had a little more guarded feel to it. The information technology sector (+0.2%) has remained an important leadership group, yet some of the more defensive-oriented areas of the market -- real estate (+0.6%), utilities (+0.5%), health care (+0.3%), and consumer staples (+0.1%) -- are stepping up.

Three cyclical sectors (financials, consumer discretionary, and energy) trade in the red with energy (-0.3%) sitting at the bottom of the leaderboard.The energy sector outperformed earlier this week when concerns about an escalating conflict with Iran led to a spike in the price of oil.

The energy sector, for its part, is now down 0.7% for the week versus a 1.4% gain in the S&P 500.On a side note, Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, are scheduled to hold a press conference at 10:45 ET, when new sanctions against Iran are likely to be announced.Notable movers:Noble Energy (NBL 21.89, -0.56, -2.5%): weakest sector component, falling below its 50-day moving average (21.93) after slipping below its 200-day moving average (22.46) yesterday.

In addition, the Company expects aggregate one-time charges of approximately $10 mln related to the China international agreements and certain unrelated litigation matters in the fourth quarter. For 2020, while the Company does not foresee any significant additional one-time costs or expenses irrespective of the outcome of the Six Flags-branded projects in China, the loss of all the China projects would result in no revenue for that market if Riverside does not cure the default and the Company is not able to engage other partners to complete any of the projects. Separately, the Company's North America parks experienced lower attendance in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the same period in 2018 due to softer than expected season pass and membership sales, primarily during the holiday sales periods. As a result, the Company expects total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 to be less than prior year by $8-$10 mln which would translate to revenues of $259.5-261.5 mln vs $285.6 mln Capital IQ consensus.07:47PCRX Pacira Pharma Chief Medical Officer Richard Scranton resigned effective January 24, 2020 (42.90 )Dr. Scranton has decided to pursue an opportunity at a private, early-stage biotechnology company.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.8%) also closed at record highs, while the Russell 2000 increased just 0.1%.The ease in tensions with Iran remained conducive for risk sentiment, even as President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau echoed a Newsweek report that Iranian missiles shot down the Boeing (BA 336.34, +4.97, +1.5%) 737-800 jetliner earlier this week. There was no indication the U.S. would reconsider its de-escalation strategy, though.Other positive factors included 1) upbeat holiday sales results, 2) several analyst upgrades, 3) weekly jobless claims returning to lower levels, and 4) China confirming Vice Premier Liu He will visit Washington from Jan. 13-15 to sign the Phase One trade deal.Apple (AAPL 309.63, +6.44, +2.1%) led the information technology sector (+1.1%) higher after Reuters reported that iPhone sales increased 18% yr/yr in China last month.

The persistent bullish momentum in the market exacerbated a fear of missing out on further gains amid a lack of detrimental developments.It's worth noting, though, that Kohl's (KSS 46.15, -3.23, -6.5%) did issue an earnings warning and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY 13.45, -3.20, -19.2%) withdrew its full-year guidance on top of reporting disappointing results.

Flat quarter over quarter demand due to a decrease in utilization, primarily in tier 1 accounts.

The findings build on the previously reported three-month interim analysis, after two vaccinations, announced at the company's R&D Day in September 2019. mRNA-1647 is a wholly owned program in Moderna's prophylactic vaccines portfolio.The second interim analysis of the Phase 1 trial reports safety and immunogenicity of the first three dose levels (30, 90 and 180 g) through seven months (one month after the third vaccination) and the highest dose level (300 g) through three months (one month after the second vaccination). Neutralizing antibody titers were assessed in two assays utilizing epithelial cells and fibroblasts, which measure immune response to pentamer and gB antigens, respectively.Safety data were consistent with those reported at the three-month interim analysis. The vaccine was generally well-tolerated and there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events. As reported in the previous interim analysis, one related Grade 4 adverse event (AE) has been observed, which was an isolated lab finding of elevated partial thromboplastin time, which was elevated at baseline (Grade 1) and self-resolved on the next lab test with no associated clinical findings. Additionally, the company announced that the first participant was dosed in the Phase 2 dose-confirmation study.With the seven-month Phase 1 data and the launch of the Phase 2 study, the company is actively preparing for a global randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy of mRNA-1647 against primary CMV infection. Moderna has solicited and received Type C meeting feedback from the FDA on the preliminary design of the pivotal trial, which will evaluate prevention of primary CMV infection in a population that includes women of childbearing age.16:04EPRT Essential Properties Realty Trust has commenced 6.25 mln share common stock offering (25.48 +0.24)16:03RARE Ultragenyx Pharma reports "positive topline cohort 3 results" and "improved cohort 2" results from Phase 1/2 study of DTX301 (53.76 -0.27)Co announces topline positive safety and efficacy data from Cohort 3 and longer-term data from Cohort 2 of the ongoing Phase 1/2 study of DTX301, an investigational adeno-associated virus gene therapy for the treatment of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.In Cohort 3, there were two confirmed female responders as well a third potential male responder who requires longer-term follow-up to confirm response status.In Cohort 2, one female patient has newly demonstrated a response starting at Week 52 which was confirmed at Week 78. The two previously disclosed responders in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 also remain clinically and metabolically stable at 104 and 78 weeks, respectively. Across all nine patients dosed in the study, up to six patients have demonstrated a response.As of the data cutoff date, there have been no infusion-related adverse events and no treatment-related serious adverse events reported in the study. All adverse events have been Grade 1 or 2.RARE is continuing discussions with the FDA regarding the potential Phase 3 study design.

The S&P 500 is flat, the Nasdaq Composite is flat, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.Nonfarm payrolls grew by 145,000 in December, which was less than the Briefing.com consensus of 160,000 and less than the readings for November and October. Overall not a bad report, but it may have tempered some growth expectations for the fourth quarter.The market isn't overly reacting to the data, cognizant that the economy is still in good shape, but selling pressure has been kept in check despite calls for a pullback. Buying efforts, however, have shifted to the defensive-oriented real estate (+0.7%), utilities (+0.4%), and health care (+0.3%) sectors.Conversely, the financials sector (-0.4%) is being pressured by some curve-flattening action in the Treasury market while the industrials sector (-0.4%) is being dragged lower by shares of top-weighted Boeing (BA 332.48, -3.86, -1.2%). The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.82%.Boeing shares are back on the retreat after disparaging employee memos about the 737 MAX were released. On a related, Boeing supplier Spirit Aerosystems (SPR 70.85, -1.94, -2.7%) said it will eliminate 2,800 jobs, according to CNBC.In other corporate news, Six Flags (SIX 35.36, -8.41, -19.2%) issued disappointing Q4 guidance, KB Home (KBH 35.96, -1.10, -3.0%) missed revenue estimates, and GrubHub (GRUB 51.80, -3.93, -7.1%) denied prior rumors about a sale. Dermira (DERM 19.25, +0.91, +5.0%) has agreed to be acquired by Eli Lilly (LLY 137.98, +2.06, +1.5%) for $1.1 billion in cash.Reviewing today's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for December:December nonfarm payrolls increased by 145,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), private sector payrolls increased by 139,000 (Briefing.com consensus 157,000), the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%), and average hourly earnings were up 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The key takeaway from the report, which included updates to the seasonal adjustment factors for the labor force series derived from the household survey, was that average hourly earnings and the average workweek were both weaker than expected. That may temper any inflation concerns, but at the same time it is apt to temper consumer spending activity and overall GDP growth expectations for the fourth quarter.Wholesale inventories decreased 0.1% m/m in November (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing 0.1% in October. Wholesale sales surged 1.5% after declining 0.9% in October.The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity was strong in November, but it will still prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.12:38SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Portola Pharma (PTLA) slumps on fourth quarter Andexxa revenue expectations -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersSRNE (4.71 +38.12%): Received a non-binding proposal from a private equity fund offering to acquire a majority or all of co's issued and outstanding shares for up to $7.00/share. The stock closed yesterday at $3.41, meaning that the cap price indicated in the proposal would represent a more than +100% premium to recent levels. The stock last traded above $7.00 in July of 2018. At nine-month highs.RVNC (18.66 +13.18%): Signed a US distribution agreement with TEOXANE SA that makes co the exclusive commercialization partner of TEOXANE's Resilient Hyaluronic Acid technology, including the FDA-approved RHA 2, RHA 3, and RHA 4 products, which include lidocaine. The agreement also includes RHA 1, currently in clinical trials, as well as an ongoing collaboration for other pipeline candidates and a right of first negotiation to access TEOXANE's "novel cosmeceutical line" incorporating RHA technology. The deal and the RHA line give co "access to the fast-growing, billion-dollar U.S. dermal filler market," further positioning co to be the "innovation leader" in the US market for facial injectables. Co, now building out a US commercial organization, targets introduction of TEOXANE RHA fillers in Q2 of 2020. Co has agreed to issue 2.5 mln of its common shares to TEOXANE SA in consideration for the US distribution rights factored into the transaction. ZYXI (10.75 +10.04%): Continued strength following co's Q4 orders update, which was released yesterday morning; orders grew +129% yr/yr in the quarter and +31% sequentially, leading co to raise its outlook for Q4 revs and adj. EBITDA. At one-month highs.Small Cap LosersPTLA (13.98 -43.49%): Announced preliminary Q4 global net revs for Andexxa of $28 mln, including $4 mln from sales of Ondexxya in Europe. Andexxa/Ondexxya had achieved net product revs of $35.7 mln in Q3. Approx. 90 new accounts ordered Andexxa in the US in Q4. Andexxa's US performance was impacted by a $5 mln gross to net adjustment due to a return reserve for short-dated product and flat demand sequentially due to a decrease in utilization, primarily in tier 1 accounts -- co believes that in certain accounts, hospital pharmacies curtailed Andexxa use following drug utilization reviews to manage budgets. Co anticipates "continued strong demand" for Andexxa in 2020 in connection with Factor Xa inhibitor market growth. Oppenheimer cut co's rating to Perform; the firm had expected Q4 Andexxa revs of approx. $39 mln. At all-time lows. MTNB (1.47 -23.04%): Announced a public offering of 32.26 mln shares of its common stock, priced at $1.55/share, for expected gross proceeds of approx. $50.0 mln, which will be put toward purposes including developing co's product candidates, primarily MAT9001. At one-month lows. SPWH (6.63 -16.98%): Lowered its Q4 revenue and earnings guidance below consensus; the quarter's same store sales are expected to decline by 6-7% yr/yr. Results were impacted by "temporary headwinds," driven by competitors discounting firearm and ammunition inventory while exiting those categories as well as difficult yr/yr comparisons connected to certain legislative changes, all of which, exacerbated by the shorter holiday season, hurt traffic and sales more than co had originally projected. Co emphasizes "outsized growth" in its online channel and normalized store traffic trends noted in January, and it believes that competitive changes and industry consolidation will ultimately bode well for co over the long term, despite the short-term headwinds that they have engendered. At two-month lows.12:24SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (123) outpacing new lows (14) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: A, AAPL, AB, ACGL, ACIA, ACM, ADBE, ADSK, ADUS, AGN, AIZ, AKAM, ALL, AMRC, ANSS, APO, APPF, ARD, ATH, ATRC, AXE, AY, B, BBY, BDX, BIO, BKNG, BLDR, BLK, BMY, BRKR, BRO, CACI, CDAY, CNNE, COLL, COUP, CRL, CRM, CROX, CTXS, DERM, DOV, DXCM, EL, EMR, ENTG, EPAM, EQH, FB, FICO, FIS, FISV, FIVN, FRTA, GBT, GOOGL, GPN, GWW, HESM, HII, HRC, INFO, ISRG, JELD, KMI, KO, KRNT, LAMR, LAZ, LDOS, LLY, LMAT, LVS, MA, MASI, MCO, MDT, MIC, MS, MSA, MSFT, MTN, NLOK, NOW, NUVA, NVDA, PAYC, PCTY, PEGA, POWI, PRFT, RMD, RPAY, SAIC, SEDG, SHOP, SNPS, SNX, SPGI, SPNS, SYNH, TDG, TGTX, TJX, TKR, TMO, TREX, TROW, TRU, V, VAR, VEC, WCG, WLTW, WSC, WSM, XENE, XLRN, YNDX, YUMC, ZNGA, ZYMEStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ASIX, CEIX, CNK, CONN, DD, GCI, GOSS, GPOR, HRTG, MAC, PTLA, S, SIX, WETFThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CABO, CSWI, HURN, SARETFs that traded to 52 week highs: BKF, DIA, EEB, EWC, EWG, GXC, HYG, IGV, IHI, IOO, IWF, IYF, IYH, IYJ, JNK, OEF, PBD, PFF, PHO, PPA, PSK, QQQ, RSX, RTH, SKYY, SOCL, SPY, UYG, VTI, XLI, XLK, XLVETFs that traded to 52 week lows: VXX, VXZ11:54ENDP Endo Intl subsidiaries settle opioid investigation with the State of Oklahoma for $8.75 mln (4.49 +0.08)The Settlement Agreement fully and finally resolves Oklahoma's investigation of the Settling Parties in connection with the opioid abuse crisis in Oklahoma and includes a release of all associated claims by Oklahoma to the Settling Parties and all of their affiliated entities.

The Settlement Agreement includes no admission of wrongdoing, fault or liability of any kind by the Endo Affiliates. The amount paid in connection with the Settlement Agreement is a fraction of the settlement and judgment amounts associated with other opioid manufacturers in Oklahoma to date.11:50TALKX Market Briefing: Starting to turn a little defensiveThe stock market is walking a steady line today, but it hasn't crossed the line yet that involves a broad-based wave of selling interest, which some think is overdue. Instead, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed the 29,000 line earlier, continuing its record-setting run.Today's action has been mixed so far, however, partly on a sense that some exhaustion might be setting in after a busy week filled with a lot of headline angst.The latter point notwithstanding, the S&P 500 is up 1.4% for the week, following through on a great fourth quarter rally to end 2019. So, the idea that it is overbought on a short-term basis and due for a pullback continues to hang out there and has participants on close watch for a reversal trade.Today has had a little more guarded feel to it. The information technology sector (+0.2%) has remained an important leadership group, yet some of the more defensive-oriented areas of the market -- real estate (+0.6%), utilities (+0.5%), health care (+0.3%), and consumer staples (+0.1%) -- are stepping up. Also, long-term yields continue to come down.The 10-yr note yield is down four basis points to 1.82% following the December employment report, which was a bit light on job growth, but noticeably light on average hourly earnings growth and the length of the average workweek, and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announcing new sanctions on Iran.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is flat; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%; and the Russell 2000 is down 0.3%.11:31NLSN Nielsen acquires Precima from Alliance Data Systems (ADS); terms not disclosed (20.04 -0.05)Nielsen Global Connect has completed its acquisition of Precima, an industry-leading, SaaS-based provider of powerful retail and customer data applications and analytics, from Alliance Data Systems. By bringing Precima into its measurement framework, Nielsen Global Connect will achieve a heightened advantage in the loyalty and personalization space, furthering its ability to help brands plan and measure the impact and success of personalized consumer offerings.10:40XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (60.01 -0.14)The major averages started the Friday session on a modestly higher note, but there are a few soft spots in the market. Three cyclical sectors (financials, consumer discretionary, and energy) trade in the red with energy (-0.3%) sitting at the bottom of the leaderboard.The energy sector outperformed earlier this week when concerns about an escalating conflict with Iran led to a spike in the price of oil. However, these concerns have waned in recent days, which has pressured oil, and, in turn, the energy sector. WTI crude is down $0.36, or 0.6%, at $59.20/bbl. The price of oil is now just above its 50-day moving average (58.70) and it is on track to end the week lower by $3.85 or 6.1%. The energy sector, for its part, is now down 0.7% for the week versus a 1.4% gain in the S&P 500.On a side note, Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, are scheduled to hold a press conference at 10:45 ET, when new sanctions against Iran are likely to be announced.Notable movers:Noble Energy (NBL 21.89, -0.56, -2.5%): weakest sector component, falling below its 50-day moving average (21.93) after slipping below its 200-day moving average (22.46) yesterday. Devon Energy (DVN 25.40, -0.45, -1.7%): sliding below its 200-day moving average (25.80). Cabot Oil & Gas (COG 17.15, -0.12, -0.7%): trying to remain above its 50-day moving average (17.10). Valero Energy (VLO 96.58, +1.40, +1.5%): refining name boosted by lower price of crude, rising to its 50-day moving average (96.31). Marathon Petroleum (MPC 60.12, +0.73, +1.2%): refining stock benefiting from lower price of crude. HollyFrontier (HFC 48.45, +0.29, +0.6%): outperforming alongside other refiners.10:23OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:HD Jan 225 calls are seeing interest with 2730 contracts trading vs. open int of 2730, pushing implied vol up around 12 points to ~28%.

The S&P 500 is flat, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the health care (+0.4%) and utilities (+0.4%) sectors outperforming the broader market, while the energy (-0.3%), financials (-0.3%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors underperform.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower. The 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.56%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index is little changed at 97.48. WTI crude is down 0.8% to $59.07/bbl.09:21WIRES On The WiresParsley Energy (PE) has completed its acquisition of Jagged Peak Energy (JAG).

The joint action between Linx and PicPay will bring the potential for users to make QR Code payments at more than 100,000 establishments operating the Linx system.09:12WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +5.90. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: +27.90.The stock market is still on pace to open higher despite the December employment report showing jobs growth slow down more than expected. The S&P 500 futures trade six points, or 0.2%, above fair value.145,000 jobs were added to nonfarm payrolls in December, which was less than than the Briefing.com consensus of 160,000 and the November and October readings. Average hourly earnings also increased less than expected at 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%).The data might temper some economic growth expectations for the fourth quarter and has likely amplified calls for a pullback due to the market's short-term overbought condition. There still doesn't appear to be too much selling interest this morning, though.Instead, many investors continue to buy the semiconductor stocks like NVIDIA (NVDA 246.50, +3.48, +1.4%) and many suppliers of Apple (AAPL 310.98, +1.35, +0.4%) following positive analyst recommendations.09:07PHAS PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals announces financing and co-development collaboration with SFJ Pharmaceuticals to develop PB2452 (shares halted) (5.65 )The collaboration between SFJ and PhaseBio will support the global development of PB2452, which is designed to reverse the antiplatelet activity of ticagrelor in major bleeding and urgent surgery situations.

In addition, the Company expects aggregate one-time charges of approximately $10 mln related to the China international agreements and certain unrelated litigation matters in the fourth quarter. For 2020, while the Company does not foresee any significant additional one-time costs or expenses irrespective of the outcome of the Six Flags-branded projects in China, the loss of all the China projects would result in no revenue for that market if Riverside does not cure the default and the Company is not able to engage other partners to complete any of the projects. Separately, the Company's North America parks experienced lower attendance in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the same period in 2018 due to softer than expected season pass and membership sales, primarily during the holiday sales periods. As a result, the Company expects total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 to be less than prior year by $8-$10 mln which would translate to revenues of $259.5-261.5 mln vs $285.6 mln Capital IQ consensus.07:47PCRX Pacira Pharma Chief Medical Officer Richard Scranton resigned effective January 24, 2020 (42.90 )Dr. Scranton has decided to pursue an opportunity at a private, early-stage biotechnology company.

Lastly, in order to meet customer delivery expectations, URBN spent more on delivery and logistics expenses than originally planned.16:34CYRX Cryoport expects to report Q4 revenue of approximately $9.2 mln vs CapitalIQ consensus of $10.4 mln (17.84 -0.13)16:34PYPL PayPal discloses expectation to report pre-tax gain of $38 mln on strategic investments in quarter ended December 31, 2019 (112.57 +0.75)PayPal expects to report a pre-tax gain of $38 mln ($29 mln on an after-tax basis) on the company's strategic investments in the quarter ended December 31, 2019.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.8%) also closed at record highs, while the Russell 2000 increased just 0.1%.The ease in tensions with Iran remained conducive for risk sentiment, even as President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau echoed a Newsweek report that Iranian missiles shot down the Boeing (BA 336.34, +4.97, +1.5%) 737-800 jetliner earlier this week. There was no indication the U.S. would reconsider its de-escalation strategy, though.Other positive factors included 1) upbeat holiday sales results, 2) several analyst upgrades, 3) weekly jobless claims returning to lower levels, and 4) China confirming Vice Premier Liu He will visit Washington from Jan. 13-15 to sign the Phase One trade deal.Apple (AAPL 309.63, +6.44, +2.1%) led the information technology sector (+1.1%) higher after Reuters reported that iPhone sales increased 18% yr/yr in China last month. Costco (COST 299.42, +4.73, +1.6%) led the consumer staples sector (+0.7%) higher after it reported 9.0% yr/yr comparable sales growth for the five weeks ended Jan. 5.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 48.97, +1.14, +2.4%), Goldman Sachs (GS 242.60, +4.84, +2.0%), and Coca-Cola (KO 55.34, +0.99, +1.8%) were among today's stocks that were upgraded to the equivalent of a Buy rating.Given the amount of good news today, then, it's easy to see why calls for a pullback remained unanswered. The persistent bullish momentum in the market exacerbated a fear of missing out on further gains amid a lack of detrimental developments.It's worth noting, though, that Kohl's (KSS 46.15, -3.23, -6.5%) did issue an earnings warning and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY 13.45, -3.20, -19.2%) withdrew its full-year guidance on top of reporting disappointing results. The broader market was not surprised or bothered by the news.U.S. Treasuries finished the session slightly higher. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.86%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.44. WTI crude declined 0.1% to $59.54/bbl.Thursday's economic data was limited to the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report:Initial jobless claims for the week ending January 4 decreased by 9,000 to 214,000 (Briefing.com consensus 225,000). Continuing claims for the week ending December 28 increased by 75,000 to 1.803 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims have settled back down at lower levels, which reflect ongoing tightness in the labor market.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Employment Situation Report for December and Wholesale Inventories for November on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +2.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.5% YTDS&P 500 +1.4% YTDRussell 2000 -0.2% YTD16:21PTLA Portola Pharma plunges to $15.20 in extended hours trading after updating Andexxa guidance (24.74 +0.78)16:20NLOK NortonLifeLock announces special, one-time cash dividend of $12 per share of common stock (shares halted) (26.69 +0.08)The dividend is payable on January 31, 2020 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 23.16:19PTLA Portola Pharma guides Q4 Andexxa global net revenues to approx $28 mln; co to host conf call at 5pm ET (24.74 +0.78)Fourth quarter Andexxa net sales in the U.S. were impacted primarily by two factors: A $5 million gross to net adjustment due to a return reserve for short-dated product. The Company expects this to be mitigated going forward by its current longer-dated, 36-month product, which began shipping in November 2019. Flat quarter over quarter demand due to a decrease in utilization, primarily in tier 1 accounts. While physician demand remains strong, the Company believes that in certain of these accounts, hospital pharmacies curtailed use of Andexxa following drug utilization reviews in an effort to manage pharmacy budgets. Following this reduction, re-ordering patterns are stabilizing in many of these accounts16:18COT Cott acquires Clearwater; terms not disclosed (13.91 -0.28)Cott announced that Cott and Eden Springs, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cott, have acquired 100% of the shares of Hungarian company, Clearwater Kereskedelmi s Szolgltat Korltolt Felelossgu Trsasg.

The S&P 500 is flat, the Nasdaq Composite is flat, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.Nonfarm payrolls grew by 145,000 in December, which was less than the Briefing.com consensus of 160,000 and less than the readings for November and October. Overall not a bad report, but it may have tempered some growth expectations for the fourth quarter.The market isn't overly reacting to the data, cognizant that the economy is still in good shape, but selling pressure has been kept in check despite calls for a pullback. Buying efforts, however, have shifted to the defensive-oriented real estate (+0.7%), utilities (+0.4%), and health care (+0.3%) sectors.Conversely, the financials sector (-0.4%) is being pressured by some curve-flattening action in the Treasury market while the industrials sector (-0.4%) is being dragged lower by shares of top-weighted Boeing (BA 332.48, -3.86, -1.2%). The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.82%.Boeing shares are back on the retreat after disparaging employee memos about the 737 MAX were released. On a related, Boeing supplier Spirit Aerosystems (SPR 70.85, -1.94, -2.7%) said it will eliminate 2,800 jobs, according to CNBC.In other corporate news, Six Flags (SIX 35.36, -8.41, -19.2%) issued disappointing Q4 guidance, KB Home (KBH 35.96, -1.10, -3.0%) missed revenue estimates, and GrubHub (GRUB 51.80, -3.93, -7.1%) denied prior rumors about a sale. Dermira (DERM 19.25, +0.91, +5.0%) has agreed to be acquired by Eli Lilly (LLY 137.98, +2.06, +1.5%) for $1.1 billion in cash.Reviewing today's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for December:December nonfarm payrolls increased by 145,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), private sector payrolls increased by 139,000 (Briefing.com consensus 157,000), the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%), and average hourly earnings were up 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The key takeaway from the report, which included updates to the seasonal adjustment factors for the labor force series derived from the household survey, was that average hourly earnings and the average workweek were both weaker than expected. That may temper any inflation concerns, but at the same time it is apt to temper consumer spending activity and overall GDP growth expectations for the fourth quarter.Wholesale inventories decreased 0.1% m/m in November (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing 0.1% in October. Wholesale sales surged 1.5% after declining 0.9% in October.The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity was strong in November, but it will still prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.12:38SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Portola Pharma (PTLA) slumps on fourth quarter Andexxa revenue expectations -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersSRNE (4.71 +38.12%): Received a non-binding proposal from a private equity fund offering to acquire a majority or all of co's issued and outstanding shares for up to $7.00/share. The stock closed yesterday at $3.41, meaning that the cap price indicated in the proposal would represent a more than +100% premium to recent levels. The stock last traded above $7.00 in July of 2018. At nine-month highs.RVNC (18.66 +13.18%): Signed a US distribution agreement with TEOXANE SA that makes co the exclusive commercialization partner of TEOXANE's Resilient Hyaluronic Acid technology, including the FDA-approved RHA 2, RHA 3, and RHA 4 products, which include lidocaine. The agreement also includes RHA 1, currently in clinical trials, as well as an ongoing collaboration for other pipeline candidates and a right of first negotiation to access TEOXANE's "novel cosmeceutical line" incorporating RHA technology. The deal and the RHA line give co "access to the fast-growing, billion-dollar U.S. dermal filler market," further positioning co to be the "innovation leader" in the US market for facial injectables. Co, now building out a US commercial organization, targets introduction of TEOXANE RHA fillers in Q2 of 2020. Co has agreed to issue 2.5 mln of its common shares to TEOXANE SA in consideration for the US distribution rights factored into the transaction. ZYXI (10.75 +10.04%): Continued strength following co's Q4 orders update, which was released yesterday morning; orders grew +129% yr/yr in the quarter and +31% sequentially, leading co to raise its outlook for Q4 revs and adj. EBITDA. At one-month highs.Small Cap LosersPTLA (13.98 -43.49%): Announced preliminary Q4 global net revs for Andexxa of $28 mln, including $4 mln from sales of Ondexxya in Europe. Andexxa/Ondexxya had achieved net product revs of $35.7 mln in Q3. Approx. 90 new accounts ordered Andexxa in the US in Q4. Andexxa's US performance was impacted by a $5 mln gross to net adjustment due to a return reserve for short-dated product and flat demand sequentially due to a decrease in utilization, primarily in tier 1 accounts -- co believes that in certain accounts, hospital pharmacies curtailed Andexxa use following drug utilization reviews to manage budgets. Co anticipates "continued strong demand" for Andexxa in 2020 in connection with Factor Xa inhibitor market growth. Oppenheimer cut co's rating to Perform; the firm had expected Q4 Andexxa revs of approx. $39 mln. At all-time lows. MTNB (1.47 -23.04%): Announced a public offering of 32.26 mln shares of its common stock, priced at $1.55/share, for expected gross proceeds of approx. $50.0 mln, which will be put toward purposes including developing co's product candidates, primarily MAT9001. At one-month lows. SPWH (6.63 -16.98%): Lowered its Q4 revenue and earnings guidance below consensus; the quarter's same store sales are expected to decline by 6-7% yr/yr. Results were impacted by "temporary headwinds," driven by competitors discounting firearm and ammunition inventory while exiting those categories as well as difficult yr/yr comparisons connected to certain legislative changes, all of which, exacerbated by the shorter holiday season, hurt traffic and sales more than co had originally projected. Co emphasizes "outsized growth" in its online channel and normalized store traffic trends noted in January, and it believes that competitive changes and industry consolidation will ultimately bode well for co over the long term, despite the short-term headwinds that they have engendered. At two-month lows.12:24SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (123) outpacing new lows (14) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: A, AAPL, AB, ACGL, ACIA, ACM, ADBE, ADSK, ADUS, AGN, AIZ, AKAM, ALL, AMRC, ANSS, APO, APPF, ARD, ATH, ATRC, AXE, AY, B, BBY, BDX, BIO, BKNG, BLDR, BLK, BMY, BRKR, BRO, CACI, CDAY, CNNE, COLL, COUP, CRL, CRM, CROX, CTXS, DERM, DOV, DXCM, EL, EMR, ENTG, EPAM, EQH, FB, FICO, FIS, FISV, FIVN, FRTA, GBT, GOOGL, GPN, GWW, HESM, HII, HRC, INFO, ISRG, JELD, KMI, KO, KRNT, LAMR, LAZ, LDOS, LLY, LMAT, LVS, MA, MASI, MCO, MDT, MIC, MS, MSA, MSFT, MTN, NLOK, NOW, NUVA, NVDA, PAYC, PCTY, PEGA, POWI, PRFT, RMD, RPAY, SAIC, SEDG, SHOP, SNPS, SNX, SPGI, SPNS, SYNH, TDG, TGTX, TJX, TKR, TMO, TREX, TROW, TRU, V, VAR, VEC, WCG, WLTW, WSC, WSM, XENE, XLRN, YNDX, YUMC, ZNGA, ZYMEStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ASIX, CEIX, CNK, CONN, DD, GCI, GOSS, GPOR, HRTG, MAC, PTLA, S, SIX, WETFThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CABO, CSWI, HURN, SARETFs that traded to 52 week highs: BKF, DIA, EEB, EWC, EWG, GXC, HYG, IGV, IHI, IOO, IWF, IYF, IYH, IYJ, JNK, OEF, PBD, PFF, PHO, PPA, PSK, QQQ, RSX, RTH, SKYY, SOCL, SPY, UYG, VTI, XLI, XLK, XLVETFs that traded to 52 week lows: VXX, VXZ11:54ENDP Endo Intl subsidiaries settle opioid investigation with the State of Oklahoma for $8.75 mln (4.49 +0.08)The Settlement Agreement fully and finally resolves Oklahoma's investigation of the Settling Parties in connection with the opioid abuse crisis in Oklahoma and includes a release of all associated claims by Oklahoma to the Settling Parties and all of their affiliated entities.

Instead, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed the 29,000 line earlier, continuing its record-setting run.Today's action has been mixed so far, however, partly on a sense that some exhaustion might be setting in after a busy week filled with a lot of headline angst.The latter point notwithstanding, the S&P 500 is up 1.4% for the week, following through on a great fourth quarter rally to end 2019. So, the idea that it is overbought on a short-term basis and due for a pullback continues to hang out there and has participants on close watch for a reversal trade.Today has had a little more guarded feel to it. The information technology sector (+0.2%) has remained an important leadership group, yet some of the more defensive-oriented areas of the market -- real estate (+0.6%), utilities (+0.5%), health care (+0.3%), and consumer staples (+0.1%) -- are stepping up. Also, long-term yields continue to come down.The 10-yr note yield is down four basis points to 1.82% following the December employment report, which was a bit light on job growth, but noticeably light on average hourly earnings growth and the length of the average workweek, and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announcing new sanctions on Iran.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is flat; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%; and the Russell 2000 is down 0.3%.11:31NLSN Nielsen acquires Precima from Alliance Data Systems (ADS); terms not disclosed (20.04 -0.05)Nielsen Global Connect has completed its acquisition of Precima, an industry-leading, SaaS-based provider of powerful retail and customer data applications and analytics, from Alliance Data Systems. By bringing Precima into its measurement framework, Nielsen Global Connect will achieve a heightened advantage in the loyalty and personalization space, furthering its ability to help brands plan and measure the impact and success of personalized consumer offerings.10:40XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (60.01 -0.14)The major averages started the Friday session on a modestly higher note, but there are a few soft spots in the market. Three cyclical sectors (financials, consumer discretionary, and energy) trade in the red with energy (-0.3%) sitting at the bottom of the leaderboard.The energy sector outperformed earlier this week when concerns about an escalating conflict with Iran led to a spike in the price of oil. However, these concerns have waned in recent days, which has pressured oil, and, in turn, the energy sector. WTI crude is down $0.36, or 0.6%, at $59.20/bbl. The price of oil is now just above its 50-day moving average (58.70) and it is on track to end the week lower by $3.85 or 6.1%. The energy sector, for its part, is now down 0.7% for the week versus a 1.4% gain in the S&P 500.On a side note, Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, are scheduled to hold a press conference at 10:45 ET, when new sanctions against Iran are likely to be announced.Notable movers:Noble Energy (NBL 21.89, -0.56, -2.5%): weakest sector component, falling below its 50-day moving average (21.93) after slipping below its 200-day moving average (22.46) yesterday. Devon Energy (DVN 25.40, -0.45, -1.7%): sliding below its 200-day moving average (25.80). Cabot Oil & Gas (COG 17.15, -0.12, -0.7%): trying to remain above its 50-day moving average (17.10). Valero Energy (VLO 96.58, +1.40, +1.5%): refining name boosted by lower price of crude, rising to its 50-day moving average (96.31). Marathon Petroleum (MPC 60.12, +0.73, +1.2%): refining stock benefiting from lower price of crude. HollyFrontier (HFC 48.45, +0.29, +0.6%): outperforming alongside other refiners.10:23OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:HD Jan 225 calls are seeing interest with 2730 contracts trading vs. open int of 2730, pushing implied vol up around 12 points to ~28%.

The 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.56%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index is little changed at 97.48.

The collaboration will leverage CAMP4's Gene Circuitry Platform with the aim of identifying how to dial up or down the expression of disease-associated genes within microglial cells -- the primary immune cells of the central nervous system, which are implicated in many serious neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. CAMP4 will receive a $15 mln upfront payment from Biogen. Biogen will reimburse CAMP4 for research activities, and Biogen will have the option to select resulting targets to advance to discovery, development and commercialization. CAMP4 will be eligible to receive development and milestone payments of up to $96 mln, plus future royalties, for each of the initial selected targets and up to $173 mln, plus future royalties, for each additional target. The companies will also explore other cell types of the central nervous system beyond microglial cells to potentially expand the number of neurological diseases that could be addressed.BridgeBio Pharma (BBIO) announced a collaboration agreement with Catalent (CTLT) to establish dedicated gene therapy development and manufacturing capacity at Catalent's Paragon Gene Therapy clinical and commercial manufacturing center in Harmans, Maryland.

As previously disclosed, the company has now cancelled all 737 MAX 8 flying through April 6, 2020. The company has reached a confidential agreement with Boeing on compensation for financial damages incurred in 2019 due to the grounding of the 737 MAX 8 aircraft. The company currently does not expect any material financial impact of the agreement to be realized in its fourth quarter 2019 earnings.Revenue (TRASM) -- The change in midpoint from previous guidance is due primarily to lower than planned yields in the pre-Thanksgiving period and higher completion factor throughout the quarter. Demand remains strong and December revenue performance exceeded the company's expectations. CASM -- The company now expects its fourth quarter total cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and net special items to be up approximately 1% to 3%1 yearover-year versus its previous guidance of up 2% to 4%. The change versus previous guidance is due primarily to improved operational performance and higher completion factor... Gross aircraft capex and net PDPs for the fourth quarter are lower than previous guidance due primarily to the delivery dates of certain MAX aircraft moving from the fourth quarter to 2020.08:04SUMRX Gapping up/down: SNX +8%, INFY +6%, PSMT +4% and ISRG +3.5% after earnings/guidance, SWKS +2%, MCHP +2%, AMAT +2% and LRCX +2% after upgrades; SIX -11%, URBN -8%, WDFC -5% and KBH -2% after earnings/guidanceGapping upIn reaction to strong earnings/guidance:SNX +8.1% (also plans to separate into two cos, raises div), QDEL +6.4%, INFY +5.7%, TELA +4.8%, PSMT +3.8%, AQST +3.8%, ISRG +3.5%, TGNA +1.9%, TSM +0.8%, ELAN +0.6%M&A news:SRNE +54% (received a non-binding proposal from a private equity fund to acquire a majority or all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company for up to $7.00/share) DERM +2.5% (to be acquired by Eli Lilly (LLY) for $18.75 per share or ~$1.1 bln in all-cash transaction; expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2020)Other news:ACRS +19.4% (reports "positive results" from Phase 1 trial of ATI-450 for immuno-inflammatory diseases)RARE +17.8% (reports positive results from Phase 1/2 study of DTX301)MRNA +13.6% (announces additional "positive" Phase 1 data from study of CMV vaccine)NLOK +3% (announces special dividend of $12/sh)EXK +1.9% (produces 4,018,735 oz silver and 38,907 oz gold (7.1 mln oz silver equivalents) in 2019) NKTR +1.2% (Nektar Therapeutics and Bristol-Myers (BMY) amend Strategic Collaboration Agreement for bempegaldesleukin Plus Opdivo) MRTX +1% (prices offering of 3.08 mln shares of its common stock at $97.50/share) LEN +0.9% (increases dividend)TTOO +0.9% (appoints John Sperzel as CEO)Analyst comments:ESTC +2.3% (upgraded to Buy at Jefferies)QRVO +2.1% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Mizuho)SWKS +2.1% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Mizuho)MCHP +2% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at BofA/Merrill)SNAP +1.7% (initiated with a Outperform at Bernstein)AMAT +1.7% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at BofA/Merrill)LRCX +1.6% (upgraded to Buy from Neutral at BofA/Merrill)SQ +1.2% (upgraded to Overweight from Equal-Weight at Stephens)UBER +1% (initiated with a Outperform at Bernstein)GOOG +0.7% (initiated with a Outperform at Bernstein)FB +0.7% (initiated with a Outperform at Bernstein)Gapping downIn reaction to disappointing earnings/guidance:PTLA -39% (guides Q4 Andexxa global net revenues to approx $28 mln), SPWH -18.8%, SIX -10.9%, URBN -8.1% (reports holiday sales), FLXN -5.3%, WDFC -5.1%, KBH -2.2%, CYRX -0.8%Other news:MTNB -12.9% (commences public offering of common stock)KRP -10% (prices 5 mln shares of common stock at $15.50 per share)APTX -8.1% (announces proposed public offering of common stock)GRUB -7.8% (Bloomberg reports co says it's not running sale process)PLMR -3.5% (prices offering)ARAV -1.8% (names new CEO)ADRO -1.5% (announces corporate restructuring plan)EPRT -0.5% (prices 6.9 mln shares of common stock at $25.20 per share)Analyst comments:ACB -7.5% (downgraded to Neutral at Piper Sandler; downgraded to Underperform from Neutral at BofA/Merrill)FL -2.2% (downgraded to Neutral from Positive at Susquehanna)DBX -1.7% (downgraded to Hold at Jefferies)BILI -1.6% (downgraded to Equal-Weight from Overweight at Morgan Stanley)IIVI -1.6% (downgraded to Mkt Perform from Outperform at Raymond James)NEWR -1.5% (downgraded to Underweight from Equal Weight at Barclays)XLNX -1.5% (downgraded to Underperform from Neutral at BofA/Merrill)DLB -1.1% (downgraded to Neutral from Buy at B.

In addition, the Company expects aggregate one-time charges of approximately $10 mln related to the China international agreements and certain unrelated litigation matters in the fourth quarter. For 2020, while the Company does not foresee any significant additional one-time costs or expenses irrespective of the outcome of the Six Flags-branded projects in China, the loss of all the China projects would result in no revenue for that market if Riverside does not cure the default and the Company is not able to engage other partners to complete any of the projects. Separately, the Company's North America parks experienced lower attendance in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the same period in 2018 due to softer than expected season pass and membership sales, primarily during the holiday sales periods. As a result, the Company expects total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 to be less than prior year by $8-$10 mln which would translate to revenues of $259.5-261.5 mln vs $285.6 mln Capital IQ consensus.07:47PCRX Pacira Pharma Chief Medical Officer Richard Scranton resigned effective January 24, 2020 (42.90 )Dr. Scranton has decided to pursue an opportunity at a private, early-stage biotechnology company.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.8%) also closed at record highs, while the Russell 2000 increased just 0.1%.The ease in tensions with Iran remained conducive for risk sentiment, even as President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau echoed a Newsweek report that Iranian missiles shot down the Boeing (BA 336.34, +4.97, +1.5%) 737-800 jetliner earlier this week. There was no indication the U.S. would reconsider its de-escalation strategy, though.Other positive factors included 1) upbeat holiday sales results, 2) several analyst upgrades, 3) weekly jobless claims returning to lower levels, and 4) China confirming Vice Premier Liu He will visit Washington from Jan. 13-15 to sign the Phase One trade deal.Apple (AAPL 309.63, +6.44, +2.1%) led the information technology sector (+1.1%) higher after Reuters reported that iPhone sales increased 18% yr/yr in China last month. Costco (COST 299.42, +4.73, +1.6%) led the consumer staples sector (+0.7%) higher after it reported 9.0% yr/yr comparable sales growth for the five weeks ended Jan. 5.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 48.97, +1.14, +2.4%), Goldman Sachs (GS 242.60, +4.84, +2.0%), and Coca-Cola (KO 55.34, +0.99, +1.8%) were among today's stocks that were upgraded to the equivalent of a Buy rating.Given the amount of good news today, then, it's easy to see why calls for a pullback remained unanswered. The persistent bullish momentum in the market exacerbated a fear of missing out on further gains amid a lack of detrimental developments.It's worth noting, though, that Kohl's (KSS 46.15, -3.23, -6.5%) did issue an earnings warning and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY 13.45, -3.20, -19.2%) withdrew its full-year guidance on top of reporting disappointing results. The broader market was not surprised or bothered by the news.U.S. Treasuries finished the session slightly higher. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.86%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.44. WTI crude declined 0.1% to $59.54/bbl.Thursday's economic data was limited to the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report:Initial jobless claims for the week ending January 4 decreased by 9,000 to 214,000 (Briefing.com consensus 225,000). Continuing claims for the week ending December 28 increased by 75,000 to 1.803 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims have settled back down at lower levels, which reflect ongoing tightness in the labor market.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Employment Situation Report for December and Wholesale Inventories for November on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +2.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.5% YTDS&P 500 +1.4% YTDRussell 2000 -0.2% YTD16:21PTLA Portola Pharma plunges to $15.20 in extended hours trading after updating Andexxa guidance (24.74 +0.78)16:20NLOK NortonLifeLock announces special, one-time cash dividend of $12 per share of common stock (shares halted) (26.69 +0.08)The dividend is payable on January 31, 2020 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 23.16:19PTLA Portola Pharma guides Q4 Andexxa global net revenues to approx $28 mln; co to host conf call at 5pm ET (24.74 +0.78)Fourth quarter Andexxa net sales in the U.S. were impacted primarily by two factors: A $5 million gross to net adjustment due to a return reserve for short-dated product. The Company expects this to be mitigated going forward by its current longer-dated, 36-month product, which began shipping in November 2019. Flat quarter over quarter demand due to a decrease in utilization, primarily in tier 1 accounts. While physician demand remains strong, the Company believes that in certain of these accounts, hospital pharmacies curtailed use of Andexxa following drug utilization reviews in an effort to manage pharmacy budgets. Following this reduction, re-ordering patterns are stabilizing in many of these accounts16:18COT Cott acquires Clearwater; terms not disclosed (13.91 -0.28)Cott announced that Cott and Eden Springs, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cott, have acquired 100% of the shares of Hungarian company, Clearwater Kereskedelmi s Szolgltat Korltolt Felelossgu Trsasg.

Fourth quarter 2019 worldwide da Vinci procedures increased approximately 19% yr/yr and FY19 worldwide da Vinci procedures increased approximately 18% compared with 2018.The growth in overall procedure volume in 2019 was primarily driven by growth in U.S. general surgery procedures and worldwide urologic procedures.

The findings build on the previously reported three-month interim analysis, after two vaccinations, announced at the company's R&D Day in September 2019. mRNA-1647 is a wholly owned program in Moderna's prophylactic vaccines portfolio.The second interim analysis of the Phase 1 trial reports safety and immunogenicity of the first three dose levels (30, 90 and 180 g) through seven months (one month after the third vaccination) and the highest dose level (300 g) through three months (one month after the second vaccination). Neutralizing antibody titers were assessed in two assays utilizing epithelial cells and fibroblasts, which measure immune response to pentamer and gB antigens, respectively.Safety data were consistent with those reported at the three-month interim analysis. The vaccine was generally well-tolerated and there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events. As reported in the previous interim analysis, one related Grade 4 adverse event (AE) has been observed, which was an isolated lab finding of elevated partial thromboplastin time, which was elevated at baseline (Grade 1) and self-resolved on the next lab test with no associated clinical findings. Additionally, the company announced that the first participant was dosed in the Phase 2 dose-confirmation study.With the seven-month Phase 1 data and the launch of the Phase 2 study, the company is actively preparing for a global randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy of mRNA-1647 against primary CMV infection. Moderna has solicited and received Type C meeting feedback from the FDA on the preliminary design of the pivotal trial, which will evaluate prevention of primary CMV infection in a population that includes women of childbearing age.16:04EPRT Essential Properties Realty Trust has commenced 6.25 mln share common stock offering (25.48 +0.24)16:03RARE Ultragenyx Pharma reports "positive topline cohort 3 results" and "improved cohort 2" results from Phase 1/2 study of DTX301 (53.76 -0.27)Co announces topline positive safety and efficacy data from Cohort 3 and longer-term data from Cohort 2 of the ongoing Phase 1/2 study of DTX301, an investigational adeno-associated virus gene therapy for the treatment of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.In Cohort 3, there were two confirmed female responders as well a third potential male responder who requires longer-term follow-up to confirm response status.In Cohort 2, one female patient has newly demonstrated a response starting at Week 52 which was confirmed at Week 78. The two previously disclosed responders in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 also remain clinically and metabolically stable at 104 and 78 weeks, respectively. Across all nine patients dosed in the study, up to six patients have demonstrated a response.As of the data cutoff date, there have been no infusion-related adverse events and no treatment-related serious adverse events reported in the study. All adverse events have been Grade 1 or 2.RARE is continuing discussions with the FDA regarding the potential Phase 3 study design. Ammonia is expected to be a primary endpoint based on direct FDA feedback to date, with ureagenesis as a measure of biologic activity that supports the decision for patients to discontinue alternate pathway medications.Co states, "We are encouraged to see a more uniform response at the higher doses including three female responders. To date, three patients in the study have discontinued alternate pathway medication and liberalized their diets while remaining clinically and metabolically stable..."Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: January 10, 2020End of Document

The S&P 500 is flat, the Nasdaq Composite is flat, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.Nonfarm payrolls grew by 145,000 in December, which was less than the Briefing.com consensus of 160,000 and less than the readings for November and October. Overall not a bad report, but it may have tempered some growth expectations for the fourth quarter.The market isn't overly reacting to the data, cognizant that the economy is still in good shape, but selling pressure has been kept in check despite calls for a pullback. Buying efforts, however, have shifted to the defensive-oriented real estate (+0.7%), utilities (+0.4%), and health care (+0.3%) sectors.Conversely, the financials sector (-0.4%) is being pressured by some curve-flattening action in the Treasury market while the industrials sector (-0.4%) is being dragged lower by shares of top-weighted Boeing (BA 332.48, -3.86, -1.2%). The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.82%.Boeing shares are back on the retreat after disparaging employee memos about the 737 MAX were released. On a related, Boeing supplier Spirit Aerosystems (SPR 70.85, -1.94, -2.7%) said it will eliminate 2,800 jobs, according to CNBC.In other corporate news, Six Flags (SIX 35.36, -8.41, -19.2%) issued disappointing Q4 guidance, KB Home (KBH 35.96, -1.10, -3.0%) missed revenue estimates, and GrubHub (GRUB 51.80, -3.93, -7.1%) denied prior rumors about a sale. Dermira (DERM 19.25, +0.91, +5.0%) has agreed to be acquired by Eli Lilly (LLY 137.98, +2.06, +1.5%) for $1.1 billion in cash.Reviewing today's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for December:December nonfarm payrolls increased by 145,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), private sector payrolls increased by 139,000 (Briefing.com consensus 157,000), the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%), and average hourly earnings were up 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The key takeaway from the report, which included updates to the seasonal adjustment factors for the labor force series derived from the household survey, was that average hourly earnings and the average workweek were both weaker than expected. That may temper any inflation concerns, but at the same time it is apt to temper consumer spending activity and overall GDP growth expectations for the fourth quarter.Wholesale inventories decreased 0.1% m/m in November (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing 0.1% in October. Wholesale sales surged 1.5% after declining 0.9% in October.The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity was strong in November, but it will still prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.12:38SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Portola Pharma (PTLA) slumps on fourth quarter Andexxa revenue expectations -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersSRNE (4.71 +38.12%): Received a non-binding proposal from a private equity fund offering to acquire a majority or all of co's issued and outstanding shares for up to $7.00/share. The stock closed yesterday at $3.41, meaning that the cap price indicated in the proposal would represent a more than +100% premium to recent levels. The stock last traded above $7.00 in July of 2018. At nine-month highs.RVNC (18.66 +13.18%): Signed a US distribution agreement with TEOXANE SA that makes co the exclusive commercialization partner of TEOXANE's Resilient Hyaluronic Acid technology, including the FDA-approved RHA 2, RHA 3, and RHA 4 products, which include lidocaine. The agreement also includes RHA 1, currently in clinical trials, as well as an ongoing collaboration for other pipeline candidates and a right of first negotiation to access TEOXANE's "novel cosmeceutical line" incorporating RHA technology. The deal and the RHA line give co "access to the fast-growing, billion-dollar U.S. dermal filler market," further positioning co to be the "innovation leader" in the US market for facial injectables. Co, now building out a US commercial organization, targets introduction of TEOXANE RHA fillers in Q2 of 2020. Co has agreed to issue 2.5 mln of its common shares to TEOXANE SA in consideration for the US distribution rights factored into the transaction. ZYXI (10.75 +10.04%): Continued strength following co's Q4 orders update, which was released yesterday morning; orders grew +129% yr/yr in the quarter and +31% sequentially, leading co to raise its outlook for Q4 revs and adj. EBITDA. At one-month highs.Small Cap LosersPTLA (13.98 -43.49%): Announced preliminary Q4 global net revs for Andexxa of $28 mln, including $4 mln from sales of Ondexxya in Europe. Andexxa/Ondexxya had achieved net product revs of $35.7 mln in Q3. Approx. 90 new accounts ordered Andexxa in the US in Q4. Andexxa's US performance was impacted by a $5 mln gross to net adjustment due to a return reserve for short-dated product and flat demand sequentially due to a decrease in utilization, primarily in tier 1 accounts -- co believes that in certain accounts, hospital pharmacies curtailed Andexxa use following drug utilization reviews to manage budgets. Co anticipates "continued strong demand" for Andexxa in 2020 in connection with Factor Xa inhibitor market growth. Oppenheimer cut co's rating to Perform; the firm had expected Q4 Andexxa revs of approx. $39 mln. At all-time lows. MTNB (1.47 -23.04%): Announced a public offering of 32.26 mln shares of its common stock, priced at $1.55/share, for expected gross proceeds of approx. $50.0 mln, which will be put toward purposes including developing co's product candidates, primarily MAT9001. At one-month lows. SPWH (6.63 -16.98%): Lowered its Q4 revenue and earnings guidance below consensus; the quarter's same store sales are expected to decline by 6-7% yr/yr. Results were impacted by "temporary headwinds," driven by competitors discounting firearm and ammunition inventory while exiting those categories as well as difficult yr/yr comparisons connected to certain legislative changes, all of which, exacerbated by the shorter holiday season, hurt traffic and sales more than co had originally projected. Co emphasizes "outsized growth" in its online channel and normalized store traffic trends noted in January, and it believes that competitive changes and industry consolidation will ultimately bode well for co over the long term, despite the short-term headwinds that they have engendered. At two-month lows.12:24SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (123) outpacing new lows (14) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: A, AAPL, AB, ACGL, ACIA, ACM, ADBE, ADSK, ADUS, AGN, AIZ, AKAM, ALL, AMRC, ANSS, APO, APPF, ARD, ATH, ATRC, AXE, AY, B, BBY, BDX, BIO, BKNG, BLDR, BLK, BMY, BRKR, BRO, CACI, CDAY, CNNE, COLL, COUP, CRL, CRM, CROX, CTXS, DERM, DOV, DXCM, EL, EMR, ENTG, EPAM, EQH, FB, FICO, FIS, FISV, FIVN, FRTA, GBT, GOOGL, GPN, GWW, HESM, HII, HRC, INFO, ISRG, JELD, KMI, KO, KRNT, LAMR, LAZ, LDOS, LLY, LMAT, LVS, MA, MASI, MCO, MDT, MIC, MS, MSA, MSFT, MTN, NLOK, NOW, NUVA, NVDA, PAYC, PCTY, PEGA, POWI, PRFT, RMD, RPAY, SAIC, SEDG, SHOP, SNPS, SNX, SPGI, SPNS, SYNH, TDG, TGTX, TJX, TKR, TMO, TREX, TROW, TRU, V, VAR, VEC, WCG, WLTW, WSC, WSM, XENE, XLRN, YNDX, YUMC, ZNGA, ZYMEStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ASIX, CEIX, CNK, CONN, DD, GCI, GOSS, GPOR, HRTG, MAC, PTLA, S, SIX, WETFThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CABO, CSWI, HURN, SARETFs that traded to 52 week highs: BKF, DIA, EEB, EWC, EWG, GXC, HYG, IGV, IHI, IOO, IWF, IYF, IYH, IYJ, JNK, OEF, PBD, PFF, PHO, PPA, PSK, QQQ, RSX, RTH, SKYY, SOCL, SPY, UYG, VTI, XLI, XLK, XLVETFs that traded to 52 week lows: VXX, VXZ11:54ENDP Endo Intl subsidiaries settle opioid investigation with the State of Oklahoma for $8.75 mln (4.49 +0.08)The Settlement Agreement fully and finally resolves Oklahoma's investigation of the Settling Parties in connection with the opioid abuse crisis in Oklahoma and includes a release of all associated claims by Oklahoma to the Settling Parties and all of their affiliated entities.

Instead, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed the 29,000 line earlier, continuing its record-setting run.Today's action has been mixed so far, however, partly on a sense that some exhaustion might be setting in after a busy week filled with a lot of headline angst.The latter point notwithstanding, the S&P 500 is up 1.4% for the week, following through on a great fourth quarter rally to end 2019. So, the idea that it is overbought on a short-term basis and due for a pullback continues to hang out there and has participants on close watch for a reversal trade.Today has had a little more guarded feel to it. The information technology sector (+0.2%) has remained an important leadership group, yet some of the more defensive-oriented areas of the market -- real estate (+0.6%), utilities (+0.5%), health care (+0.3%), and consumer staples (+0.1%) -- are stepping up. Also, long-term yields continue to come down.The 10-yr note yield is down four basis points to 1.82% following the December employment report, which was a bit light on job growth, but noticeably light on average hourly earnings growth and the length of the average workweek, and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announcing new sanctions on Iran.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is flat; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%; and the Russell 2000 is down 0.3%.11:31NLSN Nielsen acquires Precima from Alliance Data Systems (ADS); terms not disclosed (20.04 -0.05)Nielsen Global Connect has completed its acquisition of Precima, an industry-leading, SaaS-based provider of powerful retail and customer data applications and analytics, from Alliance Data Systems. By bringing Precima into its measurement framework, Nielsen Global Connect will achieve a heightened advantage in the loyalty and personalization space, furthering its ability to help brands plan and measure the impact and success of personalized consumer offerings.10:40XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (60.01 -0.14)The major averages started the Friday session on a modestly higher note, but there are a few soft spots in the market. Three cyclical sectors (financials, consumer discretionary, and energy) trade in the red with energy (-0.3%) sitting at the bottom of the leaderboard.The energy sector outperformed earlier this week when concerns about an escalating conflict with Iran led to a spike in the price of oil. However, these concerns have waned in recent days, which has pressured oil, and, in turn, the energy sector. WTI crude is down $0.36, or 0.6%, at $59.20/bbl. The price of oil is now just above its 50-day moving average (58.70) and it is on track to end the week lower by $3.85 or 6.1%. The energy sector, for its part, is now down 0.7% for the week versus a 1.4% gain in the S&P 500.On a side note, Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, are scheduled to hold a press conference at 10:45 ET, when new sanctions against Iran are likely to be announced.Notable movers:Noble Energy (NBL 21.89, -0.56, -2.5%): weakest sector component, falling below its 50-day moving average (21.93) after slipping below its 200-day moving average (22.46) yesterday. Devon Energy (DVN 25.40, -0.45, -1.7%): sliding below its 200-day moving average (25.80). Cabot Oil & Gas (COG 17.15, -0.12, -0.7%): trying to remain above its 50-day moving average (17.10). Valero Energy (VLO 96.58, +1.40, +1.5%): refining name boosted by lower price of crude, rising to its 50-day moving average (96.31). Marathon Petroleum (MPC 60.12, +0.73, +1.2%): refining stock benefiting from lower price of crude. HollyFrontier (HFC 48.45, +0.29, +0.6%): outperforming alongside other refiners.10:23OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:HD Jan 225 calls are seeing interest with 2730 contracts trading vs. open int of 2730, pushing implied vol up around 12 points to ~28%.

The S&P 500 is flat, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the health care (+0.4%) and utilities (+0.4%) sectors outperforming the broader market, while the energy (-0.3%), financials (-0.3%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors underperform.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower. The 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.56%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index is little changed at 97.48. WTI crude is down 0.8% to $59.07/bbl.09:21WIRES On The WiresParsley Energy (PE) has completed its acquisition of Jagged Peak Energy (JAG).

In addition, the Company expects aggregate one-time charges of approximately $10 mln related to the China international agreements and certain unrelated litigation matters in the fourth quarter. For 2020, while the Company does not foresee any significant additional one-time costs or expenses irrespective of the outcome of the Six Flags-branded projects in China, the loss of all the China projects would result in no revenue for that market if Riverside does not cure the default and the Company is not able to engage other partners to complete any of the projects. Separately, the Company's North America parks experienced lower attendance in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the same period in 2018 due to softer than expected season pass and membership sales, primarily during the holiday sales periods. As a result, the Company expects total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 to be less than prior year by $8-$10 mln which would translate to revenues of $259.5-261.5 mln vs $285.6 mln Capital IQ consensus.07:47PCRX Pacira Pharma Chief Medical Officer Richard Scranton resigned effective January 24, 2020 (42.90 )Dr. Scranton has decided to pursue an opportunity at a private, early-stage biotechnology company.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.8%) also closed at record highs, while the Russell 2000 increased just 0.1%.The ease in tensions with Iran remained conducive for risk sentiment, even as President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau echoed a Newsweek report that Iranian missiles shot down the Boeing (BA 336.34, +4.97, +1.5%) 737-800 jetliner earlier this week. There was no indication the U.S. would reconsider its de-escalation strategy, though.Other positive factors included 1) upbeat holiday sales results, 2) several analyst upgrades, 3) weekly jobless claims returning to lower levels, and 4) China confirming Vice Premier Liu He will visit Washington from Jan. 13-15 to sign the Phase One trade deal.Apple (AAPL 309.63, +6.44, +2.1%) led the information technology sector (+1.1%) higher after Reuters reported that iPhone sales increased 18% yr/yr in China last month.

The persistent bullish momentum in the market exacerbated a fear of missing out on further gains amid a lack of detrimental developments.It's worth noting, though, that Kohl's (KSS 46.15, -3.23, -6.5%) did issue an earnings warning and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY 13.45, -3.20, -19.2%) withdrew its full-year guidance on top of reporting disappointing results. The broader market was not surprised or bothered by the news.U.S. Treasuries finished the session slightly higher.

The Company expects this to be mitigated going forward by its current longer-dated, 36-month product, which began shipping in November 2019. Flat quarter over quarter demand due to a decrease in utilization, primarily in tier 1 accounts. While physician demand remains strong, the Company believes that in certain of these accounts, hospital pharmacies curtailed use of Andexxa following drug utilization reviews in an effort to manage pharmacy budgets. Following this reduction, re-ordering patterns are stabilizing in many of these accounts16:18COT Cott acquires Clearwater; terms not disclosed (13.91 -0.28)Cott announced that Cott and Eden Springs, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cott, have acquired 100% of the shares of Hungarian company, Clearwater Kereskedelmi s Szolgltat Korltolt Felelossgu Trsasg.

The findings build on the previously reported three-month interim analysis, after two vaccinations, announced at the company's R&D Day in September 2019. mRNA-1647 is a wholly owned program in Moderna's prophylactic vaccines portfolio.The second interim analysis of the Phase 1 trial reports safety and immunogenicity of the first three dose levels (30, 90 and 180 g) through seven months (one month after the third vaccination) and the highest dose level (300 g) through three months (one month after the second vaccination). Neutralizing antibody titers were assessed in two assays utilizing epithelial cells and fibroblasts, which measure immune response to pentamer and gB antigens, respectively.Safety data were consistent with those reported at the three-month interim analysis. The vaccine was generally well-tolerated and there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events. As reported in the previous interim analysis, one related Grade 4 adverse event (AE) has been observed, which was an isolated lab finding of elevated partial thromboplastin time, which was elevated at baseline (Grade 1) and self-resolved on the next lab test with no associated clinical findings. Additionally, the company announced that the first participant was dosed in the Phase 2 dose-confirmation study.With the seven-month Phase 1 data and the launch of the Phase 2 study, the company is actively preparing for a global randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy of mRNA-1647 against primary CMV infection. Moderna has solicited and received Type C meeting feedback from the FDA on the preliminary design of the pivotal trial, which will evaluate prevention of primary CMV infection in a population that includes women of childbearing age.16:04EPRT Essential Properties Realty Trust has commenced 6.25 mln share common stock offering (25.48 +0.24)16:03RARE Ultragenyx Pharma reports "positive topline cohort 3 results" and "improved cohort 2" results from Phase 1/2 study of DTX301 (53.76 -0.27)Co announces topline positive safety and efficacy data from Cohort 3 and longer-term data from Cohort 2 of the ongoing Phase 1/2 study of DTX301, an investigational adeno-associated virus gene therapy for the treatment of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.In Cohort 3, there were two confirmed female responders as well a third potential male responder who requires longer-term follow-up to confirm response status.In Cohort 2, one female patient has newly demonstrated a response starting at Week 52 which was confirmed at Week 78. The two previously disclosed responders in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 also remain clinically and metabolically stable at 104 and 78 weeks, respectively. Across all nine patients dosed in the study, up to six patients have demonstrated a response.As of the data cutoff date, there have been no infusion-related adverse events and no treatment-related serious adverse events reported in the study. All adverse events have been Grade 1 or 2.RARE is continuing discussions with the FDA regarding the potential Phase 3 study design. Ammonia is expected to be a primary endpoint based on direct FDA feedback to date, with ureagenesis as a measure of biologic activity that supports the decision for patients to discontinue alternate pathway medications.Co states, "We are encouraged to see a more uniform response at the higher doses including three female responders. To date, three patients in the study have discontinued alternate pathway medication and liberalized their diets while remaining clinically and metabolically stable..."Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comLoad-Date: January 10, 2020End of Document

The S&P 500 is flat, the Nasdaq Composite is flat, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.Nonfarm payrolls grew by 145,000 in December, which was less than the Briefing.com consensus of 160,000 and less than the readings for November and October. Overall not a bad report, but it may have tempered some growth expectations for the fourth quarter.The market isn't overly reacting to the data, cognizant that the economy is still in good shape, but selling pressure has been kept in check despite calls for a pullback. Buying efforts, however, have shifted to the defensive-oriented real estate (+0.7%), utilities (+0.4%), and health care (+0.3%) sectors.Conversely, the financials sector (-0.4%) is being pressured by some curve-flattening action in the Treasury market while the industrials sector (-0.4%) is being dragged lower by shares of top-weighted Boeing (BA 332.48, -3.86, -1.2%). The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.82%.Boeing shares are back on the retreat after disparaging employee memos about the 737 MAX were released. On a related, Boeing supplier Spirit Aerosystems (SPR 70.85, -1.94, -2.7%) said it will eliminate 2,800 jobs, according to CNBC.In other corporate news, Six Flags (SIX 35.36, -8.41, -19.2%) issued disappointing Q4 guidance, KB Home (KBH 35.96, -1.10, -3.0%) missed revenue estimates, and GrubHub (GRUB 51.80, -3.93, -7.1%) denied prior rumors about a sale. Dermira (DERM 19.25, +0.91, +5.0%) has agreed to be acquired by Eli Lilly (LLY 137.98, +2.06, +1.5%) for $1.1 billion in cash.Reviewing today's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for December:December nonfarm payrolls increased by 145,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), private sector payrolls increased by 139,000 (Briefing.com consensus 157,000), the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%), and average hourly earnings were up 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The key takeaway from the report, which included updates to the seasonal adjustment factors for the labor force series derived from the household survey, was that average hourly earnings and the average workweek were both weaker than expected. That may temper any inflation concerns, but at the same time it is apt to temper consumer spending activity and overall GDP growth expectations for the fourth quarter.Wholesale inventories decreased 0.1% m/m in November (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing 0.1% in October. Wholesale sales surged 1.5% after declining 0.9% in October.The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity was strong in November, but it will still prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.12:38SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Portola Pharma (PTLA) slumps on fourth quarter Andexxa revenue expectations -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersSRNE (4.71 +38.12%): Received a non-binding proposal from a private equity fund offering to acquire a majority or all of co's issued and outstanding shares for up to $7.00/share. The stock closed yesterday at $3.41, meaning that the cap price indicated in the proposal would represent a more than +100% premium to recent levels. The stock last traded above $7.00 in July of 2018. At nine-month highs.RVNC (18.66 +13.18%): Signed a US distribution agreement with TEOXANE SA that makes co the exclusive commercialization partner of TEOXANE's Resilient Hyaluronic Acid technology, including the FDA-approved RHA 2, RHA 3, and RHA 4 products, which include lidocaine. The agreement also includes RHA 1, currently in clinical trials, as well as an ongoing collaboration for other pipeline candidates and a right of first negotiation to access TEOXANE's "novel cosmeceutical line" incorporating RHA technology. The deal and the RHA line give co "access to the fast-growing, billion-dollar U.S. dermal filler market," further positioning co to be the "innovation leader" in the US market for facial injectables. Co, now building out a US commercial organization, targets introduction of TEOXANE RHA fillers in Q2 of 2020. Co has agreed to issue 2.5 mln of its common shares to TEOXANE SA in consideration for the US distribution rights factored into the transaction. ZYXI (10.75 +10.04%): Continued strength following co's Q4 orders update, which was released yesterday morning; orders grew +129% yr/yr in the quarter and +31% sequentially, leading co to raise its outlook for Q4 revs and adj. EBITDA. At one-month highs.Small Cap LosersPTLA (13.98 -43.49%): Announced preliminary Q4 global net revs for Andexxa of $28 mln, including $4 mln from sales of Ondexxya in Europe. Andexxa/Ondexxya had achieved net product revs of $35.7 mln in Q3. Approx. 90 new accounts ordered Andexxa in the US in Q4. Andexxa's US performance was impacted by a $5 mln gross to net adjustment due to a return reserve for short-dated product and flat demand sequentially due to a decrease in utilization, primarily in tier 1 accounts -- co believes that in certain accounts, hospital pharmacies curtailed Andexxa use following drug utilization reviews to manage budgets. Co anticipates "continued strong demand" for Andexxa in 2020 in connection with Factor Xa inhibitor market growth. Oppenheimer cut co's rating to Perform; the firm had expected Q4 Andexxa revs of approx. $39 mln. At all-time lows. MTNB (1.47 -23.04%): Announced a public offering of 32.26 mln shares of its common stock, priced at $1.55/share, for expected gross proceeds of approx. $50.0 mln, which will be put toward purposes including developing co's product candidates, primarily MAT9001. At one-month lows. SPWH (6.63 -16.98%): Lowered its Q4 revenue and earnings guidance below consensus; the quarter's same store sales are expected to decline by 6-7% yr/yr. Results were impacted by "temporary headwinds," driven by competitors discounting firearm and ammunition inventory while exiting those categories as well as difficult yr/yr comparisons connected to certain legislative changes, all of which, exacerbated by the shorter holiday season, hurt traffic and sales more than co had originally projected. Co emphasizes "outsized growth" in its online channel and normalized store traffic trends noted in January, and it believes that competitive changes and industry consolidation will ultimately bode well for co over the long term, despite the short-term headwinds that they have engendered.

Instead, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed the 29,000 line earlier, continuing its record-setting run.Today's action has been mixed so far, however, partly on a sense that some exhaustion might be setting in after a busy week filled with a lot of headline angst.The latter point notwithstanding, the S&P 500 is up 1.4% for the week, following through on a great fourth quarter rally to end 2019. So, the idea that it is overbought on a short-term basis and due for a pullback continues to hang out there and has participants on close watch for a reversal trade.Today has had a little more guarded feel to it. The information technology sector (+0.2%) has remained an important leadership group, yet some of the more defensive-oriented areas of the market -- real estate (+0.6%), utilities (+0.5%), health care (+0.3%), and consumer staples (+0.1%) -- are stepping up. Also, long-term yields continue to come down.The 10-yr note yield is down four basis points to 1.82% following the December employment report, which was a bit light on job growth, but noticeably light on average hourly earnings growth and the length of the average workweek, and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announcing new sanctions on Iran.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is flat; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%; and the Russell 2000 is down 0.3%.11:31NLSN Nielsen acquires Precima from Alliance Data Systems (ADS); terms not disclosed (20.04 -0.05)Nielsen Global Connect has completed its acquisition of Precima, an industry-leading, SaaS-based provider of powerful retail and customer data applications and analytics, from Alliance Data Systems. By bringing Precima into its measurement framework, Nielsen Global Connect will achieve a heightened advantage in the loyalty and personalization space, furthering its ability to help brands plan and measure the impact and success of personalized consumer offerings.10:40XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (60.01 -0.14)The major averages started the Friday session on a modestly higher note, but there are a few soft spots in the market. Three cyclical sectors (financials, consumer discretionary, and energy) trade in the red with energy (-0.3%) sitting at the bottom of the leaderboard.The energy sector outperformed earlier this week when concerns about an escalating conflict with Iran led to a spike in the price of oil. However, these concerns have waned in recent days, which has pressured oil, and, in turn, the energy sector. WTI crude is down $0.36, or 0.6%, at $59.20/bbl. The price of oil is now just above its 50-day moving average (58.70) and it is on track to end the week lower by $3.85 or 6.1%. The energy sector, for its part, is now down 0.7% for the week versus a 1.4% gain in the S&P 500.On a side note, Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, are scheduled to hold a press conference at 10:45 ET, when new sanctions against Iran are likely to be announced.Notable movers:Noble Energy (NBL 21.89, -0.56, -2.5%): weakest sector component, falling below its 50-day moving average (21.93) after slipping below its 200-day moving average (22.46) yesterday. Devon Energy (DVN 25.40, -0.45, -1.7%): sliding below its 200-day moving average (25.80). Cabot Oil & Gas (COG 17.15, -0.12, -0.7%): trying to remain above its 50-day moving average (17.10). Valero Energy (VLO 96.58, +1.40, +1.5%): refining name boosted by lower price of crude, rising to its 50-day moving average (96.31). Marathon Petroleum (MPC 60.12, +0.73, +1.2%): refining stock benefiting from lower price of crude. HollyFrontier (HFC 48.45, +0.29, +0.6%): outperforming alongside other refiners.10:23OPTNX Early Options ActivityTaking an early look at the options market, we found the following names that may be worth watching throughout the day for further indication of investor expectations given their options volume and implied volatility movement.Stocks seeing volatility buying (bullish call buying/bearish put buying):Calls:HD Jan 225 calls are seeing interest with 2730 contracts trading vs. open int of 2730, pushing implied vol up around 12 points to ~28%.

The S&P 500 is flat, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%.Looking at the S&P 500 sectors shows the health care (+0.4%) and utilities (+0.4%) sectors outperforming the broader market, while the energy (-0.3%), financials (-0.3%), and consumer discretionary (-0.2%) sectors underperform.U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower. The 2-yr yield is down one basis point to 1.56%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.84%. The U.S. Dollar Index is little changed at 97.48. WTI crude is down 0.8% to $59.07/bbl.09:21WIRES On The WiresParsley Energy (PE) has completed its acquisition of Jagged Peak Energy (JAG).

In addition, the Company expects aggregate one-time charges of approximately $10 mln related to the China international agreements and certain unrelated litigation matters in the fourth quarter. For 2020, while the Company does not foresee any significant additional one-time costs or expenses irrespective of the outcome of the Six Flags-branded projects in China, the loss of all the China projects would result in no revenue for that market if Riverside does not cure the default and the Company is not able to engage other partners to complete any of the projects. Separately, the Company's North America parks experienced lower attendance in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the same period in 2018 due to softer than expected season pass and membership sales, primarily during the holiday sales periods. As a result, the Company expects total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 to be less than prior year by $8-$10 mln which would translate to revenues of $259.5-261.5 mln vs $285.6 mln Capital IQ consensus.07:47PCRX Pacira Pharma Chief Medical Officer Richard Scranton resigned effective January 24, 2020 (42.90 )Dr. Scranton has decided to pursue an opportunity at a private, early-stage biotechnology company.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.8%) also closed at record highs, while the Russell 2000 increased just 0.1%.The ease in tensions with Iran remained conducive for risk sentiment, even as President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau echoed a Newsweek report that Iranian missiles shot down the Boeing (BA 336.34, +4.97, +1.5%) 737-800 jetliner earlier this week. There was no indication the U.S. would reconsider its de-escalation strategy, though.Other positive factors included 1) upbeat holiday sales results, 2) several analyst upgrades, 3) weekly jobless claims returning to lower levels, and 4) China confirming Vice Premier Liu He will visit Washington from Jan. 13-15 to sign the Phase One trade deal.Apple (AAPL 309.63, +6.44, +2.1%) led the information technology sector (+1.1%) higher after Reuters reported that iPhone sales increased 18% yr/yr in China last month.

The persistent bullish momentum in the market exacerbated a fear of missing out on further gains amid a lack of detrimental developments.It's worth noting, though, that Kohl's (KSS 46.15, -3.23, -6.5%) did issue an earnings warning and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY 13.45, -3.20, -19.2%) withdrew its full-year guidance on top of reporting disappointing results.

Flat quarter over quarter demand due to a decrease in utilization, primarily in tier 1 accounts.

The findings build on the previously reported three-month interim analysis, after two vaccinations, announced at the company's R&D Day in September 2019. mRNA-1647 is a wholly owned program in Moderna's prophylactic vaccines portfolio.The second interim analysis of the Phase 1 trial reports safety and immunogenicity of the first three dose levels (30, 90 and 180 g) through seven months (one month after the third vaccination) and the highest dose level (300 g) through three months (one month after the second vaccination). Neutralizing antibody titers were assessed in two assays utilizing epithelial cells and fibroblasts, which measure immune response to pentamer and gB antigens, respectively.Safety data were consistent with those reported at the three-month interim analysis. The vaccine was generally well-tolerated and there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events. As reported in the previous interim analysis, one related Grade 4 adverse event (AE) has been observed, which was an isolated lab finding of elevated partial thromboplastin time, which was elevated at baseline (Grade 1) and self-resolved on the next lab test with no associated clinical findings. Additionally, the company announced that the first participant was dosed in the Phase 2 dose-confirmation study.With the seven-month Phase 1 data and the launch of the Phase 2 study, the company is actively preparing for a global randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy of mRNA-1647 against primary CMV infection. Moderna has solicited and received Type C meeting feedback from the FDA on the preliminary design of the pivotal trial, which will evaluate prevention of primary CMV infection in a population that includes women of childbearing age.16:04EPRT Essential Properties Realty Trust has commenced 6.25 mln share common stock offering (25.48 +0.24)16:03RARE Ultragenyx Pharma reports "positive topline cohort 3 results" and "improved cohort 2" results from Phase 1/2 study of DTX301 (53.76 -0.27)Co announces topline positive safety and efficacy data from Cohort 3 and longer-term data from Cohort 2 of the ongoing Phase 1/2 study of DTX301, an investigational adeno-associated virus gene therapy for the treatment of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.In Cohort 3, there were two confirmed female responders as well a third potential male responder who requires longer-term follow-up to confirm response status.In Cohort 2, one female patient has newly demonstrated a response starting at Week 52 which was confirmed at Week 78. The two previously disclosed responders in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 also remain clinically and metabolically stable at 104 and 78 weeks, respectively. Across all nine patients dosed in the study, up to six patients have demonstrated a response.As of the data cutoff date, there have been no infusion-related adverse events and no treatment-related serious adverse events reported in the study. All adverse events have been Grade 1 or 2.RARE is continuing discussions with the FDA regarding the potential Phase 3 study design. Ammonia is expected to be a primary endpoint based on direct FDA feedback to date, with ureagenesis as a measure of biologic activity that supports the decision for patients to discontinue alternate pathway medications.Co states, "We are encouraged to see a more uniform response at the higher doses including three female responders.

The S&P 500 is flat, the Nasdaq Composite is flat, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%.Nonfarm payrolls grew by 145,000 in December, which was less than the Briefing.com consensus of 160,000 and less than the readings for November and October. Overall not a bad report, but it may have tempered some growth expectations for the fourth quarter.The market isn't overly reacting to the data, cognizant that the economy is still in good shape, but selling pressure has been kept in check despite calls for a pullback. Buying efforts, however, have shifted to the defensive-oriented real estate (+0.7%), utilities (+0.4%), and health care (+0.3%) sectors.Conversely, the financials sector (-0.4%) is being pressured by some curve-flattening action in the Treasury market while the industrials sector (-0.4%) is being dragged lower by shares of top-weighted Boeing (BA 332.48, -3.86, -1.2%). The 2-yr yield is unchanged at 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.82%.Boeing shares are back on the retreat after disparaging employee memos about the 737 MAX were released. On a related, Boeing supplier Spirit Aerosystems (SPR 70.85, -1.94, -2.7%) said it will eliminate 2,800 jobs, according to CNBC.In other corporate news, Six Flags (SIX 35.36, -8.41, -19.2%) issued disappointing Q4 guidance, KB Home (KBH 35.96, -1.10, -3.0%) missed revenue estimates, and GrubHub (GRUB 51.80, -3.93, -7.1%) denied prior rumors about a sale. Dermira (DERM 19.25, +0.91, +5.0%) has agreed to be acquired by Eli Lilly (LLY 137.98, +2.06, +1.5%) for $1.1 billion in cash.Reviewing today's economic data, which featured the Employment Situation Report for December:December nonfarm payrolls increased by 145,000 (Briefing.com consensus 160,000), private sector payrolls increased by 139,000 (Briefing.com consensus 157,000), the unemployment rate was 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.5%), and average hourly earnings were up 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%).The key takeaway from the report, which included updates to the seasonal adjustment factors for the labor force series derived from the household survey, was that average hourly earnings and the average workweek were both weaker than expected. That may temper any inflation concerns, but at the same time it is apt to temper consumer spending activity and overall GDP growth expectations for the fourth quarter.Wholesale inventories decreased 0.1% m/m in November (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) after increasing 0.1% in October. Wholesale sales surged 1.5% after declining 0.9% in October.The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity was strong in November, but it will still prove difficult for wholesalers to gain pricing power given that inventory growth remains well ahead of sales growth on a yr/yr basis.12:38SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -- Portola Pharma (PTLA) slumps on fourth quarter Andexxa revenue expectations -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Small Cap GainersSRNE (4.71 +38.12%): Received a non-binding proposal from a private equity fund offering to acquire a majority or all of co's issued and outstanding shares for up to $7.00/share. The stock closed yesterday at $3.41, meaning that the cap price indicated in the proposal would represent a more than +100% premium to recent levels. The stock last traded above $7.00 in July of 2018. At nine-month highs.RVNC (18.66 +13.18%): Signed a US distribution agreement with TEOXANE SA that makes co the exclusive commercialization partner of TEOXANE's Resilient Hyaluronic Acid technology, including the FDA-approved RHA 2, RHA 3, and RHA 4 products, which include lidocaine. The agreement also includes RHA 1, currently in clinical trials, as well as an ongoing collaboration for other pipeline candidates and a right of first negotiation to access TEOXANE's "novel cosmeceutical line" incorporating RHA technology. The deal and the RHA line give co "access to the fast-growing, billion-dollar U.S. dermal filler market," further positioning co to be the "innovation leader" in the US market for facial injectables. Co, now building out a US commercial organization, targets introduction of TEOXANE RHA fillers in Q2 of 2020. Co has agreed to issue 2.5 mln of its common shares to TEOXANE SA in consideration for the US distribution rights factored into the transaction. ZYXI (10.75 +10.04%): Continued strength following co's Q4 orders update, which was released yesterday morning; orders grew +129% yr/yr in the quarter and +31% sequentially, leading co to raise its outlook for Q4 revs and adj. EBITDA. At one-month highs.Small Cap LosersPTLA (13.98 -43.49%): Announced preliminary Q4 global net revs for Andexxa of $28 mln, including $4 mln from sales of Ondexxya in Europe. Andexxa/Ondexxya had achieved net product revs of $35.7 mln in Q3. Approx. 90 new accounts ordered Andexxa in the US in Q4. Andexxa's US performance was impacted by a $5 mln gross to net adjustment due to a return reserve for short-dated product and flat demand sequentially due to a decrease in utilization, primarily in tier 1 accounts -- co believes that in certain accounts, hospital pharmacies curtailed Andexxa use following drug utilization reviews to manage budgets. Co anticipates "continued strong demand" for Andexxa in 2020 in connection with Factor Xa inhibitor market growth. Oppenheimer cut co's rating to Perform; the firm had expected Q4 Andexxa revs of approx. $39 mln. At all-time lows. MTNB (1.47 -23.04%): Announced a public offering of 32.26 mln shares of its common stock, priced at $1.55/share, for expected gross proceeds of approx. $50.0 mln, which will be put toward purposes including developing co's product candidates, primarily MAT9001. At one-month lows. SPWH (6.63 -16.98%): Lowered its Q4 revenue and earnings guidance below consensus; the quarter's same store sales are expected to decline by 6-7% yr/yr. Results were impacted by "temporary headwinds," driven by competitors discounting firearm and ammunition inventory while exiting those categories as well as difficult yr/yr comparisons connected to certain legislative changes, all of which, exacerbated by the shorter holiday season, hurt traffic and sales more than co had originally projected. Co emphasizes "outsized growth" in its online channel and normalized store traffic trends noted in January, and it believes that competitive changes and industry consolidation will ultimately bode well for co over the long term, despite the short-term headwinds that they have engendered. At two-month lows.12:24SCANX Stocks/ETFs that traded to new 52 week highs/lows this session - New highs (123) outpacing new lows (14) -Technical-Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: A, AAPL, AB, ACGL, ACIA, ACM, ADBE, ADSK, ADUS, AGN, AIZ, AKAM, ALL, AMRC, ANSS, APO, APPF, ARD, ATH, ATRC, AXE, AY, B, BBY, BDX, BIO, BKNG, BLDR, BLK, BMY, BRKR, BRO, CACI, CDAY, CNNE, COLL, COUP, CRL, CRM, CROX, CTXS, DERM, DOV, DXCM, EL, EMR, ENTG, EPAM, EQH, FB, FICO, FIS, FISV, FIVN, FRTA, GBT, GOOGL, GPN, GWW, HESM, HII, HRC, INFO, ISRG, JELD, KMI, KO, KRNT, LAMR, LAZ, LDOS, LLY, LMAT, LVS, MA, MASI, MCO, MDT, MIC, MS, MSA, MSFT, MTN, NLOK, NOW, NUVA, NVDA, PAYC, PCTY, PEGA, POWI, PRFT, RMD, RPAY, SAIC, SEDG, SHOP, SNPS, SNX, SPGI, SPNS, SYNH, TDG, TGTX, TJX, TKR, TMO, TREX, TROW, TRU, V, VAR, VEC, WCG, WLTW, WSC, WSM, XENE, XLRN, YNDX, YUMC, ZNGA, ZYMEStocks that traded to 52 week lows: ASIX, CEIX, CNK, CONN, DD, GCI, GOSS, GPOR, HRTG, MAC, PTLA, S, SIX, WETFThinly-Traded Stocks (ADV below 100k) that traded to 52 week highs on High Volume: CABO, CSWI, HURN, SARETFs that traded to 52 week highs: BKF, DIA, EEB, EWC, EWG, GXC, HYG, IGV, IHI, IOO, IWF, IYF, IYH, IYJ, JNK, OEF, PBD, PFF, PHO, PPA, PSK, QQQ, RSX, RTH, SKYY, SOCL, SPY, UYG, VTI, XLI, XLK, XLVETFs that traded to 52 week lows: VXX, VXZ11:54ENDP Endo Intl subsidiaries settle opioid investigation with the State of Oklahoma for $8.75 mln (4.49 +0.08)The Settlement Agreement fully and finally resolves Oklahoma's investigation of the Settling Parties in connection with the opioid abuse crisis in Oklahoma and includes a release of all associated claims by Oklahoma to the Settling Parties and all of their affiliated entities. In connection with the Settlement Agreement, Endo Pharmaceuticals has agreed to pay $8.75 mln to Oklahoma. The Settlement Agreement includes no admission of wrongdoing, fault or liability of any kind by the Endo Affiliates. The amount paid in connection with the Settlement Agreement is a fraction of the settlement and judgment amounts associated with other opioid manufacturers in Oklahoma to date.11:50TALKX Market Briefing: Starting to turn a little defensiveThe stock market is walking a steady line today, but it hasn't crossed the line yet that involves a broad-based wave of selling interest, which some think is overdue. Instead, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed the 29,000 line earlier, continuing its record-setting run.Today's action has been mixed so far, however, partly on a sense that some exhaustion might be setting in after a busy week filled with a lot of headline angst.The latter point notwithstanding, the S&P 500 is up 1.4% for the week, following through on a great fourth quarter rally to end 2019. So, the idea that it is overbought on a short-term basis and due for a pullback continues to hang out there and has participants on close watch for a reversal trade.Today has had a little more guarded feel to it. The information technology sector (+0.2%) has remained an important leadership group, yet some of the more defensive-oriented areas of the market -- real estate (+0.6%), utilities (+0.5%), health care (+0.3%), and consumer staples (+0.1%) -- are stepping up. Also, long-term yields continue to come down.The 10-yr note yield is down four basis points to 1.82% following the December employment report, which was a bit light on job growth, but noticeably light on average hourly earnings growth and the length of the average workweek, and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announcing new sanctions on Iran.The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%; the S&P 500 is flat; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.2%; and the Russell 2000 is down 0.3%.11:31NLSN Nielsen acquires Precima from Alliance Data Systems (ADS); terms not disclosed (20.04 -0.05)Nielsen Global Connect has completed its acquisition of Precima, an industry-leading, SaaS-based provider of powerful retail and customer data applications and analytics, from Alliance Data Systems. By bringing Precima into its measurement framework, Nielsen Global Connect will achieve a heightened advantage in the loyalty and personalization space, furthering its ability to help brands plan and measure the impact and success of personalized consumer offerings.10:40XLE Sector Briefing: Energy (60.01 -0.14)The major averages started the Friday session on a modestly higher note, but there are a few soft spots in the market. Three cyclical sectors (financials, consumer discretionary, and energy) trade in the red with energy (-0.3%) sitting at the bottom of the leaderboard.The energy sector outperformed earlier this week when concerns about an escalating conflict with Iran led to a spike in the price of oil. However, these concerns have waned in recent days, which has pressured oil, and, in turn, the energy sector. WTI crude is down $0.36, or 0.6%, at $59.20/bbl. The price of oil is now just above its 50-day moving average (58.70) and it is on track to end the week lower by $3.85 or 6.1%.

In addition, the Company expects aggregate one-time charges of approximately $10 mln related to the China international agreements and certain unrelated litigation matters in the fourth quarter. For 2020, while the Company does not foresee any significant additional one-time costs or expenses irrespective of the outcome of the Six Flags-branded projects in China, the loss of all the China projects would result in no revenue for that market if Riverside does not cure the default and the Company is not able to engage other partners to complete any of the projects. Separately, the Company's North America parks experienced lower attendance in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the same period in 2018 due to softer than expected season pass and membership sales, primarily during the holiday sales periods. As a result, the Company expects total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 to be less than prior year by $8-$10 mln which would translate to revenues of $259.5-261.5 mln vs $285.6 mln Capital IQ consensus.07:47PCRX Pacira Pharma Chief Medical Officer Richard Scranton resigned effective January 24, 2020 (42.90 )Dr. Scranton has decided to pursue an opportunity at a private, early-stage biotechnology company.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.8%) also closed at record highs, while the Russell 2000 increased just 0.1%.The ease in tensions with Iran remained conducive for risk sentiment, even as President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau echoed a Newsweek report that Iranian missiles shot down the Boeing (BA 336.34, +4.97, +1.5%) 737-800 jetliner earlier this week. There was no indication the U.S. would reconsider its de-escalation strategy, though.Other positive factors included 1) upbeat holiday sales results, 2) several analyst upgrades, 3) weekly jobless claims returning to lower levels, and 4) China confirming Vice Premier Liu He will visit Washington from Jan. 13-15 to sign the Phase One trade deal.Apple (AAPL 309.63, +6.44, +2.1%) led the information technology sector (+1.1%) higher after Reuters reported that iPhone sales increased 18% yr/yr in China last month.

The persistent bullish momentum in the market exacerbated a fear of missing out on further gains amid a lack of detrimental developments.It's worth noting, though, that Kohl's (KSS 46.15, -3.23, -6.5%) did issue an earnings warning and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY 13.45, -3.20, -19.2%) withdrew its full-year guidance on top of reporting disappointing results. The broader market was not surprised or bothered by the news.U.S. Treasuries finished the session slightly higher. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.57%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.86%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.1% to 97.44.

Continuing claims for the week ending December 28 increased by 75,000 to 1.803 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims have settled back down at lower levels, which reflect ongoing tightness in the labor market.Looking ahead, investors will receive the Employment Situation Report for December and Wholesale Inventories for November on Friday.Nasdaq Composite +2.6% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +1.5% YTDS&P 500 +1.4% YTDRussell 2000 -0.2% YTD16:21PTLA Portola Pharma plunges to $15.20 in extended hours trading after updating Andexxa guidance (24.74 +0.78)16:20NLOK NortonLifeLock announces special, one-time cash dividend of $12 per share of common stock (shares halted) (26.69 +0.08)The dividend is payable on January 31, 2020 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 23.16:19PTLA Portola Pharma guides Q4 Andexxa global net revenues to approx $28 mln; co to host conf call at 5pm ET (24.74 +0.78)Fourth quarter Andexxa net sales in the U.S. were impacted primarily by two factors: A $5 million gross to net adjustment due to a return reserve for short-dated product. The Company expects this to be mitigated going forward by its current longer-dated, 36-month product, which began shipping in November 2019. Flat quarter over quarter demand due to a decrease in utilization, primarily in tier 1 accounts. While physician demand remains strong, the Company believes that in certain of these accounts, hospital pharmacies curtailed use of Andexxa following drug utilization reviews in an effort to manage pharmacy budgets.

The findings build on the previously reported three-month interim analysis, after two vaccinations, announced at the company's R&D Day in September 2019. mRNA-1647 is a wholly owned program in Moderna's prophylactic vaccines portfolio.The second interim analysis of the Phase 1 trial reports safety and immunogenicity of the first three dose levels (30, 90 and 180 g) through seven months (one month after the third vaccination) and the highest dose level (300 g) through three months (one month after the second vaccination). Neutralizing antibody titers were assessed in two assays utilizing epithelial cells and fibroblasts, which measure immune response to pentamer and gB antigens, respectively.Safety data were consistent with those reported at the three-month interim analysis. The vaccine was generally well-tolerated and there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events. As reported in the previous interim analysis, one related Grade 4 adverse event (AE) has been observed, which was an isolated lab finding of elevated partial thromboplastin time, which was elevated at baseline (Grade 1) and self-resolved on the next lab test with no associated clinical findings. Additionally, the company announced that the first participant was dosed in the Phase 2 dose-confirmation study.With the seven-month Phase 1 data and the launch of the Phase 2 study, the company is actively preparing for a global randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy of mRNA-1647 against primary CMV infection.

MEKONG RIVER DAMS DISRUPTING LIVES OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN FISHERMEN, FARMERSStates News ServiceFebruary 20, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1353 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Tiem Ngern-tok pointed at the water level, shook his head and talked about dragon boat races to explain how dams in China and Laos have disrupted the lives of Thai people whose villages abut the Mekong River."During annual boat races the water was high," said Tiem, a government hydrologist at a water-measuring station in Ban Sob Kok, a village in Thailand's northernmost Chiang Rai province.A colleague interrupted him: "Three meters high."With water levels usually reaching about 10 feet in April, Tiem said this year's numbers were "exceptionally low.""In previous years, the levels were a bit over 1-meter high, but that was during the driest time in April, not this soon," he told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service. "In March and April, it will get worse."The Mekong is the world's 12th-longest river, stretching 4,350 km (2,703 miles) through six nations before draining into the South China Sea.More than 60 million people depend on the Mekong and its tributaries for food, transport and water. Experts say it hosts 474 species of fish the world's most biodiverse after Brazil's Amazon River.Thai farmers said their troubles on the river began when the turbines of the Xayaburi Dam started churning upstream from Nong Khai in Laos seven months ago, further disrupting the river flow that was already drying out even at the end of the rainy season."Lately there is no water. ... It's very dry," Mr. Chai, a fisherman in Chiang Saen who declined to provide his first name, told BenarNews. "There are impacts from the dams. We can see the sandy river bed."Last month, the Mekong River Commission (MRC), an inter-governmental agency that works with regional governments to manage the river's resources, warned that water outflows could potentially drop as Beijing said it was testing equipment at one of its 11 dams on the upper Mekong.Laos has built dozens of hydropower dams on the Mekong and its tributaries in its quest to become "the battery of Southeast Asia," exporting the electricity they generate to other countries in the region. Vientiane is preparing to build scores more dams in the years ahead while aiming to sell 95 percent of the Xayaburi Dam's generated power to Thailand.NGO: Villagers report 'unprecedented bluish water'But environmentalists say that dams threaten fish populations, alter the Mekong's natural hydrology and cause major soil erosion.Last week, members of the Network of Thai People in Eight Mekong Provinces submitted additional evidence to the Thai Supreme Administrative court, describing damage to fisheries and dramatic changes to the Mekong's ecosystem, while also challenging the legitimacy of a power-purchase agreement between Laos and Thailand."During this period, downstream of the dam, stretches of the Mekong in seven Thai provinces experienced sharp and unusual water fluctuations, and 'clear blue water' a phenomenon that signals an absence of the nutrients and sediment that are critical to aquatic lives and fisheries," the International Rivers NGO said in a press statement about the submission.Thailand last year said it would develop its own solar energy section, while officials said they were also reconsidering the government's decision to purchase large amounts of hydropower from Laos.Niwat Roykaew, co-founder of the Chiang Khong Conservation Group, based in Chiang Rai, and the Thai People's Mekong Network in Eight Provinces said the "unprecedented bluish water" underscored the fluctuations in water levels."These indicate troubles along all stretches of the river; impacts on fish migration, river bank erosion, impacts on flora in the Mekong," Niwat told BenarNews."The fluctuation endangers some trees, especially the water croton which is important to the Mekong," he said, referring to a shrub that helps prevent soil erosion during spawning season.Xayaburi's impact, according to the dam's critics, has been observed in parts of Thailand's Loei province, as well as in Nong Khai, Bueng Kan, Nakhon Phanom, Mukdahan, Amnat Charoen and Ubon Ratchathani provinces.Niwat said Bangkok hadn't done enough to push for solutions."The Thai government should leverage discussions about dams' water control management, how to, how much to, in accordance with seasons to keep the ecology functions, not to be severely affected like in the present," he said. "But the government isn't enthusiastic to do so."Early this month, Bangkok responded to the environmental protests by rejecting Beijing's plan to open up a stretch of the Mekong River in northern Thailand by blasting about 60 miles of rocks and dredging the riverbed.China's plan was aimed at creating a river link that would open up trade from its Yunnan province using massive cargo ships that would go through the five other Mekong countries Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos.But according to International Rivers, Beijing has already built seven megadams and 20 more are under construction or being planned in Yunnan, Tibet and in China's landlocked northwestern province of Qinghai."The scheme will drastically change the river's natural flood-drought cycle and block the transport of sediment, affecting ecosystems and the livelihoods of millions living downstream in Burma, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam," the NGO said in a statement posted on its website."Impacts to water levels and fisheries have already been recorded along the Thai-Lao border," it said.A study released by the Mekong River Commission in August 2018 showed that fish stocks in the river could fall by up to 40 percent, with a 97-percent reduction in the amount of sediment going downstream as a result of the dam projects.Last month, Thai water-resources chief Somkiat Prajamwong told BenarNews that he had documented complaints from villagers who had suffered economic hardship as a result of the river's erratic flow, which had lowered soil fertility and hampered yield in agriculture.Somkiat said he would raise the country's concerns during the next meeting of the river commission, expected to take place this month."We compiled from and studied those concerns of the people along the Mekong River," he said.Also in January, the Thai Ministry of Foreign Ministry responded to concerns raised about the drought and "greatly reduced" water levels on the Mekong and reservoirs in the region, saying this was caused by intermittent rainfall and climate change. The prime minister had instructed Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai to visit China on Jan. 23 "to discuss ways and means to alleviate the drought situation and mitigate its impact," the ministry said.That day Pramudwinai met with Wang Yi, China's state councilor and foreign minister, the ministry said in a statement."Both sides agreed that the severity of the drought situation caused by global warming has been affecting every riparian country, including China. The Thai Foreign Minister sought cooperation from the Chinese Government in alleviating this problem and mitigating the impact faced by the people in the downstream countries," the ministry said.Pra Apichart Ratigo, the abbot at the Sob Kok Temple in Chiang Saen district, said the water level in the Mekong at various times during the past five years had abruptly risen or receded "like someone turned a faucet on and off.""So I've noticed that the abrupt tidal changes were due to water-release control," he told BenarNews, as he called on Thai authorities to provide villagers with advance notice to water-level changes, "so that people can prepare.""Sometimes we would hear the news that China had released more water, but the news came late and the water came already," he said.Somdej Thanatulyakul, a fisherman in Ban Sob Kok village in Chiang Saen, a district of Chiang Rai, said the fluctuating water-level led to unpredictable fishing harvest."We caught more fish five years ago, even during dry season," he told BenarNews. "The water tides are unpredictable. They change so fast, fluctuating in rapid manner. Dams have such impacts."Reported by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.Load-Date: February 21, 2020End of Document

CRU: Impact of the Wuhan Coronavirus on the Steel IndustryPR NewswireJanuary 31, 2020 Friday 8:05 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 580 wordsDateline: LONDON, Jan. 31, 2020 BodyPR NewswireThe coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan has led to Chinese New Year holidays being extended and transportation restrictions introduced in order to contain the spread of the virus. Demand is normally weak during this period, but production continues as usual. Every day of lost activity across China could see demand fall by 2.5-3.0 Mt and transportation restrictions are likely to disrupt supply chains and production output in affected areas.BackgroundIn only 13 days from 16 January, the number of people infected with the coronavirus in China went from 45 to almost 6,000, plus over 9,000 suspected cases. On Wednesday 28 January, the death toll reached 132, with confirmed cases reported in 12 other countries, including the US, Japan, France and Singapore.More than 60 million people in 13 cities in China have been fully or partially locked down since the virus outbreak. On top of this, the Chinese government has extended the Chinese New Year (CNY) public holidays, to delay the mass migration of people back to work. In Shanghai and nearby Suzhou in Jiangsu province, the holiday period has been extended further, until 9 February. The only industries still working are those on the exception list: gas, water, power, telecommunication industries, medical machinery, pharmaceuticals and necessaries including supermarkets, food manufacturing. In the last three days, more areas outside the Hubei epicentre are now taking steps to limit movement of people.Steel demand is likely to be lower in the near termAlready weak seasonal demand is likely to slow further in China due to measures designed to reduce the spread of the virus, including an extension to the holiday period and the infrastructure restriction.The spread of the coronavirus has coincided with CNY holiday, a period when steel demand in China is particularly weak as most people working in construction, manufacturing, infrastructure and logistics are on holiday. However, the effect on steel demand so far is limited as most construction activity does not restart until after the Lantern Festival, which this year is on 9 February. Construction is the biggest sector driving China's 2.6 Mt of steel demand per day or 15-20 Mt per week.Read the full story:  https://www.crugroup.com/knowledge-and-insights/insights/2020/impact-of-the-wuhan-coronavirus-on-the-steel-industry/Read more about CRU:http://bit.ly/About_CRUAbout CRUCRU offers unrivalled business intelligence on the global metals, mining and fertilizer industries through market analysis, price assessments, consultancy and events.Since our foundation by Robert Perlman in 1969, we have consistently invested in primary research and robust methodologies, and developed expert teams in key locations worldwide, including in hard-to-reach markets such as China.CRU employs over 280 experts and has more than 11 offices around the world, in Europe, the Americas, China, Asia and Australia - our office in Beijing opened in 2004 and Singapore in 2018.When facing critical business decisions, you can rely on our first-hand knowledge to give you a complete view of a commodity market.

Silicon Valley Abandons the Culture That Made It the Envy of the WorldAtlantic OnlineJanuary 15, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1626 wordsByline: Alexis C. MadrigalBodyFor decades, whole regions, nations even, have tried to model themselves on a particular ideal of innovation, the lifeblood of the modern economy. From Apple to Facebook, Silicon Valley's freewheeling ecosystem of new, nimble corporations created massive wealth and retilted the world's economic axis. Silicon Valley meant young companies scrambling to create the next great thing, and that scramble delivered new products to the world, so innovation became linked to start-ups.AnnaLee Saxenian, a professor at the UC Berkeley School of Information, literally wrote the book on what differentiated the Valley from other centers of technology (particularly New England's Route 128). The key words were decentralized and fluid. You worked for Silicon Valley, and working for Silicon Valley often meant striking out on your own, not only to make your name, but because innovation itself required small firms with new visions. That's how disruption happened, no?Then the post-dot-com generation of companies became the most ubiquitous and valuable corporations in the world, and Silicon Valley's rhetoric began to change. Over time, the leaders of Facebook and Google, specifically, began to argue a new line: The most innovative, competitive companies are not small and nimble, but big and rich with user data. The real game isn't among American internet companies; it's global, and pits American giants against Chinese corporations, governments, and values. In competition with such power, small will lose, or so the executives warn when facing down antitrust action.When Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO, testified to Congress in April 2018,            a photographer captured his notes, which slimmed the contention down to its core: "Break up FB? US tech companies key asset for America; break up strengthens Chinese companies."Facebook's COO, Sheryl Sandberg, placed the words in other people's mouths to make the same point. "Let me share with you something else I heard in my meetings in D.C. And I heard this in private meetings from both sides of the aisle,"            Sandberg said on CNBC last year. "That while people are concerned with the size and power of tech companies, there's also a concern in the United States with the size and power of Chinese companies, and the realization that these companies are not going to be broken up."[           Read: Silicon Valley is not a force for good]           Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, said much the same last year. "Chinese companies are growing faster, they have higher valuations, and they have more users than their non-Chinese counterparts," he said. "It's very important to understand that there is a global competition around technology innovation, and China is a significant player and likely to remain so."This is a full reversal of the language that tech promoters used to sell Silicon Valley-style innovation and competitiveness for decades. Saxenian has noticed the change in how the Valley describes itself, or at least in how the dominant firms do. "Advocacy of the small, innovative firm and entrepreneurial ecosystem is giving way to more and more justifications for bigness (scale economics, competitive advantage, etc.)," Saxenian wrote to me in an email. "The big is beautiful line is coming especially from the large companies (Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple) that are threatened by antitrust and need to justify their scale."This sort of talk prompts one obvious, knee-jerk response: It's simply hypocrisy. When Google and Facebook were start-ups, their executives said start-ups were good. Now that Google and Facebook are huge, their executives say huge companies are good. It's cynical, if not unexpected.But there's a more troubling possibility. Maybe something has changed about the nature of innovation, at least in software.The start-up tradition traces back to Hewlett-Packard, the original company-in-a-garage, in 1937, and later to the            Fairchildren of the 1960s, a tangle of semiconductor companies that successively spun out of larger companies, one after the other. The go-your-own-way ethos infused later cohorts of entrepreneurs across the spectrum of technologies, all the way up through the 20th century. The best thing you could be in Silicon Valley was a founder, and the best thing a founder could do was supercede those who came before.The newest generation of companies has not been able to fulfill the latter half of that prophecy. It's more difficult to dislodge the elder companies, which have grown ever more entrenched and valuable. CB Insights, a research firm, recently added up the (           likely inflated) value of all            439 "unicorns"-start-ups that investors have valued at more than $1 billion-in the world. It got roughly $1.3 trillion, or about            one Apple's worth of market value. Remember, that figure accounts for hardly tech companies, such as Juul;            so-far dubious technologies, such as augmented-reality headsets from Magic Leap (valued at $6.3 billion on this list); and all the Chinese and Indian players.For start-ups not on the unicorn list-and even for many that are-the chance that they will have an initial public offering and remain independent is small. That means the only way their investors will get their money out will be via an acquisition by one of the large companies. Google, Facebook, and their ilk "have become enormous by swallowing small companies, so the network is no longer the network but the octopus," Margaret O'Mara, a historian at the University of Washington, told me.This could alter the course of technological development, not just corporate structures. Quantitative research suggests that big companies do different kinds of R&amp;D than their more modest counterparts. Instead of coming up with new products, they come up with            process improvements. "If the nature of innovation is distorted toward selling to an incumbent, you're going to get more feature-driven innovation rather than systemic disruption," Federal Trade Commissioner Rohit Chopra told me. As an example, O'Mara told me a story famous in Silicon Valley about how Xerox had a personal computer in its hands in the 1970s (           thanks, Alan Kay!) but declined to commercialize it. "You get to a certain degree of bigness, and you're making so much darn money on copy machines, why on Earth would you work on a PC and bring it to market?" O'Mara said. Apple, a start-up at the time, would famously popularize PCs instead.[           Read: Gadgets for life on a miserable planet]Even though small firms have been responsible for many of the Valley's most successful products and services, large firms have deep roots there too. As O'Mara points out in her book The Code, Lockheed Missiles and Space (later a unit of Lockheed Martin) was the largest Silicon Valley employer from the 1950s into the 1980s. The government supported the development of computing and networking in myriad ways. During the Cold War, the U.S. government pushed research dollars through a select few major research universities such as Stanford. Local companies directly benefited from this largesse, in terms of both the funding and concentration of talent around Palo Alto. It wasn't until the 1970s that the military-industrial beginnings of the technology industry gave way to a different understanding of how to make change in the world."The story the Valley told about itself has been very much a small-is-beautiful story since the 1970s," O'Mara told me. "It has a politics-this Vietnam-era rejection of the military-industrial complex, rejection of the mainframe, Big Business, Big Government, big universities."This led people to take risks and launch new projects and firms. Entrepreneurs from all over the world migrated to a place where people understood why they wanted to start companies. And the idea even embedded itself right near the heart of the Valley, at Google. The company's slogan,            "Don't be evil", had a particular meaning when it was adopted around the millennium. In the classic Valley mind-set, "evil is bigness of all kinds," O'Mara said.Now, of course, "the mainframe" has been replaced by the cloud, and companies such as Facebook have openly            called for government regulation around key platform issues. The biggest companies moved closer and closer to Washington, D.C.,            during the Obama era, and despite some teeth-gnashing,            stayed close after Donald Trump's election.What happens when you find yourself becoming the thing you said was evil? So far, the Valley response has been to find a bigger evil,            which is to say China. "China is building its own internet focused on very different values, and is now exporting their vision of the internet to other countries," Zuckerberg said in a            highly publicized policy speech at Georgetown University last year. "Until recently, the internet in almost every country outside China has been defined by American platforms with strong free-expression values. There's no guarantee these values will win out."[           Read: China's new frontiers in dystopian tech]There are obviously            legitimate issues with the Chinese version of regulating the internet. The problem is, there's no guarantee that "American values" will win out with American-headquartered technology companies either.Back when Facebook was a start-up, Zuckerberg sang an entirely different tune. "I don't want Facebook to be an American company,"            he said at a Startup School event in 2010. "Like obviously we're in America, but I don't want it to be this company that just, like, spreads American values all across the world."Maybe the company is still nimble after all.Load-Date: January 16, 2020End of Document

INTERVIEW: 'AS HUMAN BEINGS, EVERYONE SHOULD CARE ABOUT THIS ISSUE'States News ServiceJanuary 13, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1083 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Feroza Aziz, a 17-year-old Muslim-American high school student, posted a 40-second video about eyelash curling on the Chinese social media app TikTok in November as a ruse to discuss China's oppression and maltreatment of the Uyghur Muslim minority. The video begins as a tutorial for creating longer lashes, but Aziz abruptly shifts into a discussion of the plight of the Uyghurs to draw public attention to their situation in northwestern China's Xinjiang region. The video, which quickly went viral, was viewed more than 1.6 million times. TikTok subsequently blocked it and temporarily suspended Aziz's account for violating a policy on terrorism-related material. Nevertheless, Aziz says she will continue broaching the subject via social media. In an interview with Gulchehra Hoja of RFA's Uyghur Service, Aziz talks about why she is speaking out about the Uyghurs and what kinds of viewer feedback she has received. The QandA has been edited for length and clarity.RFA: How did you become involved in speaking out about human rights for oppressed peoples?Aziz: I've always been into human rights issues and other advocacy issues since I was around 12 or 13 years old. As an African-American and a Muslim-American, I've faced a lot of discrimination and a lot of prejudice and racism against my beliefs and where I have come from, and so I've always had this side of me that has connected to people who have been discriminated against as well regarding their religion, race, or ethnicity. It didn't really specifically mean that they had to be African-American like me or Muslim like me. I relate to everyone who is oppressed. For example, I live in a very Jewish community, and my heart broke always having to hear stories about the Holocaust from World War II, so I've always tried to be aware of oppression that occurs.RFA: When did you become aware of the suppression of the Muslim Uyghurs by China?Aziz: I became aware of the Uyghur situation around the winter of 2018 in January, and I did not find out through mainstream news, but through an Instagram post on someone's story. I found it out through social media. And I thought this is crazy that no one is speaking about this, that no one is speaking about this on the news or bringing attention to this. It's scary. This is a genocide of over a million people, according to the U.N., who are being detained. But we all know that those numbers are obviously higher now since it's been two years since that statement has been released by the U.N. I though this is crazy and scary and disgusting that people are being detained because they are Uyghur or because they are Muslim. And it's not just Uyghurs, but also other ethnic minorities and religious groups. I thought that this is very, very crazy that people are being punished or tortured because they follow a religion, or they are from a certain place. I thought that this is wrong and that people needed to speak about it. Unfortunately, no one is speaking about it.RFA: How did you come to use social media as a platform for speaking out about the Uyghurs?Aziz: I've continued to post on my social media platforms like Instagram to raise more awareness especially among family and friends. This time I didn't really have a following to give it to too many people, but one day I downloaded TikTok and saw that it was just videos for the youth, videos that were meant to be funny and entertaining and about fashion and makeup. I thought that maybe I should do something else. I always knew that this app had attention for those entertainment things, so I thought that if I made a video and pretended that it was an entertainment video a makeup tutorial people would want to watch it. That was one of my reasons. My second reason was, obviously, to disguise the video from China, because the first time I posted a video about the Uyghur situation, it got taken down. TikTok claimed it never happened, but it did.RFA: And then what happened?I did the video around Nov. 23, and it reached a million views right away, and it's reached millions of more views on Twitter, on Instagram, and on other TikToks it was reaching lots of views. I decided to post two more videos about it on Nov. 24. After that Monday, I saw that my account had been suspended from my personal device, and I could not get onto TikTok itself. I was suspended for a few days. One or two days later, my original eyelash tutorial was taken down by TikTok for around an hour. They said this was a human error, which I find mindboggling. I have access back to TikTok. I'm going to continue to spread awareness, and I'm always going to continue to spread awareness whether it's on any social media platform, whether it's at an event or a protest, a YouTube video whatever it is, I will always speak up about the oppressed, people who are discriminated against, and the Uyghurs especially.RFA: Have you received any threats because of your video about China's mistreatment of the Uyghurs?Aziz: Yes, I have received threats. I have not received any threats, thank God, from Chinese officials or the Chinese government. However, I have received some threats from Chinese accounts. Most of them are inappropriate in a sexual way, and there have been a few death threats. But aside from that, the reaction that my video has gotten has been extremely positive. I don't really like to focus on the negative like those death threats because, honestly, it's not that much compared to the positive impact it's created. I'm really happy because 60 percent of the viewers who have seen my video were thanking me because they had never heard about this, whereas the other 40 percent were saying, "Thank you for finally speaking up about this." I'm really happy that this video has gotten a lot of attention from this, and I hope it's not me who is getting the attention, but this issue, this genocide, this holocaust, is getting attention. As human beings, everyone should be scared about what's happening. As human beings, everyone should care about this issue, and it's sad that no one is speaking about it. Anyone and everyone should be speaking about this.

Continue reading TikTok owner ByteDance denies it's exploring selling stake in popular appIllustration by Alex Castro / The VergeByteDance is not currently exploring selling its stake in TikTok, despite a report from Bloomberg stating that preliminary conversations were held as scrutiny from US officials grows.TikTok head Alex Zhu sent an internal note to staff addressing the report, which was obtained by Reuters. Zhu told employees that  from time to time you may read stories in the media that are not true,  and called Bloomberg's report inaccurate. Zhu added that executives haven't hosted any  discussions with potential buyers of TikTok, nor do we have any intention to.  A TikTok representative also told Bloomberg that  these rumors are completely meritless. Bloomberg's report arrives as TikTok continues to recent attention from US officials, with some senators warning the app could be a security threat. Advisors to ByteDance executives recommended  everything from an aggressive legal defense and operational separation for TikTok to sale of a majority stake,  according to Bloomberg. The company could maintain it doesn't present any security threat when asked by US officials. ByteDance wants to maintain full control of TikTok, Bloomberg also reported, especially as the app continues to surge in popularity.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is looking into ByteDance's $1 billion purchase of Musical.ly in 2017. An investigation could determine if ByteDance has to divest Musical.ly assets, which helped build the TikTok platform. CFIUS has begun asking questions, and may recommend measures TikTok can take to  avoid divesting the Musical.ly assets it acquired,  according to Reuters. The investigation comes as tensions between the United States and China grow.Zhu added that executives haven't hosted any  discussions with potential buyers of TikTok, nor do we have any intention to  I remain deeply concerned that any platform or application that has Chinese ownership or direct links to China, such as TikTok, can be used as a tool by the Chinese Communist Party to extend its authoritarian censorship of information outside China's borders and amass data on millions of unsuspecting users,  Senator Marco Rubio stated.ByteDance has attempted to address concerns through a couple of initiatives. The company has tried to work with more American groups, including hiring an independent American law firm in October to review TikTok's content moderation practices. Another American firm was hired to review the company's security practices. The firm found that TikTok could not have transmitted user data from the China within the period they investigated.Despite the company's efforts to try and work with American firms, the more pressing issue is whether ByteDance   a company valued at $78 billion   can change people's perceptions of using a Chinese-owned app. As The Verge's Casey Newton wrote in November:As pressure escalates on TikTok, the company may find that it has few levers of support to pull on. Putting its executives forward outside the friendly confines of a press release would be a start. But so long as the Chinese government is looming behind the company's business practices, TikTok faces a credibility gap   and it's not clear what, if anything, can close it.Tags: See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/24/21036850/tiktok-bytedance-sale-stale-bloomberg-musically-congress-investigation-chinaContact Information:Julia AlexanderTags:,           Artificial Intelligence Newswire,           Wire,           United States,           EnglishLoad-Date: January 9, 2020End of Document

The S&P; 500 has a new historic high. Nasdaq and Dow Jones are closing in.                                  Wall Street woke up hovering near the historic highs. The Standard &Poor;'s 500 advanced 0.15% to 3,339.29 points, which set a record high. The Dow Jones added 0.23% to 29,357.09 points, very close to its ever-reached january 17 high at 29,373.62 points, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.09% to 9,517.42 points, after in previous trading set a record at 9,574.94 points.Catalyzing u.S. index gains is Beijing's decision to halve customs rates on US products worth $75 billion (€68 billion) in annual imports, which it pushed away briefly fears about the strong spread of coronavirus.A month after the signing of a truce in the trade war begun about two years ago between the world's first two economies, this measure, which will take effect on February 14, will cover customs rates applied since September 1, the Chinese Government's Customs Rights Commission has specified.However, the impact of china's health crisis continues to feel in the results season of U.S. companies at this time in force. Chip maker Qualcomm has warned of a potential impact of the surge in the sector, with a possible decline in sales and production.Today, before the opening of U.S. markets the social network Twitter reported an 11% year-on-year increase in revenues to $1.01 billion, above analysts' forecasts that pointed to revenues worth $994.5 million in the fourth quarter of last year.Between October 2019, Twitter recorded an increase of 7 million people linked daily to 152 million, compared to the same period a year earlier. According to Bloomberg, the consensus of analysts anticipated an increase in users to 148.1 million.       Load-Date: February 7, 2020End of Document

KYLIEBYTES: Is your data safe on TikTok?The State Hornet: California State University - SacramentoFebruary 19, 2020 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 684 wordsBodyIf TikTok makes you feel old, you're not alone. I'm still slightly confused about the whole craze. It's only been a couple years since I was making Vines with my friends at the mall, so everyone please, give me a second to comprehend this one.TikTok has everything from cringey lip-syncs to nail-biting, cinematic masterpieces. Simply put, it's another platform for people to show off their creativity. The app has been downloaded a shocking 1.5 billion times and spans 500 million active users across the globe.Users aspire for fame through posting short clips.  We even have a TikTok influencer on our own campus. There's a lot of personal success to be achieved on this app, where your videos can be viewed without even having the mobile software downloaded. RELATED: 16 questions with Sac State TikTok star Nebaiot LemmaAs a junior in college who just turned 21, I didn't really see the appeal here. I brushed it off until it began taking over. Now it's impossible to scroll down my Instagram feed without seeing at least a few viral TikToks.Story continues below TikTok.@tituswhatget the gat w prez nels #fyp #xyzcba? GET THE GAT - r3alslimsadi3Shortly after its popularity sparked worldwide attention, The Guardian released leaked documents from TikTok moderators, in which they were asked to censor videos critical of China's communist party. The Beijing-based company called ByteDance acquired TikTok, formerly known as Musica.ly, in 2017. The U.S government began investigating ByteDance amid these accusations, to find out if they're potentially giving American data to the Chinese government. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy even forbid the use of TikTok by U.S soldiers as a result of national security concerns.I understand our government's concern for our safety, to a degree. It's ironic nonetheless, and some opinions on the matter seem to be rooted in xenophobia. I think we should be wary of calling out Chinese-based tech companies when the facts are few and far between. Communists probably aren't spying on us through a mobile platform that records kids doing the "renegade."I'd love to hear McCarthy's opinion on this one though. Truly, the irony of it is painful. With the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal only a few years in our past, we probably shouldn't be pointing fingers all too fast.To briefly explain, Cambridge Analytica was a political consulting firm that purchased the personal data of millions of Facebook users without consent, to create targeted political ads during the 2016 presidential elections. If we can't protect the data of American citizens from our own presidential candidates, I think there's a lot more to be discussed on the domestic front.It's easy to say these are national security concerns, but the CEO of TikTok spoke to the New York Times and explicitly said that he "would turn down the country's leader if asked directly to remove content or hand over data from the app." That doesn't sound like a loyalist giving our data to a foreign government. He even noted that TikTok has zero servers in China - they're located in Virginia and Singapore. These scare tactics used in the media can have brutal consequences, and we should be careful pretending that these claims are at all credible.At the end of the day, the truth is you shouldn't be trusting anyone with your data. It's not just TikTok or Facebook, it could be any free platform that you choose to use. A common phrase used in tech is "if the product is free, then you are the product." You shouldn't need a law degree to be able to read the fine print, but it's best to educate yourself wherever possible in order to protect yourself.TikTok could be selling data, but maybe every other app you download is too. Your privacy is an important asset, and these scandals prove that we need to take our own precautions. Ultimately, you're probably safe recording your favorite trends on TikTok.Related StoriesSac State YouTuber hits it big with viral videos through TikTokCOLUMN: How toxic tech culture failed the democratic process (again)16 questions with Sac State TikTok star Nebaiot LemmaLoad-Date: February 20, 2020End of Document

Common Good Capitalism: An Interview With Marco RubioTargeted News ServiceFebruary 25, 2020 Tuesday 7:41 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1217 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, issued the following news release:Excerpts from Rubio's interview with American Affairs are below.American Affairs: What is "dignified work," as you see it? Labor issues are typically associated with the Left. Why should people on the political right be concerned about ensuring the opportunity for dignified work? And have left-wing welfare policies also misunderstood dignified work?Rubio: Democratic welfare policies--even the most well-meaning ones--assume dignity is about how much you can buy as a consumer and fail to make the connection between the various components of the common good. These institutions, like strong families, close communities, dignified work, and living out the mutual obligations of citizenship, are mutually reinforcing and cannot exist in isolation.A well-paying and stable job is the foundation of family stability and ultimately a healthy society. It teaches skills and creates social obligations that teach parents and children alike the importance of responsibility and hard work. Our economic policies should make good jobs as attainable as possible. Expanding, for example, the child tax credit is one way to make the existing jobs that are available pay more. Alternate proposals like simple cash payments sever the important connection between strong families and dignified work.American Affairs: Much of the media discussion around trade and China has focused exclusively on tariffs. Do we need to take other, more proactive measures to promote domestic economic development?Rubio: [D]omestic economic development will in great part be contingent on our ability to develop a coherent, pro-American industrial policy.American policymakers must pursue policies that make our economy more productive by identifying the critical value of specific, highly productive industrial sectors and spurring investment in them. Industries like aerospace, rail, electronics, telecommunications, and agricultural machinery--in essence, the same industries China is trying to dominate via their Made in China 2025 initiative--will create opportunities for dignified work and be vital to the national interest.No one should mistake this as a call for politicians and unelected bureaucrats to take over our means of production. But policymakers and commentators should remember that, from World War II to the Space Race and beyond, a capitalist America has always relied on public-private collaboration to further our national security.American Affairs: A recent survey found that a majority of children in China thought "astronaut" was the most exciting future career choice, while the top choice among American children was "YouTuber." Is this a high-tech future we should look forward to?Rubio: We celebrate the breakneck speed of new OS updates and social media apps that lead us to believe that we're going through huge tech breakthroughs with regularity, but we're really not. Instead of all of the lofty promises of Silicon Valley's "innovations"--which were supposed to bring us together and obviate geographic distances between family members and with old classmates--we see drags on productivity from constant internet distractions, self-segregation into internet communities with little face-to-face contact, and skyrocketing rates of bullying and mental illness among younger generations.A large proportion of Silicon Valley's enormous intellectual talent ends up by default channeled into figuring out what next app idea can churn out the most seed funding before getting acquired by a bigger fish... A smarter high-tech future would entail looking at developing industries like advanced space manufacturing, which are strategically important, offer dignified work, and use cutting-edge technology to move the ball forward.American Affairs: Senator Rubio, in a recent speech on "Common Good Capitalism," you said that "Our challenge is not simply one of cyclical downturns or the wrong party being in charge. Our challenge is an economic order that is bad for America. It is bad economically because it is leaving too many people behind. And it is bad because it is inflicting tremendous damage on our families, our communities, and our society." How did you come to view these problems as systemic in nature? And does the depth of these challenges mean that we need a more ambitious policy discussion than we have had recently?Rubio: The China challenge is not just a foreign policy or trade problem, but an indictment of an outdated and sclerotic political consensus.The reason China reveals structural problems is because the premise that it was good to expose American workers to China was a structural belief. Losing industries to China was not an "unintended consequence" of liberal trade and financial policies; it was very often the goal. It required an assumption that middle-class American families would be better off with cheaper imported goods and better financing terms on consumer debt. It required the assumption that the American economy would be better off with financial services as its comparative advantage. The reason these assumptions are wrong is not because the changes they brought weren't managed properly, or not pursued consistently enough, but because the underlying belief about what makes for a good society is not true.American Affairs: China appears to be leading the way in rolling out 5G telecommunications networks globally. Dozens of countries have signed contracts with Huawei, including several NATO allies. Can anything be done at this point? Do we need an American 5G components company to compete with Huawei?Rubio: The thing is, we talk about [China's trade practices] as being unfair, that it's not how the free market is supposed to work! And that's right--it's not. In the instances where we can try to reassert the historical rules of fairness where they're being blatantly broken (e.g., China's theft of American intellectual property, which costs our economy $600 billion annually), we have an obligation to do so.But we also need to recognize that these are the new rules while dealing with Beijing, in a sense. And we can complain, but that's not in the end going to help the American economy--or the individual American workers and families suffering because of China's exploitation. If our philosophy in economic policy is solely to maximize "efficiency," our firms are competing with ones backed by the full weight of the Chinese government. In the long run, that is a competition that market fundamentalists won't win.American Affairs: Your office has released two major reports on new economic threats to the United States: one on intensifying economic and technological competition with China and one on declining domestic investment. Why are these issues important?Rubio: China is the world leader in things we can no longer make at home even if we wanted to, from lithium-ion batteries to television panel displays.This is not just populist hype. It occupies the concerns of military generals, the executives of American companies competing for market share with Chinese companies, and patriotic Americans of all occupations and incomes. We are declining in significant and quantifiable ways that require urgent attention.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7029991 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 25, 2020End of Document

CPA strongly supports federal efforts to prosecute Huawei and other state-owned enterprises in China that engage in systematic IP theft of U.S. tech firms."Huawei is an arm of the Communist Party of China," said CPA Chair Dan DiMicco. "It became the world's largest telecom equipment company by stealing the technologies used in its products. The whole world knows that Chinese companies engage in hacking and industrial espionage. It's past time to take action. We congratulate the Trump administration for bringing this case against Huawei."Huawei has been repeatedly accused of intellectual property violations, including the theft of both Motorola's wireless technology and Cisco's router code. Huawei has also been accused of spying on behalf of the Chinese government. Recently, the telecom firm Vodafone found that internet routers purchased from Huawei contained hidden "backdoors" able to reveal confidential information.The new federal indictment alleges that Huawei hacked intellectual property related to robotics, cell phone technology, and router source code. The allegations add credence to concerns that Huawei's current dominance in 5G networks could threaten America's digital security. The Trump administration is now urging foreign governments to block Huawei from providing 5G equipment."The United States and other western countries needs to ban Huawei from supplying wireless equipment to telecom networks, consumers, and businesses," said Michael Stumo, CEO of the CPA. "Washington must also help U.S. firms to develop 5G systems. National and economic security are at risk if the United States can't supply its own networks and other sensitive digital applications."Click here (https://www.prosperousamerica.org/we_need_a_5g_wireless_technology_made_in_the_usa) to read CPA Chief Economist Jeff Ferry's recent article, 'We Need a 5G Wireless Technology Made in the USA.'[Category: Political]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7021280 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: February 15, 2020End of Document

Faced with the unstoppable spread, many countries, including the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Iraq and Israel closed their borders to the entry of travelers from China in a desperate attempt to limit their exposure to the epidemic. And each person, mainly those who travel regularly, take steps to prevent contagion: Wanda Nara is one of them.The model lives in Paris with her husband, Mauro Icardi, a PSG player, and her five children: Valentino, Benedict, Constantine, Francesca and Isabella. But he travels regularly to Italy, where he has his television job as a panelist for the Tiki Taka program and Big Brother Vip and other businesses. For this reason, with so many flights around Europe, he decided to take certain steps to avoid a possible contagion of coronavirus.As he showed through the stories on his Instagram account, under his sunglasses he used a white bargy with ventilation valve from a well-known brand.She also posted a video of her walking around the airport with the bar. He wrote: "I couldn't buy because they're exhausted, i was given by a barbijo, an airport saleswoman who said to me 'you travel a lot,' and gave me an unused one I had..."Wanda Nara with barbijo at Italy airport (Photo: Instagram) (Pablo Riggio/)The virus has already reached more than 20 countries, including Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany, Russia and Sweden, while Africa and Latin America seemed at the moment free from the epidemic. In Latin America, the governments of Guatemala and El Salvador have already suspended people from China from entering their territory. Death in the Philippines was announced just after Manila decreed an immediate cessation of entry of all foreign visitors from the Asian giant.In parallel, repatriation operations for foreigners in the affected area continued. A French plane, with 250 people in their thirties, including 10 Mexicans, landed on Sunday at a military base in southeastern France and a score of them have symptoms.

Huawei's new indictment in New York for theft of industrial secretsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishFebruary 13, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 734 wordsBodyU.S. justice on Thursday reinforced pressure against Chinese telecoms giant Huawei by bringing three new criminal charges against him, as the company's heiress's fate, in Canada's home prison, remains on hold.Brooklyn Federal Prosecutor Richard Donaghue accused Huawei of stealing industrial secrets and eskiming U.S. sanctions against North Korea.These three new charges add up to the 13 the company had already faced for a year in Brooklyn federal court for bank fraud and the alleged violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran.Indicted on the first charges in January 2019, Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, currently under house arrest in Canada, is still on the new indictment, albeit not being charged with further charges.Canadian justice has not yet ruled on his extradition claimed by the United States."This new indictment is part of the Department of Justice's attempt to irrevocably damage Huawei's reputation and business for competition-related reasons, rather than law enforcement," a Huawei spokesman said in a statement."The government will not win and we will prove that these charges are unfounded and unfair," he added.The U.S. Department of Commerce on Thursday once again renewed the deadline given to Huawei to continue selling services to U.S. companies, this time for 45 days, while looking for alternatives to this giant that Washington sees as a threat to national security.Several U.S. telecom companies rely on Huawei's cheaper equipment to bring Wi-Fi service to remote rural areas and will now have to find another partner.- Us spying risk -Against the backdrop of the U.S.-China trade war, the Trump administration sees that there is a risk that Huawei, the world's largest provider of telecommunications equipment, will spy for the Chinese government.On Wednesday, anonymous U.S. officials cited by the Wall Street Journal accused Huawei of secretly accessing global telecommunications networks through "back doors" designed to be used by law enforcement.The company responded that these allegations were "a smokescreen" and recalled that, according to a Washington Post article published Tuesday, the CIA used its own encrypted language company for decades to spy on other countries.The United States has called on many countries to dispense with Huawei's infrastructure for the deployment of the new 5G telephone network.Prosecutor Donaghue stated in the indictment that Huawei engaged in the theft of industrial secrets from 2000 until now, and that in 2013 it implemented an internal policy that encouraged its employees to "steal confidential information from rivals" with headquarters or offices in the United States, in exchange for the payment of premiums.The Chinese company is accused of trying to recruit employees from U.S. telecommunications companies, and of obtaining information from them related to the technology of the companies.This data allowed it to launch products similar to those of its competitors, at lower selling prices, according to the re-indictment.Among the examples cited is a professional salon in Chicago in 2004, where a Huawei employee was discovered in the middle of the night trying to photograph a competitor's computer server, which he had disarmed.Huawei then argued that the individual, who was carrying a pass that read "Weihua", was a subaltern who went to the salon on his own initiative, although his resume mentions that he was chief engineer in research anddevelopment of the company.The Brooklyn prosecutor's office claims that the company participated in several projects in North Korea, although one of its leaders had indicated in 2012 to a US legislative committee, under oath, that Huawei had no activities in that country.The accusation states that through its unofficial subsidiary Skycom in Iran, Huawei dodged the embargo on the Islamic Republic."Huawei also attended the government of Iran by installing surveillance equipment, including the one used to monitor, identify and stop demonstrators at the 2009 anti-government protests in Tehran," he adds.Nearly a year ago, in March 2019, Huawei pleaded not guilty to the initial 13 counts before a federal judge in New York.A total of five companies are indicted, all Huawei subsidiaries, as well as Meng Wanzhou and other group executives "who have not yet been arrested" and whose names are crossed out with a marker in the indictment.tu-lbc/ll/gmaLoad-Date: February 14, 2020End of Document

Support for Protesters in Hong Kong Grows in the USArkansas Traveler: University of ArkansasJanuary 15, 2020 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 556 wordsBodyUA students voiced concerns about protests in Hong Kong as tensions continue to rise after the Hong Kong government proposed a controversial bill in February 2019.Following the proposal of the Fugitive Offenders bill, which would allow convicted criminals in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China to face harsher censorship laws, protesters took to the streets of Hong Kong on March 15, 2019, in opposition of the bill.Alex Jackson, a sophomore who lived in Hong Kong for eight years, thinks the protests have shifted focus toward gaining more freedom from mainland China, he said."The bill was the straw that broke the camel's back," Jackson said, "After that, everything started to break out."People around the globe boycotted the video game company Blizzard Entertainment in Oct. 2019 for punishing e-sport player Ng Wai Chung. Blizzard issued Chung a year-long ban and revoked his winnings of $10,000 after he expressed his support for the Hong Kong protesters in a livestream.Jackson thinks Blizzard's harsh punishment of Chung was completely uncalled for and was only an attempt by Blizzard to save their reputation with their Asian audiences, he said.Members of the NBA, such as Daryl Morey, general manager for the Houston Rockets NBA team, showed support for the protesters in Hong Kong on Twitter. However, Morey later took the tweet down after the Houston Rockets lost contracts with several Chinese vendors.A week prior to the New York Brooklyn Nets' first home game of the 2019-20 season, many fans entered the arena wearing T-shirts with the phrase: "Stand with Hong Kong."Jackson thinks a lot of the support from these communities is misguided due to misinformation from both the protesters and the Chinese government, he said. Jackson doubts there will be any official support from the U.S., he said.However, Robert Lochner, a sophomore and committee member of College Democrats of Arkansas, thinks that it is important to show support for the protesters in Hong Kong because of how the people of Hong Kong are being treated, he said."If we stand up for Hong Kong, we are setting an example for the rest of the Eastern world," Lochner said.Lochner has tried to offer as much help as possible to Hong Kong by contacting Sen. Tom Cotton asking him to vote for the U.S. to stop selling tear-gas to Hong Kong police forces, he said.Response by the Hong Kong government to the protests has been escalating with the protests on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, resulting in the arrests of more than 100 protesters.Jackson thinks that for some people in Hong Kong, protesting is their only option because many are unable to leave the area, but he fears what long term effects the protests might have for those who continue to live in Hong Kong."For a lot of locals, their only option is to fight, because their whole futures are being destroyed," Jackson said.Jackson thought the 2019 riots would be similar to the Umbrella Riots that took place in Hong Kong in 2014, but realized as time went on that these protests were much more serious than previous ones, he said. However, he does not know if or when Hong Kong will return to how it was."I want there to be a change," Jackson said. "I want there to be a resolution, but both sides are too stubborn. The only way (the protests) will end is if China or Hong Kong changes."Load-Date: January 15, 2020End of Document

Former Google Exec: 'Don't Be Evil' Motto Is DeadStillman Advance: Stillman CollegeJanuary 6, 2020 MondayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: MARKETS; Pg. 1Length: 555 wordsByline: Jean GarciaBodyRoss LaJeunesse, who is now running for the Senate as a Democrat in ME, was a key player in executing Google's decision to leave the search market in China in 2010.He said he had executed Google's decision to stop censoring search results in China as required by its government.After being "sidelined from the on-going conversations on whether to launch Dragonfly", Google's secret Chinese project which was accused of being a tool to help the Chinese government censor and persecute its citizens, LaJeunesse "then realized that the company had never meant to incorporate human rights principles into its business and product decisions".Google spokeswoman Jenn Kaiser said in a statement provided to Engadget: "We have an unwavering commitment to supporting human rights organizations and efforts".LaJeunesse also voiced concern about Google pursuing cloud computing deals with the Saudi government and establishing an artificial intelligence center in Being. However, in a recently published open letter on Medium, the now-former Google executive claims that a lack of support for this very advocacy is to blame for his departure from the company. He says, at one point, during an all-hands meeting, his boss at the company suggested Asian employees "don't like to ask questions". He accused the company of ignoring his reports about workplace culture, and said he faced discrimination directly himself."The entire policy team was separated into various rooms and told to participate in a "diversity exercise, '" he wrote".LaJeunesse claims that eventually he was accidentally cc'd on an email from a senior HR director.In turn, he recommended the adoption of a company human rights program that would publicly commit Google to "adhere to human rights principles found in the UN Declaration of Human Rights".Barcelona 'leading the way to sign Spanish midfielder Dani Olmo'Capable of playing on the wing or as an attacking midfielder, Olmo starred at last summer's Under-21 European Championship. And not only to go to the Euro, but also to keep improving."A colleague was suddenly re-assigned to lead the policy team discussions for Dragonfly"."I then realised that the company had never meant to incorporate human rights principles into its business and product decisions", LaJeunesse wrote in the blog post.LaJeunesse concludes that standing up for human rights, women, people of color, and the LGBT community cost him his job. "As someone who consistently advocated for a human rights-based approach, I was being sidelined from the on-going conversations on whether to launch Dragonfly", the Google executive added.According to him, "Just when Google needed to double down on a commitment to human rights, it made a decision to instead chase bigger profits and an even higher stock price".He partly blamed the shift on the way co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin "disengaged" and let others run the tech juggernaut, noting that Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat was hired from Wall Street and that "beating earnings expectations every quarter became the key priority".Instead, he chose to leave the company and go into politics.An expert in human rights who spent more than a decade at Google and directed its worldwide diplomacy says the tech giant pushed him out a year ago because it no longer takes human rights seriously.Load-Date: January 7, 2020End of Document

Global Blockchain Technology in Healthcare MarketPR NewswireJanuary 6, 2020 Monday 1:15 PM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1307 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, Jan. 6, 2020 BodyPR NewswireReport Scope:The global market for blockchain in healthcare has significant scope and offers a comprehensive description and evaluation of the global market for blockchain in healthcare.It provides in-depth qualitative and quantitative insights of the report which align with the goals and objectives of our intended customers.Read the full report:https://www.reportlinker.com/p05835683/?utm_source=PRNThe market has been segmented on the basis of deployment mode, application and end user.Geographically, the global market for blockchain in healthcare has been divided into North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific (APAC) and the Rest of the World (RoW).A country specific breakdown of the market for blockchain in healthcare is also included in this report.The report covers the global blockchain in healthcare irrespective of the included countries.Countries were included mainly on the basis of total revenue generated.

The blockchain technology in healthcare domain is still in its nascent stage.However, it is expected to gain momentum in the near future owing to increasing funding and growing online frauds and data breaches. Blockchain can be defined as an intricate system that is used to package data in a way that can only be modified by certain users. In its purest form, blockchain will offer healthcare a safe and secure system to share data more e fficiently. Growing incidents of hacking, unauthorized access to health records, theft, unauthorized disclosure of information and data breaches in the healthcare domain will create a significant demand for blockchain technology in the near future. At present, the healthcare system is losing nearly REDACTED each year due to poor data integration, as per Medtronic PLC. In the healthcare industry, blockchain can optimize real data through vast connectivity, providing a new way of sharing, analyzing and verifying the information. This should lead to more R&D and more coordinated care for hospital systems. For patients and providers, it should mean having information when needed.Blockchain technology offers several opportunities to secure network infrastructure,to reduce complexity and to build secure and immutable information.Blockchain is gaining traction as a tool to assist the healthcare industry in overcoming various challenges such as high healthcare spending, security concerns and higher costs for insurers, healthcare providers, and patients.Blockchain technology in healthcare has been gaining momentum owing to the shift towards patient-centric approaches, and an increasing focus on proper storage and management of critical patient information. Approximately 90% of healthcare centers do not share health-related information due to difficulty intransmission, retrieval and analysis of data.Healthcare providers, organizations, institutes and agencies are reluctant to share information due to the concerns over data security and privacy. As a result, the adoption of blockchain technology is expected to grow significantly in the healthcare sector.Other factors leading to the growth of the global market for blockchain in healthcare include the growing demand for decentralization of medical records and the integration of technological advancements in the healthcare sector.The application of blockchain technology will also lead to a decrease in the growing threat of counterfeit drugs and an improvement in the rate of commercialization of breakthrough drugs, which will positively influence the growth of the market.Owing to these factors, governments in developed and emerging economies have started investing in blockchain technology. For example, in August 2019, the Chinese city Hangzhou received funding in the amount of REDACTED to invest in blockchain startups.Dedicated healthcare companies and the Chinese government contributed more than REDACTED of the funding. Additionally, the rising integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is another factor that will positively influence the global market for blockchain in healthcare.However, market growth will be curtailed due to factors such as a lack of awareness about this technology, a shortage of skilled workforce, and a lack of technical infrastructure in emerging economies.Additionally, security and privacy concerns associated with blockchain coupled with the ban on cryptocurrency in several economies are factors that will affect the growth of the global market for blockchain in healthcare.An initial coin offering (ICO) is a new way of raising funds for companies; however, it is not regulated similarly to venture capitalism and other funding resources. In September 2017, China and six other state administrations banned domestic ICOs and cited them as illegal means of fundraising as cryptocurrencies, as Bitcoins and Ethereum are not considered legal tender.Read the full report:https://www.reportlinker.com/p05835683/?utm_source=PRNAboutReportlinkerReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.
