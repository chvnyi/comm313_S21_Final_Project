Car House, Online Auto Products Platform, Files for US IPOMT Newswires Live Briefs PROJune 15, 2020 Monday 5:41 AM ESTCopyright 2020 MT Newswires All Rights ReservedLength: 583 wordsBody Car House, which runs a B2B online platform of auto-related products in China, filed plans Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed $37 million initial public offering (IPO), and listing on the Nasdaq. The filing comes at a time of increased tensions between Beijing and Washington, and proposals by Nasdaq and US legislators for more transparency and better auditing of China-based companies listed on US exchanges.Car House reported net income of $4.4 million on revenue of $30.9 million in the latest reported period ending June 30, 2019, compared with net income of $727,231 on $24.4 million in the year-earlier period. The 16-year-old Car House, based in Guangdong Province, operates an online business-to-business marketplace of automotive products, and also manufactures auto perfume and air-fresheners and other products for direct sale through the platform. The company recently entered the "auto beauty" business of car washing and detailing, but has a lone operating location. The bulk of Car House's business is its B2B e-commerce platform. "As a shopping platform, we provide the infrastructure and services for third-party merchants to complete transactions with customers on our platform," reported the company. There are 3,100 third-party merchants that sell through the platform, primarily to auto-parts retailers, car dealers and auto-repair shops. The platform's reported gross merchandise volume increased to $65 million in the H2 2019 from $46 million in H2 2018, reported Car Home. The company said 180,000 wholesale customers have registered to use its online applications.The company intends to use proceeds of the IPO to boost operational capacity of its e-commerce platform, promote business, upgrade facilities and for general corporate purposes.The New Jersey-based Network 1 Financial Securities, a broker-dealer, is the sole book-runner on the Car House IPO. Network 1 operates the publicchinesecompanies.com website. The Car House founder, CEO and Chairman Haitao Jiang controls 73% of company's stock prior to the IPO, with his ownership stake after the IPO not yet determined. However, according to the company's filing with the SEC, Jiang will remain the controlling shareholder after the IPO, owning more than 50% of shares.  Indexes of China-based small-cap stocks have meandered in recent years. For example, the Ishares TR/MSCI China small-cap exchange-traded fund (ECNS), which tracks an index of Sino-based small caps, is off 8.7% year-to-date and off 38.7% over the last five years. In May, Nasdaq proposed several new rules for IPOs, including a minimum $25 million capital raise, and that a minimum of 25% of public-company equity be offered in an IPO. The rule-changes did not mention China, but were interpreted as targeting Sino-based small cap iPOs that allowed founders to "cash out." Also in May, the US Senate passed legislation requiring China-based companies to certify they are not under the control of the Chinese government. In addition, the SEC has wanted to inspect audits of US-listed Chinese companies through the regulator's accounting oversight arm, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, but has been unable to access key  records of China-based companies, the agency has said. In April, the SEC chairman Jay Clayton, the oversight board PCAOB, and several senior staffers issued a public statement warning that disclosures by SEC-registered companies from emerging markets may be incomplete and misleading.Load-Date: June 15, 2020End of Document

TikTok starts $200M fund to help U.S. starsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 23, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 397 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- TikTok, an app owned by Chinese company ByteDance Ltd., is giving its top talent in the United States a reason to stay, even though President Donald Trump threatens a banTikTok created a $200 million fund that will be distributed to some American users with high numbers of followers to encourage them to continue uploading innovative content, the company said. TikTok already helps its stars find advertising associations and deals with Hollywood talent agencies. Now the fund will help ensure that American creators also get livelihoods directly with TikTok.American creators will need to apply to the fund from August. They must be over 18 years of age, constantly post and meet a certain threshold of followers. TikTok's star-stars' ability to "connect and cheer up large audiences has already propelled thousands of creators into brand partnerships, sponsorships and representation agreements with some of Hollywood's largest talent agencies," said Vanessa Pappas, general manager of the app in the U.S., in a blog post. "In a relatively short time, TikTok has grown to become a source of income and opportunity for creators and their families." Over time, TikTok will explore similar funds in other countries.TikTok has also signed a couple of agreements with music companies this year that increase payment for the use of songs, and is in the process of negotiating deals with the largest music companies.This additional incentive comes at a time when TikTok users fear what will happen to their habit, and in some cases, their incipient fame, if Trump fulfills the threats to ban the app. Earlier this month, the president said he could proceed, in retaliation against China for the spread of covid-19. Other U.S. government officials, including Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, have warned against the use of TikTok for data security reasons, so that information on U.S. citizens does not fall into the hands of the Chinese government.TikTok has repeatedly said that no US data is stored on Chinese servers or sent to Beijing. The company has been hiring heavily in the U.S. and looking to reduce the partnership with its owner. Meanwhile, the app has gained popularity. In the US, TikTok has been downloaded more than 165 million times, according to Sensor Tower.Original Note:TikTok Starts $200 Million Fund to Help U.S. Stars Make Careers©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: July 24, 2020End of Document

Trump says he plans to ban TikTok in the U.S.Politico.comJuly 30, 2020 Thursday 11:20 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 442 wordsHighlight: The move comes amid heightening worries that China could get access to U.S. user data.BodyPresident Donald Trump said Friday that he plans to bar the Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok from operating in the United States, a move that comes as officials across Washington accuse the company of posing a national security risk."As far as TikTok is concerned we're banning them from the United States," Trump told reporters traveling with him from Tampa aboard Air Force One. He said he could take action against the company as soon as Saturday.TikTok, owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, has come under fire from lawmakers and government officials on both sides of the aisle over fears that it could turn over American users' information to the Chinese government. TikTok says it has not provided consumers' personal information to Beijing and would not do so. The president said he could use emergency economic powers or an executive order to ban TikTok in the United States."Well, I have that authority. I can do it with an executive order or that," Trump said, referring to emergency economic powers. Trump made clear he was not in favor of a deal to let a U.S. company buy TikTok's American operations, following reports that Microsoft is in talks to do just that.An administration official said earlier Friday that the administration would force ByteDance to divest ownership of TikTok through a ruling by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed earlier this week that TikTok has been under review by the inter-agency body, which evaluates whether foreign investments pose security risks. ByteDance acquired TikTok's precursor, Musical.ly, in 2017. Mnuchin said Wednesday that he expected CFIUS to make a recommendation for action on TikTok this week.After reports of a planned administration action against the company surfaced earlier Friday, TikTok spokesperson Jamie Favazza said in a statement, "While we do not comment on rumors or speculation, we are confident in the long-term success of TikTok. Hundreds of millions of people come to TikTok for entertainment and connection, including our community of creators and artists who are building livelihoods from the platform."Fox Business and other news outlets reported that tech giant Microsoft is in talks to acquire TikTok, a move that would give the trillion dollar company a fresh footprint in the social media market. Microsoft declined comment on the reports. The Trump administration plan to order ByteDance to sell off TikTok was previously reported by Bloomberg.Cristiano Lima contributed to this report.Load-Date: August 3, 2020End of Document

Russia Accused Of Employing Hackers To Steal Vaccine ResearchThe FrontrunnerJuly 17, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Bulletin News Network, Inc.Section: INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 608 wordsBodyReuters (7/16, James, Scherer) reports Britain's National Cyber Security Centre alleged on Thursday that "hackers backed by the Russian state are trying to steal COVID-19 vaccine and treatment research from academic and pharmaceutical institutions around the world." According to a "co-ordinated statement from Britain, the United States and Canada," the attacks are attributed to the "group APT29, also known as 'Cozy Bear,' which they said was almost certainly operating as part of Russian intelligence services." NBC Nightly News (7/16, story 5, 2:00, Holt, 5.81M) reported Ciaran Martin, head of Britain's National Security Centre, "said there is no evidence the hackers stole any data, only that they infiltrated systems using malware and spearfishing."The Washington Post (7/16, Booth, Taylor, 14.2M) reports British officials "said there was 95 percent certainty that APT29 was part of the Russian intelligence services," and "US and Canadian experts concurred." The Washington Times (7/16, Blake, 492K) notes that "Cozy Bear has been identified by Washington as one of two Russian government-linked hacking groups that broke into the Democratic National Committee computer network and stole emails ahead of the 2016 presidential election."The AP (7/16, Lawless, Kirka) says "it was unclear whether any useful information was stolen," but British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said, "It is completely unacceptable that the Russian Intelligence Services are targeting those working to combat the coronavirus pandemic." Using what the AP calls "more general language," White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said, "We worked very closely with our allies to ensure that we would take measures to keep that information safe and we continue do so."Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, asked Thursday on Fox News' Bill Hemmer Reports (7/16) if the Russian hacking harmed our ability to develop an effective vaccine, said, "I think our institutions are quite capable of continuing down the road, moving on this project. I don't want to talk about the particular subject, but I commented weeks ago about Chinese activity to do the same, to steal the intellectual property of the United States from the companies that are investing in enormous resources in trying to find a vaccine to save hundreds of thousands, indeed, millions of lives. I regret that other countries are instead of working on the project and using their best minds and talents to solve this problem are trying to steal it from Western democracies who are making real progress on these very vaccines."According to Bloomberg (7/16, 4.73M), "It is unclear whether research facilities have been damaged or if the vaccine programs have been set back as a result of the hacks." The CBS Evening News (7/16, story 3, 1:40, O'Donnell, 4.42M) reported "the Kremlin has denied any wrongdoing, instead insisting they're getting close to developing a vaccine of their own." ABC World News Tonight (7/16, story 3, 1:10, Muir, 7.03M) called the allegations "potentially more evidence of Russian aggression towards America after its targeting of the US election in 2016."China Testing Vaccine Candidates On Soldiers And State Workers.The New York Times (7/16, Wee, Sim?es, 18.61M) reports the Chinese government is "offering several vaccine candidates to employees of state-owned companies and the armed forces, while also conducting clinical trials in other countries." According to the Times, "The unorthodox move, to test people separately from the normal regulatory approval process, reflects the formidable challenge facing China as it races to develop the world's first coronavirus vaccine."Load-Date: July 17, 2020End of Document

Russia accused of wanting to steal progress from covid vaccineCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 16, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 747 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- After a year of pandemic and nearly 600,000 deaths, the international race for protection against the virus escalated to a treacherous new level, with accusations that vaccine development has become a target of Russian cyberattacks.Vaccine-linked nationalism is already a concern as countries strive for future doses of vaccines, desperate to emerge from a global crisis that hit their economies.Science and money have been the main drivers so far, with the U.S. spending billions on experimental vaccine offerings and other countries trying to keep up. Government reports on Russian intelligence that hacked international research centers that develop inoculations against covid-19 add a plot that make us think about Cold War spy thrillers."What's at stake is bigger than ever," David Nides, a cyber health care specialist at KPMG, Chicago, said in an interview. "There's a race for a vaccine or treatment, and the prize is huge for whoever wins."Concerns about global access to vaccines have increased in recent months. In May, Paul Hudson, Sanofi's chief executive, said Americans would likely receive the French company's covid-19 vaccine before the rest of the world if it were successful, because the U.S. was the first country to fund their research. Sanofi later said the vaccine would be available to everyone.Vaccine boomThat led other countries and groups like the European Union to try to catch up, mainly by pooling funds for their own businesses or pushing for equitable access. There are more than 160 vaccine projects underway at companies and research organizations around the world. China's President Xi Jinping is committed to turning any vaccine developed by the country into a global public good, even if CanSino Biologics Inc. has already administered the vaccine to some Chinese soldiers.Companies and healthcare organizations have long been considered primary targets of cyberattacks, in part due to relatively lax security, a large number of access points and devices that can be penetrated. The value of the information they contain is also coveted. U.S.-based Merck &Co;. was the victim of a ransomware attack in 2017 that affected manufacturing, formulation and packaging.Attacks on health care and life sciences organizations have intensified during the pandemic. Cybercrime in the sector has increased by approximately 300% since May, compared to the same period last year, Nides estimated. Hackers working for the Chinese government are trying to steal valuable investigations into vaccines and treatments from U.S. organizations, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security warned in May.Russia has not invested in the scientific infrastructure that would allow it to develop vaccines as quickly as the US, the UK, China and other nations, according to Michael Ebert, executive vice president of advisory services at Focal Point Data Risk, a cybersecurity company in Tampa, Florida.'Global problem'The operation, which seemed to quietly steal information rather than hold it for ransom, shows how desperate Russia is to get guidance on how to make vaccines and gain access, he said."I don't think anyone cares about IP after the vaccine," Ebert said. "They see this as a global problem."The director of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, which is involved in the research of a vaccine, dismissed theaccusations of piracy, which the Kremlin also denied."This whole story is an attempt to tarnish the reputation of the Russian vaccine by some of the people who fear it will be successful," Kirill Dmitriev, executive director of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, said in an interview with Times Radio. "Because the Russian vaccine could be the first on the market and could be the most effective vaccine."Britain's National Cyber Security Centre said Thursday that vaccine and therapeutic sectors in several countries have been attacked by a group known as APT29 which, he reported, is "almost certain" part of Russian state intelligence. U.S. and Canadian security agencies then issued their own statements supporting the findings.The extent of the impact on research facilities or vaccine programs is unclear, although authorities warned that cyberattacks are ongoing.According to cybersecurity experts, criminal groups are exploiting the pandemic crisis with an increase in ransomware attacks against health care providers and medical centers.Original Note:Covid Cold War Flares Up With Claims of Russian Vaccine Hack©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: July 17, 2020End of Document

Continue reading In months, Britain will reportedly start to remove Huawei parts from its 5G networksThroughout much of 2019, the U.S. government warned allies not to use Huawei s networking equipment to build out their 5G networks. Countries like Japan and Australia heeded the warning while    Germany and Britain did not. The British had a difficult time reaching a decision and Prime Minister Boris Johnson came to the conclusion that there weren t any other choices except to use Huawei    parts for its 5G network. After all, the company is about one and a half to two years ahead of its rivals when it comes to technology. And thanks to its connection with the Bank of China, the    company offers its customers generous financing terms. So Johnson agreed that Huawei gear could be used to make up as much as 35% of the non-core parts for the country s 5G networks. The U.S.    government does not allow carriers to use Huawei s 5G networking gear for their networks because of the company s perceived ties with the communist Chinese government (which the manufacturer    continues to deny). Huawei is the world s leading supplier of networking equipment and currently is the largest smartphone manufacturer in the world. That is an amazing achievement considering    that the firm is not allowed to access its U.S. supply chain and is not permitted to license Google Mobile Services.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Johnson has changed his mind after the U.S. pleaded with him to reconsider. The Telegraph is reporting that the British will start removing Huawei s    equipment from their 5G networks as soon as this year. Plans are being drawn up to stop the installation of Huawei equipment in Britains s 5G networks starting in six months; at the same time,    the British will start removing the Huawei parts that have already been installed. A report is expected to be presented to Prime Minister Johnson this week that will note how the U.S. plan to    block major global foundries from shipping advanced chips to Huawei could force the latter to use components that might not be so trustworthy as far as Britain is concerned. The Tories, known as    the center-right party in England, is pressuring the prime minister to take a tougher stance against the Chinese company. Huawei says that there is no reason why the British can t trust it. A    spokesman said,  Huawei is the most scrutinized vendor in the world and we firmly believe our unrivaled transparency in the UK means we can continue to be trusted to play a part in Britain s    gigabit upgrade. It s important to focus on facts and not to speculate at this time.  But the British are worried that any talks with the U.S. and other allies over intelligence matters might not    be safe if Huawei parts aren t removed from Britain s next-gen wireless technology.See Campaign:https://www.phonearena.com/news/uk-plans-on-removing-huawei-parts-from-its-5g-networks_id125727Contact Information:Alan FriedmanTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: August 12, 2020End of Document

Continue reading Fordham University Disciplines Student (Austin Tong) for Political Instagram PostsFrom a Foundation for Individual Rights in Education post last week:On June 3, rising senior Austin Tong posted to his Instagram account a photo of David Dorn, a retired St. Louis police captain killed by looters in the unrest following the killing of George      Floyd. The photo included the caption,  Y all a bunch of hypocrites,  a reference to Tong s frustration, as a supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement, with what he refers to as  the      nonchalant societal reaction over [Dorn s] death. The following day, June 4, was the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre of pro-democracy activists. Tong, who emigrated from China as a child, posed for a photo holding a      legally-obtained gun off-campus, with the caption  Don t tread on me.  The caption also included an American flag emoji, a Chinese flag emoji, and a hashtag commonly used by Chinese citizens to      avoid censorship of online discussion of the Tiananmen Square massacre.Fordham wrote to Tong on June 8, when Dean of Students Keith Eldredge informed Tong he was under investigation by the university for the two photos. [The June 8 letter said,  Specifically, it      is reported that on June 3 and 4, and in the recent past, you made several posts on social media related to the current racial issues in the country and political issues in China, including one      in which you were holding an automatic weapon.  -EV] On [July 14], Fordham handed down its verdict: Tong was found guilty of violating university policies on  bias and/or hate crimes  and       threats/intimidation.  When Tong immigrated to the United States from China at six years old, his family sought to ensure that he would be protected by the rights guaranteed by their new home, including the freedom      of speech and the right to bear arms,  wrote Program Officer Lindsie Rank, author of FIRE s letter to Fordham.  Here, however, Fordham has acted more like the Chinese government than an      American university, placing severe sanctions on a student solely because of off-campus political speech. Tong s probation bans him from physically visiting campus without prior approval, taking leadership roles in student organizations, and participating in athletics. He is also required to      complete implicit bias training and write an apology letter. While what happened to me is a total disgrace, I hope to use my example as an opportunity for the millions of people out there that fear to freely speak, and to protest the serious case of      speech censorship in college campuses,  said Tong.  As the country is facing a disastrous constitutional crisis, it is no time to stay silent, and we have been silent for way too long. It only      takes the courage of the few to spark the patriotism of many. We will use this opportunity to let the world know that now is the time that we must speak loudly, fight for our rights, and let      those who silence speech know they will face consequences. As a private institution, Fordham is not bound by the First Amendment. But it is bound by the explicit, repeated, and unequivocal promises of freedom of expression it makes to its students,      including in its own mission statement:  Fordham strives for excellence in research and teaching and guarantees the freedom of inquiry required by rigorous thinking and the quest for truth. Fordham holds FIRE s worst rating for free speech and makes frequent appearances on FIRE s  Worst Colleges for Free Speech  list. Additionally, a state court ruled just last year that Fordham      violated its promises of freedom expression in censoring a pro-Palestinian student organization. Fordham is fighting that decision on appeal.Pretty appalling behavior by Fordham, it seems to me. Yesterday, Tong sued Fordham for allegedly failing to  substantially adhere[] to its own published rules and guidelines for disciplinary      proceedings,  a cause of action that New York courts recognize even against private universities, as the Palestinian student group case shows; you can read his legal arguments here.See Campaign:https://reason.com/2020/07/24/fordham-university-disciplines-student-austin-tong-for-political-instagram-posts/Contact Information:EUGENE VOLOKHTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: July 25, 2020End of Document

OP-ED: NC State Must Abandon Use of Zoom Technologies for ClassesThe Technician: North Carolina State UniversityJune 13, 2020 SaturdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 548 wordsByline: Nora E. Hassan, Guest ColumnistBodyWith many classes in the fall moving to online services, there are questions to be asked regarding privacy concerns. All digital platforms raise concerns surrounding individual privacy; however, Zoom's recent actions put it on a different playing field than other U.S.-based tech firms.The NC State community should be alarmed that Zoom agreed with the demands of the Chinese government to shut down a meeting of pro-democracy activists. These activists were located in multiple countries across the world, including mainland China, for a meeting to commemorate the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Zoom admitted to cutting off the pro-democracy activists in "obedience to China." Rather than apologize for shutting down this meeting and promising to no longer kowtow to the demands of an authoritarian regime, Zoom did the opposite. Zoom promised that in the future it would block mainland Chinese users from some meetings-those that offend the local laws of mainland China.Zoom, an American-based company, has acquiesced to the demands of the Chinese Communist Party . Zoom has chosen to side with the demands of the CCP over our American values. One country, two systems.Will our class discussions get blocked if we offend the CCP? Will our personal data, information and discussions be monitored by Beijing? Can NC State students and faculty trust Zoom video services? The US Senate, the US Navy and SpaceX, to name a few, do not trust Zoom.Perhaps the best starting point is the following question: Would the CCP even bother to interfere in academic debates? Overwhelmingly, the answer is yes. The CCP has long seen higher education as a war against free and open inquiry and academic freedom. Recently in Australia, whose higher education economy relies heavily on foreign students, specifically those from mainland China, a pro-democracy student was suspended from his university for two years due to his protesting in favor of Hong Kong's freedom.College campuses have long prided themselves on debates within the classroom. If using Zoom means this freedom of speech in classroom debates is limited or cut off by an authoritarian nation, then Zoom is not an option.NC State, who already has a troubling past relationship with the CCP (regarding the highly controversial Huawei Technologies), prides itself on freedom of academic thought. NC State should aim to continue to embolden academic freedom, but at this current moment, Zoom cannot guarantee that students and faculty will have such a right when using their services for classroom debate.Zoom cannot be a supplier of higher education in the United States and an extended arm of the CCP at the same time. Much like Zoom, NC State must choose: American principles and academic freedom or kowtowing to the authoritarian CCP?Using Zoom puts NC State students and faculty privacy at risk. So long as Zoom maintains its current stance it would be dangerous to use the platform for classes in the future. NC State has the chance to be a leader on this issue. I urge our community and campus leaders to cease using Zoom in the future until this issue is resolved. Anything else is a risk to our security, privacy and values.Nora E.

In Israel, Serbia, Bulgaria, Lebanon and other countries, protesters have gathered in city centers to express discontent with leaders they feel have not stepped up to the challenges the coronavirus has brought. India, Latin America and the Caribbean still face skyrocketing case numbers, and in the US, confusion and anger continue to swirl around wearing masks. Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, will start requiring customers to wear masks next week. In the UK, customers will be required to wear face masks in shops starting July 24.2. Race & PoliceGeorge Floyd's family has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city of Minneapolis and the officers involved in his death, calling the killing part of "a public health crisis." New body cam video of Floyd's last moments shows the officers cursed at Floyd and forcibly pulled him from his car while Floyd pleaded with them. The revelations aren't the only resurfacing of America's recent racial wounds. A city council committee in Louisville, Kentucky, will investigate Mayor Greg Fischer's handling of the Breonna Taylor case, as well as subsequent protests and the fatal shooting of a man as police handled the unrest. And now, more protests are roiling around the country. In New York, three NYPD officers were injured yesterday in a clash with protesters on the Brooklyn Bridge.3. Election 2020President Trump shook up his campaign team, demoting campaign manager Brad Parscale and elevating Bill Stepien to the role. It's no secret the President hasn't been happy with Parscale. Trump's highly touted return to the campaign trail fizzled when a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma -- promised by Parscale to be a 100,000-person event -- attracted only a few thousand supporters. Plus, recent polls show the President trailing presumptive Democratic challenger Joe Biden. However, gloomy poll numbers and campaign staff turnovers didn't stop Trump before the 2016 election. Stepien also worked for John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign and George W. Bush's 2004 reelection effort.4. HuaweiChinese tech company Huawei is facing more international challenges after the UK announced it will ban the company's equipment from its telecom networks, shutting the tech giant out of a role in building the country's superfast 5G wireless infrastructure. Huawei has long set its sights on leading the next global generation of wireless technology, but pushback from the US has clouded that vision. The US considers Huawei a national security risk, fearing its equipment could be used by the Chinese government for spying. The US has already levied sanctions and bans against the firm, and experts think the UK's decision resulted from pressure from across the pond and US warnings that using Chinese 5G vendors could jeopardize US-UK intelligence ties. If the US continues to hold influence over the issue, countries like Germany may also reconsider Huawei's role in their 5G plans.5. TwitterYesterday was a rough day to be on Twitter. Accounts of Joe Biden, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Kim Kardashian West, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, former President Obama and other prominent people were compromised in what was arguably the biggest security incident in the platform's history. The attackers took over accounts and posted tweets that appeared to promote a cryptocurrency scam.

Amazon asks its employees to remove TikTok from their phones (press)CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 10, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 268 wordsBodyUs online commerce giant Amazon friday asked its employees to remove the TikTok app from their phones against a backdrop of renewed tensions between China and the United States, according to US media."Amazon told its employees Friday in a note that they should remove TikTok on Friday to continue accessing email from their mobile phones, according to the Wall Street Journal.Acclaimed by younger people, TikTok thanks to its videos on humor, dance and music, belongs to the Chinese group ByteDance and has almost 1 billion users worldwide.Amazon has not yet responded to the AFP confirmation request."User security is of paramount importance to TikTok: we are fully committed to respecting the privacy of our users," said a social network spokesperson contacted by the AFP.While "we still don't understand your (Amazon's) concern, we are open to dialogue so we can resolve any issues you may encounter and allow your team to continue participating in our community," he added, and stated that the online giant had not yet contacted them.U.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he was considering banning the TikTok app, which is on suspicion of spying on the Chinese government.The platform has often had to defend itself against its ties with China, where its parent company has a similar application by another name.TikTok has always denied sharing data with the Chinese authorities and maintained that it has no intention of accepting such requests.In addition, TikTok announced on Monday that it will suspend its application in Hong Kong due to china's recent national security law.jul/vog/etr/dg/gmaLoad-Date: July 11, 2020End of Document

With Support of New York's Semiconductor Industry, Sen. Schumer Announces Bipartisan American Foundries Act, Bolstering U.S. Leadership in Microelectronics Sector, Dramatically Increasing Investment in Domestic Facilities, & Keeping Production on ShoresTargeted News ServiceJune 29, 2020 Monday 9:00 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2018 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Charles E. Schumer, D-New York, issued the following news release:Citing concerns that China is catching up to the U.S. in microelectronics production capacity, U.S. Senator Schumer unveiled the American Foundries Act, a bipartisan initiative that seeks to reestablish U.S. leadership and revitalize innovation in the global microelectronics sector. Schumer explained that the bipartisan legislation would make critical investments in domestic commercial and defense-related microelectronics manufacturing and research and development, and address economic and national security concerns by decreasing U.S. dependence on foreign-made semiconductor chips."The economic and national security risks posed by relying too heavily on foreign semiconductor suppliers cannot be ignored, and Upstate New York, which has a robust semiconductor sector, is the perfect place to grow this industry by leaps and bounds," said Senator Schumer. "America must continue to invest in our domestic semiconductor industry, including companies like GlobalFoundries, ON Semiconductor, IBM and Cree right here in New York, in order to keep good-paying, high-tech American manufacturing jobs here at home. We need to ensure our domestic microelectronics industry can safely and securely supply our military, intelligence agencies, and other government needs. This is essential to our national security and to U.S. leadership in this critical industry."The senator noted that even though the U.S. revolutionized the microelectronic industry and invented much of the key technology used to this day, competitors in Asia, especially China, have made huge investments into their microelectronics industries in recent years to challenge U.S. leadership. In fact, Schumer pointed out, 78% of cutting-edge wafer fabrication capacity is now based in Asia, with last year being the first year that North America fell behind China.Schumer has long-championed increased efforts to expand the domestic microelectronics industry, supporting companies like GlobalFoundries, which houses their most advanced 'Fab 8' manufacturing facility in Malta, New York, IBM, and others. With New York home to multiple major companies and research institutions in the semiconductor industry, the state is positioned to securely supply the U.S. government with critical technologies and maintain U.S. leadership in this technology, offering a tremendous opportunity for New York's semiconductor companies to expand operations, create more jobs in Upstate New York, and help the U.S. reduce its reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturing.Specifically, supporters of the American Frontiers Act include GlobalFoundries, IBM, ON Semiconductor, Cree, Inc., the Genesee County Economic Development Center, Hudson Valley Economic Development Corporation, Mohawk Valley EDGE, Cornell University, Binghamton University, and SUNY Polytechnic Institute."We applaud the powerful American Foundries Act of 2020 co-sponsored by Senator Schumer and the impressive, bi-partisan list of Senate leaders," said Tom Caulfield, CEO of GlobalFoundries. "Senator Schumer has supported semiconductor manufacturing and GlobalFoundries for many years and this legislation seeks the quickest route to boosting chip production in the U.S. We appreciate this timely and significant contribution as Congress and the Administration work through the best approach for federal investment to restore domestic leadership in semiconductor manufacturing.""The U.S. semiconductor industry drives economic growth through technological breakthroughs and plays a critical role in the nation's security," said John E. Kelly III, Executive Vice President, IBM. "IBM strongly supports the American Foundries Act of 2020 because this important legislation would sustain American leadership in semiconductor technology and establish a national strategy to move it forward. We thank Senators Schumer and Cotton for their leadership on this bill and urge the Senate to pass it quickly.""The American Foundries Act is a bold step to respond to the aggressive incentives available to overseas competitors and reverse the decline of semiconductor manufacturing in the United States," said Keith Jackson, President and CEO of ON Semiconductor. "ON Semiconductor urges the Congress to quickly advance legislation to promote American semiconductor research and manufacturing.""Cree continues to invest aggressively in silicon carbide manufacturing and research in order to support the growing, global demand for our technologies, and we believe advanced semiconductor manufacturing is essential to leading the acceleration of critical next-generation technologies. Like many other semiconductor companies in the U.S., we believe this legislation would provide necessary investments that move our industry and economy forward and we commend its introduction, " stated Gregg Lowe, President and CEO of Cree, Inc."Senator Schumer has long recognized that our 1250 acre STAMP site in Genesee County presents a tremendous opportunity to create thousands of high quality semiconductor jobs for the Western New York and Finger Lakes regions," said Steve Hyde, president and CEO of the Genesee County Economic Development Center (GCEDC). "Our challenge has always been the considerable cost to get the site developed and shovel ready in the global competition to land projects of this scale. This legislation though is a game changer in so many ways as it will support cutting-edge domestic semiconductor development and increases in semiconductor manufacturing capacity at a crucial time in our nation's history.""Senator Schumer's American Foundries Act is the type of innovative, bipartisan legislation that we need to build on our regional strengths and grow the Hudson Valley economy post-pandemic. With industry leaders like IBM, GlobalFoundaries, and soon ON Semiconductor right here in the Hudson Valley, it is no secret that investing in the microelectronics manufacturing and research and development space will enhance our ability to manufacture semiconductor chips, create jobs, and reimage our economy," said Mike Oates, President and CEO of Hudson Valley Economic Development Corporation. "HVEDC is proud to support Senator Schumer in his push to bolster our footprint in the growing semiconductor sector and we will continue working with him to keep the Hudson Valley on the map as a global industry leader.""Construction of new microelectronics and semiconductor fabrication facilities have the ability to change the economic landscape of a region and the proposed American Foundries Act proposed by Senator Schumer is a strategic investment to secure the United States' position as a global leader in microelectronics and semiconductor R&D," said Steven J. DiMeo, President, Mohawk Valley EDGE. "As our economy shifts away from the long-standing model of industrialism coupled with the uncertainty of a global pandemic, we now more than ever need the federal government to continue its support of game-changing industries like semiconductors and microelectronics. The construction of Cree's state-of-the-art 200 mm enabled SiC semiconductor facility at the Marcy Nanocenter in Upstate NY, is a pivotal example of what can be done when all stakeholders are working together to advance our high-tech ecosystem and regional economy and maintain the United States' global competitiveness."Emmanuel P. Gianellis, Vice Provost for Research and Vice President for Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property and Research Policy at Cornell University, said, "Senator Schumer has long recognized that the best way to keep America at the forefront of the technology revolution is to invest in research and development here at home. Not only does the American Foundries Act of 2020 direct critical resources into expanding the domestic production of microelectronics, it also points the way to the future with substantial funding for research and innovation. Cornell University is pleased to support this legislation and commends Senator Schumer for his leadership.""Whether we are talking about technology that enables advancement in AI for autonomous vehicles, smart energy for a greener environment or flexible wearable devices for human health and industrial monitoring, the United States government must remain on the frontlines, supporting industrial and academic innovations in advanced electronics manufacturing," said Harvey Stenger, president of Binghamton University. "We once again acknowledge all that Sen. Schumer has done and continues to do to emphasize the importance of research and development efforts in private labs as well as at research institutions like Binghamton University. We thank the senator for this latest effort to apply resources to enhance the bridge from early R&D to at-scale manufacturing that will lead to breakthroughs in next-generation semi-conductor research and keep the United States competitive and a leader in the global economy.""Leadership in the microelectronics industry is critical for America's continued economic and strategic competitiveness on the global stage. The American Foundries Act of 2020 will provide a more strategic national approach in advancing microelectronics capabilities, R&D, and workforce development and ensure our nation remains at the forefront of impactful innovation," said SUNY Polytechnic Institute Interim President Dr. Grace Wang. "This bill takes a bold approach to facilitate chip fab modernization efforts and investment in key areas such as fabrication, assembly, test, and advanced packaging to strengthen our nation's technological independence and agility for years to come."Schumer said he will aim to include the legislation as an amendment in this year's National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).Senator Schumer introduced the American Foundries Act of 2020 in the Senate, along with Senators Cotton (R-Arkansas), Reed (D-Rhode Island), Hawley (R-Missouri), Gillibrand (D-New York), Risch (R-Idaho), Jones (D-Alabama), Collins (R-Maine), King (I-Maine), and Rubio (R-Florida), and details of the bill can be found below:Support for Commercial Microelectronics Projects: Authorizes the Department of Commerce to award $15 billion in grants to states to assist in the construction, expansion, or modernization of microelectronics fabrication, assembly, test, advanced packaging, or advanced research and development facilities.Support for Secure Microelectronics Projects: Authorizes the Department of Defense to award $5 billion in grants for the creation, expansion, or modernization of one or more commercially competitive and sustainable microelectronics manufacturing or advanced research and development facilities capable of producing measurably secure and specialized microelectronic for defense and intelligence purposes.

WITH THE SUPPORT OF NEW YORK'S SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY, SCHUMER ANNOUNCES BIPARTISAN AMERICAN FOUNDRIES ACT, BOLSTERING U.S. LEADERSHIP IN MICROELECTRONICS SECTOR, DRAMATICALLY INCREASING INVESTMENT IN DOMESTIC FACILITIES, AND KEEPING PRODUCTION ON OUR SHORESUS Fed NewsJune 28, 2020 Sunday 11:11 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 2036 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, DC, June 28 -- The office of Sen. Charles E. Schumer issued the following news release:Citing concerns that China is catching up to the U.S. in microelectronics production capacity, U.S. Senator Schumer today unveiled the American Foundries Act, a bipartisan initiative that seeks to reestablish U.S. leadership and revitalize innovation in the global microelectronics sector. Schumer explained that the bipartisan legislation would make critical investments in domestic commercial and defense-related microelectronics manufacturing and research and development, and address economic and national security concerns by decreasing U.S. dependence on foreign-made semiconductor chips."The economic and national security risks posed by relying too heavily on foreign semiconductor suppliers cannot be ignored, and Upstate New York, which has a robust semiconductor sector, is the perfect place to grow this industry by leaps and bounds," said Senator Schumer. "America must continue to invest in our domestic semiconductor industry, including companies like GlobalFoundries, ON Semiconductor, IBM and Cree right here in New York, in order to keep good-paying, high-tech American manufacturing jobs here at home. We need to ensure our domestic microelectronics industry can safely and securely supply our military, intelligence agencies, and other government needs. This is essential to our national security and to U.S. leadership in this critical industry."The senator noted that even though the U.S. revolutionized the microelectronic industry and invented much of the key technology used to this day, competitors in Asia, especially China, have made huge investments into their microelectronics industries in recent years to challenge U.S. leadership. In fact, Schumer pointed out, 78% of cutting-edge wafer fabrication capacity is now based in Asia, with last year being the first year that North America fell behind China.Schumer has long-championed increased efforts to expand the domestic microelectronics industry, supporting companies like GlobalFoundries, which houses their most advanced 'Fab 8' manufacturing facility in Malta, New York, IBM, and others. With New York home to multiple major companies and research institutions in the semiconductor industry, the state is positioned to securely supply the U.S. government with critical technologies and maintain U.S. leadership in this technology, offering a tremendous opportunity for New York's semiconductor companies to expand operations, create more jobs in Upstate New York, and help the U.S. reduce its reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturing.Specifically, supporters of the American Frontiers Act include GlobalFoundries, IBM, ON Semiconductor, Cree, Inc., the Genesee County Economic Development Center, Hudson Valley Economic Development Corporation, Mohawk Valley EDGE, Cornell University, Binghamton University, and SUNY Polytechnic Institute."We applaud the powerful American Foundries Act of 2020 co-sponsored by Senator Schumer and the impressive, bi-partisan list of Senate leaders," said Tom Caulfield, CEO of GlobalFoundries. "Senator Schumer has supported semiconductor manufacturing and GlobalFoundries for many years and this legislation seeks the quickest route to boosting chip production in the U.S. We appreciate this timely and significant contribution as Congress and the Administration work through the best approach for federal investment to restore domestic leadership in semiconductor manufacturing.""The U.S. semiconductor industry drives economic growth through technological breakthroughs and plays a critical role in the nation's security," said John E. Kelly III, Executive Vice President, IBM. "IBM strongly supports the American Foundries Act of 2020 because this important legislation would sustain American leadership in semiconductor technology and establish a national strategy to move it forward. We thank Senators Schumer and Cotton for their leadership on this bill and urge the Senate to pass it quickly.""The American Foundries Act is a bold step to respond to the aggressive incentives available to overseas competitors and reverse the decline of semiconductor manufacturing in the United States," said Keith Jackson, President and CEO of ON Semiconductor. "ON Semiconductor urges the Congress to quickly advance legislation to promote American semiconductor research and manufacturing.""Cree continues to invest aggressively in silicon carbide manufacturing and research in order to support the growing, global demand for our technologies, and we believe advanced semiconductor manufacturing is essential to leading the acceleration of critical next-generation technologies. Like many other semiconductor companies in the U.S., we believe this legislation would provide necessary investments that move our industry and economy forward and we commend its introduction, " stated Gregg Lowe, President and CEO of Cree, Inc."Senator Schumer has long recognized that our 1250 acre STAMP site in Genesee County presents a tremendous opportunity to create thousands of high quality semiconductor jobs for the Western New York and Finger Lakes regions," said Steve Hyde, president and CEO of the Genesee County Economic Development Center (GCEDC).

Trump is increasingly relying on white supremacist ploys to fire up his base as he panics over his re-election chancesBusiness Insider USJune 23, 2020 Tuesday 05:51 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1493 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (John Haltiwanger)Highlight: Trump has repeatedly echoed the deceptions of white supremacists, which may be part of a broader strategy to exploit fear and prejudice.BodyAssociated Press• President Donald Trump in recent days shared tweets depicting Black people as violent and asked why people weren't protesting over it, which came amid nationwide demonstrations over racism and police brutality. • These tweets echoed the rhetoric of white supremacists, and are part of a broader strategy from Trump to exploit fear and prejudice as he fights to salvage his vulnerable reelection campaign.• Trump leaned on racism and xenophobia to garner support during his 2016 campaign, and he's employing a similar approach as the US gets closer to Election Day. • Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.With his reelection prospects dimming, President Donald Trump has increasingly employed the rhetoric of white supremacists in an effort to rile up his base and increase divisions in the US. On Monday night, Trump retweeted a video of a Black man punching a white department store employee, apparently during rioting in June, stating: "Looks what's going on here. Where are the protesters? Was this man arrested?" Earlier, Trump retweeted a video of a Black man shoving a white woman into the side of a subway car that asked: "Where are the protests for this?" In his tweet on the video, Trump said, "So terrible!" The Washington Post            reported this video appears to come from a 2019 subway incident, for which the man was arrested.These tweets came with the US in the midst of nationwide protests against racism and police brutality, largely spurred by the disturbing death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. Floyd, a Black man, died after a police officer knelt on his neck for roughly eight minutes.  Though the protests have zeroed in on systemic racism, they've also served as a profound rebuke of Trump, who has made his disdain for the demonstrators abundantly clear. The president referred to the protesters as            "thugs" during his first rally in months in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Saturday. It's a standard tactic of white supremacists to attempt to incite fear based on the false premise that Black people harbor violent hatred of whites. This white supremacist lie is often employed in an effort to deflect from evidence-based discussions on systemic racism and state-sanctioned violence against Black people and people of color. In 2015, a white supremacist shot and killed nine Black people in a church in Charleston, South Carolina. The shooter said he wanted to foment a race war. Court testimony said that during the shooting he yelled: "Y'all are raping our white women. Y'all are taking over the world."With these inflammatory tweets, Trump borrowed from the ideology and rhetoric of white supremacists, and it's part of a broader, divisive strategy the president appears poised to accelerate as he panics over his grim reelection prospects. David 'Dee' Delgado/Getty ImagesTrump is turning to racism amid backlash over his botched response to coronavirusIn 2016, Trump also employed a white supremacist playbook, stoking people's fears and biases in an effort to rally them behind his campaign. Trump began his campaign by referring to Mexican immigrants as rapists, drug dealers, and criminals. Among other blatantly racist and xenophobic moments along the campaign trail, Trump would go on to call for a ban on Muslims entering the US as he simultaneously depicted refugees as terrorists,            which he continued to do as president.Fast-forward to 2020, and Trump is rapidly leaning into a near-identical approach. During his Tulsa rally, Trump referred to COVID-19 as the "kung flu," which is part of the president's            racist effort to blame the pandemic on China in order to distract from his own failings in responding to the virus. The president has ignored recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to avoid rhetoric that            stigmatizes certain groups, often referring to COVID-19 as the "Chinese virus" or the "plague from China."In January,            February, and even            as late as March, the president was actually praising the Chinese government over its handling of the virus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.Trump's tone only shifted after cases began to spread at scale in the US, and it became increasingly clear that his administration had failed to adequately prepare for the outbreak. Polling has repeatedly shown that Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of Trump's handling of the virus. As Trump has often done in the process of seeking to avoid responsibility, the president found a scapegoat and portrayed COVID-19 as a "foreign virus" that invaded the US from China.Meanwhile, Asian-Americans have faced discrimination due in part to the Trump's racist accusations. Trump's white supremacist playbook also borrows from authoritarianismBRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)Experts and historians have warned that Trump's behavior in 2020 has increasingly mirrored that of authoritarians, and it is only            set to become worse if the president is left unchallenged."What we are seeing now is a disturbing preview of what will likely be worse in the months ahead. He is clearly going to run a scorched-earth election campaign laced with lies, conspiracy theories, racial division, and even incitement of violence," Brian Klaas, a political scientist at the University College London, told Insider earlier this month. Last Thursday, Facebook took down dozens of ads put up by Trump's reelection campaign that included a symbol once used by the Nazis to classify or identify political prisoners in concentration camps.The ads were part of Trump's efforts to blame isolated instances of violence at recent protests on antifa, a loosely affiliated group of left-wing anti-fascist activists. But there's little evidence to support this. At the same time, Trump has praised law enforcement for            violent crackdowns on protesters. Facebook and Twitter also within the past week removed a doctored "racist baby" video shared by Trump after a copyright complaint from the parents of one of the children in the clip. The doctored video made light of racism, and depicted a Black baby and a white baby running down a sidewalk with a fake CNN chyron: "Terrified toddler runs from racist baby."And in the midst of the nationwide conversation on racism, Trump has positioned himself firmly against those who wish to see monuments to the Confederacy removed or renamed.Indeed, a president who has repeatedly proclaimed his disgust for losers has recently expressed fervent support for continuing to memorialize a defeated, traitorous army that fought to perpetuate slavery. Along these lines, at his rally in Tulsa on Saturday, Trump spoke of the need to "save your heritage," echoing the language of neo-Nazis who often discuss the need to fight to preserve their "white heritage."None of Trump's behavior is coincidentalTrump's reelection campaign is in trouble. Multiple recent polls have shown former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, with a double-digit lead over Trump. The former vice president has also seen a huge uptick in financial support in recent weeks, and is            catching up on the president in terms of fundraising.Between his botched response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to over 120,000 confirmed fatalities in the US, and the nationwide protests over racism that have morphed into an anti-Trump movement, the president's approval numbers have also tanked in recent weeks. The most recent Gallup polling put Trump's approval rating at an abysmal 39%. The president was also reportedly shocked and enraged over turnout at his Tulsa rally. Roughly 6,200 people showed up to a stadium that can hold a little over 19,000. Trump is in panic-mode, and when fear sets in he resorts to what he knows best: demagoguery. It's an approach that worked for Trump in the past, and is reminiscent of the "Southern strategy," which worked well for President Richard Nixon. But given the watershed moment the US experiencing, this game plan could now backfire on Trump.More Americans than ever say that racism is pervasive in their country. The Black Lives Matter movement is now mainstream, and Trump is swimming against the current of history. But all of this also might make Trump more aggressive than ever as he fights for political survival. The past few weeks have likely only been a sample of the ugliness to come as the US gets closer to Election Day. NOW WATCH: Why electric planes haven't taken off yetSee Also:• The 'Students for Trump' campaign scrapped online registration for his next event after TikTok teens hijacked sign-ups for his Tulsa rally• Trump called for protesters who deface statues to face prison time, after demonstrators targeted a statue of President Andrew Jackson right outside the White House• The Trump campaign is rethinking massive arena rallies after Saturday's poor turnout in TulsaLoad-Date: June 23, 2020End of Document

Instagram pounces on India market after TikTok is bannedCNN WireJuly 8, 2020 Wednesday 2:44 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 471 wordsDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  TikTok has had a difficult week, to say the least --- and rival Instagram just made it much harder.India, which has the most TikTok downloads outside of China, announced late last week that it would ban the popular video-sharing platform and several other Chinese apps, saying they pose a "threat to sovereignty and integrity." And the United States, the third-largest TikTok market, may follow India's lead. Now, Instagram is hoping to fill India's TikTok-size void with its own video-sharing feature called Reels. Facebook, Instagram's parent company, said it would begin testing Reels in India on Wednesday."We're excited to expand our test of Instagram Reels to India," a Facebook spokesperson said. Reels gives anyone the ability to create and discover short form videos, which is how more and more people are enjoying and creating content."Instagram began testing Reels in Brazil in November, and has since expanded into France and Germany. The in-app tool lets users record 15-second videos set to music and audio, and upload them to their stories, similar to TikTok. Facebook also said it is shutting down its own TikTok-like app, Lasso, to focus on Reels."India has always been a priority for us," the Facebook spokesperson said. "All of our test countries represent vibrant cultures, and in India consumer demand is strong with videos making up over a third of posts on Instagram." The company has not announced a date for a global launch.Instagram isn't the only platform taking on TikTok. YouTube plans to launch its competitor, Shorts, by the end of the year, according to The Information. YouTube did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Indian companies are also looking to benefit. One homegrown video-sharing app, Roposo, said that before the TikTok ban was announced, it had recorded 50 million downloads since its 2014 launch.After the announcement, the company said it received another 22 million downloads in just two days.Chingari, another Indian video-sharing app, is also reporting strong numbers, having reached 10 million users since it launched three weeks ago.TikTok has said it is committed to working with both the Indian and American governments. In response to India's ban, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance said it "is committed to working with the government to demonstrate our dedication to user security and our commitment to the country overall."After US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday said the United States was "looking at" banning the app, TikTok released a statement saying: "We have no higher priority than promoting a safe and secure app experience for our users. We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked."TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

The dispute over scientific and technological power in the world, a match with more than two rivalsCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 29, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 848 wordsBodyThe U.S. Department of Defense published the list of 20 Chinese companies linked to its Asian military system, a precautionary mandate of the U.S. Congress in 2001, when it facilitated China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).This move paves the way for President Donald Trump to enforce restrictions and controls on activities with those corporations not only in the trade order. Thus discussions and analysis on the disengagement between the West and the People's Republic gain momentum.Knowledge research and development is one of the areas where the conflict is most intensely unfolding because of the pre-eminence of global power.The technology mastery of the future – and science – has strategic preponderance characteristics. China has made significant progress while reducing its shareholding.This finding is an important fact that requires clarification.InvestmentsThe investment and development amounts for 2018 and expressed in US dollars, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (Oecd), consolidated by the Center for Security and Emerging Tecnology at Georgetown University, are as follows:United States: 582 billionChina: 554 billionJapan: 171 billionGermany: 141 billionSouth Korea: 98 billionIndia: 74 billionFrance: 68 billionUnited Kingdom: 53 billionExcluding the United States and China, the other countries collectively invest 606 billion.The two major powers do not reach 30% of the total investment each and the quantities must be added factors that make to the quality.For example: of the nine Nobel laureates of intellectuals of Chinese origin, eight reside or have acquired American nationality; of the overwhelming patent registration of the Asian country in the last lustro, none among the 100 most important and the large number of "papers" or research published by authors of that origin is unrelated to the quotations that are made of them in the scientific world.Important differencesThe Western world, if we could bypass the discussion on financial guidance and other interests, bases scientific research on principles of freedom, which is restricted in the decision-making system dominated by the chinese Communist Party's government.Thus, Chinese scientific development, particularly of artificial intelligence (AI), lags behind and couples, more or less efficiently, with third-party advances.In this way, the Asian dragon continues to depend on the American eagle and it does not seem that the large investment it makes can alter the equation in the times to come.5G technology, today's strategic battle, is a clear example.20% more efficient and 30% cheaper than Nokia or Ericsson, Huawei has relied on Western developments for deployment. Alibaba, Wechat, QQ or Tik Tok are other examples.American corporations produce – even with plants in China – 50% of semiconductor production and together with Japan and the Netherlands reach 90%.Safety and scienceThe scope ofthe links of U.S. institutions with others in China is a source of inquiry by governments, but international alliances of scientific and technological cooperation are more flexible than security and defense policies.Suffice it as an example to mention cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union in the space field at the height of the Cold War.The participation of North American centres, especially universities, in programmes in sectors that can be considered strategic is under scrutiny. The advantage remains on the American side.In any case, most Chinese scientists trained in other countries do not return for a long time and return scientists must be inserted into a different system in which creative freedom will be limited.But even more, the advancement of globalization has built, especially between the United States and China, very dynamic technological ecosystems – also commercial – that are growing and transforming cooperatively where the economic advantages of Western companies and universities are not less.Future eclipsesThe United States over the past three years and China so far this 2020 have been committed to destroying trust, and nothing can ensure that Europe, Japan, South Korea, and even India secure strong alliances with Americans or Chinese, based on proximity to values.But in any case, the disengagement of states in the scientific and technological way is highly unlikely, as all actors would suffer negative impacts; in any case, the disengagements will end up being selective and more preventable and that global cooperation continues.In the future, no power will have absolute primacy to the United States, and those who might hypothetically be its allies have significant advantages in emerging technologies and the base structure of the development of the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution or 4RI.However, until the world succeeds in establishing a new global order that allows the adoption of rules of conduct and conflict resolution, disputes of all kinds will become increasingly frequent, worrying and, in some cases, dangerous.* Lawyer and diplomatAdvertising       Load-Date: June 30, 2020End of Document

Wells Fargo tells employees to delete TikTok from their company devicesCNN WireJuly 13, 2020 Monday 3:31 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 397 wordsDateline: (CNN Business) Body (CNN Business) --  Wells Fargo has banned the social media app TikTok from company devices amid what it says are concerns about security.In a statement to CNN Business on Monday, a Wells Fargo spokesperson said the company had identified a "small number of employees with corporate-owned devices who had installed the TikTok application.""Due to concerns about TikTok's privacy and security controls and practices, and because corporate-owned devices should be used for company business only, we have directed those employees to remove the app from their devices," the statement said. The ban was first reported by The Information. TikTok didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The Wells Fargo announcement comes at a time of renewed scrutiny of TikTok -- including talk of a possible ban from the Trump administration -- due to its ties to China. The short-form video app, which has been downloaded 165 million times in the US, is owned by the world's most valuable startup, a Chinese company called ByteDance.On Friday, Amazon sent an email to employees to delete TikTok immediately from work phones or risk being cut off from corporate email. But hours later, Amazon said the email had been sent "in error." After Amazon sent the initial email on Friday, TikTok told CNN Business it is fully committed to respecting the privacy of its users. "We're proud that tens of millions of Americans turn to TikTok for entertainment, inspiration, and connection, including many of the Amazon employees and contractors who have been on the frontlines of this pandemic," a company spokesperson told CNN.Separately, both the Democratic and Republican national committees warned their staffs about using the app. US policymakers have previously sounded alarms about the potential for TikTok to be a security risk. A key concern, according to politicians including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as well as Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley, is the possibility that TikTok data could be handed over to the Chinese government. US cybersecurity experts say the reality is more complicated.TikTok has said that data pertaining to US users is stored in the US and not subject to Chinese laws. It has also hired an American CEO and may undergo corporate changes to distance itself from China.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

How will Covid-19 affect international academic mobility?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 30, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1678 wordsBodyMultiple times pandemics have hit the world by disrupting the economic and social activities of millions of people, altering with varying degrees of affectation the culture and institutions of the societies in which they spread. The university is one of those institutions that pandemics have significantly affected, and in a way that in the present moments we do not prove to their fair measure.Invoking historical analogies does not imply that Covid-19 will affect the future trajectory of universities in the same way that the Black Plague (14th century) or smallpox (19th century) did, mainly because we live a historical time signified by scientific conquests of every order. However, scrutinizing history allows us to discover actions and reactions around higher education after a major health and economic crisis like the one we are going through.It is worth remembering that five of the 30 universities that existed before the Black Plague disappeared in the late 1350s due to little or no enrolment. However, the deaths also meant renewing the supply of clerical caders lost to the pandemic which, coupled with a significant increase in donations, meant that schools such as Trinity Hall in Oxford and Corpus Christi College in Cambridge were of their existence.  Likewise, donations, previously only directly addressed to the poor and needy, were institutionalized.The case of smallpox, a disease that blinded a person's life in ten, is linked to the development of the first vaccine. The empirical work of Edward Jenner (University of Oxford, 1796) demonstrated the validity of knowledge derived from the experience and observation that today form the foundations of the scientific method. Since then, the fact that pandemics expose our weaknesses has made people take refuge in science, which is ultimately the raison d'etre of universities.There is no doubt that the university will be strengthened from this crisis just as it did in the past. However, the changes will be profound because The Covid-19 will not stop the digital revolution—which already hit the university hard—but will enhance it. Accelerating the transit from an analogue to a digital economy will result in the major chapters of production and consumption, of which educational services are a part.ImpactsThe impact will be particularly traumatic for countries that have internationalized their higher education - half of international students move to the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia - so much so that other destinations are expected to emerge that had already been gaining positions to take away that primacy, mainly Malaysia and South Korea, and which will be helped by the low prevalence rate of the disease in their territories.This international competence to capture the flows of international academic mobility is understood, in part, because there are other concomitant reasons, because of the huge amount of money it contributes to the recipient countries. Only the chinese student contingent accounts for 20% of Australian universities' income, while for the United States it is the fourth largest export line, behind only its automotive, aeronautics and pharmaceutical industry.EvenConsidering these contributions to national economies, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison noted that it was time for international students to return home ("time to go home"), a statement that will no doubt weigh on the recruitment of prospective international students.  In addition, the functioning government has denied them the right to about $20,000 in labour allowances and other aid available exclusively to Australian citizens.The United States enacted the CARES Act as a package of stimuli to deal with the pandemic. This financial aid reserves $14,000 for the higher education sector—and includes a section for its international students—that has already been labeled "inadequate" by the American Board of Education.The United Kingdom, anticipating a 47% drop in foreign students for the next academic year, against the US and Australia, registers voices suggesting adding value-added bonuses (four-year work visas once studies are completed, facilities for obtaining British citizenship, etc.) to the national academic offer with a view to mitigating that fall (Higher Education Times , April 25, 2020).Undoubtedly, future enrolment rates for international students will depend on the measures and policies adopted by the governments of the recipient countries in the near future. Will there be travel restrictions for international students? Will the determinants that condition international mobility be better off? Everything seems to indicate that in the short term it will be like this:Restrictions on the granting of visas for nationals from countries with high rates of prevalence of the disease;Psycho-emotional sequels that lessen the appeal of continuing interrupted international mobility or undertaking a new experience of a similar nature;Global financial astringency that will reduce public and private funds for international mobility;54% increase in the cost of air tickets to social estrangement in air passenger transport (IATA, 6 May);Increased supply of cross-border virtual education.Visa restriction will be an important barrier to international academic mobility. Health barriers to preventing the spread of Coronavirus will be difficult for nationals to prove provenance from countries with high prevalence of infection, particularly from the epicentres of contagion (Wuhan, Northern Lombardy, Madrid, New York and others).  The forced permanence in their host countries also caused an internal break with an impact on the psychological security of many students, which is why there will be some who will claim in their interest to pursue studies abroad, regardless of whether they are inside or inside. As an illustrative example of this we have the approximately 5,000 African students who were in Wuhan, China, at the time of the pandemic's outbreak and who were barred from leaving the city. Despite their desperation and contacting their respective consular authorities, the Chinese government urged these diplomatic representations to refuse to provide such assistance.Generally enacted household confinements around the world paralyzed global economic activity. With varying degrees of concern, Spain — a preferred destination for the European ERASMUS mobility programmePlus— forecasts a fall in its economy by around 9.5% by 2020. For Latin America and the Caribbean, the fall is expected to be around 5.3% (Cepal, 21 April 2020) pushing 29 million people into poverty.For its part, social estrangement in aircraft cabins will result in an increase in air tickets of around 54% if the biological passport suggested by IATA is not approved; the latter, still without known details, raises great concern for its inocultable discriminatory tint. Similarly, expert voices augur the disappearance of so-called low-cost flights, which, with little incidence in Latin America and the Caribbean, accounted for 57% and 39% of air traffic in Asia and Europe, respectively (2017).Finally, cross-border higher education could be strongly strengthened and detract from the attractiveness of traditional mobility by allowing students the opportunity to take subjects remotely, with the certainty that the credits taken will be recognized by the institutions of higher education of origin. Initiatives in this regard constitute the Virtual Mobility Space in Higher Education (eMOVIES) under the leadership of the Inter-American University Organization,and the NetACTIVE programme of Erasmus Mundus. The latter seeks to facilitate virtual mobility between Latin America and the European Union, and is supported by the Ibero-American Association for Distance Higher Education (AIESAD) and the European Association of Distance Universities (EADTU).This virtual mobility model is defined as "using ICT to get the same benefit as a physical mobility student, without the need to travel." However, this novel concept of "mobility without physical displacement" looks confusing when contrasted with e-learning or mobile-learning, even though credits for courses or subjects taken in virtual mode will enjoy full recognition in the institution of origin.It should be noted that virtual mobility is an emerging concept whose implementation characteristics have been forged in Europe within the framework of the European Higher Education Area and, without demerit of the potential it offers, may even need more consolidated trajectories to find recognition in the laws of Latin American and Caribbean countries, as well as in the New Regional Convention for the Recognition of Studies , Diplomas and Diplomas in Latin America and the Caribbean (2019).Already to conclude, we can say that while universities turned their attention to virtuality to ensure the continuity of the teaching-learning process, with the stumbles that it entailed [and still entails] for those institutions that accused a low level of virtualization, academic mobility does not find the same correspondence of change in the arenas of virtuality.  As a result, international academic mobility will be frankly prostrate until universities do not restart (in part or in full) face-to-face activities, and the conditions of physical mobility do not offer sufficient porosity to enable significant flows of international academic mobility.This conclusion is also reached when we project the immediate future of international academic mobility in Latin America and the Caribbean. However, it should be added that, in the two countries with the highest international student mobility, Argentina and Brazil, the first as a recipient and the second as an exporter of students, there are concerns as the number of infected by Covid-19 is continuously increased and not yet reach the peak that marks the decline of thePandemic.The author is programme coordinator of the UNESCO International Institute for Higher Education in Latin America and the Caribbean (IESALC).Load-Date: July 1, 2020End of Document

Continue reading Facebook will  pause  responses to data requests from Hong KongA new law in China has increased internet surveillance in the region.China just recently imposed a new national security law on Hong Kong, a region not subject to the country s restrictive  Great Firewall  that censors the internet throughout the country.      However, legal experts believe the new law gives police the power to order individuals and companies to remove content. But despite the law, it sounds like Facebook isn t immediately going to      comply. According to the Wall Street Journal, Facebook s WhatsApp will pause any processing of requests for user data from Hong Kong police while it reviews the new regulation. WhatsApp was the      first Facebook company to confirm it wouldn t process these government requests, but now it sounds like all of Facebook will hold off on reviewing data requests.A WhatsApp spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal that the company was looking at the impact of the new law specifically focusing on  formal human rights due diligence and consultations with      human rights experts.  Legal experts believe the new law doesn t let Hong Kong fully block services or website, which China s notorious  Great Firewall  does   but Facebook s refusal to comply      with the law could certainly put the company at odds with the Chinese government.Given that Hong Kong has long lived with an open and free internet, it ll be worth seeing if any other companies follow suit with Facebook s refusal to comply with the new regulation. It ll      also be significant to see how China s responds to Facebook s decision, particularly if other companies join Facebook and push back against the new law. Last year, Apple eventually complied      with China s demands for it to remove a Hong Kong protest-tracking app, a move that was criticized as the company bowing to governmental pressure. Whether Facebook will do an eventual      about-face remains to be seen.See Campaign:https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-in-hong-kongs-new-national-security-law-11593689730Contact Information:Nathan IngrahamTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: August 13, 2020End of Document

In a report released (https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/new-law-new-threat) by Human Rights First and the University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law, the lawyers explain how they and other civil society leaders fear the new national security law will be the end of the city's autonomy and mean fresh attacks on them and their work.The report, "New Law, New Threat," details a series of attacks on Hong Kong human rights lawyers over the last year, and how the new security law could be devastating to human rights in Hong Kong."Lawyers fear the new security law will mean that being a human rights lawyer in Hong Kong is about to become as dangerous as it is in mainland China," said Human Rights First's Brian Dooley.The report details online and offline attacks on Hong Kong's human rights lawyers since the start of mass street demonstrations in June 2019. It is based primarily on interviews with Hong Kong human rights lawyers and legal academics conducted in 2020.After a relative lull in large-scale protests since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the city is bracing for a potentially explosive month ahead. June 4 will mark Hong Kong's annual commemoration of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, when hundreds, and possibly thousands, of student-led protestors, were killed by Chinese security forces. For the first time in 30 years, Hong Kong authorities have banned demonstrations to mark the event, though protests are expected to go on anyway.Five days later, the city will observe the first anniversary of the outbreak of the most recent round of major protests, with additional demonstrations planned. Mass demonstrations against the new security law have already taken place, and are likely to increase as passage of the legislation proceeds in the coming weeks.The report details consistent attacks on the independence of Hong Kong's judiciary, and the undermining of its rule of law. Over the last 12 months, under the sway of the Chinese government, Hong Kong authorities and their allies have smeared, "doxed" (revealed personal information), harassed, arrested, and physically assaulted lawyers as mass protests swept the city.The new national security law is likely to ban a range of ill-defined acts including treason, secession, sedition, and subversion, and will authorize China's security services to operate openly within Hong Kong.One Hong Kong human rights lawyer interviewed for the report said, "Our fear is that the sort of vague national security laws used to target human rights lawyers in mainland China will now happen here," and warned that just as human rights lawyers in China have been arrested for their work, those in Hong Kong could be next.[Category: Sociological]Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7128327 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: June 2, 2020End of Document

It is based primarily on interviews with Hong Kong human rights lawyers and legal academics conducted in 2020.After a relative lull in large-scale protests since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the city is bracing for a potentially explosive month ahead. June 4 will mark Hong Kong's annual commemoration of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, when hundreds, and possibly thousands, of student-led protestors, were killed by Chinese security forces. For the first time in 30 years, Hong Kong authorities have banned demonstrations to mark the event, though protests are expected to go on anyway.Five days later, the city will observe the first anniversary of the outbreak of the most recent round of major protests, with additional demonstrations planned. Mass demonstrations against the new security law have already taken place, and are likely to increase as passage of the legislation proceeds in the coming weeks.The report details consistent attacks on the independence of Hong Kong's judiciary, and the undermining of its rule of law. Over the last 12 months, under the sway of the Chinese government, Hong Kong authorities and their allies have smeared, "doxed" (revealed personal information), harassed, arrested, and physically assaulted lawyers as mass protests swept the city.The new national security law is likely to ban a range of ill-defined acts including treason, secession, sedition, and subversion, and will authorize China's security services to operate openly within Hong Kong.One Hong Kong human rights lawyer interviewed for the report said, "Our fear is that the sort of vague national security laws used to target human rights lawyers in mainland China will now happen here," and warned that just as human rights lawyers in China have been arrested for their work, those in Hong Kong could be next.Load-Date: June 2, 2020End of Document

Beijing takes control of U.S. consulate in ChengduCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJuly 27, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 482 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- The Chinese authorities took control of the U.S. consulate in Chengdu after its closure, the last historic milestone marking the deterioration of relations between Washington and Beijing.The United States lowered its flag on the U.S. consulate in southwestern China on Monday, less than three days after the government forced its Chinese counterparts to abandon its mission in Houston. The security cordon around the consulate, which had declined since China announced on Friday its decision to expel diplomats, re-intensified on Monday morning and police prevented pedestrians from approaching a block from the facility.Chinese authorities entered through the front door of the consulate, China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement Monday. The consulate was closed at 10 a.m., according to China's request.Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Monday at a daily briefing in Beijing that the authorities' entry into the complex was a "legitimate and necessary response to what the United States did."The closure of the U.S. mission after 35 years caused a steady stream of spectators throughout the weekend, as people filmed moving vans and consulate staff came and went in and out of the gates of the compound. The two consulates are the most tangible victims of one of the worst disputes between the United States and China since both sides formally established relations in 1979.In a farewell diaporama posted on Chinese social media, the U.S. consulate in Chengdu said designated local diplomats would appreciate the memory of working to promote mutual understanding between the American people and those of Chongqing, Guizhou, Sichuan, Tibet, and Yunnan.An announcer from the state-owned China Global Television Network reported over the weekend that some Chinese staff members were still negotiating their compensation packages with the consulate after being fired. Some American employees "won't leave so fast because there's still a lot of work to be done," CGTN said, citing people he didn't identify.Hu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of the Communist Party's Global Times newspaper, said in Weibo that some Chinese employees at the consulate were insufficiently compensated after being fired, without specifying where he obtained the information from.The Trump administration's decision to shut down the Houston mission followed years of frustration at what would be criminal and covert activity led by Beijing to steal trade secrets and conduct evil-influenced operations across the United States. While two Chinese citizens were convicted in the past year for trying to steal trade secrets in the U.S. energy capital, U.S. administration officials friday told reporters that the activity conducted through the Houston consulate represented the "tip of the iceberg."Original Note:Beijing Takes Over U.S. Chengdu Consulate After Forced Closure©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: July 28, 2020End of Document

COVID-19 & senior citizensThe SentinelJuly 12, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Omega Printers & Publishers Pvt Ltd, distributed by Contify.com All Rights ReservedLength: 590 wordsByline: Sentinel Digital DeskBodyOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic status for the COVID-19 viral infection. India with a population of 1.3 billion had reported its first case on January 30, 2020. India is a densely populated country. The Government of India took the decision to promulgate countrywide lockdown since March 25, 2020.The extent to which citizens comply with newly-enacted public health measures such as social distancing or lockdowns strongly affects the propagation of the virus and the number of deaths from COVID-19. It is, however, very difficult to identify non-compliance through survey research because claiming to follow the rules is socially desirable.In late December, 2019, clusters of pneumonia cases with unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, China. Sequencing of lower respiratory lavage fluid indicated that the disease was caused by a novel coronavirus in humans that was subsequently named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2020). The novel coronavirus is thought to be a relative of the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) viruses. These coronaviruses are all characterized by flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and chills - they can also cause severe respiratory illness and death (WHO, 2020). During Spring Festival in China, hundreds of thousands of people left Wuhan, often via public transport, potentially carrying the virus with them. As a result, the virus is now rapidly spreading worldwide.On the 31st January, 2020, the WHO declared the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) (WHO, 2020). By the 1st February, 2020, 14,380 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed nationwide by the Chinese government (including medical staff), and another 19,544 cases were suspected (National Health Commission, 2020). Shortly after, hundreds of cases were confirmed in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Germany, and the United States of America (WHO, 2020).The Government of Assam is aware of the dilemma of the elderly. Several administrative steps to facilitate supplies, fiscal assistance, internet-banking facilities and meal supplies may address their physical needs. Neighbours and NGOs try to organize help for the older residents. Media report of a Mumbai policeman helping a single octogenarian female suffering from diabetes mellitus by fetching not only her medications from pharmacy but also vegetables and cash from her bank are heartening to read.The first case of Assam was reported on 31 March 2020. As of 9 July 2020, the Government of Assam confirmed a total of 14,032 positive cases of COVID-19, including 8,726 recoveries, three migrations and 22 deaths in the State. The State's as well as Northeast's largest city, Guwahati has been the worst affected by coronavirus.Lastly, In the era of Digitization, one hopes that some kind of online measures should be taken and prove to be a boon, especially for elderly who face mobility issues, those with healthcare access issues, and for the rural population. Online access for older adults, once harnessed, can help create online support groups, provide video counseling, and help design diagnostic and therapeutic services. The COVID-19 pandemic could thus prove to be a blessing in disguise for accelerating healthcare resource and access issues faced by the population in India and Assam at large and the elderly in particular.Hrishikesh Gogol,Amul, (GCMMF) Guwahati.Load-Date: July 13, 2020End of Document

The 2nd Edition of the Global Business Barometer Improves but Executives Still See the Economy and Their Businesses in the Survival PhasePR NewswireJune 30, 2020 Tuesday 3:00 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 647 wordsDateline: LONDON, June 30, 2020 BodyPR NewswireExecutive sentiment about the three-month outlook for the global economy rose but remains pessimistic at -27.7 (out of a range of -50 to +50) The single biggest swing in the barometer came in China, where executives' outlook for the domestic economy declined by 21.9 points The most popular government action to help the economy and business recover, receiving 51% of responses, was to limit international travelThere are three broad stages to recovery from the kind of crisis we are experiencing now: survival, adaptation and recovery. The latest Global Business Barometer, conducted by The Economist Intelligence Unit and supported by SAS, shows that as of late May executives believe we are still in the survival phase, although many have made adaptations to their operations, some of which may become permanent.Less pessimistic:The barometer reading for the 3-month outlook for the global economy rose 11.7 points from -39.4 to -27.7, a marked improvement from the first GBB in April but indicative of a recovery that could remain a long way off. Sentiment in Europe increased the most (from -40.5 to -27.3), followed closely by the Asia-Pacific and North America. Sentiment about the global economy among executives in the Middle East and Africa region, while still up, increased by only 6.9 points, the least among the five regions covered by the barometer.Sentiment in China falls:The biggest single swing in the barometer from April to May came in China, where the 3-month outlook for the economy fell by 21.9 points. At the time of the first GBB in April, China looked to be over the worst of COVID-19 (or at least the worst of the first wave). That has clearly since changed, with the mood souring considerably on widespread downgrades to China forecasts and the Chinese government abandoning its annual GDP target for the first time in decades.The road, less traveled:When asked what actions they would like to see governments take in the coming months to get the global economy and businesses back on track, "limit international travel" surged to the number one answer (51%) after ranking towards the bottom in our last GBB survey. This put it ahead of other options such as direct fiscal stimulus to consumers and tax cuts. Now that travel restrictions have been demonstrably effective in many instances against the spread, we see a mix of resignation and adaptation amongst executives on the issue.Coming to grips:There was an uptick in the percentage of GBB survey respondents answering that the global economic recovery will take "3 to 5 years." In April, the figure stood at 30.8%. In May it was at 37.2%. All other options more or less held steady.About the researchThe Global Business Barometer gauges sentiment towards current events and financial market uncertainty and explores how businesses are coping today and planning for the future.About The Economist Intelligence UnitThe Economist Intelligence Unit is the thought leadership, research and analysis division of The Economist Group and the world leader in global business intelligence for executives.

Want to bring them to you.First this, President Trump laying out his four-step plan to tackle racial inequality and police brutality while he was in Dallas yesterday. His plan includes economic development in minority communities, confronting healthcare disparities, encouraging police departments to meet standards for use of force, and he's renewing calls for school choice.Well, the mayor of Seattle slamming President Trump for vowing to take back that city.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR JENNY DURKAN (D), SEATTLE: Lawfully gathering and expressing First Amendment rights, demanding we do better as a society, and providing true equity for communities of color is not terrorism, it is patriotism.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, protesters have taken over six blocks surrounding the police precinct referred to as Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone or CHAZ they're calling it. They have a list of demands, including the city defund and abolish the police department. The police chief says it was not her decision to abandon that precinct. The department is also warning business owners to not give money to the protesters after reports of extortion in the autonomous zone.Well, Zoom video under fire for closing the account of a human rights group saying it took that step at the request of the Chinese government.

LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): I'm going to call every person who signed the warrant and ask them, did you know about the doctoring of an e-mail? Did you know that the FBI had learned that the dossier was no longer reliable. And I'm sure most of them are going to say no. The most important investigation in 30 years of a sitting president that nobody told the top of the FBI, oh, by the way, our case fell apart.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, under committee rules, Graham can only issue subpoena as part of a deal with ranking member Dianne Feinstein or a majority vote.Well, funding police departments. President Trump speaking on what the White House plans to do regarding police reform during a roundtable in Dallas, Texas, yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're working to finalize an executive order that will encourage police departments nationwide to meet the most current professional standards for the use of force, including tactics for de-escalation.We're not defunding police. If anything, we're going the other route. We're going to have stronger police forces because that's what you need.(END VIDEO CLIP)CASONE: Well, joining me now is one of the people who was at the event, Texas Congressman, House and Commerce Committee member, and medical doctor, Michael Burgess.It's great to have you here, sir.REP. MICHAEL BURGESS (R-TX): Good morning. Thanks for having me on.CASONE: Congressman, first, this was really the first time that we -- we really heard the president dig deep into what he sees when it comes to police reform.What did you make of kind of the -- that four point plan that he outlined yesterday and also how was he received in Dallas yesterday?BURGESS: Well, it was in the -- was in the event venue he was obviously received very well. I wasn't part of the motorcade, so I don't know what -- what the scene was like outside.But, you know, I will say this, I thought of course the president puts down the marker that order is going to be maintained. I think that's important. He is the -- he -- he is the chief -- in a way, he's the chief law enforcement officer in the country. But he also -- it was a note of conciliation and certainly the panelists who were present and spoke very eloquently about things such as education, investment in the minority community, ways to bring people together, I thought that was an important message also. It wasn't exactly reported on in the -- in the papers, the coverage that I read this morning, but it was a note of conciliation in the room.CASONE: Well, and he was also in Dallas, Texas, which has had its issues of riots and violence, just like many other cities in the country. And there were some horrific scenes that came out of Dallas during all of this, Congressman.I do want to bring in my colleague, Jon Hilsenrath, from "The Wall Street Journal." He's got a question.Jon.HILSENRATH: Congressman, I want to ask you about this idea of bad apples in the police force. You know, I think most Americans would agree that the vast majority of police officers, say 99 percent, are good people doing well protecting the public.But this idea that, you know, that maybe there are a few bad apples, I wonder if that's an acceptable idea. You know, we wouldn't accept a bad apple among pilots. You can't get in a plane if 1 percent are bad and might crash the plane. So what do you think of this and is there any way to just kind of get rid of the notion that it's acceptable to have bad apples?BURGESS: It's not acceptable to have bad apples. In every profession, every profession, medical profession, certainly is -- there's always a significant effort made on self-policing but also there are -- there are standards and there are outside reviewers. So it's -- yes, there are people who end up being policemen who should not be policemen. The idea is, you need to find them, find them quickly, find them another line of work or get rid of them.I think, you know, one of the points that the president did make yesterday was comparing with the VA when he arrived in office, you couldn't find anyone at the VA, and he changed that. And it helped the culture at the VA. It made it better. So I don't -- I think acknowledging that, yes, there are some -- there's some people who shouldn't be there, but it doesn't mean you don't work on continuous improvement.CASONE: Well, there you go, Congressman, instead of talking about defund, let's talk about maybe reform for the police.BURGESS: Sure.CASONE: And that is being talked about in Congress. You've got South Carolina Senator Tim Scott. There's a Republican effort he's leading. He's got this draft of his proposal that would we think be ready by maybe next week.But, again, in the House you've got Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy saying he disagrees with the Dems that are writing this reform bill on their own and that he would support efforts like banning choke holds.So, you know, obviously the back and forth is going to start between the House and the Senate. Probably not a surprise here.BURGESS: No.CASONE: What kind of meaningful reform do you think should be passed by Congress?BURGESS: Well, I do think -- you know, look, the discussion about defunding the police is one of those particularly troublesome to me because the -- if anything, you want to increase the value for someone to be a policeman because you want the very best people to apply. If you don't have the very best people applying to -- for these law enforcement positions, then you're not going to get the very best people and we need them.CASONE: Yes.BURGESS: The country needs them. The communities need them.CASONE: Yes.BURGESS: So I think anything that embellishes and encourages a higher standard, even upon entrance into the police academies, I think that would be a good thing.Now, I will tell you this. I --CASONE: Sure. It's a conversation.BURGESS: Four years ago we had a terrible event in Dallas where five law enforcement officers lost their lives providing security for a protest march.CASONE: I know.BURGESS: And they were ambushed on the street and shot down. Chief Renee Hall (ph), who wasn't there at the event yesterday, admittedly, but has said that Dallas police force is down 600 officers. And it's difficult to get your best people out when you've got those kind of constraints.CASONE: It is. And I know that --BURGESS: And then if you cut paying and benefits on top of it, that's going to make it worse.CASONE: And, Congressman, I don't -- I don't have a lot of time -- I don't have a lot of time with you this morning, but I will say that there was definitely some commentary in the Dallas area about who was not with the president yesterday. And I'm glad you brought that up.I do want to switch gears, really quick, though, to what's happening down in Houston. What do you make of this talk that one official there saying that they are the precipice of a disaster for Covid cases and that there could be another lockdown there? What's your reaction to that?BURGESS: Well, talk of another lockdown is obviously way premature. And when the governor began the phased opening that we're doing now in Texas, there was broad acknowledgement, that doesn't mean the virus is over, that there won't be more cases. And it does need to be monitored closely. And the one thing about this virus that we've learned is that when a case -- when there's a cluster of cases, the virus has the ability to be a super spreader. And where there is evidence of that, you've got to be very aggressive and in and on that quickly with isolation, yes, targeted in that -- whatever facility or area that is, ramp up the testing, and aggressive public health information to citizens.CASONE: Right.BURGESS: But it's -- as far -- you know, I think we've all learned through what we've just been through that you shut things down entirely and you hurt a lot of people. There's a lot of collateral damage in that. And certainly we've seen that throughout society.CASONE: Yes, you say that as a congressman and, of course, from the great state of Texas, my home state as well.BURGESS: Thanks.CASONE: Congressman Michael Burgess, it's always great to talk to you, sir. Thank you.BURGESS: Great. Thank you.CASONE: All right, we've got a lot more coming up this morning. And coming up next, this is going to be great, former Shell Oil President John Hofmeister. He is going to talk to us about the latest on the oil contract. It has been going crazy the last 48 hours.And then next hour, "Washington Examiner" Chief Political Correspondent Byron York talks the Seattle protest.Former Toys 'R' Us CEO Jerry Storch talks the state of retail and America's malls.The New Voice CEO Herman Cain talks police reform and the economy.And Nascar driver Bubba Wallace talks all the big changes the sport is seeing. Don't miss a moment of it.CASONE: Oil is edging higher actually this morning, up about 16 cents. We're at $36.50. But this follows yesterday's steep slump for oil. We saw the biggest drop in this contract. We haven't seen this since April 27th. Investors, obviously, fearing that spike in new coronavirus cases. They're worried that that could affect demand, especially for the summer. Oil now on track for its first week of declines in almost two months.I want to bring in former Shell Oil President John Hofmeister.And, John, what do you make of this concern about demand destruction because you've got the oil side of the story and then you've also got these incredibly low gas prices across the country right now.JOHN HOFMEISTER, FORMER SHELL OIL PRESIDENT: Well, this is a very, very uneasy season for demand. And it's going to continue, I think, as long as we have this uncertainty with respect to how much of the economy will remain essentially shut down. And so there's a big problem.And if you look at what OPEC Plus did last week, when they extended the cutbacks of production of oil, but only by a month, that's really to say to the U.S. oil patch, don't get your hopes up of producing any time too soon because we're going to -- if you do, we're going to flood the market again a month from now. And so everybody's on edge on the production side about not producing more than the economy can handle because what do you do with oil that's not needed? It just sits in storage and it's not of any value to anybody.CASONE: Yes.HOFMEISTER: But, on the other hand, if you're a producing company, that's what you're paid to do, produce oil.CASONE: Yes.HOFMEISTER: So the U.S. oil patch is in a dilemma right now. The price is high enough to begin some new production, just barely, but most everybody I think is going to hold back because the demand is not there.CASONE: Yes. Talk to the Saudis and Russians about that.Mattie Duppler, you've got a question for John.Go ahead.DUPPLER: Well, I would just say that it's not just about production, right, John, it's about investment. I mean these are capital heavy industries, millions of jobs hang in the balance. Part of the CARES Act allowed for some tax treatment that allowed companies to smooth out their losses because of this demand shock.What do you think Congress needs to do moving forward and how important is it to retain that tax treatment for companies so they can ride out this storm?HOFMEISTER: Well, I think that's the best thing Congress can do is provide some kind of tax relief, which means elimination of certain royalties and giving people a break on the cash that they have to pay to the government.But you're correct, with this demand destruction, what comes with it is zeroing out or severely curtailing capital investment. We know from 100 years of history, every time we cut back capital investment, a year, year and a half, two years from now, there's not going to be enough supply because we aren't finding new oil, we aren't producing for the future. And, you know, the -- so we're going to face the inevitable, high priced oil, maybe it's 2022, 2023, don't know for sure.CASONE: Wow.HOFMEISTER: But we've put down about $600 billion to $800 billion of capital has been deferred from this industry. And if you don't spend money for the future, in the future you're not going to have the oil. We know that for a fact.CASONE: John, that is an interesting, fascinating warning from you.Before we go, I do want to bring in Lou Basenese.Lou.BASENESE: Yes, John, I mean you're -- you mentioned high prices. That's what you go to experience through your tenure. But do you believe the adage here that, you know, low prices are the cure for low prices in the commodities spaces? They're going to be a demand uptick or is there just too much excess supply right now to have that happen?HOFMEISTER: For right now, there's just an excess of supply. Keep in mind, we've -- we've lost about 12 to 14 million barrels a day of demand. That's huge. That's a 15 percent -- roughly a 15 percent reduction in total demand for oil. And what do you do when you can't sell it, you just sit on it. And so I don't think low prices are going to help cure low prices in the short term. It may be by the fall we'll see a different scenario play out. But right now, I think it's going to be a continued low price period through the summer months.CASONE: John Hofmeister, I'm still stuck on the fact about 2022 and the issue of supply. That's incredible. Makes me want to buy some energy stocks today.John Hofmeister, thank you so much. It's great to have you, as always, sir.HOFMEISTER: Thank you.CASONE: All right, well, coming up, we are poised for a triple digit rally at the open after a dismal day on Wall Street yesterday. We've got to having something positive on a Friday, don't we? Dow is up by 37 in the pre-market right now.Plus, setting up for summer vacation. How Americans are preparing to travel amid the pandemic. We were just talking about gas prices. Are they going to be driving?Stay with us.CASONE: Well, cities across the United States struggling to stay afloat. Among them, Allentown, Pennsylvania, now fighting to survive amid revenue shortfalls due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Kristina Partsinevelos is in Allentown this morning.Kristina, good morning to you.KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Cheryl.And like you mentioned, it is a cry for help from a lot of these small towns across America. Why? Because they were left out of the almost $2 trillion coronavirus relief package.You have a situation here in Allentown. It's the third largest city in Pennsylvania. There's about 120 -- or a little bit more than 120,000 people. But it still wasn't big enough to get funding from Washington.Overall, you have cities, towns, they have to have at least 500,000 people in their population in order to qualify. So that means roughly 36 cities across the country actually made that criteria, which is why towns like Allentown are begging for a cash infusion from Washington.Listen in.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CE-CE GERLACH, ALLENTOWN COUNCILWOMAN: We're in a dire financial situation right now.A hungry mouth is a hungry mouth, no matter if it's in a small city or a large city. And we've got -- we've got a lot of challenges and very needy people here in Allentown.(END VIDEO CLIP)PARTSINEVELOS: It's estimated that towns and cities in Pennsylvania will see a roughly 40 percent revenue shortfall. More specifically in Allentown, they're expecting a budget loss of $10 million. And it comes, Cheryl, at a time when Allentown is trying to reinvent itself. It used to be a manufacturing hub. And now it's trying to be a place where small businesses can thrive.But you can see just behind me with the boarded up windows, the for rent signs all across this city, everything like that is on hold. And with the next round of funding relief stalled in Capitol Hill, a lot of towns are going to have to make some big decisions, and that means budget cuts, cutting parks budgets or reducing the number of firefighters, et cetera. And that's because a lot of the towns here, small towns across America, feel left out. They feel money went to larger municipalities instead of small town America. And that's why they're begging for help.Back to you, Cheryl.CASONE: That's why Billy Joel wrote a song about Allentown. And if you listen to the lyrics of that song --PARTSINEVELOS: Oh, "Allentown," yes.CASONE: If you listen to the lyrics, it's what you're reporting on today, Kristina. So that's crazy.PARTSINEVELOS: It's crazy. It's come back again. And it's so unfortunate to see a lot of this -- these stories like this.CASONE: Yes. All right, Kristina Partsinevelos, live in Allentown, Pennsylvania.I want to bring in Jon Hilsenrath, so your reaction. I mean in all seriousness, I mean it is sad what is happening to small towns like Allentown -- not small but at least smaller towns like Allentown who aren't maybe getting the attention that they need, Jon.HILSENRATH: Well, you know, I think that's a really important report. And, you know, I hope the rest of Washington is watching because, you know, there's this kind of debate going on in Washington, which is kind of painted as red versus blue, why should the government bailout these kind of blue states and blue cities. But the fact is the shock that's hitting state and local governments right now is color blind. It's hitting red places, blue places and purple places, like Pennsylvania.CASONE: Yes.HILSENRATH: And so I think that's really what's going to shape this next -- the state and local debate about giving support to state and local governments is a really important debate that's going to be happening in Washington this summer (ph).CASONE: Yes.Mattie, I want to get you into really quick to this before we run. Final thought, Mattie.DUPPLER: Well, the Federal Reserve has set up a lending facility that is supposed to be able to get some liquidity to these states and cities for exactly that reasons, that there's different sizes, different problems across the country. Allentown hopefully can get some support there.CASONE: Yes.All right, guys, great discussion and a great report from Kristina. Our thanks to her.We've got a lot more coming up on the show. This is -- you're going to love this story. Not gone yet. "Gone With the Wind" sales are up after HBO Max took it down. It is making the buzz this morning.CASONE: Welcome back.

The Dow is up 533 in the pre-market, Nasdaq up 154, S&P up 55 and change.This after concerns over spikes in coronavirus cases and what it could mean to the recovery fueled a major selloff yesterday. It was a rough day for Wall Street. Haven't seen this since March. Dow lost 1,861 points, as you can see. The Nasdaq down 527, the S&P lost 188.Now to Europe. Green across the board, actually, despite the fact the U.K. economy took a big hit from the coronavirus shutdowns. GDP plummeted a record 20.4 percent in April there.In Asia overnight, red across the board following Wall Street's steep selloff. As you can see, the Kospi taking the biggest hit, down more than 2 percent.Some of the top stories making headlines this morning, two active duty Navy pilots were killed in a plane crash in Alabama.

And President Trump holding a rally in Oklahoma just next week with sources saying there's going to be no mandates for face masks or social distancing. A lot of questions here.I want to bring in Harvard Global Health Institute director, Dr. Ashish Jha.Doctor, so great to have you here, and I hope I pronounced your name correctly, sir.DR. ASHISH JHA, DIRECTOR, HARVARD GLOBAL HEALTH INSTITUTE: You did. You did.CASONE: Whew. All right. Well, you've said this recently, that if states continue to loosen their restrictions, we could see 200,000 deaths by September. That is a stunning number, Doctor. Why do you say that?JHA: Yes. So, good morning and thanks for having me on.Right now about 800 to 1,000 people are dying every day from the coronavirus. And if you assume that we won't see any spikes, that we won't see any increases, that that number will just stay steady, that's 25,000 to 30,000 deaths a month and that means that sometime during September we will cross the 200,000 mark. And we won't be done. The pandemic will keep going.So it was just my way of giving a reality check to folks that we're not done with this pandemic. We have got a long way to go and we've got to be careful.CASONE: Well, we've heard Dr. Fauci say over and over -- and Dr. Birx as well, social distancing, wash your hands, wear a face covering, the basic things that all of us can do.But, you know, in a lot of parts of the country, we're not seeing that and we really didn't see it during the protests.Do those things factor in to your prediction here?JHA: Yes, I -- those things all worry me. And I completely understand that we can't be locked down forever. So I've been supportive of the idea of opening up. But I said we've got to open up smartly. And that means maintaining a certain amount of social distancing.If you're going to go out and if you're going to go into crowds, which I would prefer from a virus point of view that people didn't do that, but I understand people feel compelled to do that, then you've got to wear a mask and you've got to use hand sanitizers.And then the other point is, we've got to get testing and tracing into our -- our know, in our communities, in our states. It's still not where it needs to be. And until that happens, we're going to continue struggling with this.CASONE: Well, but there's a piece in "The Journal" this morning, and I'm going to bring in my colleague, Jon Hilsenrath, from "The Journal," but there was an editorial board piece that said that basically this -- the -- because you're getting more testing, you're getting more cases. Obviously, the more you test, the more positive cases you're going to get. And that's why Florida and Arizona and Texas are seeing this kind of build-up if you will.But let me bring in my colleague from "The Journal," Jon Hilsenrath.Jon, go ahead.HILSENRATH: Well, two things. I'll make a point and then -- and then ask a question. One is on this, testing means more cases. That's the case, which is why I think we have to look at how much death there is because like that -- you can't -- there's no fudging that one.JHA: Right.HILSENRATH: And my sense is that deaths are rising and I'd like to hear the doctor's view about that.And I'd also like to hear what lessons we've learned, what lessons you've learned about what works and what doesn't work in terms of trying to get this contagion under control.JHA: Yes. So those are good questions.Deaths are not fudgeable and hospitalizations as well. So if you're going to make the case that the number of test increasing is leading to more cases being identified, that would not explain the increases in hospitalization and it wouldn't explain the steady or even rising death numbers.And, remember, hospitalizations and deaths are lagging indicators. They take several weeks after people get infected before people end up getting really sick and dying.In terms of lessons we have learned, there's a lot. And this is obviously a changing virus -- well, the virus isn't changing, our knowledge is changing. You know, what we have learned is, I think that there's more and more evidence that being outdoors is better than being indoors.CASONE: Yes.JHA: Two months ago we didn't think masks were important. I think now we have pretty good evidence that masks really are important.And then if we look at other countries, like Germany, that's open and has done a good job, low number of cases, the economy doing better, they have a pretty vigorous testing and tracing program. And if we could get that in America, we could also really bring virus levels down and get our economy going again.CASONE: And, Doctor, we need a vaccine. You've got Regeneron, a lot -- a lot of other companies that are all working on either vaccines or treatments for the coronavirus.I want to bring in Lou Basenese, Lou, because, you know, these major American companies are pushing to find that vaccine.BASENESE: Yes, and I -- two points. One, I think I wanted to mention that, you know, I think there's -- and I don't want to be insensitive to the value of a life, but we've become accustomed to a certain number of flu cases each year, maybe 30,000 to 60,000. Want to know if the doctor thinks that there -- there's going to be a level set number where we just have to accept is going to happen each season with the coronavirus. And then kind of a follow-on to that is, what happens if there is no vaccine? I mean there's tons of companies, Moderna, Regeneron, racing for a vaccine. How do you see the landscape changing if we just don't have a vaccine in 12 to 18 months?JHA: Yes, so, look, we can decide that we can live with 30,000 Americans dying every month. I personally think that's unacceptable. And then people will come back with, well, they're older people. It turns out, I care about the lives of older people. There are a lot of older people that I love. And if they all died off, I would be pretty unhappy.So I think this idea that, you know, we're just going to have to live with 300,000 or 500,000 Americans dying before this pandemic is over to me is unacceptable. And particularly because no other high income country, maybe except the U.K., which is also bungling this response. But countries like Germany and others are not having to do this kind of thing, so we shouldn't accept it either.And if we don't get a vaccine, that's obviously going to be a huge problem. I'm pretty optimistic we will have one. The idea that we won't have one in 18 months I think is low likelihood. But if -- let's just play that out. We are going to have to figure out how to live with this virus. Hopefully we'll have better therapies and hopefully we will have a program that knows how to suppress the virus in terms of a vigorous testing and tracing program.Look, there are only two ways of suppressing the virus, shut the country down or have a really vigorous testing and tracing program. Masks and social distancing helps, but only so far. So I don't -- we don't have a whole lot of other choices right now.CASONE: Dr. Jha --BASENESE: I think we only have one, you can't shut the country down again.CASONE: Yes.BASENESE: You just can't. No one's going to tolerate it.JHA: Exactly. That's a -- it's a disaster.CASONE: I think we all agree on that.JHA: So my point is, if we don't want that, can we do the other thing, please.CASONE: Dr. Jha, it was great to have you on. And I hope you're wrong. I hope your predictions are wrong.JHA: I do too. I do too.CASONE: Yes.JHA: I'd love to understand how I -- you know, and we're all hoping that I'm wrong.CASONE: Yes, we've had so much heartbreak in this country already.Dr. Jha, thank you very much, sir. Great discussion with you.JHA: Thank you.CASONE: Thank you for being here this early in the morning.Well, we've got a lot more coming up. We're going to switch gears and talk about the office, offices. We're looking at a new product that can keep employees' minds at ease as they decide or need to come back to work.Plus, drive on. Fans are getting back to the Nascar races and it's making a big buzz this morning.CASONE: Well, as states reopen, many Americans are getting back to work despite rising coronavirus cases in some areas of the country. Many employees are fearful about returning to the office right now. So to address that, the digital health company Buoy is launching a new product that helps large companies get workers back safely. Joining me now is the CEO of Buoy Health, Andrew Le.And, Andrew, good morning.DR. ANDREW LE, CEO, BUOY HEALTH: Good morning, Cheryl.CASONE: So, tell us about this product. How -- how does it help us feel better about going to the office?LE: Sure. We really think, going back to the office is a personal and a local decision. And on the personal level, we built a product called Back With Care that helps the employee understand, you know, if they're symptomatic not to come in, if they're exposed not to come in, if they received a positive test not to come in.But beyond that, if they do have those things to actually navigate them into seeing the right doctor that's in-network, seeing -- getting the testing that's in-network for them, and even helping them during the quarantine process.For employers, what we're doing is actually taking into account the amount of disease that's in the area of all of their employees. So imagine you have multiple offices. We can actually help the employer understand, if I bring back 50 percent of my New York office, this is the likelihood of this number of people getting sick. If I bring back 20 percent of my office in Chicago, this is the number of people that might get sick, this is the number of people that might get hospitalized and this is the number of people that might get an adverse reaction. So we're really using real data from the ground, at the county level, to help employers make really safe decisions on who comes in and at the employee level help them if they can't come in actually get the care that they need during this, you know, really pivotal time.CASONE: What are -- what are your clients telling you on the corporate side about bringing people back into the office? And how worried are they about lawsuits?LE: I think there is a general sense that, you know, there feels like there's really no silver bullet, right? Whether it be testing or masks or social distancing or thermometer screens. I think the sentiment right now is, like, goodness, I really don't know what to do within all of this uncertainty.CASONE: Yes.LE: So really having a product like what we're doing that takes real data from studies that have been published, data that's getting updated on a daily basis, to help employers understand, OK, if you can layer multiple solutions on top of each other, testing, contact tracing, mask wearing, social distancing, reducing the number of people who come back into the office, that actually can have real effects on the likelihood of something bad happening.CASONE: Sure.LE: So, you know, really shedding light on the decisions that they're making.CASONE: Yes. And I like the data.I want to bring in Lou Basenese into this, you know, from the tech perspective. I mean this is what companies, Lou, are going to have to deal with. This is -- and this data could actually assist them.BASENESE: It sounds like a practical tool for (INAUDIBLE).CASONE: Oh, Lou, your mic's cutting out.Well, anyway, that would -- that would be my question, then, because -- but -- again, but, you know, again, technology, though, Andrew, I mean -- because obviously our work environments are going to change, right? I mean everything's going to have to change. Do you think it's going to be new jobs in technology? Do you think that companies are going to cut back in other ways because people -- they don't need as many employees as they thought they did at their -- at their office, maybe the work from home thing? What do you make of all that?LE: I think there's no doubt about it. I mean even though we're building, you know, a product to help employers bring their employees back into the office, I think the genie's out of the bottle in terms of how productive people can be in a work from home setting. So, in that regard, I think in terms of new jobs, I really see there being a lot of new roles that help remote workforces, whether that be remote HR, remote recruiting, remote IT to get people set up at scale.CASONE: Yes.LE: Or even having senior level positions that focus on operations of a remote workforce. I really don't think there's -- we're going to go back to the way things were before Covid.CASONE: Yes, I think you're right. Yes. Well, again, and I'm sorry we couldn't get Lou in there because technology is going to be kind of -- I think the piece of this, to your point.Andrew Le. Andrew, thank you very much.LE: Thanks, Cheryl.CASONE: All right, we've got a lot more coming up.Another shot at the game. Who is reaching out to Colin Kaepernick. That's making buzz this morning.Plus, the final day of YouTube week is here. We're going to hear from a creator who makes a living giving advice and then coming up with fun projects for the whole family. She's a mom. Coming up.CASONE: It is time for the "Morning Buzz."First up, gone but not forgotten. "Gone for the Wind" jumping to the number one spot on Amazon's best seller's chart, a day after Warner Media's HBO Max pulled the movie for racist depictions. The iconic film could return to HBO Max in less than a week.You go to your Apple TV, Jon, "Gone with the Wind" is now a top choice, by the way, I should add.HILSENRATH: Yes, so, I've got a couple of thoughts about this. One is, you know, I think a lot of people are going to attack HBO for political correctness and cancel culture for canceling this. And, frankly, you know, HBO is a private enterprise. They can do whatever they want with their property. And people can boycott them if they want. And that's the way a private enterprise system works. So I'm not going to argue with them doing what they choose to do with their property.The other thing I'd say is, yes, there is a risk here of people overreacting, political correctness, cancel culture.CASONE: Yes.HILSENRATH: But, you know, maybe if people had taken black concerns about policing more seriously, we wouldn't be in a toxic environment right now.CASONE: Yes. By the way, I agreed with Dagen, I love her, but I thought "Gone with the Wind" was a great movie, but that's just me.All right, coming up --HILSENRATH: I've actually never seen it.CASONE: I -- it's a classic.Ah, anyway.All right, let's move on to this one.Another shot at the NFL. Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll says that at least one NFL team is interested in signing Colin Kaepernick. He doesn't say which team, but he told "The Times" in Seattle he regrets not signing Kaepernick.Mattie, he hasn't played since 2016. Why is there still interest in this quarterback?DUPPLER: Right. Well, I think that he hasn't played in 2015 (ph) because we've been hearing about how he's one of the first black Americans with a huge platform to take a stance on the conditions that now the rest of the country is confronting.Now, I'm a Packers fan and Kaepernick put -- did a pretty good job putting us away in the playoffs in 2013, so I'm not sure how I feel about him coming back on the field. But anyone whose upset about the fact that black Americans have used their platform in the past to talk about the inequities in this country really they need to go -- take a hard look at themselves to say that this is not the time to say that they can't use their platform to talk about what we need to hear (ph) in this country.CASONE: Well, and, Jon, to be fair, you know, Roger Goodell came out and said that he regrets that he didn't pay more attention.HILSENRATH: Well, you know, I think we should talk about the flag. The Pledge of Allegiance, which I said every day as a kid in school, ends with justice for all. If we want to honor the flag, let's try to live up to that pledge that we put our hand to our heart to every day as children.CASONE: Sure. Yes, we're all in this country together, by the way.Fans back at the track. Nascar announcing it's going to allow fans in races this month in Florida and Alabama. They're going to be screened. There's going to be PPE, social distance.You know, what do you make of this, Lou, the fact that Nascar's back? You love it or not?Oh, Lou isn't with us any more --BASENESE: No, I love it.CASONE: OK, Jon, go --BASENESE: Look, Nascar without fans --CASONE: What's that?BASENESE: (INAUDIBLE). I had an experience --CASONE: Oh, Lou, your mic is still messed up.All right, we are going to fix that, I swear.Jon Hilsenrath, final word.HILSENRATH: All right, you know, on Nascar, I'm actually going to throw it back to baseball. Hey, baseball, are you watching, we've got golf and racing. Where are you? Get your act together.CASONE: All right.DUPPLER: Jon, I'll say it again, we've got hockey as well. So, I mean, all you guys who aren't hockey fans, come on over. The water and ice is fine.HILSENRATH: Wake up, baseball, wake up.CASONE: Just want my football back. I just miss it.But, you know what, Nascar is back. It's happening now. Guess what, driver Bubba Wallace is going to be joining me in the next hour. That's going to be 8:50 a.m. Eastern Time to talk all about the big changes the sport is seeing. And tune in for Nascar on Fox. That's this Sunday, 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time.We'll be right back.Load-Date: June 12, 2020End of Document

$77 Million Autonomous Bus Door System Industry Insight 2020-2027 - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireJuly 22, 2020 Wednesday 9:16 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 710 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Autonomous Bus Door System Market by Bus Type, Door Type, Mechanism, Level of Automation, Propulsion Type and by Component: Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2020-2027" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.According to the report, the global autonomous bus door system market was valued at $3.9 million in 2019, and is projected to reach $77 million by 2027, registering a CAGR of 43.8% from 2020 to 2027.At present, the U.S. dominates the market, followed by Canada and Mexico in North America. However, Mexico is expected to grow at a higher CAGR during the forecast period. In addition, in 2019, China led the market in the Asia-Pacific region followed by India, South Korea, Japan, and rest of Asia-Pacific countries.Factors such as improved safety coupled with the reduction in traffic congestion, rise in connected infrastructure, and increase in demand for fuel-efficient, high-performance, and low-emission vehicles are driving the autonomous bus door module market growth. However, high manufacturing cost, and data management challenges are expected to impede the stated autonomous bus door system market growth.With the rapid adoption of Internet of Things (IoT), transportation infrastructure across the globe is evolving quickly. Companies such as Cisco and IBM have created digital platforms, which can automate street and traffic lights, optimize trash pickup, and augment surveillance. For instance, installation of IoT sensors in the streets of Las Vegas has managed to control traffic congestion and solve environmental issues. Connected infrastructure includes car parking, toll booths, and smart-street and traffic lights.Thus, growth of connected infrastructure creates favorable conditions for adoption of autonomous bus, which, in turn, drives the growth of the bus door system market.Smart cities are experiencing considerable growth across the globe. Emergence of disruptive technologies such as IoT and connected devices also lead to the development of smart transportation in smart cities. Advancement in IoT and cloud-based platforms has led to significant investment in smart cities. Several countries focus on transportation under smart cities initiative.For instance, Chinese government is working on programs for an autonomous driving revolution. Around 300 Chinese cities, which include Xinjiang and Nanjing, have introduced smart-city projects out of which 93 of the smart city projects are focused on transportation. These can potentially use the connected infrastructure to focus on building autonomous cars, self-driving buses and shared-driving models on the road.Furthermore, in September 2017, Baidu, a China-based technology company announced a $1.52 billion autonomous-driving initiative, which is called "Apollo Fund." This initiative is projected to invest in 100 autonomous driving projects till 2021. Further, global spending on smart city initiatives is expected to surpass $100 billion. Thus, development of smart cities holds a remarkable growth opportunity for the key players operating in the global autonomous bus door system market.The key players profiled in the autonomous bus door system market share include Bode Sud S.p.A., Vapor Bus International, Circle Bus Door Systems Co., Ltd., KBT GmbH, Masats LLC, PSV Transport Systems Ltd., Shavo Norgren (India) Pvt.

Huawei s ecosystem is thrivingiCrowdNewswire (English)July 26, 2020 Sunday 1:26 AM GMTCopyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 750 wordsBodyWhen the U.S. Commerce Department put Huawei on the Entity List last year, it meant that the company would be unable to access its U.S supply chain which it spent $18 billion on in 2018.

Continue reading Huawei s ecosystem is thrivingWhen the U.S. Commerce Department put Huawei on the Entity List last year, it meant that the company would be unable to access its U.S supply chain which it spent $18 billion on in 2018. It    also meant that Huawei could no longer license the Google Mobile Services version of Android. That meant that Google s Android apps like the Play Store, Search, YouTube, Maps, Drive, and Gmail    could not run on Huawei s phones. In China, that doesn t matter since most Google apps are banned in the country anyway. But consumers in other countries used to buying Huawei s international    models surely wouldn t be happy paying big bucks for a high-end handset without a proper mobile ecosystem.Huawei has 700 million device users using its ecosystemYesterday, the Chinese manufacturer revealed the latest data related to the Huawei Mobile Services (HMS) Ecosystem during the 19th China Internet Conference. The HMS Ecosystem now reaches    700 million Huawei Device users, up 32% year-over year. Growing at even a faster pace is the number of developers registered with the company; that figure has now hit 1.6 million up 76% on an    annual basis.The Huawei P40 Pro launched this year with    Huawei Mobile Service includedZhang Ping an, President of Consumer Cloud Service, Huawei Consumer Business Group, said,  AppGallery, Huawei s official app distribution platform, covers more than 170 countries and regions.      With this coverage, we hope to share local digital innovation with the world. We want every innovative app developed by global partners to reach all 700 million Huawei device users.  The      company also noted that global Huawei Mobile Service apps such as Huawei Video, Huawei Music and Huaei Reader  have brought high-quality services and content to consumers in more countries and      regions. Back in May we told you about an interesting app developed by Huawei called Petal Search. With the latter, Huawei users can type in the name of an app. If it is not available in the company s    AppGallery, Petal Search scours third-party app stores until it finds one that hosts the app. A tap on the install button will download the software on the user s handset. Even apps like Amazon,    Snapchat, Speedtest.net, and AccuWeather, all with U.S. developers, can be installed on a recently released Huawei phone using Petal Search. And Huawei calls its Quick App  a new type of    installation-free app, providing users with a tap-to-use experience and much less memory space.  It sounds similar to Apple s App Clips coming in iOS 14, and Android s Instant Apps. The U.S.    considers Huawei to be a national security threat because of its perceived ties to the communist Chinese government. Despite its placement on the Entity List, Huawei moved up in the global    rankings to become the second largest smartphone manufacturer in the world last year. The company shipped 240 million units in 2019, up 17% for the year. For the first half of 2020, Huawei    actually has a small lead over Samsung to be the top smartphone manufacturer in the world. But that might not last terribly long. A new export rule announced by the U.S. prevents global foundries    that produce chips using U.S. technology to ship semiconductors to Huawei without obtaining a license. The latter is requested from the U.S. Commerce Department. The new rule takes effect on    September 15th. Huawei will have a problem if it can t somehow find a replacement for TSMC; the foundry is one of only two that will churn out cutting edge 5nm chips this year. Huawei is expected    to receive its first 5nm chip, the Kirin 1020, from TSMC until the new export rule kicks in. We could see the component used to power the Huawei Mate 40 series, the manufacturer s most    technologically advanced phone for 2020; the line is due out during the fourth quarter. The chips are also used to drive Huawei s 5G base stations; the company is the top supplier of networking    equipment in the world.See Campaign:https://www.phonearena.com/news/huawei-ecosystem-growing-fast_id126158Contact Information:Alan FriedmanTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: July 26, 2020End of Document

Nokia profit up despite pandemic as new CEO takes overAssociated Press InternationalJuly 31, 2020 Friday 8:34 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWS; INTERNATIONAL NEWSLength: 464 wordsByline: JARI TANNER, Associated PressDateline: HELSINKI BodyHELSINKI (AP) — Nokia has reported better than expected second-quarter earnings on the back of improved margins for telecoms equipment and software despite the coronavirus crisis causing a substantial drop in revenue.The Espoo, Finland-based maker of new-generation 5G mobile and other networks said Friday that its net profit for the April-June period was up 22% at 316 million euros ($376 million). Sales were down 11% at 5.1 billion euros.CEO Rajeev Suri said in a statement that the majority of the drop in revenue was "the result of COVID-19 as well as a sharp decline in China based on the prudent approach we have taken in that market.”Nokia estimated that the COVID-19 crisis hurt its net sales by about 300 million euros in the second quarter and about 500 million euros in the first half of the year.“We expect that the majority of sales missed in the (second) quarter due to COVID-19 will shift to future periods,” Suri said.Though the company warned it was expecting to lose some market this year, it gave an upbeat outlook for its main network business and lifted its profit and cash flow guidance for full year 2020.Suri said that Nokia has now concluded 83 commercial deals for 5G, the new network technology that allows ultra-fast downloading speeds among other things. Along with China’s Huawei and Sweden’s Ericsson, Nokia is one of the three main providers of 5G networks. Huawei is at the center of a U.S.-China dispute over technology, with the Trump administration saying it can help the Chinese government spy on people, a claim the company denies.Friday marked the last day as a CEO for Suri, a Nokia veteran with 25 years in service and the head of the company since 2014, as his appointed successor Pekka Lundmark takes over on Aug. 1.Lundmark, 56, is the former CEO of the Finnish energy group Fortum and worked at Nokia between 1990 and 2000.In May, Sari Baldauf was named as the company’s new chair. Baldauf headed Nokia's network business from 1998 until 2005 and Lundmark was her team colleague in the 1990s.Nokia has played catch up with Huawei and Ericsson in the 5G business, which has become increasingly politicized amid the U.S.-China rift, and industry observers say one of Lundmark’s immediate priorities is to review the company’s strategies.Suri’s tenure was dominated by Nokia’s 15.6 billion-euro acquisition of the French telecoms group Alcatel-Lucent in 2016. Analysts say that integrating the company has taken more time than expected, causing Nokia to get a late start in the 5G race, which took off in 2018.In February, U.S. Attorney General William Barr suggested the U.S. government should, either directly or through a U.S. company, take a stake in Nokia or Ericsson to stay ahead in the 5G and technological battle with Huawei and China.Load-Date: July 31, 2020End of Document

SENATE PROPOSAL TO DELAY HUAWEI BAN FACES OPPOSITION FROM CHINA HAWKSInside the Air ForceJuly 10, 2020Copyright 2020 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights ReservedLength: 1119 wordsBody Posted July 2, 2020U.S. industry is urging lawmakers to delay a looming ban on the government contracting with companies that use certain Chinese products, but it's unclear whether a Congress keen on taking a hard line against China will consider the proposal.In the Senate, an amendment to the fiscal year 2021 defense authorization bill filed by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) this week would delay the statutory ban on federal contractors using products and services from Huawei, ZTE and other Chinese technology companies until August 2021. The law is currently scheduled to take effect Aug. 13.Johnson's amendment would also clarify that the ban only applies to equipment and services used in the performance of a government contract, rather than a company's entire business operations.The ban is required under Part B of Section 889 of the FY-19 National Defense Authorization Act, which targeted Huawei, ZTE, their affiliates and other Chinese companies due to concerns China could use those companies to target U.S. telecommunications infrastructure and spy on citizens and businesses.Part A went into effect last year and bans the government from purchasing certain Chinese products and services. However, the contractor ban is expected to be far more wide-sweeping and complex, as it applies to millions of federal contractors and their supply chains, which are often opaque and difficult to audit.Johnson's proposal is backed by powerful U.S. industry groups, who say the current deadline is unworkable and could force many businesses to suspend their government operations or leave federal business outright.In a June 30 letter to members of the Senate, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce highlighted Johnson's amendment as one of the "key" changes it would like to see in the bill."If Part B is not changed, many businesses with international and domestic operations would be forced to halt their work providing key products and services to agencies, including equipment that is needed to fight the coronavirus pandemic," Neil Bradley, the chamber's chief policy officer, wrote in the letter.But any changes to Section 889 will face stiff opposition from China hawks. Earlier this month, in response to a story about companies pressing for a delay to the ban, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) tweeted, "Nope.""Under no circumstances should we weaken or delay implementation of our laws banning the U.S. federal government and government contractors from using Huawei equipment," Cotton continued. "That would be a gift to the Chinese Communist Party."Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jim Inhofe (R-OK) said the Senate plans to take a vote on the authorization bill after the Fourth of July recess.However, it remains unclear whether Johnson's amendment will be considered. It was not included in a package of 62 bipartisan amendments adopted to the bill today, nor was it among six amendments the Senate agreed to consider and vote on, according to information provided by Inhofe's office today.A spokesman for Johnson, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, did not respond to questions about where the amendment stands in the process.Industry groups argue some relief is needed before Aug. 13 because the statute is overly broad and does not define "use." They say the ban seemingly applies to a company's entire business operations and its supply chain, and the Trump administration has yet to publish rules defining specifically how it would be implemented.Pentagon acquisition chief Ellen Lord also supports pushing back the deadline."I am concerned that we might have some unintended consequences with shutting down major portions of our defense industrial base because of one infraction of a Hikvision camera in a parking lot somewhere at a level four supplier," Lord told the House Armed Services Committee June 10. "We are very, very supportive of the intent. I am concerned about unintended consequences. I believe we need more time."But a general bipartisan consensus has emerged that China needs to be targeted through tougher industrial and national security policies, leaving many lawmakers reticent to relax laws such as the Huawei ban."Nobody wants to look like they're being soft on China," Kea Matory, director of legislative policy at the National Defense Industrial Association, told Inside Defense."No company wants to be soft on China either," she added. "Companies not only have national security concerns, but they also have concerns for their own intellectual property. Nobody wants their data to be taken."But she said industry is concerned the broad nature of the law will capture every aspect of a company's business operations. For instance, the current statute could apply to a supplier in southeast Asia, where the use of Huawei and ZTE telecommunications equipment is inevitable.Or, as Lord told House lawmakers earlier this month, it could apply to a lower-tier subcontractor in the United States who uses a security camera made by Hikvision, one of the "covered" Chinese companies banned by the law."How do you do that when you don't know where the pieces are throughout your supply chain?" Matory said of compliance.In addition to advocating for a delay, industry has been urging the Trump administration to issue a proposed rulemaking to allow for comment and revisions before the requirements go into effect Aug. 13. Earlier this year, a Defense Department official told industry a proposed rule was pending approval at the White House.In a follow-up tweet earlier this month, Cotton agreed that the White House's Office of Management and Budget should release Section 889 regulations so companies understand how to comply, but argued "the law already contains generous wavier provisions for any company attempting to comply in good faith that may need additional time."The House Armed Services Committee's version of the FY-21 defense authorization bill, approved by the panel Wednesday night, includes a "sense of Congress" provision that the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council should ensure Section 889 implementation provides "sufficient time for public comment and review of any related rulemaking." But the bill includes no changes to the law and the statutory deadline.OMB, which coordinates the regulatory council's activities, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Meanwhile, with legislative relief unlikely, Matory said NDIA is recommending its members prepare for Section 889 to go into effect Aug. 13."It's wise for contractors to start planning now for what they're going to do, because it doesn't look like there's going to be a change in time for the implementation of the law," she said. -- Justin DoubledayLoad-Date: July 10, 2020End of Document

TikTok Calls Instagram Reels a 'Copycat Product' After Speculation of U.S. BanNewsweek.comJuly 28, 2020 Tuesday 12:25 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 633 wordsByline: Jason MurdockHighlight: "Given that Lasso didn't catch on, it's not surprising to see Facebook try this tactic," a TikTok spokesperson said, referencing an Instagram service that will reportedly compete with the popular app.BodyAs short form video application TikTok continues to face political pressure in the U.S., it will soon find itself with another problem: Facebook.Instagram—which is owned by the Mark Zuckerberg-led company—is planning to unveil its TikTok-like Reels next month. The Wall Street Journal reported today Instagram has offered TikTok creators money to shift their attention to the new platform.TikTok, which is owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance and hugely popular with teens, is standing firm against imminent opposition, blasting the social media company for encroaching on its territory, even after its previous attempt failed.A separate TikTok-like app launched by Facebook in 2018, called Lasso, went out with a whimper this month, with service ending on July 10, The Verge reported."Given that Lasso didn't catch on, it's not surprising to see Facebook try this tactic with a copycat product tied to Instagram," a TikTok spokesperson told Wall Street Journal. "No matter how you dress things up, hundreds of millions of people truly just enjoy TikTok."According to the newspaper, content creators could be offered "hundreds of thousands of dollars" to exclusively make material for the Instagram service, which is said to use features similar to TikTok, including 15-second video clips set to music."Our focus here is offering choice, which we believe is a great thing for people to have," Instagram spokesperson Sarissa Thrower told WSJ in a statement.From its high-ground position, TikTok has been downloaded more than two billion times globally via app stores, according to analytics company SensorTower.But it has already felt some heat from its newest rival. After TikTok was banned in India over data privacy and national security concerns due to its close ties with China, Reels quickly swooped in and started tests in the region, Business Insider reported.TikTok has been contacted for comment by Newsweek.Speculation about a U.S. ban on the app surged over the past month, with president Trump appearing to confirm in an interview that it was being considered.Secretary of state Mike Pompeo said officials were "looking at" the app, far from the first time such concerns had been raised at a political level. In November last year, senators requested a formal assessment on TikTok's potential risk to national security.Critics have suggested the data of American users could be exploited or scooped up by the Chinese government, a claim consistently denied by TikTok officials.The business is currently led by an American CEO, former Disney streaming exec Kevin Mayer, and has reportedly considering splitting off from the parent company.Still, the U.S.-led concerns extend beyond the Trump administration, with staffers from the campaigning team of Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden urged to remove TikTok from their phones over its alleged security threat, Bloomberg reported.The Democratic and Republican national committees are taking a similarly-cautious approach when giving staffers advice about the Chinese-owned app."We continue to advise campaign staff to refrain from using TikTok on personal devices. If you are using TikTok for campaign work, we recommend using a separate phone and account," a note from the DNC security team read this month, CNN reported.Referencing a possible TikTok ban, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro previously indicated restrictions by the Trump administration were incoming. "TikTok and WeChat, I suspect that the president is just getting started with those two," he said.Last Thursday, TikTok announced a new $200 million fund to help support its creators through "monetary opportunities," including a marketplace that makes it easier for brands to "partner with innovative creators to collaborate on paid campaigns."Link to ImageGraphic TikTokMARTIN BUREAU/AFP/GettyThis illustration picture taken on May 27, 2020 in Paris shows the logo of the social network application Tik Tok on the screen of a phone.Load-Date: July 28, 2020End of Document

The push comes after U.S. officials warned American companies to protect any research on COVID-19 from hackers who were working to steal information related to a vaccine."Since Congress passed CARES earlier this year, we have become aware of attempts by hackers affiliated with China, Russia and Iran to steal American intellectual property related to COVID-19," wrote the Senators. "These hackers attempted to illegally gain access to the networks of American companies and research institutions with the intent to steal intellectual property. This includes research into diagnostics, potential treatments, and vaccines. These attempts to steal intellectual property related to COVID-19 is a threat to our national security.""As discussions continue for a possible fourth stimulus bill, we ask that you consider including funding for cyber-security grants for American companies conducting COVID-19 related research," the Senators continued. "This funding will help ensure that our intellectual property is kept safe from foreign adversaries and protect national security."* * *Dear Senators McConnell and Schumer:We write you today to express our support for the inclusion of funding in any fourth stimulus package for cyber-security hardening grants for small American companies engaged in COVID-19 research.In the CARES Act, Congress allocated $9.1 million to the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). This money was to support operations and to help guarantee that CISA has the resources it needs. However, since Congress passed CARES earlier this year, we have become aware of attempts by hackers affiliated with China, Russia and Iran to steal American intellectual property related to COVID-19.

This includes research into diagnostics, potential treatments, and vaccines. These attempts to steal intellectual property related to COVID-19 is a threat to our national security.Research into diagnostics, treatments, and cures is some of the most important research being conducted today and will continue to be essential for the foreseeable future. Given that hackers affiliated with foreign adversarial governments have already tried to hack American companies to steal this valuable research, it is likely they will try again.Innovative American companies of all sizes, in partnership with federal agencies, are working tirelessly to produce the essential treatments, vaccines, and ancillary supplies that we need to stop the spread of this virus. Smaller American companies are doing some of the most innovative research and development related to COVID-19. However, most of the resources they do have must be used for research. These smaller companies do not have the resources or technical expertise to prepare for attempted hacks. That is why this funding is essential.China has been clear: if America can invent it, they will try to steal it. And they are not the only foreign adversary willing use cyber-attacks to try to steal American intellectual property. Cyber-attacks that are successful or disrupt essential research are a threat to our economic recovery and national security. One successful disruption or stolen IP from hackers affiliated with China or any other county will negatively impact our road to recovery.As discussions continue for a possible fourth stimulus bill, we ask that you consider including funding for cyber-security grants for American companies conducting COVID-19 related research.

What does fate hold?CE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 22, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 664 wordsBodyToday we are all concerned about the future. And after readingFortune's survey of the CEOs on its list of the world's top 500 companies, it became very clear to me that, instead of wanting to return to "normality," we need to move forward in order to achieve a new and stable balance, within a "new reality."In addition, this study offers us great clarity, in this time when all public information is practically skewed or responds to political interests. At the top, we live and see daily how information changes to the pandemic by the Covid, because strategy, López-Gatell never had. The data is dosed and changed to give you a political explanation, and thereby manage people's support for their erratic decisions.To continue reading, you will need to sit well in your chair, adjust your belt and mentally prepare for a turbulence, NEVER before experienced.I'll start with more than half of the interviewees (52.4%) he thinks the economy will pick up levels equal to what it had before the start of the pandemic, until the first quarter of 2022. Faced with the question: when they expect at least 90 percent of their workforce to return to chambear, the answer is chilling, as more than a quarter of them (26.4%) believes he will NEVER return.They also argue that several situations of the way we worked will NOT be the same again. For example, business travel says more than half of CEOs (51.1%), will not return to previous levels, and technology will help change (and lower costs) from ancient ways. Moreover, 75% think that this pandemic will accelerate technological transformations.Eye, here you apply the glass half full or half empty, as almost half of them (48.9%) at this stage he has maintained jobs in his companies.Who passed and who failed?Most called the performance of both Trump and the Chinese government very poor. WHO received almost a draw between poor performance and mediocre so-so.Which country or region has the best opportunity to invest for the following year?With an overwhelming 74.3% won the USA; Asia followed, without China, with 11.5%; China, with 9%, and Europe, with 2.6%, tied with India.Look, they asked: if you had to invest in a company besides yours, in the top three were Amazon, Microsoft and Apple. Now, if they had to fall short in a company the top three is occupied by Tesla, Carnival and Boeing. I know, you're thinking, Tesla, after the rocket launch, they must be crazy, but that's what they said.The world will have changed.In addition to the decrease in business travel, much electronic communication will be used, so will technology more present.Ojo,, nationalism will strengthen by reducing global production chains. Governments will be more vigilant, although citizens will lose their confidence, and on the other hand, confidence in the Private Initiative will be increased. At the same time, theconcern and attention to the social side and certainly for the environment. (Obviously neither Two Mouths nor the Nahle Law nor those 4T ideas come in here; nor Bartlett's understanding saying that if there is no sun, there is no solar energy, and if there is no air there will be no wind energy either. Well neither the Green Party, as a friend-ally to the 21st with Morena and the PT. What will AMLO know? –I tell you in another column, because... the tail is laaaaaaarga).You could conclude that most of these managers, surveyed by Fortune, are aware and willing to support and protect their employees and workers because they don't see their governments doing it (and that's not governed by 4T, eh!), and that ultimately it's these (employees and workers) that bring their companies to life, but mostly bring the economy to life.However, we must be clear, companies can support a country's social strength, but not replace its governments; to help in that are your taxes and these are NOT substitutable. Tropicalizing, without entrepreneurs and their taxes, there is NO for AMLO's social programs.Read the original column hereLoad-Date: June 23, 2020End of Document

SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING IN MAINE, U.S. GETS BOLSTERED BY PASSAGE OF AMENDMENT SUPPORTED BY SENATORS COLLINS, KINGStates News ServiceJuly 22, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 737 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Maine Senator Susan Collins:The U.S. Senate voted to include an amendment cosponsored by U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Angus King (I-Maine) which would support the production and development of microelectronics in the United States in this year's National Defense Authorization Act. The amendment, which was approved by a vote of 96 to 4, mirrors the American Foundries Act of 2020, legislation introduced by the Senators and a bipartisan group of their colleagues earlier this month."Semiconductors are not only essential to keeping our country on the cutting edge of technology, but are also vital to maintaining our national security," said Senator Collins. "This industry supports hundreds of good-paying, high-tech manufacturing jobs at two factories in South Portland. Although the U.S. semiconductor industry has been an international leader for decades, aggressive incentives by foreign governments and unfair business practices have eroded America's dominance in this crucial sector. The targeted investments provided in our amendment will help spur the research and development necessary to keep U.S. semiconductor companies at the forefront of the industry.""America's technological prowess is a key source of economic innovation, and a vital building block of our national security we cannot and must not undercut either by outsourcing the manufacturing of semiconductors," said Senator King . "We need to be investing in these capabilities, to ensure that we are able to remain leaders in the world of microelectronics and to support good, high-paying jobs in communities across the country. The passage of this amendment will advance that goal, and provide a major boost to hundreds of Maine jobs."The United States revolutionized the microelectronics industry, inventing many of the key technologies that drive the economy today. However, it is at risk of falling behind in manufacturing or "fabricating" semiconductors at home as countries in Asia, especially China, have made significant investments in their microelectronics sectors. Seventy-eight percent of cutting-edge wafer fabrication capacity is now located in Asia; North America fell behind China in this benchmark for the first time in 2019.The American Foundries Act would make critical investments in commercial and defense-related microelectronics projects to ensure the United States remains a world leader in the industry. The bill includes the following measures:- Support for Commercial Microelectronics Projects : Authorizes the Department of Commerce to award $15 billion in grants to states to assist in the "construction, expansion, or modernization ... of microelectronics fabrication, assembly, test, advanced packaging, or advanced research and development facilities."- Support for Secure Microelectronics Projects : Authorizes the Department of Defense to award $5 billion in grants "for the creation, expansion, or modernization of one or more commercially competitive and sustainable microelectronics manufacturing or advanced research and development facilities capable of producing measurably secure and specialized microelectronic" for defense and intelligence purposes. This funding may go to primarily commercial facilities capable of producing secure microelectronics.- RandD Funding : Authorizes $5 billion in RandD spending to secure U.S. leadership in microelectronics. Requires agencies that receive this funding to "develop policies to require domestic production, to the extent possible, for any intellectual property resulting from microelectronics research and development as a result of these funds."- $2 billion for DARPA's Electronics Resurgence Initiative- $1.5 billion for the National Science Foundation- $1.25 billion for the Department of Energy- $250 million for the National Institute of Standards and Technology- National Microelectronics Research Plan : Establishes a subcommittee of the President's Council on Science and Technology to produce a report each year "to guide and coordinate funding for breakthroughs in next-generation microelectronics research and technology, strengthen the domestic microelectronics workforce, and encourage collaboration between government, industry, and academia."- Safeguards : Prohibits firms owned, controlled or otherwise influence by the Chinese government from accessing funds provided by the legislation.###Load-Date: July 22, 2020End of Document

Redefining national security in the post-pandemic worldCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 8, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 1181 wordsBodyResearchers, foundations, companies and government agencies from various countries work together to develop treatments and vaccines for Covid-19, while the US and China use the pandemic to raise bilateral tensions.Washington, DC – The world has spent the last 30 years trying to redefine "national security" in ways that allow nations-states to prepare to respond to a wide range of threats to our existence and well-being. Alternatively, it has been juxtaposed to "human security" in an effort to focus resources and energy on dangers affecting humanity as well as national sovereignty.But these efforts have largely failed, and it is time for us to try a new approach. Instead of broadening our definition of what national security is, we need to start narrowing it down. This is about making a distinction between national security and global security, and putting military security in place along with many other equally important but different priorities.We should start by asking ourselves four essential questions: What or who is he protecting himself? What threat(s) is protection against? Who's protecting? And how is protection being exercised?In its classic form, national security involves protecting nation-states from military aggression. To be more precise, as stated in Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations, it is a question of preventing or countering "the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State".Today nations-states face other threats, such as cyberattacks or terrorism, although they usually have to be sponsored by one state against another to threaten the integrity or political independence of a country. So these threats actually qualify as subsets of military security. On the other hand, climate change poses an existential threat to many island states because of sea level rise and similarly threatens arid countries by aggravating desertification and water scarcity.Moreover, while the world of 1945 was almost entirely defined by nation-states, today's security experts must also focus on threats that transcend national borders. Unlike military aggression, phenomena such as terrorism, pandemics, global criminal networks, disinformation campaigns, deregulated migration, and food, water and energy shortages do not necessarily threaten the political independence or territorial integrity of a particular state. But they do put the safety and well-being of the world's population at risk.The distinction between national and global security is not just semantic. It goes to the heart of the third question: who exercises protection? National security is the domain of national governments and a fairly small group of homogeneous people within them, who have traditionally focused almost entirely on military security. In recent years, these entities have expanded to deal with issues such as cybersecurity, health security and environmental security, but only on their margins.In contrast, thinking in terms of global security opens the door to the participation of a much broader group of people, starting with mayors and governors, who have direct responsibility for the safety and well-being of residents of their states, provinces andCities. For example, since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, U.S. state and urban authorities have been actively involved in preventing and protecting against future attacks. They are as likely to talk to their counterparts around the globe as diplomats or national defense authorities do.Even broader terms, global security has no designated authorities. Executive directors of companies, civic groups, philanthropists, teachers and leaders from every imaginable field can launch and join initiatives to keep us all safe. Indeed, the Covid-19 crisis has opened up many effective leadership bodies from different sources than national governments.A good example is the huge number of international networks of researchers, foundations, companies and government agencies that have been collaborating with each other to develop treatments and vaccines for Covid-19, with little regard for nationality, while the US and Chinese governments use the pandemic to raise bilateral tensions.Broader participation in global security initiatives will also increasingly dissolve the boundaries between "local" and "international" issues and policies. Distinctions in areas that have traditionally traditionally beenconsidered to be inmates of each country, such as health, environment, energy, cybersecurity and criminal justice, as well as areas that security and foreign relations experts see as entirely separate fields, such as defence, diplomacy and development, that needed relations between countries and international organizations.In turn, these changes will create opportunities for a much more diverse range of people to sit at the table to discuss global security issues. Despite some gradual changes in conventional armies in recent years, many more women and people of color now occupy major positions in city governments, and in areas such as health and environmental protection, including environmental justice.The final piece of puzzle is how to provide global security. Traditional military security focuses on winning, after all. But many global threats require greater resilience— that is, to stay resilient rather than always gain. As Sharon Burke of New America has argued, the goal is to develop home security rather than destroy enemies abroad.We certainly want to "win" if that means overcoming the effects of a virus or eradicating a terrorist cell or a misinformation network. But the profound nature of global threats suggests that they can be reduced, but almost never eliminated. Equipping people with the resources to recognize and avoid dangers, survive trauma, and adapt to new circumstances is a better strategy in the long run.Today Covid-19 death figures almost double those who died in the Vietnam War. But several national leaders in the United States and elsewhere remain focused on competition between major powers and seem less concerned about the growing number of victims of the pandemic than blaming other countries. And yet the lessons of this crisis will weigh heavily on thinking about our security and how to guarantee it in the future.And that will be especially true for future generations. For example, Alexandra Stark of New America argues that Covid-19 is the 9/11 of her generation. Instead of the highly militarized counter-terrorism response adopted by the US in the wake of these attacks, it calls for a new general strategy "that is fundamentally geared around human well-being",putting the emphasis on health, prosperity and opportunities for humans. That certainly sounds like security to me.The authorFormer director of policy planning at the US State Department (2009-2011), she is executive director of the New America expert group, emeritus professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University, and author of Unfinished Business: Women Men Work Family.Load-Date: June 9, 2020End of Document

TikTok plans to add 10,000 jobs in US as Trump admin considers banning itCNN WireJuly 21, 2020 Tuesday 3:51 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 403 wordsDateline: (CNN Business) Body (CNN Business) --  TikTok said Tuesday that it plans to create 10,000 jobs in the United States over the next three years, a substantial increase from the roughly 1,400 employees it currently has in the country.The announcement comes as the company faces mounting criticism over its handling of user data and its ties to China through its parent company, ByteDance. "These are good-paying jobs that will help us continue to build a fun and safe experience and protect our community's privacy," a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement provided to CNN on Tuesday.TikTok said it has already tripled its US workforce this year, and the new jobs will be based in California, Texas, Florida and New York --- focusing on areas including sales, content moderation, engineering and customer support. The announcement was first reported by Axios.The jobs announcement is part of a wider game of defense that TikTok has been playing to meet allegations by policymakers that TikTok poses a national security risk. The move also appears to follow a tried and true playbook for tech companies: when under fire, play up the job creation potential.Lawmakers including Sens. Chuck Schumer, Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley worry the company's user data could ultimately find its way to the Chinese government. TikTok has said it stores its US user data domestically and on backups in Singapore, and cybersecurity experts have previously told CNN the national security fears have not been proven by evidence.The Trump administration has said it is "looking at" banning the popular video app in the US, though it remains unclear how that may play out in practice. On Monday, House lawmakers voted 336-71 to bar TikTok from US government devices. The vote on the proposal took place as part of a vote on a package of amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act.TikTok has taken other steps to distance itself from China. It recently hired an American CEO and confirmed that its parent company is considering a corporate restructuring, including establishing a headquarters for the video app outside of China. In Washington, the company has expanded its policy and lobbying team and has met with roughly 50 congressional offices. TikTok also publishes a weekly policy newsletter that the company said goes out to hundreds of policymakers and their staffs. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

The week in GRC: US companies condemn racism, and ESG funds said to outperform peers during Covid-19Corporatesecretary.comJune 5, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 IR Media Group, LTD All Rights ReservedSection: ESGLength: 1854 wordsByline: Ben MaidenBody-The Guardianreported that Facebook employees were criticizing Mark Zuckerberg on social media for his refusal to act against US President Donald Trump. Disagreement came from employees at all levels of the company, including some senior staff. Particular criticism was aimed at Zuckerberg's decision to leave in place the Facebook version of a tweet sent by Trump in which the president appeared to encourage police to shoot rioters. Twitter hid the message behind a warning.Zuckerberg had said he disagreed with Twitter's interpretation of Trump's statement, which included the phrase: 'When the looting starts, the shooting starts.' Zuckerberg said: 'Personally, I have a visceral negative reaction to this kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric. I disagree strongly with how the president spoke about this, but I believe people should be able to see this for themselves.'Some employees appealed to the company's oversight board, a quasi-independent body that Facebook has funded to act as a 'supreme court' capable of ruling on difficult questions around content moderation. The board said it would not be able to intervene in time but was 'working hard to set the board up to begin operating later this year.'- The Guardianalso reported that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in late May said equity markets have generally ignored the increasing number of natural disasters over the past 50 years and tougher rules are needed to make investors aware of the dangers posed by climate change. Companies should be required to disclose their exposure to climate risk because a voluntary approach does not go far enough, the IMF said in a chapter from its latest global financial stability report.The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures outlines how companies should calculate and disclose to investors their exposure to climate risk.'An increasing number of firms have begun to voluntarily disclose climate change risk information, in line with the recommendations set out by the taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures,' the IMF said. 'However, going further by developing global mandatory disclosures on material climate change risks would be an important step to sustain financial stability.'- Coty appointed its fourth new CEO in under four years and finalized its $2.5 billion deal to sell a majority stake in its professional beauty and retail haircare businesses to KKR & Co, The Wall Street Journalreported. Peter Harf, Coty's current chair, will also assume the CEO role. The move leaves the company's fortunes directly in the hands of its largest shareholder, JAB Holding Co, of which Harf is one of two managing partners.- According to CNN, Bank of America is donating $1 billion over the next four years to community programs and small businesses to help address economic and racial inequality that has been worsened by Covid-19. CEO Brian Moynihan said 'underlying economic and social disparities' were made worse by the pandemic and mentioned the nationwide protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in police custody, saying this has 'created a sense of true urgency', adding: 'We all need to do more.'Moynihan is the latest high-profile CEO to publicly speak about the protests. Peloton, Intel and Verizon have also announced donations to minority-oriented organizations.- The Wall Street Journalreported that more than 20 of the world's largest co-working companies, which are facing threats to their business from the Covid-19 pandemic, have agreed to co-ordinate in a way that would have been unheard of before the crisis. The companies, which include Industrious and Convene in the US, JustCo of Singapore and IWG of the UK, have created a new umbrella organization known as the Workplace Operator Readiness Council.WeWork is not a member. A WeWork spokesperson said the company opted against joining because 'with more than 100 locations in China, WeWork quickly developed, shared and began implementing plans for a safe return to the workplace in early April.'- Reuters reported that General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor Co condemned racial inequality in the US following the death of Floyd, an unarmed black man. In a letter to employees, GM CEO Mary Barra wrote that she was 'impatient and disgusted' following the death of Floyd and emphasized the need to 'individually and collectively' drive change. The company shared Barra's letter with thousands of dealers and suppliers. Barra also said she was commissioning an inclusion advisory board at the company.Ford's executive chair, Bill Ford, and CEO Jim Hackett also wrote a joint letter to employees addressing the 'tragic killing of George Floyd' and America's 'systemic racism.'- Ryanair Holdings and its CEO Michael O'Leary failed to persuade a US judge to dismiss a securities fraud lawsuit accusing the European budget airline of defrauding shareholders by downplaying its willingness to recognize labor unions, according to Reuters. Although dismissing much of the proposed class action, US district judge Paul Oetken said shareholders could try to prove that Ryanair intended to mislead them with statements indicating a 'near certainty' it would not welcome unions, the recognition of which could increase costs and reduce profitability.Oetken dismissed claims concerning other statements about Ryanair's labor relations, profitability and growth targets, finding no proof the statements were false.Ryanair and its law firm did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for the lead plaintiff did not immediately respond to similar requests.- According to CNBC, the manager of S&P's scoring system for its ESG index said it takes into account companies' responses to their communities in times of stress. Mona Naqvi, head of ESG product strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices, was speaking after nationwide protests were held following the death of Floyd while in police custody.'We do take into account things like how companies are behaving with respect to their raw stakeholders,' Naqvi said. 'So not just their employees and their shareholders, but [also] how they interact with their broader community, which is really important in terms of building goodwill in times of stress like this.'It's also important through ESG to take into account things like diversity. How does a company actually hire? What are its hiring practices? Is it diverse throughout its broader business operations? And I think these are all types of issues that these protests are demonstrating are very important to many people, which ESG can help capture.'- CNN reported that ice cream maker Ben & Jerry's called on Americans to 'dismantle white supremacy' and 'grapple with the sins of our past' as nationwide protests against racial injustice continued. In a statement posted to the company's website late on Tuesday, Ben & Jerry's describes the death of Floyd as the result of 'inhumane police brutality that is perpetuated by a culture of white supremacy.''What happened to George Floyd was not the result of a bad apple; it was the predictable consequence of a racist and prejudiced system and culture that has treated black bodies as the enemy from the beginning,' said the brand, which is owned by Unilever.The company also called for the US Department of Justice to reinvigorate its Civil Rights Division, and for Congress to pass HR 40, a bill that would create a commission to study the effects of discrimination since African slaves first arrived in North America in 1619 and recommend remedies.- CNBC reported that an analyst at BNP Paribas Asset Management said investors have been 'doubling down' on sustainability over the last quarter - and sustainable funds have performed better than the broader market. That's a shift from historical precedents where people shifted their focus from sustainability to near-term profits in tough times, according to Gabriel Wilson-Otto, head of stewardship for Asia-Pacific at the French bank.'In Asia ex-Japan, even with the deterioration in markets, ESG assets are actually up 21 percent in the first quarter, and this has also been supported by really strong performance from sustainable funds,'Wilson-Otto added.- Reuters reported that Amazon.com has been sued for allegedly fostering the spread of Covid-19 through unsafe working conditions, causing at least one employee to contract the disease, bring it home and see her cousin die. The complaint was filed in the federal court in Brooklyn, New York, by three employees of the company's fulfillment center in Staten Island, and by family members.One employee, Barbara Chandler, said she tested positive for Covid-19 in March and later saw several household members become sick, including a cousin who died on April 7. The lawsuit said Amazon has made the fulfillment center a 'place of danger' by impeding efforts to stop the coronavirus spreading, increasing productivity at the expense of safety.Amazon did not comment on the lawsuit but said it has always followed guidance from health authorities and its workplace safety experts since the pandemic began. The company is spending more than $800 million on coronavirus safety in this year's first half, including cleaning, temperature checks and face masks.- The SEC announced a nearly $50 million whistleblower award, the largest amount ever given to one individual under the agency's whistleblower program. The next largest is a $39 million award to an individual in 2018. 'This... brings the total awarded to whistleblowers by the SEC to [more than] $500 million, including [more than] $100 million in this fiscal year alone,' said Jane Norberg, chief of the SEC's office of the whistleblower, in a statement. 'Whistleblowers have proven to be a critical tool in the enforcement arsenal to combat fraud and protect investors.'- Reuters reported that Volkswagen said it has completed an internal report into how it came to publish a racist advert, adding that its findings will be released once its management board has reviewed the matter. The management board, headed by CEO Herbert Diess, meets regularly on Tuesdays. Criticism of the advert went viral last month and the company apologized and pulled the clip, prompting Volkswagen's labor leaders to accuse management of damaging the company. Volkswagen admitted that the advert was racist and insulting.- According to the Financial Times, the US president set a 60-day deadline for financial regulators to recommend ways to clamp down on Chinese companies listed in the US that fail to meet proper accounting standards. Trump said in a memorandum that he was instructing the presidential working group on financial markets - which includes US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell, SEC chair Jay Clayton and Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair Heath Tarbert - to suggest actions the executive branch could take to curb certain Chinese listings.US officials have been particularly concerned that the Chinese government is preventing auditing firms from giving the PCAOB paperwork it requires for auditing inspections of companies listed in the US.Link to ImageLoad-Date: June 5, 2020End of Document

U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King joined a bipartisan group of Senators in introducing the American Foundries Act of 2020, a bill that supports the production and development of microelectronics in the United States. The Senators aim to include the bill as an amendment in this year's National Defense Authorization Act."Semiconductors are not only essential to keeping our country on the cutting edge of technology, but are also vital to maintaining our national security," said Senator Collins. "This industry supports hundreds of good-paying, high-tech manufacturing jobs at two factories in South Portland. Although the U.S. semiconductor industry has been an international leader for decades, aggressive incentives by foreign governments and unfair business practices have eroded America's dominance in this crucial sector. The targeted investments provided in our bill would help spur the research and development necessary to keep U.S. semiconductor companies at the forefront of the industry.""America's technological prowess is a key source of economic innovation, and a vital building block of our national security we cannot and must not undercut either by outsourcing the manufacturing of semiconductors," said Senator King. "We need to be investing in these capabilities, to ensure that we are able to remain leaders in the world of microelectronics and to support good, high-paying jobs in communities across the country."The legislation was also introduced by Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Jack Reed (D-RI), James Risch (R-ID), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), and Doug Jones (D-AL).The United States revolutionized the microelectronics industry, inventing many of the key technologies that drive the economy today. However, it is at risk of falling behind in manufacturing or "fabricating" semiconductors at home as countries in Asia, especially China, have made significant investments in their microelectronics sectors. Seventy-eight percent of cutting-edge wafer fabrication capacity is now located in Asia; North America fell behind China in this benchmark for the first time in 2019.The American Foundries Act would make critical investments in commercial and defense-related microelectronics projects to ensure the United States remains a world leader in the industry. The bill includes the following measures:Support for Commercial Microelectronics Projects: Authorizes the Department of Commerce to award $15 billion in grants to states to assist in the "construction, expansion, or modernization ... of microelectronics fabrication, assembly, test, advanced packaging, or advanced research and development facilities."Support for Secure Microelectronics Projects: Authorizes the Department of Defense to award $5 billion in grants "for the creation, expansion, or modernization of one or more commercially competitive and sustainable microelectronics manufacturing or advanced research and development facilities capable of producing measurably secure and specialized microelectronic" for defense and intelligence purposes.

Here we tell you.m{905520}Why is TikTok banned in other countries?View this post on InstagramI trying to find my chapstick in my bag . . . #TikTok #TikTokDontStop #cuteanimals #cutecats #asmrA post shared by TikTok (@tiktok) on Jun 28, 2020 at 12:00pm PDTThe popular application of short videos is prohibited in some countries with India and Cuba for considering the implications that the app would have in possible cases of espionage, both governmental and private, as well as the possible dissemination of propaganda within its content, so Australia is also considering banning it in its territory.In addition, it was announced that in the coming days TikTok will cease operating in Hong Kong following the entry into force of a new national security law that China enacted for the territory, and non-compliance could result in fines of up to 100,000 Hong Kong (290 thousand pesos) and penalties of up to two years in prison, as the local newspaper South China Morning Post reports today.View this post on InstagramCEO of running off into the sunset . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . #TikTok #TikTokDontStop #oddlysatisfying #water #sunsetA post shared by TikTok (@tiktok) on Jul 7, 2020 at 12:00pm PDTRumors of the possible departure of the App from Mexico are taking hold because, following recent events, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. government is considering restricting its citizens' access to this app, possibly implying a domino effect for the rest of the American countries.In addition, a few days ago the hacking group Anonymous reported that the TikTok app collects data from users, including phone hardware, CPU type, course number, hardware ID, screen dimensions, DPI, memory usage, disk space, even up to WiFi access.Delete TikTok now; if you know someone that is using it explain to them it is essentially malware operated by the Chinese government running a massive spying operation. https://t.co/J7N9FS7PvG— Anonymous (@YourAnonCentral) July 1, 2020Why is TikTok failing in Mexico?TikTok's "fall" that was reported in recent hours in countrieslike Mexico and Spain, it could have nothing to do with a possible ban or disappearance of the app, but with a Facebook problem that would be causing massive drops and service problems in dozens of third-party applications, including TikTok, Spotify, Pinterest and Tinder, among others, as the Verge reports.Facebook recognized a "sudden spike" bug in third-party apps caused by its iOS SDK, a developer software development tool that it distributes so that other apps can use its services.This is not the first time that an error in the Facebook SDK for iOS causes bugs in other apps, as the month of May there was a massive drop in Spotify, TikTok, Pinterest, Tinder and GrubHub, due to a change made by the company in its this development kit.m{905519}LnbLoad-Date: July 11, 2020End of Document

What to Know About Tech Investing in 2020USNEWS.comJuly 14, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: INVESTING; Investing 101; Vol.; No.Length: 1347 wordsByline: Rebecca Lake, Paulina LikosHighlight: Tech innovation has skyrocketed so far this year and there are no signs of stopping.BodyThe technology sector has been a high-performing group, experiencing record gains in 2020 thus far. With our new virtual reality accompanied by a surge in online activity, e-commerce and software development are seeing aggressive growth. Consumer and business spending in these areas has beefed up tech stock price targets and increased shares, reaching new highs. While the S&P 500 has struggled with a year-to-date daily total return of -0.32%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has gained about 20% this year to date. Experts are observing a lot of momentum in the tech sector. "Public tech stocks have been doing tremendously well so far this year," says Ben Narasin, venture partner at New Enterprise Associates in Menlo Park, California. Narasin explains that increasing dependence on technology is a good predictor of even greater reliance on technology after the pandemic ends. The public health crisis has created a model where there is no one who isn't using technology to get their job done, Narasin says. "Technology has always enabled people and companies to be more productive but not everyone embraced it. Now they have no choice." The push for digitization has resulted in technology business growth and consumer adoption and retention. "Huge growth means big value increases for these companies and this acceleration has gotten people excited," Narasin adds. Here are the most important things to know about tech investing looking toward the second half of 2020: -- Think about how tech will be used in the future.-- Consider hedging your bets. -- Be prepared for "techlash" repercussions.-- Stay optimistic.[SEE:Analyst Picks for 7 Top 5G Stocks to Buy.]Think About How Tech Will Be Used in the FutureAny industry may be subject to obsolescence risk: having a process, technology or product become obsolete, reducing a company's competitiveness in the marketplace. The ever-shifting nature of tech may heighten that risk. Technological change will "blaze a trail of destruction across even the nontech sectors of investor portfolios since the next phase of the technology revolution will be in technology-using firms," many of which are far removed from the formal tech sector, says Taimur Hyat, chief operating officer at PGIM, the investment management business of Prudential Financial in New York City. With that in mind, he says it's important to evaluate how technological changes may impact total portfolio holdings to understand which asset types, securities or sectors face a higher risk of obsolescence from disruptive technologies and where the opportunities lie. "Investors don't need to find the unicorn in this next phase of technology-driven disruption, because the opportunities arising from the current wave of change are not limited to Silicon Valley or the narrowly defined tech sector," Hyat says. "In fact, the greatest risk of obsolescence and the greatest potential for disruption will be in sectors as diverse as real estate, energy and consumer goods." [Sign up for stock news with our Invested newsletter.]Consider Hedging Your BetsMarket volatility may be a cue to pull focus and reevaluate tech positioning. Strong, secular drivers have done well in a digitally-driven economy so far but it's important to have a balance with high-growth technology companies to offset any risks. Some experts recommend to hedge higher growth tech stocks with cyclically exposed stocks, "It's prudent to balance out that opportunity with cyclical investments within in tech," says Dave Smith, senior vice president at Bailard in Foster City, California. Smith says his company is focused on the best-in-class companies with strong management teams with a history of strong execution. "We think there will be opportunities for cyclicals in the near term on semiconductors, particularly focused in the 5G space," Smith says. Investors need to be comfortable with market changes. If you're invested in highly volatile companies, you have to be able to ride out those periods, experts say. Narasin says to trade only an amount you're comfortable losing or having materially impacted. "In general, many tech stocks are great long-term bets, but having a long-term investment win when you are forced to get out short-term due to liquidity issues doesn't help," he explains. Narasin stresses that investors need to prepare to "navigate volatility in terms of not needing that cash" and be in a position to withstand volatility and be a long-term buyer. "Buy stocks you can buy and hold for the long term and not worry about how it impacts your day to day, because if it does, it will force you to make decisions you don't want to make," Narasin says. >Be Prepared for a 'Techlash'Tech is a major focal point for regulators and lawmakers, both in the U.S. and abroad. Recently, the U.S. put a firmer grip on the regulation of technology exports in efforts to prevent China and other international players from obtaining exclusive technology. The most recent example: The possibility of the U.S. banning TikTok, a popular social media app among teens, due to scares of Chinese government interference. Hyat says those events, along with geopolitical tensions between China and other G-8 countries over intellectual property and strategic technology, could elevate volatility among tech stocks. "Investors should absolutely continue to brace for a techlash, as regulators and governments aren't yet done with tightening regulation around tech firms that have, historically, taken advantage quite aggressively of limited rules in a bid to win customers, reduce tax burdens and outmaneuver governments," he says. "It remains to be seen how much appetite technology-driven firms have to self-regulate versus waiting for regulators to impose new regulations." While privacy and security are central to regulatory concerns, big tech's adherence to antitrust laws is increasingly being called into question. David Russell, vice president of market intelligence at trading platform TradeStation in Chicago, says focusing on business-to-business stocks, rather than high-profile consumer-facing tech names may help to mitigate any risk that increasing regulation could present. Going back to basics with classic business-to-business growth stocks is also a way to downplay tech stock risk without abandoning the sector entirely, says Blake Oliver, director of marketing at Jirav in Los Angeles. "It isn't nearly as sexy as social media and consumer tech, but there are plenty of fast-growing companies building critical Software-as-a-Service products (SaaS) for businesses all the way from small to enterprise," he says. Those products, which range from accounting software and collaboration apps to marketing automation programs, are being quickly adopted at the back end of every business in America, Oliver says. "We're in the middle of a generational shift from on-premises and desktop software to cloud-based SaaS, and it's a huge opportunity for both businesses and investors." [SEE:The S&P 500's 10 Best Dividend Stocks in the First Half of 2020.]Stay OptimisticThe overarching theme for tech investors in the months ahead: Keep an eye open for new trends. "There are companies benefiting from real secular trends that are accelerating right now," says Blair Silverberg, co-founder and CEO of Capital in New York City. Shopify and Livongo are great public market examples, Silverberg says. "Their business models fundamentally facilitate the shift toward conducting more life and work online." In terms of choosing new tech investments, "individual investors should take their cues from the institutional buyers who control the market," TradeStation's Russell says. "They may want to seek out companies that are making new highs or leading their peers." He offers a reminder that Apple (ticker: AAPL), Amazon ( AMZN), Netflix ( NFLX) and Facebook ( FB) outperformed for a long time and won't be the last tech companies to do so. "The next innovators will behave similarly," Russell says. "Traders may want to wait for the new champions to emerge and then follow their momentum." Graphic Picture, The overarching theme for tech investors in the months ahead is to keep an eye open for new trends., (Getty Images)Load-Date: July 15, 2020End of Document

Rethinking the K-pop industry's silence during the Black Lives Matter movementThe Conversation - United StatesJune 26, 2020 Friday 12:34 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights ReservedLength: 1369 wordsByline: Hye Jin Lee, Clinical Assistant Professor of Communication, University of Southern California, Annenberg School for Communication and JournalismHighlight: Few of those in the K-pop industry have donated or even spoken out in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.BodyAs nationwide protests against police violence and racial inequality continue in the U.S., K-pop fans, famous for their social media savvy, are using their            collective power to rally around the Black Lives Matter movement.K-pop stands for Korean popular music. So far, fans have crashed police department apps and            co-opted hashtags. This highlights the subversive tools that have become part of the K-pop standom - which refers to the obsessive, dedicated, diehard fandom - resistance.When K-pop stars BTS and their company, Big Hit, donated US$1 million to Black Lives Matter, BTS fans mobilized in a            #MatchAMillion campaign. They successfully            reached their fundraising target in 24 hours.Big Hit was an outlier. While K-pop fans have received media attention for their support in the Black Lives Matter movement, the industry has largely remained quiet about what has become a global flashpoint. The silence from most of the K-pop industry stands out even more against the            unprecedented number of businesses standing with the anti-racism movement as a            corporate strategy.I'm a scholar of popular culture, and my research on K-pop shows how the K-pop industry's conventional practice of shying away from political issues is currently being challenged by the more politically vocal and engaged fans at the moment of Black Lives Matter.A history of silenceK-pop is generally understood as a particular style of music produced, distributed and consumed within the idol training and management system.Under this system, Korean entertainment companies tightly control the images of the young K-pop stars and groom them to become "multi-entertainers" who can make various media appearances and  potentially land numerous lucrative endorsement deals and partnerships with brands.This goal requires K-pop stars to have a broad commercial appeal, secured through their exuberance and exhibition of values that the Korean public approve, such as humility, hard work, discipline and obedience.The K-pop industry has a long history of staying out of political and social issues. Entertainment companies fear that getting mired in politics will            hurt business.Even when millions of Koreans peacefully took to the streets for 20 consecutive weekends to demand the            impeachment of ex-President Park Geun-hye for her role in the government corruption,            the K-pop industry and its stars stayed mum.K-pop's transnational popularity, especially in East Asia, a region that has complex geopolitics and tensions from unresolved historical conflicts, is another reason the industry stays apolitical.But due to the differing demands of the Korean fans who want their K-pop stars to advance Korea's nationalistic causes and the international fans who want the K-pop stars to be sympathetic to their local causes, K-pop's industry's desire to maintain "apolitical neutrality" seems to be less tenable.Even when K-pop stars avoid expressing their political views, geopolitical feuds between different countries in the East Asian region can lead to disastrous financial consequences.The world saw the result of this in the aftermath of the the U.S. missile defense system's deployment on the Korean soil. Worried that            the sophisticated radar systems included in the system can track China's own missiles, the Chinese government issued a stern warning that the deployment of THAAD will lead to a disastrous relationship between two countries.When the Korean government failed to heed to that demand, China banned Korean entertainment and entertainers, leading many Korean companies to see their share prices to dip more than 15% within a month of those            retaliatory actions. K-pop in the statesWith K-pop's growth into a $5 billion global industry, Korean entertainment companies' collective silence on Black Lives Matter seems to be less of a viable option when issues of racism and social inequality matter greatly to the American fans whose passion and effective fan labor have been at the center of that global growth. K-pop's global success being indebted to Black music and fandom is another important factor to why the K-pop industry cannot ignore the social justice movements that are happening in the U.S.K-pop's influence from Black music such as hip hop, rap and R&B is a huge factor in K-pop's transnational appeal. Lee Soo Man, the founder of SM Entertainment, has acknowledged the connection, saying that K-pop is "based on Black music."The founders of JYP, YG and            Big Hit Entertainment have all publicly stated their influence from Black artists. The K-pop industry continues to draw inspiration from Black music by            hiring Black American lyricists and producers to provide R&B style music.K-pop's breakthrough in the U.S. is largely attributed to its transnational fandom base, with Black fans contributing significantly to transform K-pop            from a niche genre to a global phenomenon.In fact, K-pop's success in the U.S. was possible not because of a white, mainstream audience, but because a small, passionate group of K-pop fans - many from communities of color - discovered K-pop as they sought alternatives to the mainstream popular culture that continues to privilege white representation as the norm.K-pop as a political toolThese fans are not political wallflowers.American K-pop fans have held American journalists and mainstream media accountable when those journalists and outlets used racist stereotypes to cover K-pop. They have called out a white, Western record executive who expressed his desire to            whitewash K-pop by creating a K-pop group without Koreans.They have also challenged the racist and xenophobic actions of MTV when it created a separate category for K-pop artists called "Best K-pop" while excluding them from the main awards such as "Best Pop" or "Artist of the Year" for Video Music Awards.For these American fans, K-pop has become a tool for social justice.However, fans are also looking at this tool in the context of the K-pop industry's - and the fandom's -            anti-Black racist practices as K-pop is being celebrated as a popular weapon for activism.K-pop idols have a history of wearing cornrows, braids or dreads,            performing in Blackface or            making jokes about Black people.Considering that K-pop is a product of systematic planning and controlled management, these anti-Black performances were done with the approval of the Korean entertainment companies. As K-pop fans in America and around the world are protesting for social justice and racial equality, they are also using the moment to reflect on K-pop's practices of racism and            cultural appropriation.The current moment is one of reckoning for the K-pop industry, where the narrow nationalism of its apoliticism appears at great odds with its American K-pop fans' demand for political and social change. Taking a standA significant number of K-pop stars have already publicly stated their support for the Black Lives Matter movement.Korean entertainment companies that generally encourage their stars to refrain from political expressions as part of their management strategy have not stopped them from doing so. In fact, on June 19, 2020, SM Entertainment, Korea's biggest entertainment company, released an official statement on the Black Lives Matter movement. It took more than three weeks since the protests after the death of George Floyd and much prodding from American fans who have called out the company to speak out with            #SMBLACKOUT movement for the company to issue its support.However, this shows how the socially conscious and politically outspoken American fans can nudge the K-pop industry to become more political, especially as K-pop aims to stay global.[You're smart and curious about the world.

03 JUN 2020 SLOW AND STEADY WINS BACK AMERICAN MANUFACTURINGStates News ServiceJune 3, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 466 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the National Center for Public Policy Research:The delay in efficiently preparing for the COVID-19 pandemic due to a combination of unhelpfulness and deceit by the Chinese government "highlights the potential dangers of our globalized world."To reestablish stability, National Center President David Ridenour suggests a repatriation of the supply chain for items such as medical goods and drugs. Right now, America is simply too dependent upon China. But this is neither a quick nor easy fix. David advises:[L]ike anything worth doing, Buy American initiatives are worth doing well. Let's hope policymakers realize that before pushing through half-baked plans.In a Townhall commentary, David does provide good news about America's medical reliance on China. It is, in fact, not as bad as many have thought:America is less dependent on China for essential products than many Buy American advocates believe. We already manufacture 70 percent of essential medical equipment domestically. Of the remaining 30 percent, most comes from Ireland, Germany, and Switzerland. China trails as the fourth-largest supplier...The United States may also be less reliant on China for medicines than many believe. Twenty-eight percent of facilities capable of manufacturing "active pharmaceutical ingredients" (API) the chemicals used to make drugs are based in the United States, 26 percent are based in the European Union and 18 percent are based in India. China lags behind at just 13 percent. Only three of the 370 drugs deemed "essential" by the World Health Organization contain active pharmaceutical ingredients sourced solely from China.This data might not provide a complete picture of the essential drug supply chain, but it does tell us that reports suggesting 80% of our drugs come from China are wild exaggerations.To further distance the United States from China, David suggests more economic incentives and lower corporate taxes to entice manufacturers not to locate their facilities abroad. Additionally, "a targeted repatriation plan," something that was authorized for medical supplies in the CARES Act, could prioritize, diversify and create a smooth transition for the implementation of Buy American policies.With the possibility of executive action on the horizon that could mandate the establishment of certain domestic manufacturing especially for medical products and pharmaceuticals immediate and careful planning is a wise move.Click here to read all of David's commentary "The Right Way to Buy American?

Top US Shippers: Recyclables exporters bracing for large drops in supply, demandJournal of CommerceJune 3, 2020 Wednesday 4:00 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Commonwealth Business Media All Rights ReservedLength: 991 wordsByline: Bill Mongelluzzo, Senior Editor | Jun 03, 2020 12:00PM EDTBodyhttps://www.joc.com/sites/default/files/field_feature_image/Recyclables%20white%20background.jpg [caption caption="The nationwide economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 crisis will result in a 20 percent contraction in the US recycling industry in 2020, according to a study commissioned by the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI). Photo credit: Shutterstock.com."][/caption](The following story appears in the Top 100 US Importers and Exporters issue of the Journal of Commerce print magazine.)US exporters of scrap metals, paper, and plastics saw increased demand in 2019, as growing shipments to Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Northern Europe offset a 20.2 percent decline in volume to China, which remains the primary market for recyclables.However, exports of recyclables came crashing down in early 2020 due to both supply and demand destruction caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). On the supply side, the global pandemic has idled key industries and services that generate scrap paper and metals. Plunging oil prices have made recycled plastics uncompetitive with virgin plastics.  According to a Dunham & Associates study commissioned by the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI), the nationwide economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 crisis will result in a 20 percent contraction in the US recycling industry in 2020. The report projects recyclers will cut 27,000 jobs, and wages and benefits will fall by $2 billion, as the direct loss in total output in the recycling industry climbs to $7 billion this year alone.Areas that have traditionally been the largest markets for US recyclables such as China, India, Taiwan, and South Korea are generating lower demand as their economies grow more slowly - or not at all - amid the COVID-19 pandemic."China is still number one, but now demand is crashing," said Adina Renee Adler, senior director of international relations at ISRI. US scrap exports to China plunged 45 percent in February as factories were closed for the Lunar New Year celebrations and then remained closed due to COVID-19 lockdowns, she said.[caption caption="Click to enlarge" align="right"][/caption]US containerized exports of scrap metals, paper, and plastics have been on a downward slide since peaking in 2014 at 1.97 million TEU, according to data from PIERS, a sister company of JOC.com within IHS Markit. Exports to China, by far the largest market for US recyclables, declined from a peak of 1.32 million TEU (66.9 percent of total US scrap exports) in 2013 to only 416,768 TEU (28.3 percent) in 2019 as the Chinese government implemented its Green Fence program, which banned imports of contaminated scrap products. US exports declined further the past two years because of tariffs on scrap commodities during the US-China trade war.China has significantly reduced its imports of recyclable materials, not only from the US but from other exporting countries as well, Adler said. "China wants to get to a place where it is self-sufficient," with its manufacturing industries securing most of their recyclables domestically, she said.For their part, US scrap exporters have expanded their markets in a number of locations over the past five years. Volumes to Southeast Asia have grown at a five-year compounded annual rate of 38.1 percent, while shipments to the Indian subcontinent (India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) have increased 14.2 percent, and exports to Northern Europe are up 10.2 percent, according to PIERS.Despite its tighter environmental restrictions and a trade war with the US, China last year easily retained its ranking as the top market for US recyclables. US scrap exports to China in 2019 totaled 416,768 TEU, nearly double that of second-ranked India (263,396 TEU) and much greater than those to Taiwan (163,793 TEU), South Korea (126,823 TEU), and Vietnam (99,383 TEU).Market lockdownsUS scrap exporters have been pinning their hopes on India, which has seen volumes grow at a five-year rate of 15.4 percent. Scrap exports to India in 2019 increased 4 percent from 2018, but that growth may slow even further this year due to COVID-19."India is a critical market," Adler said. But the country "went into a complete lockdown. Manufacturers closed overnight." Shipments of recyclable products that were already in transit to India when the recycling plants were closed backed up at Indian ports, and many of those containers are not expected to move to the plants until at least May 17, she said.In addition to declining markets overseas due to the global economic recession, US scrap exporters this year must contend with a shortage of supply. The US economy in the first quarter contracted by 4.7 percent, according to an advance estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), and more than 30 million jobs were lost. Businesses in major metropolitan areas either laid off workers, or told them to work from home, further decreasing the consumption of goods that use recyclable materials as packaging.Shippers of recyclables must also deal with supply shortages in the US for some commodities such as scrap paper and metals. Offices and schools, which generate large volumes of scrap paper, have been closed since mid-March in much of the country. Scrap metal supply and demand are on a similar trajectory. With automobile manufacturing plants in a number of countries shut down for a couple of months, demand for recycled metals is down, and with consumers holding onto their cars longer, less scrap is being generated, Adler noted.The story is much the same for recycled plastics, which compete directly with resins and other plastics produced from oil and natural gas. "With the steep drop in oil prices" caused by the effect of COVID-19 on demand, "virgin plastics are cheaper than recycled plastics," Adler said.Contact Bill Mongelluzzo at bill.mongelluzzo@ihsmarkit.com and follow him on Twitter:            @billmongelluzzo.Load-Date: June 14, 2020End of Document

CRAPO STATEMENT AT EXPORT-IMPORT BANK OVERSIGHT HEARINGStates News ServiceJune 26, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 818 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Majority Office:U.S. Senator Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, delivered the following remarks at a hybrid hearing to conduct oversight of the Export-Import Bank of the United States.The text of Chairman Crapo's remarks, as prepared, is below."Welcome to our witness, the Honorable Kimberly Reed, President and Chairman of the Board of the Export-Import Bank of the United States."We welcome you back, Chairman Reed. It has been almost exactly a year since your last appearance before this committee."Today, we will receive testimony on EXIM's recent activities and operations, including your efforts to implement the 7-year reauthorization legislation we enacted last December, as well as your efforts to continue to process through the transactions and other matters in the pipeline at EXIM, and to increase your outreach and efforts to bring new U.S. export opportunities into the pipeline."In addition, we know the disruption of COVID-19 on the U.S. economy has had an impact on U.S. exporters as well, and we will be interested to hear of any efforts and initiatives you are undertaking to address these challenges."Chairman Reed, you have been on the job for a little over a year now."When you came before us for your nomination hearing, and when you met individually with me and with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, you made a commitment that, if confirmed, you would move forward on implementing any outstanding congressionally-initiated reforms, as well as bring your own commitment to greater transparency and accountability for the EXIM bank."As I have since noted in other EXIM-related hearings in this committee, your efforts to follow through on your commitment to transparency, accountability and reform have not gone unnoticed by me and by my colleagues on this committee."I commend you for those efforts and encourage you to continue them."In December 2019, this Congress enacted a 7-year reauthorization of the EXIM Bank, the longest authorization period in the Bank's history."This extension provides much-needed certainty for U.S. exporters and strengthens an important tool for the U.S. to compete directly with China and others in the global marketplace."Included in the legislation is a new initiative, focusing on China and transformational exports, which will reserve a significant portion of EXIM's exposure authority for transactions that will put U.S. exporters in direct competition with China."This program will particularly focus on U.S. exports of innovative technologies, like semiconductor manufacturing, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, wireless communications, renewable energy and energy efficiency and storage, as well as emerging financial technologies."The new law also includes a requirement that, in addition to its existing notification obligations to Congress, EXIM shall consult with the State Department as part of efforts to assess any risk to the national interest for any proposed transaction above $25 million involving any business entity that is controlled by the Chinese government."Our reauthorization legislation also had an important focus on increasing the participation of American small businesses in EXIM projects, by raising the target from 25 percent to 30 percent for small business participation in EXIM-supported exports."Chairman Reed, we look forward to any update you can provide on EXIM's implementation of these important initiatives, and all provisions included in the December reauthorization."We have discussed in previous Committee hearings, you and your board colleagues faced a number of pending transactions and other matters to address upon taking office."Now that you all have had some time at EXIM, we would like to hear an update on those efforts to address those transactions and matters that had already been in the pipeline, as well as your outreach efforts to bring new American businesses and export and job creation opportunities into the pipeline."Finally, with regard to the COVID-19 global pandemic, we know business and government operations all over the world have been impacted."For an agency such as EXIM, with such a global scope to its mission and operations, we would be interested to hear about the challenges that you and your team have faced, as well as those faced by the American businesses and other stakeholders you work with on a daily basis as part of your mission."And we would ask you to share with us any initiatives EXIM has commenced to assist U.S. exporters in dealing with the challenges of COVID, while remaining competitive, creating jobs and growing our economy."Chairman Reed, thank you again for your considerable efforts, and I look forward to our continued work together on these important efforts."###Load-Date: June 26, 2020End of Document

It has been almost exactly a year since your last appearance before this committee."Today, we will receive testimony on EXIM's recent activities and operations, including your efforts to implement the 7-year reauthorization legislation we enacted last December, as well as your efforts to continue to process through the transactions and other matters in the pipeline at EXIM, and to increase your outreach and efforts to bring new U.S. export opportunities into the pipeline."In addition, we know the disruption of COVID-19 on the U.S. economy has had an impact on U.S. exporters as well, and we will be interested to hear of any efforts and initiatives you are undertaking to address these challenges."Chairman Reed, you have been on the job for a little over a year now."When you came before us for your nomination hearing, and when you met individually with me and with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, you made a commitment that, if confirmed, you would move forward on implementing any outstanding congressionally-initiated reforms, as well as bring your own commitment to greater transparency and accountability for the EXIM bank."As I have since noted in other EXIM-related hearings in this committee, your efforts to follow through on your commitment to transparency, accountability and reform have not gone unnoticed by me and by my colleagues on this committee."I commend you for those efforts and encourage you to continue them."In December 2019, this Congress enacted a 7-year reauthorization of the EXIM Bank, the longest authorization period in the Bank's history."This extension provides much-needed certainty for U.S. exporters and strengthens an important tool for the U.S. to compete directly with China and others in the global marketplace."Included in the legislation is a new initiative, focusing on China and transformational exports, which will reserve a significant portion of EXIM's exposure authority for transactions that will put U.S. exporters in direct competition with China."This program will particularly focus on U.S. exports of innovative technologies, like semiconductor manufacturing, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, wireless communications, renewable energy and energy efficiency and storage, as well as emerging financial technologies."The new law also includes a requirement that, in addition to its existing notification obligations to Congress, EXIM shall consult with the State Department as part of efforts to assess any risk to the national interest for any proposed transaction above $25 million involving any business entity that is controlled by the Chinese government."Our reauthorization legislation also had an important focus on increasing the participation of American small businesses in EXIM projects, by raising the target from 25 percent to 30 percent for small business participation in EXIM-supported exports."Chairman Reed, we look forward to any update you can provide on EXIM's implementation of these important initiatives, and all provisions included in the December reauthorization."We have discussed in previous Committee hearings, you and your board colleagues faced a number of pending transactions and other matters to address upon taking office."Now that you all have had some time at EXIM, we would like to hear an update on those efforts to address those transactions and matters that had already been in the pipeline, as well as your outreach efforts to bring new American businesses and export and job creation opportunities into the pipeline."Finally, with regard to the COVID-19 global pandemic, we know business and government operations all over the world have been impacted."For an agency such as EXIM, with such a global scope to its mission and operations, we would be interested to hear about the challenges that you and your team have faced, as well as those faced by the American businesses and other stakeholders you work with on a daily basis as part of your mission."And we would ask you to share with us any initiatives EXIM has commenced to assist U.S. exporters in dealing with the challenges of COVID, while remaining competitive, creating jobs and growing our economy."Chairman Reed, thank you again for your considerable efforts, and I look forward to our continued work together on these important efforts."Copyright Targeted News ServicesT40-MgEditor-7157146 T40-MgEditorLoad-Date: June 27, 2020End of Document

South Korea reopens schools despite uptick in casesCE Noticias Financieras EnglishJune 3, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 518 wordsBodySEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea on Wednesday reported 49 new cases of COVID-19, continuing a week of infection increases as the government defended its decision to reopen schools despite health risks.Figures announced by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention raised the national total to 11,590 cases and 273 deaths. All but one of the new cases were reported in Seoul's populous metropolitan area, where hundreds of infections have been linked to leisure areas, religious congregations and a huge e-commerce warehouse.Mayors and governors in the capital region have closed thousands of nightclubs, themed bars, karaoke rooms, churches and wedding halls to slow the spread of the virus.Some entertainment venues in Seoul, Incheon and Daejeon began collecting their customers' personal data with QR codes this week so they can easily locate them if necessary, a requirement that will expand across the country on June 10.Despite the uptick in contagion, the government has maintained the gradual reopening of schools, which began on 20 May with high school seniors.Nearly 1.8 million primary, middle and high school pupils returned to class on Wednesday.Keeping schools closed would have been a difficult political decision in a country where teens live in a hypercompetitive environment because graduating from elite universities is considered crucial to their future career. But some critical voices point out that this would have been the right direction of public health, and that the authorities were risking the safety of children and their families.The country kept schools open even during the Korean War between 1950 and 1953, prime minister Chung Sye-kyun noted.Meanwhile, the city of Wuhan, in central China, has conducted diagnostic coronavirus tests on nearly all of its 11 million inhabitants in a massive effort that resulted in the isolation of 300 people, authorities said Wednesday.The pandemic is believed to have originated last year in this industrial city, which was under a strict quarantine to curb contagion. Wuhan still accounts for most of the 83,021 confirmed cases and 4,634 deaths recorded in China.Tests in the second half of May focused on residents who had not yet undergone any, and only excluded children under the age of 6."This is extraordinarily unusual anywhere in the world," Li Lanjuan, an expert with the National Health Commission, told reporters. "Not only does it show confidence and determination in the fight against the epidemic in Wuhan, but it also offers a reference to other cities for prevention."No active cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, were found during the tests, although about 300 people who tested positive for the virus but showed no symptoms were put into isolation.The Chinese government reported four new cases, one arriving from abroad and three added retroactively upon test results.However, the country's total fell in one case to 83,021 after eliminating another five cases retroactively. No further deaths were reported, keeping the death total at 4,634 since the virus was detected late last year.Load-Date: June 4, 2020End of Document

U.K. bans Huawei from its 5G networksiCrowdNewswire (English)July 15, 2020 Wednesday 1:10 AM GMTCopyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 728 wordsBodyBack in January, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that Huawei gear would be allowed in the country s 5G networks. At the time, Johnson felt that he had no choice but to go against the U.S. considering that Huawei provided the most cutting-edge technology at a good price. But the Prime Minister was persuaded by constant pressure ... Continue reading U.K. bans Huawei from its 5G networksBack in January, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that Huawei gear would be allowed in the country s 5G networks. At the time, Johnson felt that he had no choice but to go against    the U.S. considering that Huawei provided the most cutting-edge technology at a good price. But the Prime Minister was persuaded by constant pressure from America and the final blow came when the    U.S. banned chip manufacturers like TSMC from delivering chips to the company. That led officials in Britain to worry that Huawei would be forced to use unproven components that might not be    secure.Huawei gear must be removed from all U.K. networks by 2027So this morning, the prime minister announced that Huawei s networking equipment must be completely removed from the U.K. by 2027. Huawei is the global leader in networking equipment and    depending on the source, it is also the number one smartphone manufacturer on the planet for the moment. But since 2012 Huawei has been deemed a national security threat in the U.S. because of    its close ties to the communist Chinese government. A law in China requires the country s tech firms to gather intelligence on behalf of the government if requested to do so. The myth is that    Huawei products contain a backdoor that collects data and sends it to a server in Beijing. This scenario has never been proven to be true and the firm has denied it over the years. The    announcement that the ban won t be in place until 2027 made U.K. carriers like BT, Vodafone, and Three happy because they were worried about spending billions to rip out Huawei gear from their    networks a lot earlier. According to Reuters, Britain s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Oliver Dowden said that by the end of this year, it will be illegal for companies in the U.K.    to buy any 5G equipment from Huawei. But there is a price that consumers will have to pay for this decision as it delays the rollout of 5G connectivity in the nation by two to three years.    Additionally, the move raises the cost of installing 5G in the market by up to $2.5 billion. Today s announcement also gives telecom firms in the U.K. two years to remove all traces of Huawei    from their fixed-line fiber broadband networks. In a statement, Secretary Dowden said,  The NCSC (National Cyber Security Centre) has now reported to ministers, that they have significantly    changed their security assessment of Huawei s presence in the U.K. s 5G network. This has not been an easy decision, but it is the right one for the U.K. telecoms networks, for our national    security and our economy, both now and indeed in the long run. By the time of the next election, we will have implemented in law an irreversible path for the complete removal of Huawei equipment    from our 5G networks.  With the U.S. imploring allies not to use Huawei equipment to build out their 5G networks, Britain s original decision stunned U.S. officials. And while Australia, New    Zealand, and Japan heeded the warnings from the U.S., Germany did not. Besides concerns about spying, the U.S. is also worried that if Huawei grabs the lead in 5G technology, China will become    the world s technology leader for years. The next generation of wireless conductivity, 5G will deliver download data speeds up to 10 times faster than current 4G LTE signals. The faster speed and    lower latency will allow new technologies and industries to be created. Huawei panned the U.K. s decision calling it  political  and said it was made because of U.S. trade policy and was not due    to issues surrounding security. The company also stated that the decision is bad for phone users in the country.  It threatens to move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen    the digital divide,  a Huawei spokesperson said.See Campaign:https://www.phonearena.com/news/uk-bans-huawei-from-5g-networks_id125934Contact Information:Alan FriedmanTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: August 11, 2020End of Document

Continue reading U.S. tech firms will be allowed to work with Huawei over 5G standardsBack in May, we told you that the Commerce Department was working on a draft of a new rule that would allow U.S. companies to work with Huawei to create 5G standards. After the company was    placed on the Commerce Department s Entity List last year, it was banned from accessing its U.S. supply chain and U.S. firms were not sure what information they were allowed to discuss with the    Chinese manufacturer. As a result, during meetings held with Global telecom firms to discuss 5G standards, engineers working for U.S. companies would stay silent giving Huawei a stronger voice in    the creation of these standards.U.S. amends Entity List rule against Huawei to allow U.S. to participate in meetings to set 5G standardsToday, Reuters reports that U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is calling a new rule that allows the U.S. to work with Huawei in the creation of 5G standards  a clarification.  The rule makes      a change to the Huawei  entity listing  to allow U.S. firms to release certain technology to Huawei and its affiliates if it adds  to the revision or development of a  standard  in a  standards      organization.'  Ross says,  The change is really simply a clarification. It isn t that we re doing something to help Huawei. What we re doing is something to make it easier for global standards      to be symmetrical. This is to help make sure we have ubiquity in 5G. U.S. tech companies are also concerned about whether they can participate in these meetings because they need to have their input in the development of 5G standards heard. Naomi Wilson,    senior director of policy for Asia at the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), which represents companies like Amazon, Intel, and Qualcomm, said,  As we approach the year mark, it is    very much past time that this be addressed and clarified.  Wilson noted that the U.S. wants its companies to be competitive with Huawei  But their policies have inadvertently caused U.S.    companies to lose their seat at the table to Huawei and others on the entity list.  The U.S. put Huawei on the Entity List last year, calling the company a threat to U.S. national security    because of its perceived ties to the communist Chinese government. The plan was to make it very difficult for Huawei to obtain the software and components it needs to produce its handsets and    networking equipment. Not being able to license Google s Mobile Services, Huawei could not allow its phones to run apps like the Google Play Store, Search, Gmail, YouTube, Maps, Drive, and    others. This didn t matter in China where Google banned most of Google s apps anyway, but it did have an impact on Huawei s international units. Still, Huawei managed to increase its phone    shipments last year by 17% to 240 million phones allowing it to surpass Apple and become the world s second-largest smartphone manufacturer. Not happy with these results, the U.S. took things to    the next level last month when it changed an export rule. Foundries that employ U.S. technology to produce semiconductors cannot ship these components to Huawei without obtaining a license from    the U.S. Without cutting-edge chips to use for its phones and 5G base stations, Huawei could have a tough time ahead. Still, the firm is looking for a way around the new rules including one plan    that would allow Samsung to produce 7nm chips for Huawei s 5G base stations in return for some smartphone market share. Secretary Ross says that the national security concerns about Huawei    continue. He states that the spying that Huawei is accused of is a real issue and the U.S. is concerned about the security of its 5G networks. Despite the amendment to the Entity List rules    against Huawei, the global leader in networking equipment is not allowed to participate in the construction of 5G networks in the states.See Campaign:https://www.phonearena.com/news/us-firms-to-work-with-huawei-on-5g-standards_id125384Contact Information:Alan FriedmanTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: August 20, 2020End of Document

HOLLEN STATEMENT ON BOLTON EXCERPTS: IT'S CLEAR THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP PUTS HIMSELF OVER NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS - REPUBLICAN LEADER MCCONNELL MUST STOP AIDING AND ABETTING TRUMP'S BETRAYAL OF OUR COUNTRYUS Fed NewsJune 17, 2020 Wednesday 11:11 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 HT Media Ltd. All Rights ReservedLength: 588 wordsBodyWASHINGTON, June 17 -- Sen. Chris Van Hollen issued the following press release:Today, U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) released the following statement regarding excerpts released from John Bolton's forthcoming book on President Trump's actions related to our national security:"It's clear that President Trump serves one man and one man only. He does not act in the best interests of the American people - but only his own, and he consistently puts his own interests over the national security of the United States. John Bolton should have brought this disturbing information to light much earlier, but now Senate Republicans must act to defend our country from the threats to our national security coming from the President himself.""Over the course of the Trump Presidency, Republican Leader McConnell and this Administration have blocked bipartisan legislation I have introduced that would hold dictators accountable and punish our adversaries for their attacks on our democracy. For any Senate Republicans who thought they could provide cover for Trump, John Bolton has ripped away the mask. President Trump has refused to take meaningful action on Russia, China, and North Korea in order to curry their support for his reelection. This represents a clear and present danger to the United States. Senator McConnell must stop aiding and abetting Trump's betrayal of our country. This has gone much too far."Senator Van Hollen has introduced a number of proposals to hold China accountable, including:* The Hong Kong Autonomy Act, bipartisan legislation introduced by Senators Toomey and Van Hollen to sanction those responsible for the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy and democratic freedoms* The Protecting American Intellectual Property Act, bipartisan legislation introduced by Senators Van Hollen and Sasse to sanction those responsible for the theft of U.S. trade secrets* The NETWORKS Act, bipartisan legislation introduced by Senators Cotton, Schumer, Van Hollen, and Rick Scott to impose sanctions on foreign telecommunications firms producing 5G technology, like Huawei, that engage in industrial espionage or violate U.S. sanctions* The Telecommunications Denial Order Enforcement Act, bipartisan legislation introduced by Senators Cotton and Van Hollen to impose denial orders on foreign telecommunications firms - such as Huawei and ZTE - found to violate U.S. sanctions and export control laws* The True Reciprocity Act, bipartisan legislation introduced by Senators Sullivan and Van Hollen to mandate reporting on the Chinese government's restrictions on * U.S. diplomats, officials, journalists, businesses, and nongovernmental organizations* The ZERO Act, bipartisan legislation introduced by Senators Rubio and Van Hollen to ensure ZTE complies with the terms of its settlement agreement and to impose a denial order if ZTE is found to violate the terms of the agreement* The DETER Act, bipartisan legislation introduced by Senators Van Hollen and Rubio to sanction Russia and other foreign governments that interfere in our elections* All of these bills are bipartisan but have been blocked by the Administration and Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the Republican Leadership.Republicans also blocked Senator Van Hollen's effort to call witnesses in the Senate Impeachment trial, and John Bolton refused to testify in the House Impeachment proceedings.

Continue reading What a speech controversy at Stanford tells us about Facebook s Oversight BoardThe board s co-chairman read a passage containing the N-word during class   and the debate that followed foreshadows the speech debates to comeLet s conclude what turned out to be Free Speech Week on The Interface with a look at a case involving the co-chairman of Facebook s new Oversight Board, a Zoom recording of his law school class, and the N-word.Can you use a racist slur on Facebook? The answer is probably not, but also maybe. The company s community standards prohibit  direct attacks  on people based on their race. But the company also published a blog post in 2017 laying out some of the nuances involved in deciding whether a slur is, in fact, an attack, which often depends heavily on context that goes beyond the written word.Later this year, some of the hardest decisions about whether a post should stay up on Facebook will be made by an independent Oversight Board. The board, whose initial members were announced last month, will allow Facebook and Instagram users to appeal when they believe that their posts have been removed in error. Facebook says it will abide by the board s decisions, and will also ask it to issue advisory opinions on emerging policy questions.In the wake of this week s controversy over President Trump s Facebook posts about nationwide protests, which Twitter and Snap concluded promote violence, some asked the Oversight Board to weigh in. On Wednesday, the board published a somewhat apologetic note explaining why it couldn t: for a bunch of reasons, it just isn t ready.But one of the things we know about the Oversight Board is that its initial members were selected for their commitment to free speech values. Visit the board s website and the first message you see reads:  Ensuring respect for free expression, through independent judgment. In fact, one of the co-chairs of the board was involved in a speech controversy just this week. Here s Nick Anderson in the Washington Post:Stanford University law professor Michael W. McConnell was nearing the end of a course on the creation of the Constitution last week when he decided to read a quote attributed to Patrick Henry from an 18th-century debate in Virginia.But first, McConnell paused the Zoom video recording, according to one of his students, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing backlash. Then the professor read the statement, which he said was intended to stoke racist opposition to ratification of the Constitution.The quote included the n-word. McConnell, who is white, resumed recording and turned to other topics, the student said.The incident took place that same week that global protests against the recent murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, among others, galvanized the country   and brought a heightened sensitivity to ongoing racist oppression in the United States.I spoke with some Stanford law students about McConnell s class, and they told me they found his reading of the N-word painful in part because a similar incident had taken place at the law school in November. Then, a guest lecturer from Stanford s history department read the N-word out loud while discussing racist cigarette marketing. And just last month, another Stanford professor apologized after using a form of the N-word twice while discussing the hip-hop group N.W.A. There is a feeling of exasperation and people just feeling a lot of pain,  said Donovan Hicks, co-president of the Black Law Students Association at Stanford.In his initial note to students, McConnell defended reading what he referred to as  the horrific Henry quotation  out loud:  I do not think history should be stripped of its ugliness. In response, the Black Law Students Association sent a letter complaining about the incident to Stanford law students and faculty.  If there is one thing black students know, it s our own history,  the letter reads.  Ahmaud Arbery is our history. Breonna Taylor is our history. George Floyd is our history. White men refusing to stop saying  n   is our history. The students noted that, in the wake of the November incident, McConnell had written a note to students saying  it is hard for me to see the pedagogical purpose  of using what he called  this most extreme racial epithet known to our language.  He went on:To my mind, political correctness as it exists in the modern university is a problem, because it can stifle discussion and silence minority views. But that does not mean that all standards of civility should be dismissed as examples of  political correctness.  The use of some terms, especially when blatant, intentional, extreme, or devoid of legitimate context, can also stifle discussion and silence minority views. We should not be quick to censure the speech of others, but we should not let worries about freedom of speech and political correctness stop us from condemning what should be condemned.McConnell sent an email to students and faculty May 29th saying he had made the decision to read the passage with  good will,  and noted he had placed the speech in its proper historical context and condemned the use of the words. He said he would not use the word again in class, but stopped short of apologizing.McConnell told the Post he would have no further comment. Jamal Greene, one of the other Oversight Board co-chairs, told Protocol he  might have made a different choice  but did not condemn McConnell. Issie Lapowsky writes:McConnell s co-chair, Jamal Greene, wrote that he has  tremendous respect for [McConnell] as a person and a scholar.  Striking the right tone in surfacing the ugliness of our constitutional history is a difficulty I myself have struggled with,  Greene wrote.  While I might have made a different choice in this instance, I take professor McConnell at his word that he has learned from his experience, as we all must strive to do as educators. This incident seems relevant to anyone looking to understand what the Oversight Board is, and how it might act. When I saw tweets this week from people begging the board to weigh in on Facebook s decision about the Trump posts, the implication was that the board would step in and remove what Facebook would not.In fact, Facebook has said from the beginning that initially the board will only restore posts that the board concludes it has removed in error. Eventually the board will issue opinions on what Facebook ought to take down; one person who is closely involved told me that could come within a few months. But it s not clear any of that will be up and running before, say, the 2020 US presidential election.More than that, though, the McConnell incident   and his co-chairman s reaction to it   helps us understand how the board is likely to see the world. For some vocal subset of Facebook s user base, the primary concern is that the platform allows too much speech. The board s initial makeup and starting assignment reflect that fear that Facebook might not be allowing enough speech.This is, not coincidentally, something Mark Zuckerberg fears. He told employees on Tuesday:Over time in general, we just we tend to add more policies to restrict things more and more. And I think that this, while each one is thoughtful and good and we re articulating specific harms   and I think that s important   I do think that expression and voice is also a thing that routinely needs to be stood up for because it has the property that, you know, when something is uniformly positive, no one argues for taking it down. It s always only when there s something that s controversial. Every time there s something that s controversial, your instinct is,  Okay, let s restrict a lot,  then you do end up restricting a lot of things that I think will be eventually good for everyone.For some, the McConnell classroom incident shouldn t even qualify as an  incident  at all   a professor simply taught history, using the language of history, while condemning it to his students. To others, though, including some of his students, McConnell failed a basic test of empathy: can you avoid using a word you know to be harmful, as a show of support to Stanford s black community and its allies?It all feels related to a question Facebook is being confronted with more and more   and increasingly, by its own employees. Will it be a simple mirror for society, warts and all, or will it put a thumb on the scale for progressive change   including anti-racism? Zuckerberg has long said that, given his near-total control over Facebook as a company, he wants to avoid rigging the company s services in favor of any particular viewpoint. Instead, whenever possible, he hopes to fight bad speech with more speech.McConnell is just one member of the board, which will eventually include 40 members. He won t hear most or even all of the cases brought to the board. And perhaps, as he begins to review cases involving offensive and dangerous speech later, he ll find reason to vote for their removal from Facebook. But until then I ll probably find myself thinking of the decision he made last week   the moment in his Stanford classroom, with protests raging in the world around him, when he shut off his Zoom recording to leave no record of his words.PUSHBACKAfter I wrote about yesterday s decision by Snap to remove Trump from promotion in its Discover tab, a reader asked whether the president had violated policy.  There s a big difference between randomly deciding something is a good idea because it s in a news cycle versus doing it based on a general policy that people under you can do, too,  the reader wrote.I checked in with Snap, and the company said the decision was not based on a violation of Snapchat s community standards. Instead, the decision was based on Spiegel s Sunday memo to his team, which said the company  cannot promote accounts in America that are linked to people who incite racial violence, whether they do so on or off our platform. THE RATIOToday in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.Trending up:AppleCEOTim Cookpublished a blog post to address the senseless killing of George Floyd and the long history of racism.

Disneyland's July Phased Reopening to Nix Character Meet-and-Greets, ParadeNewsweek.comJune 10, 2020 Wednesday 7:42 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 558 wordsByline: Daniel VillarrealHighlight: It's unclear whether the park will require guests to wear facemasks or undergo mandatory temperature checks before entering the park.BodyOn Wednesday, Disney announced plans for a phased reopening of several of its themed California properties, pending approval by the state and local government, but its parades and character meet-and-greets will be temporarily discontinued.As of now, Disney plans to reopen its Downtown Disney District, a walkway of eateries, boutiques and entertainment venues, on July 9; the Disneyland park and Disney California Adventure amusement parks on July 17; and its Grand Californian Hotel & Spa and Paradise Pier Hotel on July 23.The Disneyland theme park will operate at a lowered capacity to help maintain social distancing. Park guests will have to pre-schedule their visits through a new reservation system. The parks will also discontinue character meet-and-greets, parades and nighttime spectaculars to avoid creating large crowds. The parades and meet-and-greets are expected to return at a later date.The park has also put a temporary pause on new ticket sales, annual passport sales and renewals.A Disney spokesperson told Newsweek that the decision whether to require facemasks or mandatory temperature checks at the sites will be shared soon."These policies are under continuous review and are subject to change as we monitor conditions and receive guidance from health and government authorities," the spokesperson said.In a statement on the company's blog, Josh D'Amaro, Chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products said a professional team has helped the park implement new health and safety measures reflecting the guidance of local health and government authorities to ensure the safety of employees and guests. A Guest Experience Team will help explain the new changes and safety measures to guests."As one of the first major theme parks to close our operations and the last to reopen, we have been deliberate about keeping the health and safety of our cast, guests and local communities top of mind," D'Amaro said.Disney has already reopened Shanghai Disneyland, the Disney Springs entertainment complex in Lake Buena Vista, Florida as well as several Disney stores.When Shanghai Disneyland in China reopened its doors on May 11, it required visitors to wear masks and undergo temperature screenings before entering the park and maintained social distancing at restaurants, rides and other facilities.The Chinese government had asked the company to limit the park to 30 percent of capacity (around 24,000 people), but Disney said it expected to reopen at "far below" that number in order to let its employees adjust to the new precautionary measures."The frequency of sanitization measures will be increased in order to augment the standards of cleanliness already in place throughout the park, and hand sanitizers will be available at attractions, restaurants and stores," the company noted at the time.Amid the coronavirus epidemic, Disney reached agreements with the unions for hourly cast members in order to maintain members' health insurance benefits coverage, educational support and additional employee assistance programs during a temporary furlough effective on April 19."These agreements provide an easier return to work when our community recovers from the impact of COVID-19," a Disney spokesperson wrote Newsweek.Update (6/10/2020, 9:30 p.m.):This article has been updated to include comments from Disney.Link to ImageGraphic Disneyland Park California coronavirus COVID-19David McNew/AFPAn employee cleans the grounds behind the closed gates of Disneyland Park on the first day of the closure of Disneyland and Disney California Adventure theme parks as fear of the spread of coronavirus continue, in Anaheim, California, on March 14, 2020.Load-Date: June 10, 2020End of Document

Global Blockchain IoT Market: Growth, Trends and Forecast (2020-2025) - ResearchAndMarkets.comBusiness WireJuly 3, 2020 Friday 8:47 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 1530 wordsDateline: DUBLIN BodyThe "Global Blockchain IoT Market: Growth, Trends and Forecast (2020-2025)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The Global Blockchain IoT Market is expected to grow with a CAGR of 40% over the forecast period 2020-2025.With the rapid development of communication technologies, the Internet of Things is experiencing exponential growth both in research and industry and is getting out of its infancy to maturity phase with the volume of data generated, transmitted and processed but it still suffers from pitfalls such as privacy and security vulnerabilities that is leveraged by the asymmetric cryptography of the blockchain technology.Key Highlights• The traditional IoT systems are powered by centralized topology where data is transmitted from physical devices to cloud where the data is processed using analytics and output is received back to the IoT device, but with the increase of frequency of network devices limits the scalability of the IoT platforms and risk it with vulnerabilities that would eventually compromise users network security and privacy.• For instance, In 2017, the US FDA ( Food and Drug Administration) announced that St Jude Medical' implantable cardiac are vulnerable to hack due to vulnerabilities in the transmitter powered by IoT which were deployed to monitor the patient heart function and control heart attack, Also few of the infamous IoT attacks include Mirai Botnet DDoS attack affected internet service for the entire East Coast of America including Netflix, Reddit, and Twitter.• As with the Blockchain powered by decentralized architecture and cryptographic encryptions leverages the IoT platform by ensuring the privacy and security in a peer-to-peer network. However, it requires high computational power resulting in higher bandwidth overhead and delay• Furthermore, centralized architecture such as cloud model that powers traditional IoT result in latency, high cost and the risk of single point of failure. Blockchain technologies on other hand provide security protocols and infrastructure that enable billions of IoT devices to have trusted interoperability for both data and commerce.• The Financial institutions and other major companies are usually are inherently slow in adopting any new technology but Banks and Financial institutes such as HSBC, Deutsche Bank, ING that are exploring the potential of blockchain technology added with the flexibility IoT open up innumerable use cases to run smart operation leveraging the everyday devices equipped with sensors and thereby achieve more efficiency.• With the rapid growth of urbanization and government initiatives across the world foster the demand for smart cities. The smart cities are entitled to problems such as high operation cost of the data center, poor security of IoT, equipment maintenance among others. However, technologies such as blockchain IoT would provide the necessary infrastructure for transaction management, asset tracking, smart contracts while ensuring security and transparency and thereby increasing the operational efficiency• For instance, smart city developers such as Hancom Group announced that its 470 acres smart city project Gapyeong Malang Malang Smart Ecosystem will be incorporating blockchain as the basis for development.Market TrendsSmart City End-users to Hold a Major Market Share• Over the last few decades, the world has experienced unparalleled urban growth majorly due to an increase in population, scarcity of resources and climate changes. According to the United Nations, about 54% of people dwell in cities and is expected to reach 66% by 20250. To cope up with urban growth government bodies are focusing on modern technologies such as IoT, wireless communication, blockchain aiming to reduce cost and use resources optimally• For instance, the Netherlands deployed IoT infrastructure in Amsterdam to regulate and monitor the city' energy usage, traffic flow and safety real-time• Data security is one of the vital constraints for devices and services deployed in a metropolitan city, which leveraged with the blockchain's decentralized platform ensures the trust of the public and hence, fosters the growth of the market.• Also, Government initiatives around the world are starting to appreciate the potential of blockchain as it provides the infrastructure necessary for transaction management while ensuring transparency and security which stands to be critical elements in smart city implementation.• For instance, In 2015, India has pioneered to openly enact smart city mission across 12 cities with Government approved tender amounting to INR 1,62,000 Cr under this programme. Additionally, Government recently announced will be reported report card for the 100 selected smart cities in June 2020Asia-Pacific to Witness the Highest Growth• The Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow at the highest rate over the forecast period owing to the rising influx of technology companies in the region coupled with the increasing investment in IoT technology, Smart City deployments, Government initiative and growth of urban population, the region is expected to boost the market growth rate.• For instance, In November 2019, Hyperchain, a blockchain firm announced that China' State Grid Corporation accepted its bid for a blockchain solution to leverage the Internet of things ( IoT) capabilities as a part of its procurement program.• Also, In February 2020 Chinese central government issued the CCP Central Committee and State Council Opinions Concerning Effectively Seizing Key Work in the Three Agricultures' Sphere featuring the application advance technologies such as IoT, Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence to Chinese Agriculture.• In August 2019, Reliance, a leading Indian multinational conglomerate company announced its plan to introduce Blockchain network with emphasis on modernizing agriculture, supply chain at its annual general meeting, The plan is aimed to be delivered by August 2020 and is hoped to capable of fulfilling thousand of node operations added with smarty city initiatives by the government are expected to drive the growth of IoT market.Competitive LandscapeThe Blockchain IoT market is highly competitive owing to the presence of many large and small players in the market operating in the domestic as well as in the international market. The market appears to be fragmented due to the presence of many technological giants in the market. Key strategies adopted by the major players in the market are product innovation and mergers and acquisitions. Some of the major players in the market are Cisco Systems, Google, IBM Corporation, and Microsoft Corporation among others.Recent Developments• October 2019 - IBM announced a new supply chain service based on its blockchain platform and its recently acquired Red Hat open-source software, This service enables developers to integrate legacy data systems on to the distributed ledger with the help of open APIs. The end-users such as distributors, manufacturers, and retailers would seamlessly be able to integrate the data from sources such as IoT sensor systems onto Hyperledger so as to track products throughout the supply chain in realtime.• September 2019 - Linux Foundation announced that it seeks to closely integrate with IOTA Foundation to further leverage LF Edge table. This open colloboration leads the development of LF Edge framework which is an open-source stack of Cloud interoperability, IoT edge with distributed ledger technologies and help the company to leverage its stack of technologies to advance its development approach towards interoperable solution for IoT, Cloud and Edge integration.Key Topics Covered1 INTRODUCTION1.1 Study Deliverables1.2 Study Assumptions1.3 Scope of the Study2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY4 MARKET DYNAMICS4.1 Market Overview4.2 Market Drivers4.3 Market Restraints4.4 Value Chain / Supply Chain Analysis4.5 Porters 5 Force Analysis4.6 Assessment of Impact of COVID-19 on the Industry5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 Offering5.1.1 Hardware5.1.2 Software5.1.3 Infrastructure5.2 Application5.2.1 Data security5.2.2 Smart Contracts5.2.3 Data Communication5.2.4 Asset Tracking & Management5.2.5 Other Application5.3 End-user5.3.1 Manufacturing5.3.2 Energy-utility5.3.3 Transportation & Logistics5.3.4 Building Management5.3.5 Retail5.3.6 Smart City5.4 Geography5.4.1 North America5.4.1.1 US5.4.1.2 Canada5.4.2 Europe5.4.2.1 Germany5.4.2.2 UK5.4.2.3 France5.4.2.4 Rest of Europe5.4.3 Asia-Pacific5.4.3.1 India5.4.3.2 China5.4.3.3 Japan5.4.3.4 Rest of Asia-Pacific5.4.4 Latin America5.4.5 Middle East and Africa6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE6.1 Vendor Market Share6.2 Mergers & Acquisitions6.3 Company Profiles6.3.1 IBM Corporation6.3.2 Intel Corporation6.3.3 Microsoft Corporation6.3.4 Cisco Systems Inc.6.3.5 Amazon Inc.6.3.6 Robert Bosch GmbH6.3.7 The Linux Foundation6.3.8 KrypC Technologies6.3.9 Ethereum Foundation6.3.10 R3 LLC6.3.11 IoTA6.3.12 Waltonchain7 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND FUTURE TRENDSFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/5o1joxView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200703005040/en/CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.comLaura Wood, Senior Press Managerpress@researchandmarkets.comFor E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900http://www.businesswire.comLoad-Date: July 3, 2020End of Document

REP. ADRIAN SMITH: SECURING KEY RESOURCES FOR OUR MILITARYStates News ServiceJuly 27, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 536 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Nebraska Rep. Adrian Smith:July 27, 2020ColumnBecause of social distancing measures we have undertaken, the world may seem like it is at a standstill. However, the forces aligned against America never rest. Thankfully neither does our military. In order to ensure America's Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force are able to meet their missions, every year, Congress enacts legislation to authorize our military funding and establish priorities for the Department of Defense. This year pandemic or not was no different. On July 21, the House of Representatives passed the 60th annual National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 6395), commonly known as the NDAA, with broad bipartisan support.I supported this bill because especially during difficult times, we need our nation's military to be at its best. We live in a world where many nations and other actors stand against our values of political freedom, economic opportunity, religious freedom, and property rights an aggressive China, a dangerous Iran, and the ever present face of terrorism are just a few of them. To counter these threats posed by our most dangerous enemies, H.R. 6395 commits the United States to deterrence through nuclear modernization. Since World War II, the cornerstone of our defense policy has been nuclear deterrence. This deterrence is less effective as our nuclear capabilities age. Modernizing our nuclear arsenal is essential to ensuring our military remains the sole superpower, and thus will never have to resort to using these weapons.In addition to nuclear deterrence, America's defense relies on recognizing emerging threats. China's concerning conduct during the pandemic has shown they are not to be trusted. China's aggressive expansion in the pacific region, along with continued espionage against America's citizens, industries, and military reveal the depth of the threat. The Chinese government has also been spending massive amounts of money researching artificial intelligence (AI) with the goal of overtaking the United States in that area. For this reason, H.R. 6395 moves to establish the Indo-Pacific Deterrence Initiative to develop key relationships in the region into a united front against this aggression.While ensuring our troops are adequately provisioned and trained is important, there is much more to ensuring readiness than building airplanes and ships and provisioning supplies. Behind the men and women in our military, are the military families who sacrifice as well. Because we cannot and must not forget them, H.R. 6395 includes a significant pay increase for our troops, along with the legislative text of the Military Family Readiness Act. This legislation would confirm our commitment to military families by ensuring needed medical care and child care is available to families at the bases where they are stationed.The world is a better place with the United States at full strength. It is up to us to maintain this balance. The brave men and women who put on the uniform deserve our full support, and I am glad this NDAA bill will be able to make their lives a little easier.

Good Thursday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, July 16th.Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.High profile hack. Scammers taking hold of top Twitter accounts like Elon Musk, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, even Kanye West in what is being called a coordinated attack to scam bitcoin. Twitter shares are sliding roughly 7 percent this morning on this news as CEO Jack Dorsey laments a tough day yesterday for the platform.Earnings season rolling on this morning. We have heard from bank of America, Johnson & Johnson and Morgan Stanley. All three companies this morning reporting better-than-expected quarterly results.Despite good earnings, futures are in the red however. We are standing by for retail sales and initial jobless claims this morning out in about a half an hour.Right now the Dow futures are down 159 points. The Nasdaq futures down 136. And the S&P futures lower by 20 capping a four-day winning streak.Stocks edged higher yesterday. Investor optimism over a COVID-19 vaccine pushed markets into the green. The Dow posting a fourth day of gains in a row with a gain of 227 points at 4:00 on Wall Street yesterday.Well, a blocking spree underway. Find out why model Chrissy Teigen had to block more than one million people on Twitter.And then drink it up. How moderate alcohol consumption could protect against cognitive decline.Plus aging gracefully, a new study this morning shows the difference in aging between men and women. It is not just longevity. Wait until you hear this.MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.European markets on the decline this morning, take a look. The FT 100 down 24. The CAC 40 down 38. And the DAX index down 78. The European Central bank out with news deciding to leave interest rates unchanged. It is also keeping its stimulus -- monetary stimulus steady as a result. No movement in markets this morning. It is exactly where we were from the ECB.We will wait to see any headlines from the ECB coming out after that meeting this morning.In Asia overnight, red across the board despite the Chinese government releasing data showing that China's economy actually expanded in the second quarter. It grew 3.2 percent after a sharp contraction in the first quarter of nearly 7 percent.Joining the conversation this morning is Mark Tepper, Liz Peek and Matt Schlapp. Great to see everybody this morning.MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: Great to be with you.LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Great to be here, Maria.MARK TEPPER, PRESIDENT, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS: Good morning.Some of the top stories that we are watching right now.Twitter investigating a coordinated attack overnight, targeting several high-profile accounts using the company's own employee tools. Joe Biden, former President Obama, Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett -- all among those targeted. Their Twitter accounts were hacked with a link to a bitcoin wallet for users to send money with the promise of getting more money back. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey says the company will share everything it can when it knows more about the nature of this attack.Coronavirus deaths have now topped 137,000 in United States as cases in U.S. now near 3.5 million, most of any country. The CDC reported nearly 61,000 new cases just yesterday alone. Nearly half of those came from Florida, Arizona and Texas.

In Alabama face coverings must be worn in public and when not social distancing. In Montana, masks are required in certain indoor spaces and for outdoor activities. But in Georgia the governor is banning cities and counties from requiring face coverings.Meanwhile more retailers are requiring shoppers to wear masks in their stores. Kohl's, Kroger, Walmart, Sam's Club -- all mandating face coverings beginning next week. this moves comes as the National Retail Federation is pushing for a nationwide mask policy.Well, body cam footage leading up to George Floyd's death has now been released. However, the judge is only allowing it to be viewed by appointment only. The footage, taken from the cameras of formers officers Thomas Lane and J. Keung shows Floyd yelling "I can't breathe" more than 20 times as former officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd's neck.It comes as Floyd's family has filed a lawsuit against the city of Minneapolis and its police department. The lawsuit alleges that the department trained its officers in quote "warrior training" and encourages the use of deadly force in non deadly circumstances.Well, reopening America seems to be job one right now for the country. The coronavirus causing a major shake-up across the country, changing how we live, changing everything. While there is optimism over vaccines and treatments, spikes in some areas across the country are rolling back reopening plans especially with schools set to begin in just two weeks time.Joining me right now, Louisiana Congressman and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise.Congressman, it's great to see you. Thanks very much for joining us.REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), HOUSE MINORITY WHIP: Always good to be back with you, Maria.BARTIROMO: So most schools are not opening for about a month. So we've got a couple of weeks. We've got the beginning of starting to get back to school. But really, the school is supposed to open within about four weeks.What is your take on getting schools open? Do you see the -- do you see children needing to go back this fall, or do you think we need to watch the science?SCALISE: Children need to go back to school be in the classroom with their teachers, Maria. This is something that we've got to commit ourselves to making happen. There are safe ways to do it.I was with the vice president just a few days ago in Baton Rouge, and we had the systems of the LSU system, the Southern University system, working together. They've got different protocols that they're putting out so that the students can safely come back to school.In Louisiana, all of our post -- our higher ed schools are going to be open. Our K-12 schools are working right now on plans to reopen. And every state needs to be putting together their plans. Not saying whether or not to do it but working to figure out how to do it safely, share that data with other states.But ultimately, get it done because the kids need to be in the classroom. We're seeing a lot of pediatric studies that show the damage that was done to children by not being able to go back to school at the end of the semester last spring. We got to work to get this done. We can get it done - -BARTIROMO: Right.SCALISE: -- and that is where our focus needs to be.BARTIROMO: So Congressman, do you think there should be funds in a new stimulus package in order to target schools in particular if they need help?You aren't (ph) going to go back for a couple of weeks, and then Congress leaves again on August -- in August. Do you think you will be able to get another stimulus package done before you leave for the next recess?SCALISE: I know that there are a lot of negotiations. And whether or not there will be another package is still yet to be determined. But you know look, whatever we do has to continue to be focused on helping people safely get back to work, helping schools safely reopen.There are a lot of federal dollars, hundreds of billions of federal dollars that are still out there that we've already appropriated. It may be a reallocation or continuing to tweak like what we did with the PPP just a few weeks ago, where we took existing money and made it more flexible for businesses that are reopening. That's something that we can look.Maybe even more choice for kids in education if their -- if their school's not reopening and there are other schools that are reopening. They ought to have that flexibility so that parents can send their kids to a school that is going to be able to safely take care of their kid.And there are a lot of other reasons why schools need to reopen. It's not just for the educational health of those kids, but there is a lot of mental health that is involved in it. And then you also -- you've got parents that are working and sending their kids to school. You are also making it harder for those parents to go back to work as well.So there are a lot of reasons why we need to say, look, this country has done great things. I mean we've taken on many challenges in the past, and we've tackled them because we said, let's figure out how to get it done --BARTIROMO: Yes.SCALISE: -- not whether or not to get it done.And that's our -- that is what our attitude has to be. We have to serve our children. And we have to be focused on serving them. It would be a cop-out to say it is too hard, so we are just going to have kids --BARTIROMO: Yes.SCALISE: -- stay at home learning again. That is not -- that is not an acceptable answer.BARTIROMO: How will voters -- Congressman, how will voters react to this? We are on countdown to the November election, about 100 days.New polls showing majority of voters backing former vice president Joe Biden. He's leading President Trump by 11 points in the latest "Wall Street Journal"/NBC News poll and 15 points in the latest Quinnipiac poll. President Trump's approval there 36 percent.And Biden came out with his economic plan this week, and it was about raising taxes, spending $2 trillion on a green plan. If Elizabeth Warren is his economic voice, we're likely to see a wealth tax as well. So anything you have in the bank, you also get taxed.Are people responding to this?SCALISE: Well, thank goodness that Joe Biden is going to, you know, have to come out of the basement at some point and let people know what he would do as president, because the contrast has never been sharper.What President Trump did, to take an economy that was sluggish because of the Biden policies and turn it around and make it hottest economy in the world, President Trump did it once. We're now are obviously at a different place because of COVID-19. But who better to bring that economy back than President Trump?And then go -- go look at what Joe Biden rolled out on his energy plan. I mean, Maria, you know energy as well as anybody. We had a great energy plan. We were the -- one of the -- the dominant leader in energy production before COVID. And we're going to be again by the way.Joe Biden's plan brings us back to those policies of 10 years ago. And I called it Solyndra on steroids, because it was Joe Biden who was the father of the Solyndra, the failed $535-million taxpayer subsidy to an energy company that failed because it was crony capitalism at its worst.That's what Joe Biden wants to do now, not with $500 million of your tax dollars, but with $2 trillion. That is not the direction we need to go. Higher energy costs are not what we need.President Trump has got a proven record on energy and on the economy. And frankly the economy, Maria, I think is going to still be the biggest issue come November. It's not today, we are focused on getting through this pandemic. The president has done -- what the president has done with Operation Warp Speed, we're closer than we ever have at -- not only therapies that are proven --BARTIROMO: Yes.SCALISE: -- but also a vaccine possibly being ready, which is never -- unheard of for any kind of disease to be this close because of what President Trump has done with Operation Warp Speed.BARTIROMO: Yes. Congressman, I want to ask you about mail-in voting, because a super PAC working to elect Joe Biden has launched a $24-million initiative to boost vote by mail-in swing states. That same group already announced a $32-million effort to register new voters.Your thoughts on mail-in voters. How much of this election will be mail-in?SCALISE: I think you're seeing an increased participation in mail-in voting, and every state gives voters a lot of different options right now to vote.But I still see a lot of desire for people to want to in-person vote. There is just something unique about going to the polls and going into the voting booth and casting your vote. And that option ought to be there for people as well.So you know, look, this is America. We like choices. But ultimately, I think you are going to see large numbers of people participating in this election. I think, by the way, the eight million Trump voters who didn't show up two years ago because Donald Trump wasn't on they ballot, they're going to be showing up in this election. And that is going to bode well for President Trump and Vice President Pence's reelection.And look, those people are the forgotten men and women in states like Pennsylvania where Joe Biden wants to ban fracking. It's not only Elizabeth Warren heading up his economic plan with all of this class warfare, but it's also AOC heading up his energy plan with things like the Green New Deal and solar panels on airplanes and all this foolishness.BARTIROMO: I have wondered if he wanted to name AOC his environmental head, because I mean obviously they all want jobs in the campaign. Elizabeth Warren wants to be Treasury secretary. So we'll keep watching --(CROSSTALK)SCALISE: Yes --BARTIROMO: Congressman, it's good to see you --(CROSSTALK)SCALISE: Joe Biden -- Joe Biden ought to name his secretaries and show who he would have running his government. Good being with you.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly, so that people understand the administration that they are getting.Congressman Steve Scalise, it is good to see you, sir. Take good care.Quick break and then we've got a lot more coming up.We're looking at markets. We are waiting initial jobless claims and retail sales due out in about 15 minutes' time. Could be a market mover.And then blocking spree underway for model Crissy Teigen. She cut off more than 1 million people on Twitter. This is another setback for the social media platform following that massive hack.You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Markets are under pressure this morning. Take a look at futures indicating a decline of 170 points right out of the gate this morning on the Dow. The Nasdaq down 127. And the S&P down 20 points right now.We are on standby for some key economic data out this morning. We'll get retail sales for the last month along with initial jobless claims for the last week. they are out in 15 minutes' time, 8:30 a.m. Eastern.Joining me right now to talk about the state of business today is BNP Paribas U.S.A. CEO Jean-Yves Fillion. Jean-Yves, it is always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for being here..: Maria, thank you so much for having me.BARTIROMO: Characterize what you are seeing right now in terms of your own employees and your own customers working from home. Is it working? When are you expecting us to go back to normalization, Jean-Yves?FILLION: Well, you know Maria, at BNP Paribas in the United States, we have a lot of platform (ph). We have 14,000 people across retail and wholesale activities. We've been mostly working from home, over 90 percent of the staff today is still working from home.However, we've started asking some of our colleagues to come back, the ones who work in the key critical areas like general trading and clearing and payments. But it's going to be very gradual.You know, we started phase one 10 days ago. You would look at the (INAUDIBLE) today, you know this building pretty well, it's very different. We asked people to be tested and we test all staff, the staff we asked to come back.We do and conduct temperature screening. If I were to take you to the floors, a lot (ph) of floors and trading floors all very different as well. You know, we have Plexiglas dividers. We don't have inter -- comingling across the floors. And you see we all have to wear and respect social distancing.But it's going to be gradual, Maria. Don't expect more than 15 percent of the staff --BARTIROMO: Yes.FILLION: -- back in the corporate offices over the summer months. And then we access (ph) based on the pandemic case.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, it depends.So what is state of business then, Jean-Yves. We've heard from a number of your colleagues in the banking sector this week, talking about putting -- increasing number of dollars aside for loan losses that they are expecting later on in the year. What is your take on all of that? Can you assess your own business right now in that regard?FILLION: Well, as you know, Maria, I am in the -- at BNP Paribas, in the black out period until we publish our research by month's end. But I can definitely give you a sense of what I see.You know, the banking sector and BNP Paribas, we've been very active supporting clients but when the level of activity has been very high because, you know, clients have been very, very busy. Just to give you a sense.In Europe, you know, which is the home field of BNP Paribas, through May (ph), we've extended an additional $200 billion of funding, financing to European clients through bonds and loans and equity markets. We've underwritten 60 percent of the loans (AUDIO GAP) market there and over 50 percent of the high rate bond markets.You know, this is the level of activity we've been experiencing here in the United States. We followed exactly the same trend, supporting our corporate clients, full funding, full access to capture the markets, as well as times of volatility, obviously we've been very active advising on hedging strategies.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you this. The ECB opted to keep interest rates unchanged this morning. Emergency coronavirus stimulus program unchanged while it monitors the economic strength of the Eurozone. We're all monitoring how business is changing right now, Jean-Yves.I want to get your take on real estate. This is also an important point in terms of your own business. People feel that with real estate is going to change, people will not want to go into high-rise buildings anymore. You have lot of commercial real estate on the cutting room floor, what will happen to that? How do you see real estate right now?FILLION: Well, you know it is really what you've been covering very well in your show, Maria. The combination of the pandemic and the digitization of the economy and of the business is really leading businesses across, you know, all verticals (ph), to make some significant adjustment, and some of these things will be longstanding.What first is, what we just discussed, you know, working from home. It's probably here to stay. It is beneficial to employees, as you know. It's less commuting, it's more time spent in the communities and we have been extremely efficient doing so.Then the consequence of that is we see commercial real estate footprints, you know, from big corporate in the dense urban areas to significant change. You will know the trend here which as to be mentioned is business traveling.As we've been doing things so much, you know, digitally including today, by the way, I wish I was in your studio like we always do and face-to-face. I love that. But it has been quite efficient. Then the companies will look at business traveling in a very different way we'll think twice before flying, understanding we can do things very, you know, effectively.BARTIROMO: All right. Jean-Yves, thank you and your colleagues for supporting liquidity as you are, $150 billion plus loans out the door.Jean-Yves Fillion, it's good to see you this morning, sir. Thank you so much. CEO of BNP Paribas.We will be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Mail-in ballot worries. The U.S. Postal Service scrambling to fix issues plaguing this year's primaries to prepare for the upcoming election in November. The U.S. Postal Service sending advice and checklists to election officers across the country recommending voters request ballots no later than 15 days ahead of election, sending them in a week ahead of time.Matt Schlapp will these efforts be enough to avoid fraud. AG Barr says mail-in voting opens the door to massive fraud.SCHLAPP: Yes. And Maria, that is exactly right. There's nothing wrong with voting by mail when an individual requests an absentee or early vote because they have an excused absence from voting on Election Day. But if you can go to the grocery store to get your food, you can show up to vote in person.And what they're doing is the opposite of the absentee ballots. They're literally pushing in some of these localities and states, pushing every name on the voter rolls, pushing them the ability to vote by mail and saying they must vote by mail.These lists (ph) are dirty, filled with fraud and this will put the whole question about the election results with a big question mark.BARTIROMO: All right.we've got some economic data on the other side of this break. The jobless claims and retail sales right after this.Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, July 16th.We are standing by for initial jobless claims and June retail sales.Let's take a look at markets ahead of these breaking news numbers this morning. It is just before 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.Dow Jones is right now down 161 points. This is pretty much near the lows of the morning. The Nasdaq Futures are down 125 and the S&P Futures down 20 points right now. The numbers that we're looking at encapsulate the last week in terms of unemployment benefits and the last month in terms of retail sales.The retail sales expectation is for a gain for the month of 5 percent but it is much better than expected. Let's get right to Cheryl Casone with the numbers we're looking at a very strong retail sales report this morning, Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: We are and I'm going to start with that because it is much stronger than expected and really this was the second biggest report that we got for the week so the month over month number, the estimate was for a jump of 5 percent. We got a 7.5 percent jump for June retail sales.That's actually very strong. If you strip out autos, you get a - the estimate was a jump of 5 percent, we got 7 percent there and they're also saying so 7 percent versus - 7.5 percent versus 5 percent. Now this is not as strong as May, I want to be clear because we got 17.7 percent for the month of May so we're not getting back to that blockbuster number that we had last month.Also, we're looking at initial jobless claims coming through right now, Maria and for the weekly initial jobless claims, the estimate was for 1.25 million. We're coming in at 1.3 million so a little bit of a game. Now, that means that we are down from the prior - actually we're in line with the prior number from last week.So this may or may not be a fall from last week. It might be just really in line. This now takes us though well above 50 million for these initial jobless claims since we got those in mid- March. We are now again this is another 1.3 million on top of the 49.98 million that we already had.All right, looking back to continuing claims, we're looking at a 17.33 million number for continuing claims. That is a little bit better than expected. Continuing claims was supposed to be 17.6 million, 17.33 million for continuing claims, that's the week ending July 4th.The estimates were - that's kind of towards the top end of the range, I want to say and then looking at again the initial claims, almost the top end of the range from an economist, we are getting better at this, I got to say at this point.Looking at the Philadelphia Fed by the way, I'm just going to throw this in for July. Better than expected, it came in at 24.1 and the estimate was for 20 and this is manufacturing in eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware and South Jersey. So again, we're looking at these numbers and a slight revision for the week ending July 4, 1.31 million on initial claims.Lot of data is crossing, Maria. Obviously as you can see, a little bit of a loss on the Dow, not a big one for the amount of economic data that we just threw at all of our viewers, I got to say the markets are kind of holding on here, Maria. So that's where we're at.But again, the retail sales number was the big one. Big one for today that we were looking at, much better than expected, Maria.BARTIROMO: All right Cheryl, thank you so much. 7.5 percent. You would have thought, would have improved these markets in fact we are seeing worsening. Dow Futures, now down 180 points. The NASDAQ is down 134. S&P, down 21.Joining me right now is Allianz Chief Economic Adviser Mohamed El-Erian and Mohamed, it's always a pleasure to see you. Your reaction to this economic data that we're just getting this morning. 7.5 percent retail sales, certainly makes you feel like we are in recovery mode, when it comes to retail and jobs.MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER, ALLIANZ: Yes Maria. These numbers shows you both what's possible and what we should be worried about. Possible came from retail sales. This economy can take off very quickly if it has a green light but unfortunately that's the June data. The July data is not going to be as good. Why?Because we know that certain states either halted their reopening or went back and you starting to pick that up in the jobless claims. Jobless claims is what we should worry about. The number came in higher than expected. It didn't really improve from last week and I worry that next week maybe even worse.So you know, on the one hand, there's a lot to hope for if we get the health issue right. On the other hand, it's too early to feel comfortable because the unemployment problem is still there.BARTIROMO: So you know, Larry Kudlow joined me a couple weeks ago and said that we should expect a 20 percent growth story for the second half of the year. Do you believe that? Do you think we will see a snap back in the third and fourth quarter?EL-ERIAN: It all depends on the health picture. I'm worried about two things. One is our inability as yet to open up in a healthy manner which means that it would like a pendulum, swinging around, trying to find an equilibrium point to live with Covid because unfortunately, that's what we have to do until we get a vaccine or community immunity.The second thing I'm worried about, keep an eye on the big companies. We're getting announcement after announcement of big companies looking to lay off people. Yesterday, it was American Airlines. It was 25,000 and I'm worried that we're going to migrate up in the layoffs on the small and medium sized company to the large one so I would hope for what Larry is talking about but I think it's going to be heavy going forward, unfortunately.BARTIROMO: Let me bring in Mark Tepper. Go ahead, Mark.TEPPER: Hey Mohamed so I read your - your comments about this being a liquidity driven rally and how dangerous that could be and the retail investors really being front and center. How much are apps like Robin Hood and other apps like that, how much are they impacting what we're seeing in the market right now?EL-ERIAN: In a huge way, Mark and in two ways. One is they were using the barrier to entry. You can go out now and buy for example for $5, you can buy a small proportion of loss of shares so we are reducing the barriers to retail investors and secondly, Robin Hood in particular is talking to millennials in a way that they like to being talked to.Don't get me wrong. It is a good thing that we get broader retail participation. We want this market to be deeper and we want society to have a buy-in to the market system but I worry a little bit that that chasing the market higher and higher, hopefully I'll be wrong, because the last thing we want is a whole new set of investors getting burned in the first entry into the market.BARTIROMO: Yes, that have never seen a selloff by the way or have never seen a recession. What do you think's going on with these markets recently? I mean even with the cautious news on the pandemic Mohamed, we're near record highs and yet this morning, we get good news on retail sales and we see the market worsened down almost 200 points right here.EL-ERIAN: Yes, day to day is hard but I think Maria, if you step back, there's two very strong factors in play. One is the ability to look through the short term and the hope that a vaccine is coming and also let's not forget that the U.S. economy is incredibly robust structurally and can come back quickly.The second is just liquidity. Central Bank liquidity and today we heard from the ECB, if they are going to be flat out still, the Fed is giving every indication that it will be supportive of market liquidity and the retail investors. So I think of this as a liquidity driven market.It is hoping for a destination that comes rather quickly and that's what I'm worried about so the big question is going to be do we have enough liquidity to continue ignoring corporate, economic and corporate fundamentals.BARTIROMO: Sure. Liz Peek.PEEK: Mohamed, question. I'm struck by the fact that almost every read on the economy, whether it's consumer sentiment or the PMI numbers or today's retail sales are always better than expected, at least over the last couple of months, that's been the case.I would think that means that earnings also for the second quarter are going to be better than expected. Terrible probably. Yes, but better than expected. Won't that help the market?EL-ERIAN: It should help the market and you're getting two phenomena. If you remember March, April, we got hit very hard and we all underestimated how hard that hit was. May, June, we bounced back much faster than people expected so you know, the error was on both sides and I think that that has to do with models that are not able to capture this historic shock.In terms of earnings, my gut feeling is that we're going to look through them again. We're going to say unfortunately these are dated. These days a lot happens just from one day to another as you read - as you report so well every day. So I think the market place is going to say, that's great, yes, it's better than expected but what about the third quarter? What about the fourth quarter?BARTIROMO: Yes, so how do you want to allocate capital amidst all of this uncertainty?EL-ERIAN: You know the last three to four weeks, I have been cautious and wrong. I've been cautious because despite there being some really attractive companies in terms of themes and by that I mean strong balance sheets, the world is coming to them and the themes are good, the valuations are high.So I have been overly cautious and I remain cautious because evaluations, don't get me wrong, there's a lot to like in various companies here. It's just that valuations have gone really far, really fast.BARTIROMO: Yep, for sure. All right, Mohamed, it's good to get your insights this morning. Thanks so much Sir. Good to see you.EL-ERIAN: Thank you for having me. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Thank you Mohamed. Mohamed El-Erian. Coming up pour yourself another glass. Why Happy Hour may actually be good for your health? We're going to take a look at that. And then this supermodel Chrissy Teigen cutting off 1 million Twitter users. What sparked this blocking spree? You're watching Morning with Maria live on Fox Business.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Happy Hour may actually be good for your health, now we're learning. A new study from the University of Georgia finds low to moderate alcohol consumption can help prevent cognitive decline. Joining us right now is Dr. Jennifer Caudle and Jennifer, it is great to see this morning. What did you make of this study?We've been talking about it all morning, wanting to get your advice here.DR. JENNIFER CAUDLE, FAMILY PHYSICIAN: Absolutely right. I think definitely it's an interesting study. You know alcohol has a mixed relationship with science and our health. That's for sure. There have been many studies that have suggested that alcohol, excessive alcohol can be problematic to our health in terms of cardiovascular disease.But they have also been studies that have said you know, low to moderate drinking can actually be helpful, not only with the way we think but other things as well.This study wanted to see really what the deal is and by the way, I should say there have been studies and said no, it doesn't help with cognition so that's why I say, it's mixed. Researchers here look at 20,000 people, the mean age was around 61 years old. Followed them for nine years and asked them about their drinking habits, asked them about sort of questions that would assess how well they sort of think and remember and things like that.What researchers found was that compared to non-drinkers, those who were low to moderate drinkers actually had better - better cognitive scores in terms of memory and things like that and they had a lower rate of decline of their condition as well. So this study seems to suggest that perhaps low to moderate drinking can be potentially beneficial to cognition.BARTIROMO: All right, Matt Schlapp wants in. Go ahead Matt.MATT SCHLAPP, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, this is I think it's part of the frustration Americans and people around the globe have with medical science generally. It seems like there are studies that show one side and then show the other side. How many years into the future will we understand what could have stopped coronaviruses? Is it a similar kind of dynamic where studies decades from now will tell us what we did that was helpful, what was harmful?CAUDLE: You know, that's an excellent question. I think that's one of the concerns that I and my colleagues have about Covid-19 is how long is it going to take for us to really understand what's going on. I can tell you that literally on the ground, I'm part of many physicians group, my physician colleagues, we're talking all the time and there are advances in information that we are gathering from Covid and really putting into use on a daily basis.So in real time, this disease is being studied. There are studies literally coming out of Italy, other countries, our own country. We've seen many of them so we are working feverishly to get as much data and information we possibly can but I will say that this is going to take a long time to really understand the full scope with this and it's one thing I need to say regarding that.So one of the reasons why information about how many cases we have, where they are, who they are happening and that information needs to be transparent and available to the public. We need public access to this information to really fully be able to study it so that we learn as quickly as possible about this disease.BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a really good point. All right, Dr. Caudle, we've been talking all morning about aging. Women and men don't age, you know they just age differently. They don't age the same.CAUDLE: That's right.BARTIROMO: Their bodies also change in opposite ways, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. Talk to us about how men and women age differently.CAUDLE: Yes, so women and men are not the same. In many ways we are very, very different also with aging as well. We know first of all, that women tend to outlive men but there have been a number of studies over the years that have suggested that men and women have different immune function, have different brain function, other system, cellular structure even could be different between the two and you know with Covid you know, bringing that into the picture, we have also seen studies and data suggesting that Covid maybe more severely affected by Covid.So that's even a gender difference, shall we say with the real time disease that we're dealing with which is Covid. We know that there are still social and cultural and sort of environmental factors that go into how genders age, men and women tend to have different roles in different societies.So that probably makes a difference as well. I think for me, what's really important for us to take home from this is that men and women are not the same. We are different. There are gender related health differences but it's also another reason why we need just as many women as we have men in the studies that we have and the clinical trials.We need to be studying men and women so we fully understand the spectrum of differences that men women have but yes, men and women are definitely not the same.BARTIROMO: So if men and women are exercising the same, eating the same, you saying typically women will outlive men, now you just said something about Covid, did you say that men are more susceptible to Covid than women?CAUDLE: Men have typically - you know according to the data that we've had and the studies that we've had so far in Covid, we know that men tend to be more severely affected by Covid than women. Yes, I did say that and you're right Maria that it's statistically a fact that women do live longer than men.The lifespan of women is longer, that's a statistical fact so those are two sort of macro issues and then of course there are all the micro issues that you know we know cellular structure and things like that are also different but we're still studying this.And it's why we need gender equality in our studies. We need to understand how men and women are different also how we're alike.BARTIROMO: And - and how we're behaving in terms of health and our healthy living, eating, exercise and whether or not that changes the equation is also worth exploring. Dr. Caudle, it's always a pleasure. Thanks very much. Great to talk to you this morning.CAUDLE: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We will see you soon. Coming up supermodel Chrissy Teigen's cutting off 1 million Twitter users. What sparked the blocking spree right after the break. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. This Fox Business alert. ECB President Christine Lagarde holding a news conference after the Central Bank's decision to keep interest rates and stimulus unchanged. Lagarde says she sees the economy in the EU rebounding in the third quarter but that uncertainty about the strength of the recovery remains high.She is expecting growth in the third quarter. Markets are pretty much unchanged. FT100, down 27; CAC 40, down 35 and the DAX index, down 71. We're expecting a decline on Wall Street of about 200 points from the opening bell sounds in about 35 minutes.Meanwhile, a massive Twitter hack not the only issue for the social media giant, this morning. Supermodel Christy Teigen blocked more than a million users yesterday. She also deleted more than 60,000 of her own tweets. The overhaul of her account coming after she said she was getting harassed because of conspiracy theories on the platform linking her to Jeffrey Epstein.Now she's denying all allegations but she says she's never met Jeffrey Epstein. She's never been to his island or on his jet. Matt Schlapp, this is another example of the issues on the platform that we've been talking about all morning with that massive hack.SCHLAPP: No, that's exactly right and once something gets - takes off on social media and once they kind of start to attack you, it's rather scary thing. I think when you're the subject of these attacks especially things like Cancel culture Maria, you find yourself realizing that being too attached to a social media platform is actually injurious to your health.BARTIROMO: Yes well, I mean Twitter shares are coming back. They were down about seven percent early on. Now you're looking at a decline of about four percent Mark Tepper. I said it earlier, I'll say it again. What happened with this hack basically told us that Twitter has the tools to allow its employees to control our accounts and that means shadow banning and everything else.They just told us because that's how the hack happened. They took control of the person who could operate user accounts.TEPPER: Yes, if they decide they're going to speak on my behalf, using my voice, my profile, I've got a big issue with that. That's a huge issue from Twitter's perspective and that's probably why Parlor is gaining so much popularity right now.Now back to the Chrissy Teigen thing, look, I get it. I mean, I've been attacked as well on Twitter. I don't have nearly as many followers. God forbid, I say Tesla's stock price is too expensive, the trolls come out quick. They come out hard but it is really easy to attack somebody when you are a faceless coward.And you're - you're not tied to your own personal account. There are just way too many fake accounts out there, way too many bots, they got to go.BARTIROMO: Well, some of them are fake Liz, but you know, there's also that social media mob mentality. The mobs come at you when you say something that they don't agree with. Yes, some of them are bots, I agree with that but not all. They're not all robots, Liz.PEEK: No, I think that's exactly right and what's amazing to me is that she apparently has removed some million followers, I don't know how - I have no idea how you do that. How do you identify a million followers that you can remove? I can remove ten if I don't like what they're saying but look, I think it's a little bit people have gotten too enamoured with having a social media presence.That's where it becomes more important than life, right and - and I think you kind of have to take your lumps if you're going to be that sort of indebted to Twitter followers and involved with unfortunately, things like this can happen, it's not good but it's going to happen.BARTIROMO: Yes, for sure. More on Mornings with Maria, live on Fox Business right after this.Load-Date: July 16, 2020End of Document

V2X Cybersecurity Market Worth $3,065 Million by 2025 - Exclusive Report by MarketsandMarkets™PR NewswireJuly 8, 2020 Wednesday 5:30 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1479 wordsDateline: CHICAGO, July 8, 2020 BodyPR NewswireAccording to the new market research report"V2X Cybersecurity Marketby Unit Type (OBU and RSU), Form (In-vehicle and External Cloud Services), Communication Type (V2I, V2V, V2G, V2C, and V2P), Security Type (PKI and Embedded), Connectivity Type, Vehicle Type, and Region - Global Forecast to 2025", published by MarketsandMarkets™, the V2X Cybersecurity Market size is projected to reach USD 3,065 million by 2025, from an estimated USD 935 million in 2020, at a CAGR of 26.8%.The growth of the V2X Cybersecurity Market can be attributed to the increasing trend of connected and autonomous vehicles equipped with V2X technologies and growing cyber threats in the automotive industry. The focus of automobile manufacturers has shifted from fuel efficiency, performance, driver safety, and stability of the vehicle to additional features such as vehicle connectivity, electrification of functions, and digitalization. This change in focus has created a huge opportunity for non-automotive industry players such as Intel, Qualcomm, and Nvidia, to name a few. OEMs, technology companies, and V2X providers worldwide have joined hands and are focusing heavily on research & testing of security applications/standards to protect data privacy.Browse in-depth TOC on "V2X Cybersecurity Market"103 – Tables49 – Figures187– PagesThe V2X cybersecurity is part of a complex ecosystem with multiple stakeholders, as the value chain is fragmented among all types of industries. Due to COVID-19, businesses of majority of stakeholders in the V2X ecosystem have been affected, one way or the other. Most of the ongoing developments in this ecosystem have been suspended or stopped for a while as well. With such a complex ecosystem, the COVID-19 affects one or two stakeholders in the chain will result in the whole ecosystem suffering the impact.Download PDF Brochure:https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=194480977Asia Pacific is expected to be the largest and fastest-growing market in the forecastThe Asia Pacific region is projected to account for the largest share of the global V2X Cybersecurity Market during the forecast period. The region is home to renowned V2X cybersecurity companies such as Autotalks, AutoCrypt, and Argus Security. China is expected to be the most influential factor in the Asia Pacific V2X Cybersecurity Market. China has been conducting various tests and trails on cellular connectivity for V2X, and the expected country-wide launch is by 2021. The large market share of China can also be attributed to the high sales of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, which is equipped with V2X, especially V2C and V2I. The Chinese government is committed to the growth of IoT with a great emphasis on the development of connected cars and has already invested more than USD 10 billion in the IoT industry since October 2010. Apart from this, one of the key factors driving the growth of the market in Asia Pacific is the increased production of passenger cars with advanced connected car features. The increasing purchasing power of the population and increasing concerns over the environment have triggered the demand for V2X in Asia Pacific. Since South Korea and Japan are among the leaders in electronics, it would enable them to design V2X solutions with better performance at a lesser price. Thus, increasing V2X use in vehicles will result in high demand for cybersecurity solutions, thus, driving the Asia Pacific V2X Cybersecurity Market.The external cloud services segment is expected to be the largest market during the forecastThe external cloud services segment is projected to have the largest share in the V2X Cybersecurity Market. V2X communication security mostly requires external cloud services due to continuously changing security protocols, connectivity options, and cloud updates. With the increasing cloud-based applications, smart devices, and IoT penetration, the market for external cloud services has increased in the automotive market. Manufacturers are looking for cost-effective solutions along with better resource planning. Fleet management system, OTA, V2X, and other IoT applications and services are the major applications of external cloud services for the automotive market. The V2X, cybersecurity, and network providers have started creating their cloud servers to support secured V2X communications. With cloud-based security services, V2X messages can be kept encrypted and cannot be accessed without proper authentication. Cloud services help in maintaining certificate and security keys to keep V2X communications secured. Also, external cloud services for V2X cybersecurity are more feasible, as they are cost and time efficient (due to OTA updates).Request FREE Sample Report:https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=194480977The European region is expected to be the second-largest market during the forecast periodEurope is projected to be the second largest V2X Cybersecurity Market as the regulations related to safety issues have become stringent. Therefore, the increasing demand for connected cars equipped with V2X technologies is likely to drive the V2X Cybersecurity Market in this region. Moreover, given the present infrastructure, the inclination of OEMs in the region and recovery from the financial crisis is likely to result in a high growth market, with Germany expected to be the fastest market in the region for connected cars and cybersecurity solutions.

REPS. OMAR, CASTRO URGE USAID TO RESCIND ITS APPOINTMENT OF MARK KEVIN FLOYD AS USAID RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ADVISORStates News ServiceJune 29, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1181 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar:Today, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX) sent a letter urging USAID to rescind its appointment of Mark Kevin Floyd as USAID Religious Freedom Advisor. Mr. Floyd has a proven track record of prejudice towards those of the Islamic faith and Muslim majority countries, discrimination that is antithetical to USAID's mission of global development and religious freedom:"Mark Kevin Lloyd, who has a long history of promoting hateful, Islamophobic rhetoric has no businesses promoting religious freedom abroad," said Congresswoman Omar. "Someone who doesn't recognize the importance of religious diversity in our country cannot credibly promote religious freedom internationally. This appointment will severely weaken USAID's ability to assist the world's poorest countries including many predominately Muslim nations. This appointment must be rescinded immediately.""The appointment of Mark Kevin Lloyd undermines USAID's clear, global commitment to religious freedom as a human right. We should not be rewarding Mr. Lloyd's pattern of prejudice and bigotry against those of the Islamic faith. People around the world desperately need USAID's advocacy and assistance. But those who espouse discrimination should not be given a platform and especially not in an organization that aims to represent America's promise of liberty and justice for all. USAID works with countries that are 32% majority Muslim and all of those countries need our help. I fear with Mr. Floyd at the helm those countries will face further discrimination. I strongly urge USAID to remove Mr. Lloyd from his position as USAID's Religious Freedom Advisor effective immediately," said Congressman Castro.A PDF of the letter can be found here, and the full text of the letter is below.June 29, 2020The Honorable John BarsaActing AdministratorU.S. Agency for International DevelopmentRonald Reagan BuildingWashington D.C. 20523-1000Dear Acting Administrator Barsa,We are writing to denounce the appointment of Mark Kevin Lloyd as the USAID Religious Freedom Adviser and call for his immediate removal from this position.USAID, the country's lead agency to assist the world's poorest countries, espouses a clear commitment to religious freedom as part of its mission. As a key component of its Democracy, Human Rights and Governance office, USAID lauds religious freedom as a core human right and assures that the agency "aims to protect and vigorously promote religious liberty." [1] USAID further recognizes the freedom from discrimination as a corollary right intrinsically linked to the freedom of religion.[2]The appointment of Mr. Lloyd as the USAID Religious Freedom Adviser is antithetical to the USAID mission of global development and religious freedom. Mr. Lloyd has demonstrated a historical pattern of prejudice against the Islamic faith and the Muslim population. Using personal social media platforms, Mr. Lloyd's offenses range from calling Islam a "barbaric cult"[3] to making the vulgar suggestion that, following a 2016 mass shooting in Orlando, people should be forced to eat bacon before they can purchase firearms.[4] Similarly, Mr. Lloyd posted articles that endorsed the Chinese government's suppression of the Uyghur Muslim minority,[5] one of the most painful modern examples of religious discrimination by a state. The repression of Uyghurs - which the Simon-Skjodt Center for the Prevention of Genocide at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum has determined may amount to crimes against humanity[6] - has drawn widespread bipartisan condemnation, including from Secretary Pompeo.Far from an isolated incident of poor judgement, Mr. Lloyd's behavior openly and frequently displays his contempt for a religion that counts nearly two billion followers, and constitutes the second largest religion in the world.[7] Still, today, Mr. Lloyd's Facebook account has posts that assert a link between President Barack Obama and the Muslim Brotherhood and notes that people who believe Islam is a peaceful religion fail to understand history.[8]Yet, USAID does not deny Mr. Lloyd's avowed prejudices. Instead USAID has responded to only one of Mr. Lloyd's comments, excusing his reference to Islam as a barbaric cult as a remark that "was made four years ago" and concerned only "radical Islam."[9] This reaction is woefully inadequate and plays on harmful stereotypes. The government, in proper stance, has previously rejected language that equates an entire religion with the actions of an extremist few.One of USAID's roles is to represent the American promise of liberty and religious freedom through strategic programming that supports and defends these rights in developing countries. Of the approximately 122 countries that USAID currently provides assistance, nearly 32% are comprised of Muslim majority countries.[10] Scores of other countries that receive assistance also host significant Muslim populations.Given the scope of USAID's reach and the priority it has placed on religious freedom, USAID's program development will necessarily involve planning with Muslim countries or populations. Any USAID senior leader that cannot serve the world's multi-faith society is unable to assist in fairly administering these assistance programs. Mr. Lloyd's discriminatory posture disqualifies him for the position. His continued tenure as USAID's Religious Freedom Adviser undermines our commitment to help poor countries around the world. The longer-term consequences of failing to remove Mr. Lloyd from office will weaken our country's ability to cultivate democratic institutions and allies abroad, which could seriously damage U.S. national security interests.For these reasons, we insist that you immediately remove Mr. Lloyd from his position as USAID's Religious Freedom Adviser. He does not represent the values of our country, and he should not be in a position to betray our nation's constitutional promise of religious freedom.Sincerely,Ilhan OmarMember of CongressJoaquin CastroMember of CongressAndre CarsonMember of CongressRashida TlaibMember of CongressAdriano EspaillatMember of CongressDavid TroneMember of CongressAl GreenMember of Congress###[1] See, https://www.usaid.gov/democracy/religious-freedom[2] Id.[3] Mariam Fam, Elana Schor, "New USAID Adviser Sparks Furor Over Past Anti-Islam Comments," Associated Press, May 29. 2020.[4] Id.[5] Murtaza Hussain, "USAID Faces Mounting Pressure to Remove Latest Trump Appointee with History of Islamophobic Remarks," The Intercept, May 30, 2020.[6] See, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Country Case Studies, China, 2020.[7] C.L.

South Korea platform Naver terminates Hong Kong serversUPIJuly 20, 2020 Monday 11:31 AM ESTCopyright 2020 U.P.I. All Rights ReservedLength: 337 wordsByline: ELIZABETH SHIMDateline: July 20 BodySouth Korea's most popular search engine has shut down its servers in Hong Kong, following the passage of the Hong Kong national security law.Naver, Korea's most popular search engine by share of all searches, said Monday it has destroyed its Hong Kong-based backed up data, South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo and Hankook Ilbo reported.Naver physically destroyed the saved data from July 6 to 10, or a week after the controversial Hong Kong security law went into effect. The new law can punish people with imprisonment if they advocate for secession.The South Korean firm said all data previously handled in Hong Kong was transferred to Singapore. A representative of the company said Naver had taken a "comprehensive assessment of the situation at overseas data centers" to arrive at the decision, according to the Hankook Ilbo.Naver began using Hong Kong as a hub for backed up data in October 2016. The company said Monday those data transfers occurred with the use of virtual private networks, or VPNs, and that the data was kept encrypted in accordance with data protection regulations.The company also denied allegations the Chinese government requested access to private user data. Personal information in backed up data is protected under encryption, according to Naver."There's no possibility at all a third party could get hold of the data," the firm said.Not all South Korean platforms keep backed up data outside the country. Kakao, the country's No. 1 messaging app, keeps all data domestically, according to reports.U.S. firms are also slowly shutting down servers over security law concerns.CNBC reported Friday U.S.-based companies IPVanish and Private Internet Access are to deactivate their Hong Kong servers.IP Vanish said the firm is committed to protecting its users."The new law places the region, once a stronghold of online freedom, behind the same tight Internet restrictions that govern mainland China. With this legislative change, we, unfortunately, have to consider Hong Kong and China as one."Load-Date: July 20, 2020End of Document

Blockchain IoT Markets 2020-2025: Assessment of the Impact of COVID-19 on the IndustryGlobeNewswireJuly 3, 2020 Friday 3:59 AM PTCopyright 2020 GlobeNewswire, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTSLength: 1550 wordsBodyDublin, July  03, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The     "Global Blockchain IoT Market: Growth, Trends and Forecast (2020-2025)"   report has been added to     ResearchAndMarkets.com's  offering.         The Global Blockchain IoT Market is expected to grow with a CAGR of 40% over the forecast period 2020-2025.With the rapid development of communication technologies, the Internet of Things is experiencing exponential growth both in research and industry and is getting out of its infancy to maturity phase with the volume of data generated, transmitted and processed but it still suffers from pitfalls such as privacy and security vulnerabilities that is leveraged by the asymmetric cryptography of the blockchain technology.Key Highlights• The traditional IoT systems are powered by centralized topology where data is transmitted from physical devices to cloud where the data is processed using analytics and output is received back to the IoT device, but with the increase of frequency of network devices limits the scalability of the IoT platforms and risk it with vulnerabilities that would eventually compromise users network security and privacy.• For instance, In 2017, the US FDA ( Food and Drug Administration) announced that St Jude Medical' implantable cardiac are vulnerable to hack due to vulnerabilities in the transmitter powered by IoT which were deployed to monitor the patient heart function and control heart attack, Also few of the infamous IoT attacks include Mirai Botnet DDoS attack affected internet service for the entire East Coast of America including Netflix, Reddit, and Twitter.• As with the Blockchain powered by decentralized architecture and cryptographic encryptions leverages the IoT platform by ensuring the privacy and security in a peer-to-peer network. However, it requires high computational power resulting in higher bandwidth overhead and delay• Furthermore, centralized architecture such as cloud model that powers traditional IoT result in latency, high cost and the risk of single point of failure. Blockchain technologies on other hand provide security protocols and infrastructure that enable billions of IoT devices to have trusted interoperability for both data and commerce.• The Financial institutions and other major companies are usually are inherently slow in adopting any new technology but Banks and Financial institutes such as HSBC, Deutsche Bank, ING that are exploring the potential of blockchain technology added with the flexibility IoT open up innumerable use cases to run smart operation leveraging the everyday devices equipped with sensors and thereby achieve more efficiency.• With the rapid growth of urbanization and government initiatives across the world foster the demand for smart cities. The smart cities are entitled to problems such as high operation cost of the data center, poor security of IoT, equipment maintenance among others. However, technologies such as blockchain IoT would provide the necessary infrastructure for transaction management, asset tracking, smart contracts while ensuring security and transparency and thereby increasing the operational efficiency• For instance, smart city developers such as Hancom Group announced that its 470 acres smart city project Gapyeong Malang Malang Smart Ecosystem will be incorporating blockchain as the basis for development.Market TrendsSmart City End-users to Hold a Major Market Share• Over the last few decades, the world has experienced unparalleled urban growth majorly due to an increase in population, scarcity of resources and climate changes. According to the United Nations, about 54% of people dwell in cities and is expected to reach 66% by 20250. To cope up with urban growth government bodies are focusing on modern technologies such as IoT, wireless communication, blockchain aiming to reduce cost and use resources optimally• For instance, the Netherlands deployed IoT infrastructure in Amsterdam to regulate and monitor the city' energy usage, traffic flow and safety real-time• Data security is one of the vital constraints for devices and services deployed in a metropolitan city, which leveraged with the blockchain's decentralized platform ensures the trust of the public and hence, fosters the growth of the market.• Also, Government initiatives around the world are starting to appreciate the potential of blockchain as it provides the infrastructure necessary for transaction management while ensuring transparency and security which stands to be critical elements in smart city implementation.• For instance, In 2015, India has pioneered to openly enact smart city mission across 12 cities with Government approved tender amounting to INR 1,62,000 Cr under this programme. Additionally, Government recently announced will be reported report card for the 100 selected smart cities in June 2020Asia-Pacific to Witness the Highest Growth• The Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow at the highest rate over the forecast period owing to the rising influx of technology companies in the region coupled with the increasing investment in IoT technology, Smart City deployments, Government initiative and growth of urban population, the region is expected to boost the market growth rate.• For instance, In November 2019, Hyperchain, a blockchain firm announced that China' State Grid Corporation accepted its bid for a blockchain solution to leverage the Internet of things ( IoT) capabilities as a part of its procurement program.• Also, In February 2020 Chinese central government issued the CCP Central Committee and State Council Opinions Concerning Effectively Seizing Key Work in the Three Agricultures' Sphere featuring the application advance technologies such as IoT, Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence to Chinese Agriculture.• In August 2019, Reliance, a leading Indian multinational conglomerate company announced its plan to introduce Blockchain network with emphasis on modernizing agriculture, supply chain at its annual general meeting, The plan is aimed to be delivered by August 2020 and is hoped to capable of fulfilling thousand of node operations added with smarty city initiatives by the government are expected to drive the growth of IoT market.Competitive LandscapeThe Blockchain IoT market is highly competitive owing to the presence of many large and small players in the market operating in the domestic as well as in the international market. The market appears to be fragmented due to the presence of many technological giants in the market. Key strategies adopted by the major players in the market are product innovation and mergers and acquisitions. Some of the major players in the market are Cisco Systems, Google, IBM Corporation, and Microsoft Corporation among others.Recent Developments• October 2019 - IBM announced a new supply chain service based on its blockchain platform and its recently acquired Red Hat open-source software, This service enables developers to integrate legacy data systems on to the distributed ledger with the help of open APIs. The end-users such as distributors, manufacturers, and retailers would seamlessly be able to integrate the data from sources such as IoT sensor systems onto Hyperledger so as to track products throughout the supply chain in realtime.• September 2019 - Linux Foundation announced that it seeks to closely integrate with IOTA Foundation to further leverage LF Edge table. This open colloboration leads the development of LF Edge framework which is an open-source stack of Cloud interoperability, IoT edge with distributed ledger technologies and help the company to leverage its stack of technologies to advance its development approach towards interoperable solution for IoT, Cloud and Edge integration.Key Topics Covered                   1 INTRODUCTION1.1 Study Deliverables1.2 Study Assumptions1.3 Scope of the Study2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY4 MARKET DYNAMICS4.1 Market Overview4.2 Market Drivers4.3 Market Restraints4.4 Value Chain / Supply Chain Analysis4.5 Porters 5 Force Analysis4.6 Assessment of Impact of COVID-19 on the Industry5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 Offering5.1.1 Hardware5.1.2 Software5.1.3 Infrastructure5.2 Application5.2.1 Data security5.2.2 Smart Contracts5.2.3 Data Communication5.2.4 Asset Tracking & Management5.2.5 Other Application5.3 End-user5.3.1 Manufacturing5.3.2 Energy-utility5.3.3 Transportation & Logistics5.3.4 Building Management5.3.5 Retail5.3.6 Smart City5.4 Geography5.4.1 North America5.4.1.1 US5.4.1.2 Canada5.4.2 Europe5.4.2.1 Germany5.4.2.2 UK5.4.2.3 France5.4.2.4 Rest of Europe5.4.3 Asia-Pacific5.4.3.1 India5.4.3.2 China5.4.3.3 Japan5.4.3.4 Rest of Asia-Pacific5.4.4 Latin America5.4.5 Middle East and Africa6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE6.1 Vendor Market Share6.2 Mergers & Acquisitions6.3 Company Profiles6.3.1 IBM Corporation6.3.2 Intel Corporation6.3.3 Microsoft Corporation6.3.4 Cisco Systems Inc.6.3.5 Amazon Inc.6.3.6 Robert Bosch GmbH6.3.7 The Linux Foundation6.3.8 KrypC Technologies6.3.9 Ethereum Foundation6.3.10 R3 LLC6.3.11 IoTA6.3.12 Waltonchain7 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND FUTURE TRENDS           For more information         about this  report  visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/79dxl4    Research and Markets also offers Custom Research services providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research. CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.com          Laura Wood, Senior Press Manager          press@researchandmarkets.com          For E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470          For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630          For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900 Load-Date: July 3, 2020End of Document
