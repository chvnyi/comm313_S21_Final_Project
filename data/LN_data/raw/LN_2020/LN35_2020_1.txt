WE SHOULD "CONFRONT" CHINA BY LIBERALIZING CHINESE IMMIGRATIONStates News ServiceMay 29, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1880 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Cato Institute:ByAlex NowrastehThe Chinese government's crackdown on dissidents in Hong Kong is just another indication of that government's rising totalitarianism. Vox's Matt Yglesias wrote that the United States should let in any Hongkonger who wishes to leave a proposal I agree with. However, the U.S. government is moving in the opposite direction. Not only has it virtually ended all immigration, including for those seeking refuge and asylum, but it will soon go further to limit the migration of Chinese students.Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) recently introduced the Secure Campus Act that "would prohibit Chinese nationals from receiving visas to the United States for graduate or post" graduate studies in STEM fields." Their press release cites the single example of the arrest of Arkansas professor Simon Saw" Teong Ang for wire fraud, alleging that he failed to disclose ties to the Chinese government and Chinese firms when he applied for NASA grant money. The senators also write that "the Chinese Communist Party has long used American universities to conduct espionage on the United States."The Trump administration is expected to follow with an executive order to expel some Chinese students with ties to Chinese universities who are affiliated with the People's Liberation Army (edit: Trump just signed an executive order doing just this). This will come on the heels of the Trump administration efforts that begun in June 2018 to restrict student visas for Chinese citizens studying in subjects with potential national security applications. The U.S. government imposed extra screening for students studying in fields related to the Chinese government's Made in China 2025 plan and shortening the time period of visas related to aviation, robotics and advanced manufacturing from a maximum of five years to one year. The administration is edging toward a total ban on Chinese students.The Chinese government and Chinese firms have engaged in industrial espionage and state" espionage in recent decades. There's no doubt that some small number of foreign students have nefarious intent to steal valuable intellectual property from American firms and universities. But those firms and universities are the victims, and they think the benefits from welcoming Chinese students outweigh the costs. Many of them are strengthening security to prevent theft, but slamming the door shut is an extreme and destructive solution to a manageable problem.The biggest challenge is getting universities to fully comply with the complex export controls that limit the sharing of potential national" security related advancements with countries that are potential adversaries of the United States like China. The government's focus on Chinese espionage, IP theft, and export of new inventions has led to some tragic career" ending prosecutions such as in the case of Xiaoxing Xi.Xi was a Chinese" born American physics professor and former Chair of the Physics Department at Temple University. The government charged him with wire" fraud in May 2015, alleging that he sent designs for a pocket heater used in superconductor research to where? The DOJ dropped all charges against Xi after the co" inventor of the pocket heater showed that the designs Xi shared, as typical in academic collaboration, with Chinese researchers were not for a pocket heater or any other advanced technology. Temple University still placed Xi on administrative leave and he resigned his chairmanship position.Undeterred by their embarrassment in the Xi case, the Department of Justice (DOJ) launched the China Initiative in 2018 to "identify and prosecute those engaged in economic espionage, trade secret theft, hacking and other economic crimes." According to the DOJ, "about 80 percent of all economic espionage prosecutions ... allege conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and there is at least some nexus to China in around 60 percent of all trade secret theft cases." We only have some of their China Initiative cases available, and a portion of them are troubling, but we the public needs to see all of them rather than a DOJ" selected list to evaluate how serious the threat is.There are approximately 380,000 Chinese students studying in the United States out of the roughly 1.4 million foreign students here. About 171,000 of them were enrolled in science and engineering programs at U.S. universities. They are tightly monitored by both the government and universities. The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), which monitors foreign students studying in the United States, has already "mitigated previously identified national security gaps ... and is continuing to enhance the system" according to testimony by Louis A. Rodi III, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting assistant director in charge of enforcing visa rules. Their enrollment and attendance at universities is known in real time by the government, and the students lose their visas immediately if they don't comply a system of forced" compliance virtually unique amongst visas.The justifications for the DOJ Chinese Initiative are intended to protect American innovation. But stopping the flow of Chinese students to STEM fields, as the Secure Campus Act would do, would undermine U.S. innovation. Despite being 1.5 percent of the U.S. population, Chinese immigrants and their descendants account for almost 9 percent of patents filed in the United States and 8.2 percent in computers, 8 percent in electrical, and 7.2 percent in chemicals.Even the FBI agrees. "Most foreign students, researchers, or professors studying or working in the United States are here for legitimate and proper reasons," said one FBI report from 2011 on security in U.S. universities. "Only a very small percentage is actively working at the behest of another government or organization." Another FBI report from 2020 said that "[t]he vast majority of the 1.4 million international scholars on U.S. campuses pose no threat to their host institutions, fellow classmates, or research fields."The leak of some intellectual property by a few Chinese students and researchers is worth the gargantuan economic benefits of their tremendous contributions to U.S. innovation to say nothing of the non" Chinese who also sell IP to China or other governments. The U.S. government should continue to try and limit industrial espionage and state" espionage, but halting or severely restricting Chines migration is akin to removing part of one's brain to remedy an allergy" induced headache.Rather than reducing Chinese immigration to combat China, the United States should drastically liberalize immigration. For decades, the best minds in China have left for freer and greener pastures abroad. The Chinese government is desperate to have them return as part of their central economic plan of becoming a leader in science and technology by 2050, which is the justification or their Thousand Talents Program that incentivizes Chinese scientists to return (sometimes with stolen IP) to study in China, often with large bonuses.The Chinese government is even attempting to send recruiters overseas to entice Chinese students to return to reverse the brain drain in China. In part due to their decades" long and brutal one" child policy, the Chinese population is aging more rapidly than our own. By 2045, about a third of China will be 60 or older compared to about 22 percent in the United States.This represents a golden opportunity to drain the best minds from China that will undermine their government's efforts to have Chinese students and scientists return, as well as worsen their demographics while bettering our own. Every Chinese national with a college degree should be able to get a work permit or green card without numerical cap. Those studying in the United States state should be welcomed, allowed, and even encouraged to stay.Chinese institutions and the Thousand Talents Program provide foreign scientists with signing bonuses up to $151,000 and research stipends ranging from $453,000 to $755,000 for established scientists over the age of 40. Even with those enticements, 90 percent of Chinese STEM doctorate recipients were still in the United States a decade after completing their studies. All the U.S. government has to do to wipe out the Chinese government's talent recruitment efforts and raise that percentage even more is allow them to come to study, work, and live here with a minimum of bureaucratic fuss and the removal of arbitrary visa restrictions.Efforts by Tom Cotton and the Trump administration are inspired by legitimate national security considerations. They're rightly worried about Chinese espionage, but their solutions will only strengthen the Chinese state. The example of the U.S. returning Chinese immigrant Qian Xuesen to China should provide a cautionary tale. Xuesen immigrated from China and earned his Ph.D. from Cal Tech in 1939. He was a pioneer in cybernetics, aerospace engineering, and physics. He was involved with the Manhattan Project and designing American rockets. Theodore von Karman, legendary aerospace engineer, mathematician, and physicist, pronounced Xuesen an "undisputed genius."During the Cold War, Xuesen was accused of being a Communist on flimsy evidence. He lost his security clearances and his career options limited. He decided to return to China and was detained by U.S. authorities for five years under house arrest after the government claimed that he was trying to smuggle out classified documents. Subsequent examination of the documents showed they contained no classified material. Eventually Xuesen was traded to China in exchange for downed American pilots.In China, Xuesen helped lead the Chinese nuclear weapons program and their missile program, earning the moniker "Father of Chinese Rocketry." Undersecretary of the Navy Dan A. Kimball, who knew Xuesen personally, said "It was the stupidest thing this country ever did. He was no more a Communist than I was, and we forced him to go." How many other brilliant Chinese scientists like Xuesen will the U.S. government turn back or force to leave because of the fear of IP theft and espionage? While real concerns, the threat from espionage is trivial in comparison to the known cost of keeping thousands of Chinese scientists and engineers in China.It's no secret that many policymakers in the United States and the People's Republic of China want a new Cold War. Trade restrictions, espionage, and military buildups in both countries are moving in that direction. Except for Xuesen, the United States government welcomed people fleeing Communist countries and reformed its entire refugee and asylum program to do so. The U.S. government likely reformed the entire immigration system in 1965 in response to the Cold War. The Communist countries had to impose draconian emigration restrictions to keep their people from fleeing. Many Chinese, including some of their top minds, would jump at the opportunity to study, work, and live in the United States. For the benefits of our own economy and national security as well as for the sake of Chinese citizens seeking freedom, we should welcome them rather than throw up new barriers.Load-Date: May 30, 2020End of Document

Senate Judiciary Subcommittee Issues Testimony From SacksTargeted News ServiceMarch 6, 2020 Friday 6:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4928 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism issued the following testimony on March 4 by Samm Sacks, senior fellow at the Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center and cybersecurity policy fellow at New America, at a hearing entitled "Dangerous Partners: Big Tech and Beijing":I am a Senior Fellow at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center and a Cybersecurity Policy Fellow at New America. I have worked as an analyst of Chinese cyber and technology policies for the last decade, in the U.S. national security community and in the private sector.My previous testimonies before other House and Senate committees over the past two years addressed broader challenges in the U.S.-China technology relationship, providing recommendations on issues such as export controls, market access in China, and the ethical challenges of joint research in emerging technologies./1In each of these areas, I argued that it is absolutely vital that we maintain the openness of the U.S. system, but with greater resilience and new guardrails to ensure that openness is not exploited.Today I will provide remarks on managing the data security risks of U.S.-China technology entanglement. I will focus on three areas:(1) The reality of China's cyber governance system and how Chinese government access to data works in practice(2) How to build a stronger U.S. cybersecurity and data privacy system(3) How to address risks posed by China in a way that strengthens U.S. global technological leadership and competitivenessPart I. China's cyber governance system and Chinese government access to data We need to start with an accurate understanding of the nature of the risks posed by China's cyber governance system.Here I would like to make two points:1. U.S. policymakers should not conflate the problems of (a) U.S. companies operating inside China with (b) Chinese companies operating in the United States.Different policy approaches are required to address two separate sets of risks. The first is U.S.companies like Apple operating in China (mainly handling Chinese citizen data) and the second is Chinese companies like TikTok operating in the United States (mainly handling U.S. citizen data). Because U.S. firms in China manage mostly Chinese citizen data, this poses serious ethical and market access questions. This is distinct from the national security question of Chinese companies having access to massive amounts of U.S. citizen data overseas.The data handled by U.S. firms operating in China is primarily Chinese citizen data, and in some cases, they segment their global networks to prevent Chinese citizen data from flowing outside of China, in accordance with Chinese law. The challenges for U.S. firms in this context are ethical: how will they respond to pressure from the Chinese government to turn over the content of user emails or search histories to crack down on dissent? Do they have control over and visibility into supply chains to prevent the company's technology from enabling the Chinese government to commit mass human rights violations today or in the future? The mass incarceration of minorities in areas like Xinjiang or Tibet is just one example. A new report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute describes Uighurs in prison-like forced labor conditions at Chinese factories reported to supply U.S. companies such as Nike./2In my previous testimonies, I argued for the development of new legislation and standards to systematically consider the ethics of specific partnerships in China. This is too big and complex a challenge for individual companies to take on themselves. Existing voluntary guidelines like the Global Network Initiative (GNI) are not up to the task of addressing the problem./3But neither of the two extreme positions I often hear--pretending these issues do not exist at all or pushing to sever all research and commercial ties with China--serve U.S. interests and values, either.U.S. firms also face market access barriers and costs due to Chinese government restrictions around cross border transfer of data. Article 37 of China's Cybersecurity Law requires that certain kinds of data ("important data" and "personal data") must be stored on local servers or undergo a security assessment before being sent outside of China. There still appears to be a regulatory gray zone in which multinationals in China can send certain kinds of data outside the country, but it is not clear the extent to which this will be the case in the future, given the significant weight given to national security in Beijing's approach to data regulation.This is a separate question from the other key issue: the way Chinese companies handle U.S. citizen data does impact U.S. national security. This could mean a Chinese app collecting data from overseas users (like TikTok) or a Chinese company seeking to acquire a U.S. company that has data collected on Americas (like the Ant Financial/Moneygram deal blocked by CFIUS).This brings me to my second point:2. The Chinese government does not necessarily have unfettered real-time access to all companies' data.The government of Xi Jinping has built the most comprehensive cyber governance framework in the world. With the 2017 Cybersecurity Law as the centerpiece, a sprawling framework governs data security and transfer, critical infrastructure, and digital content. This framework underpins the most sophisticated system for online control in the world, which the Chinese government is now using to monitor and restrict population movement in the wake of the Coronavirus./4And on March 1, a new sweeping regulation for censoring content took effect./5U.S. and Chinese firms must comply with these requirements to operate in China. But what exactly does compliance mean in practice? Nothing is black and white, particularly when it comes to government access to data. Ultimately the Chinese government can compel companies to turn over their data, but this does not always happen.U.S. policymakers must start with a fact-based understanding of the reality on the ground, taking into account the internal push and pull of different actors in the system, and the gray zones in the rules. Chinese corporate actors are not synonymous with the Chinese government or the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and have their own commercial interests to protect. Failure to take into account the friction within the system can lead to dangerous policy outcomes; decoupling and conflict with China are not in the interest of U.S. security or economic prosperity.Many Chinese companies will say privately that they routinely push back against data requests from the government, but they do not want to talk publicly about the fact that they do often resist because doing so draws attention to themselves. In fact, drawing attention to themselves would be counterproductive to the ultimate goal of fighting against government intrusion. In China, media attention will only lead government officials to double down on their request.A few examples have come out publicly. The Chinese ride-sharing company Didi initially refused to turn over data to law enforcement authorities investigating the murder of passengers./6Tencent and Alibaba refused to feed their transaction data to a government credit reporting program under the People's Bank of China (PBoC)./7The Chinese app WeChat states that it does not store the content of user chats for data mining, which may be driven in part to avoid entanglement with the government, according to an article in the Harvard Business Review./8It is also important to keep in mind that data requests are made in a manual fashion (request, review, respond). Moreover, there is no single government repository of all data. The PboC and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the state agency responsible for state economic planning, have a history of not sharing data with each other. This is not surprising given the tremendous political power that certain kinds of data can yield in the Chinese system.I'd like to walk through how the regulatory regime related to government access to data in China works since the system is very difficult for outsiders to understand in English, let alone by reading the original directives in Chinese. Moreover, many commentators in the U.S. have no experience with the process involved for companies undergoing cybersecurity-related audits in China.Among the concerning parts of this cyber governance framework, the Cybersecurity Law (Article 28) states that "Network operators shall provide technical support and assistance to public security organs and national security organs that are safeguarding national security and investigating criminal activities in accordance with the law."/9This vague language (which also is echoed in the 2015 Counterterrorism Law/10 and National Security Law)/11 does provide an opening for the government to compel companies to collaborate with intelligence services and law enforcement. Does "technical support" mean turning over encryption keys? Does it mean data monitoring by the security services? Maybe, maybe not.Compliance often involves lengthy and complicated negotiations between companies and local officials. Local officials must balance competing demands of security with immense pressure to deliver economic development in their jurisdiction. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) derives its ruling authority in large part by providing economic prosperity. Furthermore, different local government agencies often have different objectives. Sometimes companies will leverage connections with officials from other agencies to stop security bureau officials from seeking certain kinds of data./12These factors creates a kind of backstop on how far the government tends to go in implementing some of the most worrisome provisions of China's cyber governance regime.I'd like to look at recent developments in China's cyber governance system where risk of data access is at issue: a regulatory scheme called the Multi-Level Protection Scheme (MLPS) and the Cryptography Law. Both apply to Chinese and U.S. firms in China.(a) Multi-Level Protection Scheme 2.0 (MLPS 2.0)MLPS is a security certification regime that the Chinese government established in 2007. In 2018, China's Ministry of Public Security (MPS) released a draft of a new version (referred to as MLPS 2.0). The draft regulation updates the original MLPS regime based on the new principles set out in the 2017 Cybersecurity Law. MLPS ranks from 1 to 5 all information and communications technology (ICT) systems based on their importance to national security, with Level 5 deemed the most sensitive. Anything ranked level 3 or above triggers a suite of regulatory requirements. Companies initiate the process by conducting a self-assessment and working with a third party auditor (typically linked with the local public security bureaus); the auditor conducts interviews on site and observes testing and verification performed by the company. The auditor then writes a report for the provincial or city-level public security bureau.To be sure, MLPS 2.0 creates more regulatory scrutiny on foreign technology, along with a host of new market access barriers as the Xi government doubles down on reducing reliance on foreign suppliers and boosting indigenous equipment. While the 2007 version of MLPS only targets information systems controlled by the government, the updated regime covers all information systems (all "network operators"), meaning that all private and foreign companies now fall in scope of the review. In the current environment MLPS 2.0 also appears to have a focus on cloud computing, big data platforms, and the Internet of Things.While this creates a ton of regulatory headache, there is nothing written down under MLPS that requires firms to provide access to all of their data (or provide encryption keys to the Chinese government). There is a provision that requires information systems graded level 3 and above to undergo "cybersecurity monitoring" connected to the public security agency. But there is no definition of what exactly this entails--does this mean a sleepy security guard sits in a facility or a device is installed in the network? The audit is a negotiation--a give and take in which companies hash out with regulators a way to be compliant but not go as far as the most conservative interpretation of the requirements. Again, local bureaus responsible for economic growth in their jurisdiction do not have incentives to demand that companies turn over all of their data. Chinese government regulators understand that certain MLPS requirements like the use of Chinese domestic encryption (as discussed in the next section) create tremendous costs and challenges for foreign companies, which means the use of domestic encryption by foreign firms is rarely enforced.(It is important to note that the final regulation for MLPS 2.0 has not yet been released. The latest development in late 2019 is that the core standard of MLPS took effect (spelling out the requirements for each of the five levels of the graded system).)(b) New Cryptography LawThe two most important things to understand about China's encryption regime are (1) the Chinese government wants all companies to use Chinese encryption algorithms; and (2) the vast majority of foreign companies do not do this and regulators rarely enforce it.The problem, however, is it is not clear whether this will be the case in the future.A major change is underway with the release of the Cryptography Law (which entered force January 1 2020). This law overhauled China's encryption regime after two decades of intense internal debate. The law is concerning on several fronts, but it is too early to determine the impact it will have as we are awaiting follow-on regulations that will offer more details about its scope and how it will be implemented for companies. (New regulations plus standards tied to those will eventually update a 1999 regulation called the Regulation on the Administration of Commercial Cipher Codes.)This new law introduces two important changes, among other developments:First, it eliminates a significant carve out that has benefitted foreign companies for years. Under the previous regime (centered on the 1999 Regulation on the Administration of Commercial Cipher Codes), the government granted what is known as the "core function exception." This meant that the government permitted the use of products designed with encryption as a general feature (e.g., commercial software). In contrast, products designed to be encryption or security products as their "core" function would face restriction. So companies like Symantec and encryption hardware manufacturers, for example, were excluded from the Chinese market, leaving domestic firms to dominate these business segments. However, for the past two decades, many companies have benefited from carve out, including server, database, and software companies considered not to have encryption as their core function.The new law is a potential game changer by removing this exception. It is still too early to know whether this means products allowed under the previous regime could be restricted or if they will still be allowed albeit with a new approval process. Nobody knows yet. In place of the exception, the government has indicated that it will focus on requiring certifications for the fifteen products listed in the "Catalogue of Critical Network Equipment and Network Security-Specific Products" ("The Catalogue" includes items like routers, switches, PLC equipment). This Catalogue came out with the Cybersecurity Law in 2017 and lists network products that must receive a certification before they can enter the market./13It is also possible that the new regime could create some new openings for foreign companies, especially smaller companies.The second change is that the new law creates a separate category of what is called "commercial encryption" (distinct from "core" and "common encryption," which both apply to state secrets; "core" being the most sensitive). Any item that is identified as a commercial encryption "mass consumption product" will not be subject to an import license. The government has not yet released regulations to clarify the scope of "mass consumption," again creating much uncertainty. Depending on how it is implemented, this could mean lifting the burden of having to navigate a lengthy administrative review process (which is often subject to rent-seeking).Is operating in a regulatory gray zone--one in which the government has all the power and can change course at any moment--a wise decision for a U.S. company? That is not my area of expertise. I highlight these ambiguities so that U.S. policymakers have an accurate picture of how the process works.Part 2. RecommendationsThis first part of my testimony makes clear that China poses real cyber risks to the United States (ethical, commercial, and national security). If the Chinese government wants something, then they can get it, so why is it even important to understand the nuance of how the process works in China, and the fact that there is an internal push and pull, driven by stakeholders with often conflicting agendas? It's easy to make claims that drive headlines on this issue, but my observations are different and can be more difficult to make into short sound bites. I believe U.S. policymakers must have an accurate understanding of the complexities in China's system so that we can respond to the risks it poses in the most responsible and effective manner.Here I have two main recommendation for how to do this.(2.1) Build a better U.S. cybersecurity and data privacy systemIn order to address the risks presented by Beijing, we should not be reactive, but actively seek to set out a different vision for U.S. internet governance based on a rule of law system.The reason why in China there is no guarantee that the Chinese government cannot access data is because China's system lacks clarity of law, oversight mechanisms, and clear pathways for contestation. As U.S. policymakers look to strengthen our own data privacy and cybersecurity system, there are important lessons we can learn. Establishing clear authorities and oversight capacity enables the U.S. government to conduct legitimate national security and law enforcement investigations in such a way that upholds civil liberties and is subject to review and appeal. Here the United States has an opportunity to set out a different vision for U.S. internet governance, one that strikes the appropriate balances among national security, economic, and privacy concerns in a way that promotes strong democratic norms and protects data flow openness.The United States would be wise to spend more time working on legislation and the development of standards to better protect privacy and secure data--not just in dealing with China--but for all companies./14Lawmakers should accelerate progress on a number of bills addressing algorithmic transparency, strengthening cybersecurity, and mandating higher standards for personal data.Developing a comprehensive federal privacy bill is vital to this effort, along with the creation of strong enforcement mechanisms. Inaction by the United States means ceding leadership and influence to both Europe and China in setting international standards.Moreover, without higher standards for data security and privacy, U.S. citizen data held by unregulated private companies will be more vulnerable to breaches by hackers from China.Equifax's many security issues are well-documented, such as the company's failure to patch known vulnerabilities that ultimately left exposed the data of 145 million Americans. But the hack was also conducted by a foreign government entity with sophisticated hacking capabilities and access to considerable state resources. Setting minimum standards on what data can be collected and retained by all companies will help protect U.S. personal data, regardless of whether the risk is exacerbated by a state-sponsored hacker, a data broker, or a private company transferring the data to Beijing. Companies should not even have access to so much personal data in the first place that can be hacked or transmitted back to Beijing.(2.2) How to address cyber risk from China in a way that strengthens global U.S. technological leadership and competitivenessWe must keep in mind that U.S. actions to respond to data security risks posed by the Chinese government are not occurring in a vacuum. Our policy approach should be tailored to take into account the fact that technology competition with China will not only play out in the United States and China, but also in other places from India to Europe. How we respond to Chinese companies operating in the United States will have ramifications for whether other countries are willing to accept our vision of data governance.The ability of U.S. firms to maintain a high rate of innovation depends upon access to global markets, talent, and, perhaps most important, datasets. But an increasingly obstacle to the ability of U.S. companies to operate internationally--beyond China--is rising data sovereignty in places from Europe to India and Vietnam. Data sovereignty refers to efforts by nation-states to ensure control over data by prohibiting transfers of data out of the country or seeking to limit foreign access to certain kinds of data./15In this context, our actions will serve as a reference and a roadmap for other governments that are concerned about U.S. companies and the U.S. government getting access their data.For example, Indian lawmakers are in the middle of debating a draft data protection bill that would require local storage and processing of Indian citizen data in an effort to boost local technology firms as well as push back against data collection by large U.S. companies./16The U.S. government and U.S. industry have lobbied against this law. In this context, the U.S. establishing (or, arguably, contributing to) a precedent of strict data localization rules risks other countries following suit.If U.S. firms cannot send data out of countries in which they operate overseas, they lose access to the value of being able to create international data sets. This directly impacts economic growth and AI innovation because of the ways large, diverse, international datasets are core to building artificial intelligence applications that work across a variety of different geographies, languages, cultures, and demographics. A language translation system only trained in China, for instance, will likely not accurately and precisely capture all of the world's spoken languages as much as a language translation system with data from many different countries. Skin cancer predictors trained only on lighter skin tones, to give another example, are likely to have poor accuracy and precision when trying to predict skin cancer with darker skin tones. Policies that leave companies without any access to global datasets under any circumstances will lead to a "fracturing" of how AI applications are developed.We have an opportunity to set the standards for protecting the flow of data that has underpinned economic growth and the free flow of information around the world, but with the right safeguards in place.The challenge, therefore, is how to maintain this openness but with the right guardrails in place.The first step is to limit companies' access and retention of data across the board, as discussed earlier.We also need to take a targeted approach to restrictions on Chinese companies. In my previous testimonies I argued for an approach based on the idea of a "small yard, high fence," borrowing a phrase used by former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to mean be selective about what we protect, yet aggressive in protecting it. The same idea should apply to restrictions on access to U.S. citizen data.The expanded powers of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)/17 provides one tool to do this. The U.S. government should evaluate the risks when a foreign firm acquires or takes a non-controlling investment stake in an American firm that holds U.S. citizen data. As my Yale colleague Rob Williams writes, CFIUS uses a case-by-case approach to evaluate risk, best understood as a scalpel and not a sledge hammer./18Whether through CFIUS or other policy tools, any new restrictions must take a risk-based approach. Not all data has the same level of sensitivity. The mere fact that a Chinese company handles U.S. citizen data in and of itself may not necessarily warrant banning a transaction or blacklisting a specific company. The U.S. national security risks should be evaluated based on an investigation (with regular audits) to determine (a) what kind of U.S. citizen data is being accessed (e.g., metadata, images, geographic data, critical infrastructure data, etc.), (b) how that data is being used and what data protection measures are in place to protect the rights and interests of U.S. consumers, and (c) with whom that data is being shared and through what mechanisms. If based on the outcomes of such an evaluation, we cannot verify that the interests and rights of U.S. consumers will be protected, then that company should be prohibited from storing and sharing U.S. personal data.In short, we need a more effective strategy to protect U.S. personal data than one-off bans on companies or where they send their data. We need to address legitimate national security risks where they exist but as one part of a broader U.S. initiative on comprehensive data privacy and higher standards for cybersecurity for all companies (whether U.S. or foreign). These efforts should not name China as a bad actor, but instead create a high bar for how all companies manage their data. Failure to establish a compelling vision for U.S. internet governance will only allow more space around the world for companies controlled by the CCP to flourish worldwide, and Beijing's vision for the internet with it.* * *Footnotes:1.

COTTON SLAMS CHINESE GOVERNMENT FOR POOR CORONAVIRUS RESPONSEStates News ServiceMarch 4, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1361 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton:Yesterday, the Senate passed my resolution to honor the life of Li Wenliang, the Chinese doctor who heroically tried to warn his fellow citizens and the world about the Wuhan coronavirus late last year.Dr. Li tragically fell victim to that very diseasebut not before he was victimized by his own government, the Chinese Communist Party.Li was 34 years old when he passed away of coronavirus on February 7th. He had a wife, a young child, and another young child on the way. His whole life was ahead of him. And now his wife is widowed, his child has no father, and his second child will never know his father.But as Li knew, when you become a doctor you pledge to care for the sick and the dyingwhatever the hardships, whatever the cost, whatever the risks to yourself.So when patients with a severe pneumonia began appearing in Li's hospital late last year, he sounded the alarm to fellow doctors. And the Chinese Communist Party responded with lightning speednot to contain this epidemic, but to intimidate Dr. Li and attack his reputation.Local communist goons paid him a visit days later, forcing him to retract his statements and apologize for so-called "illegal behavior."China's state media piled on, denouncing Li and other whistleblowers as "rumormongers" who were spreading fear among the Chinese people.That's been the pattern of the Chinese Communist Party's response to then coronavirus from the very beginning: First coverup, and then catastrophe.When Chinese Internet users flooded social media with indignation following Dr. Li's death, their cries were scrubbed from the Internet by the Communist Party's army of censors. When a Chinese human-rights activist called for Chairman Xi to step down, he was detained and then "disappeared." When Wall Street Journal columnist Walter Russell Mead wrote a bracing article about the Chinese Communist Party's failure to contain the coronavirus, the Communist Party kicked three of the paper's reporters out of the country.The Chinese Communist Party's deception has been so thorough that its rare moments of candor, however obviously helpful, have been quickly suppressed and punished. When the number of reported infections spiked upward due to an improvement in data reporting, the Party purged local officials who were likely responsible. And after Chinese scientists gave the world a head-start in developing a vaccine by publishing the disease's genome online, what happened? Were they given awards? Were they celebrated? No, their lab was shut down the very next day. Those scientists deserved awards, they deserved a medal; instead, they were given a professional death sentence.The Chinese people have suffered greatly from this coronavirus. They're in fact the first and the worst victims of their own communist government. But now the whole world is suffering with them. Just as the bubonic plague spread to Europe via traders on the Silk Road, the Wuhan coronavirus is traveling China's New Silk Road. It turns out that the Belt and Road Initiative exports not just China's money and Chinese debt but China's viruses, as well as its repression; it threatens not only economies around the world, it threatens peoples around the world.So right next door to China, Iran is suffering a devastating outbreak of coronavirus. And birds of a feather flock together, I have to add: the mullahs in Tehran have emulated the Chinese Communist Party's shameful response to coronavirusfirst denying and then downplaying the outbreak, until it was no longer possible to ignore the bodies stacking up in clinics or the mysterious sickness spreading through the cabinet of Iran's government itself.Remember the suffering people in these countries when you hear triumphant, self-congratulatory messages coming from Chinese propaganda rags like Global Times and China Dailyor even the World Health Organization, which I have to say seems more interested in protecting the feelings of the Chinese Communist Party than protecting the health of people around world. China's propagandists are reportedly hard at work on a book exonerating Chairman Xi for his negligent response to this virus. The official line is that coronavirus is contained and China is back to work.But don't believe it. Do not believe the hype. The Chinese Communist Party lied from the very beginning of this outbreak, and it's lying still. It is responsible for the scale of this virus outbreak around the world. This outbreak didn't happen in spite of the Chinese Communists' efforts to contain it, it happened because of the communist system of government.Three months later, we still don't know how many people have been infected or killed by coronavirus on the Chinese mainland. All we have are bogus statistics that just so happen to track perfectlyperfectlywith the Communist Party line day after day. I'll cite just one example: Barron's, the financial publication, discovered that the official number of deaths could be predicted perfectly in advancein advance, in Chinausing a simple mathematical formula. This coronavirus isn't just contagious and deadly, it's good at math, as well, if you believe the Chinese Communist Party. But that doesn't just happen in nature. They're obviously cooking their books.It's not hard to see why. China's economy has ground to a halt. The Chinese Communist Party is desperate to restart it and avoid the first contraction in the last 30 years, whatever it may cost in lives of the Chinese people. If China is truly "back to work," as the Chinese Communists claim, that's only because it has employed communist tactics that evoke the worst horrors of Soviet communism, from Stalin's Five-Year Plans to Leningrad, 1943. After shutting down almost half the country's factories to stop the spread of coronavirus, the Chinese Communist Party is opening them again barely one month later. Investors around the world, beware: that decision is motivated not by confidence but by desperation. It will almost certainly lead to more outbreaks, as workers congregate on crowded subways and factory floorsall because the Chinese Communist Party mandarins, living safely behind armed guards and walls in Beijing, decided that hitting their growth target was more important than the peasants' lives.When I first called for travel restrictions on China back in late January, Dr. Li was still alive and coronavirus was thankfully far from our shores. Tragically it's now a global disease, and we have to do all we can to arrest its spread.The most vital thing China can do is still be open and transparent about the origins and extent of coronavirus. I say to the Chinese Communist Party: stop hiding behind your fake numbers and politically correct bureaucrats at the World Health Organization. Let truly independent experts into Wuhan to investigate this virus. The United States has offered repeatedlyrepeatedlyto send a team and would do so tomorrow, if you would just have the humanity to let them in and help save your own people. Finally, give those people the freedom to speak candidly about the disease that has devastated your nation. Do not stifle the next whistleblower, the next doctor, the next nurse, who speaks up to save the lives, not just of their own people, but of people around the world.Here in America, only time will tell how this virus will run its course. We have many advantages, though, to help us in the fight. We have the world's best doctors, nurses, and health-care professionals. As important: we live in a republic that protects the liberty of our citizens and gives every American the freedom to speak, to write, dissent, to sound an alarmloudly sound an alarmwhen we see something that isn't right and we think we can make it right.Tragically for himself, for his family, and for the world, Dr. Li Wenliang enjoyed no such freedom, yet he still spoke up to try to save his neighbors and to save the world. For that he was punished and now he has passed.May he rest in peace, and may his memory inspire other selfless heroes who will speak truth and hold the Chinese Communist Party to account, no matter the cost.Load-Date: March 4, 2020End of Document

Chinese Propaganda Has Infected Daily Mail's Coronavirus CoverageThe Daily CallerMarch 26, 2020 Thursday 01:56 AM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; investigative-group; investigative-groupLength: 1692 wordsByline: Chuck Ross, Investigative Reporter, chuck@dailycaller.comChuck Ross is a reporter at The Daily Caller.Author ImageBodyLink to Image• A prominent British news outlet widely read in the U.S. has recently published multiple stories about the coronavirus pandemic based on information from the Communist Party of China's official newspaper and other propaganda outlets. • The Daily Mail this week published stories that pushed the communist party's line that the new cases of coronavirus that have appeared in China came from travelers from overseas. • A Daily Caller News Foundation investigation found that the Daily Mail struck a content-sharing partnership in 2015 with People's Daily, the Chinese communist party's propaganda mill. • The Daily Mail's owner has bragged about attending a “high-level gathering of senior Chinese business leaders and officials.”The Daily Mail, the popular British tabloid widely read in the United States, has published dozens of articles in recent months about coronavirus that were based on stories originating from People's Daily, the communist party's official newspaper, and other Chinese propaganda mills.A Daily Caller News Foundation investigation found that the Daily Mail has published thousands of articles in recent years as part of a content-sharing agreement with People's Daily.Whether that agreement is explicitly in place now is unclear, but the tabloid has nonetheless cited Chinese government news outlets extensively in its coverage of coronavirus. The Daily Mail did not return multiple requests for commentOn Monday, the Daily Mail published a story with the headline: “Beijing's leading doctor warns of a NEW coronavirus outbreak in China after the country reported its first case of someone 'catching the illness from a person returning from abroad.'”The story, which had a massive 1.1 million shares on social media, cited comments that Li Lanjuan, a top Chinese government doctor, gave to People's Daily and China News, another government-controlled outlet. (RELATED: Media Rhetoric On 'Wuhan Virus' Echoes Chinese Propaganda)“One of China's top coronavirus experts has warned that the nation is facing a second outbreak due to the increasing number of infections detected among new arrivals from abroad,” reads the Daily Mail piece, written by Tracy You.Lanjuan said she was “very worried that imported cases could trigger another large-scale epidemic in our country,” the story said. Beijing's leading doctor warns of a NEW coronavirus outbreak in China https://t.co/vYfMd0e6md - Daily Mail Online (@MailOnline)            March 24, 2020The report posits that China had completely contained coronavirus within its borders and that a Turkish citizen infected with the virus reintroduced it into the country.The Chinese government has been accused of covering up its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which began to spread out of the Wuhan province in November 2019.Health experts have accused Beijing of fudging           data on the number of cases and deaths in Wuhan and greater China.Chinese officials and state-controlled outlets have also waged a campaign to shift blame for coronavirus on other nations, including the U.S. and Italy, two of the countries hardest hit by the disease.“The problem is, how do we know if we can trust their numbers or not? All we know is that they'd lied about their numbers before,” a national security and foreign policy expert at Heritage Foundation, James Jay Carafano, told the DCNF.The Daily Mail has published multiple other stories spouting the Chinese government line that other nations are sending new coronavirus cases back to China.On Monday, it ran a story headlined “U.K. is now worst offender for sending cases to China.” The article, also written by You, cited China News's claim that travelers from the U.K. “imported” more than one-third of 107 new coronavirus cases reported in Beijing.Link to ImageChina's President Xi Jinping waves to the press. (PAVEL GOLOVKIN/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)On Tuesday, the site published a story citing a report from the Global Times, a tabloid affiliated with People's Daily, claiming that a second wave of the pandemic in China “is 'INEVITABLE' due to loopholes in the health screening for people arriving from abroad.”The website for People's Daily pushes an even harder line of propaganda.On March 13, People's Daily published a story based on tweets from            Chinese Foreign Minister Lijian Zhao alleging that the U.S. military spread coronavirus in China.“It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan,” Zhao tweeted.“U.S. is the creator of human right [sic] disasters” reads a March 23 article on its website.The U.S. Justice Department requires People's Daily's New York-based distributor, Hai Tian Development, to register as a foreign agent of China.“The 'political activities' carried out by Registrant for the principal involved in the 'dissemination of political propaganda,'” reads Hai Tian Development's most recent filing.“The People's Daily Overseas Edition is the official newspaper of the government of the People's Republic of China,” the filing reads. “The text of the publications are directly and solely under the discretion of the government officials in China.”While mainstream news organizations in the U.S., U.K. and other democratic nations sometimes cite stories from organizations like Russia's RT or Sputnik, there is a general aversion to relying heavily on their work. (RELATED: Elite American Institutions Keep Bowing To China)The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal have all also come under criticism for publishing paid inserts from China Daily that are designed to look like legitimate news articles.The Daily Mail has gone far beyond simply blurbing the occasional People's Daily story.In 2015, Jonathan Harmsworth, a British aristocrat who owns Daily Mail's parent company, DMGT, touted a visit he made to People's Daily to arrange a content-sharing agreement between the two organizations.“While in China I was delighted to visit People's Daily and discuss their collaboration to share news stories with MailOnline,” Harmsworth wrote in the company's 2015 annual report.He also bragged in the report about his access to senior Chinese officials.“DMGT was one of very few global businesses invited to this high-level gathering of senior Chinese business leaders and officials, reflecting our efforts to build strong foundations and relationships in the region,” he wrote.Daily Mail editorial director Martin Clarke told The Guardian in 2016 that the arrangement with People's Daily was “basically a copy-swap” that did not involve any cash transactions.“We take about 40 stories a week from The People's Daily and they can take a similar number from us. There is no cash involved,” he told The Guardian.“As the most populous nation on earth, and one of its most dynamic economies, China is an increasing source of stories for outward-looking global publishers like Mail Online. We believe this relationship broadens our coverage there and also helps us better understand the country's social and political structures,” Clarke said.A review of Daily Mail's website shows the company published more than 3,000 articles between March 10, 2015, and March 16, 2018, that explicitly disclosed which articles were published as part of the content agreement with People's Daily.You, the reporter who published the recent coronavirus content, wrote nearly 360 articles under the People's Daily banner.Many of those articles were lighthearted clickbait, such an April 20, 2015, story about a Chinese farmer's six-legged goat, or            a Jan. 11, 2018, story about a one-legged municipal road worker in Xi'an who is also deaf and mute.Link to ImageDaily Mail banner for story published April 18, 2016, disclosing People's Daily partnership. (Screenshot)The coverage has shifted to more serious topics amid the coronavirus pandemic.Carafano, the Heritage Foundation national security and foreign policy expert, said it is “very typical” for Chinese propaganda to start as benign stories that carry no overt political spin.“They start very innocuously with sports sports, soccer stories, and then they suddenly roll in their editorial content,” he said. “That's very common.”He said that most Chinese propaganda that appears in the West is “pretty restrained,” offering up content that lightly praises the government and avoids taking the U.S. government head on.“There has been a recent change, though,” especially during the coronavirus outbreak, he said.The communist party's media organs have begun “spinning mendacious narratives” about coronavirus, said Carafano, “like this all started in Italy, and China's leading the way, the virus came from the United States.”“That's a new phase in Chinese propaganda warfare.”Carafano also said that the Chinese government has long maintained media partnerships with foreign outlets, especially in Africa.“Expanding this into new markets like the Daily Mail, they're basically expanding a tactic that they've been using for a couple years now,” he told the DCNF. “It is building on a trend that we've seen that we just don't pay much attention to in certain places, particularly in Africa.”The latest Daily Mail stories do not include a banner identifying the content as originating from People's Daily. It is not clear if the copy-swap agreement is still in place.Not all of the Daily Mail's coronavirus coverage has put the Chinese government in a positive light, and its stories often note that People's Daily and China News are affiliated with the Chinese government.On March 9, the Daily Mail published a story about the death of four Chinese doctors who worked alongside Dr. Li Wenliang, an opthamologist who worked in Wuhan who spread to the world about a coronavirus outbreak there in December 2019.Wenliang was reprimanded by the Chinese government, which accused him of peddling rumors about the virus. He died from coronavirus on Feb. 7.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

SPLC AND PARTNERS DEFEND CHINA OVER CORONAVIRUSStates News ServiceApril 1, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1194 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Capital Research Center (CRC):by Ashley Rae GoldenbergThe coronavirus pandemic is not slowing down the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) or its partners. One partner organization is claiming measures to stop the spread of the virus are leading to a rise in exposure to white nationalism, while the SPLC is defending China against what it calls "anti-China coronavirus rhetoric" and "anti-Chinese fearmongering."Western States CenterThe Western States Center (WSC) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to "inclusive democracy" and produces resources similar to the SPLC's, such as toolkits called "Confronting White Nationalism in School" and "Indigenizing Love." WSC executive director Eric K. Ward discussed his organization's partnership with the SPLC in a March 22 piece titled "Who Are We, America?" hosted on the SPLC website.In this piece on the SPLC website, Ward portrayed America at a crossroads because of the coronavirus and the "authoritarian-tinged" Trump administration. In Ward's hypothetical America, a coronavirus-induced future can either be one with a new "civil rights movement" or one in which Americans "allow the pandemic to pour fuel on demographic anxiety and ignite xenophobic policies and anti-Asian violence."Ward's piece also attempts to contrast the WSC's and SPLC's work with the "fearmongers" politicizing the coronavirus pandemic (which is somehow unlike WSC's and SPLC's politicization of the coronavirus pandemic):We are proud of our partnership with SPLC to challenge the fearmongers and those who would use hate, violenceand a global health crisisto fan the flames of exclusion. SPLC ensures that untold numbers of activists and organizers will have the tools and knowledge they need to ignite the 21st century civil rights movement.Inventing a White Nationalist EpidemicMeanwhile, the WSC and the SPLC are fanning fear by pretending there is a widespread white nationalist epidemic and by kowtowing to an actual authoritarian regime to preserve the appearance of political correctness.Just days before Ward's piece went live on the SPLC website, Ward was on a phone call to discuss the SPLC's "Year in Hate" report. According to Rolling Stone, during the phone call, Ward blamed social distancing measures for an increase in people potentially being exposed to white nationalist rhetoric. He claimed there is a "huge uptick" in white nationalist content and therefore possibly people seeing white nationalist content. "A lot of it is happening on YouTube platforms and videos and others, at a time where much of the country is sheltering in place or practicing social distancing," he said. "Ironically, it will serve to give these individuals much more access [to an audience] than they would normally have." These comments by Ward led Rolling Stone to run the headline "How Social Distancing Could Lead to a Spike in White Nationalism." Yet YouTube's community guidelines ban content the site deems "hateful." YouTube intentionally reduces the reach of "supremacist content" and bans outright any content that YouTube moderators believe supports discrimination, so it is unclear what content Ward is speaking about, much less how long it stayed online before it was flagged and removed.Rolling Stone also quoted Ward preemptively blaming Trump for any future increase in violence against Asian Americans because, according to Ward, Trump is being "irresponsible" by calling the viruswhich originated in Chinaa Chinese virus. Ward said, "We have an irresponsible president who is continuing to refer to COVID-19 as a Chinese virus. That is intentional, and in a time of great panic and fear that will only lead to physical violence being expressed."The SPLC's Latest PropagandaThe SPLC has gone farther than the Western States Center in defending China. On March 20, the SPLC issued a response to what it called "Trump's Racist and Xenophobic Attacks on Asians" by referring to the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus." On the same day, the SPLC issued a press release titled "Trump's Racist Response to COVID-19 Endangers All Americans, Including Immigrants."On March 24, SPLC's Hatewatch ran the story "Hate Group Leaders, Antigovernment Extremists Push Anti-China Coronavirus Rhetoric." Throughout the article, the SPLC repeatedly cast doubt on the virus's origins in China and the Chinese government's role in covering up the extent of the virus, calling these topics "xenophobic" and "anti-Chinese fearmongering." Examples of the language in the Hatewatch piece include (emphasis added):The groups accuse China of trying to blame the virus, which the letter refers to as the "Wuhan Coronavirus," on the U.S. China has politicized the virus, according to the letter. . . .The letter also plays into the xenophobic narratives that have been swirling around the global public health crisis as countries try to cope with the spread of the virus. The letter urges the Trump administration to investigate the Chinese government's supposed mishandling of the virus. . . .Political reactions to the coronavirus pandemic have been mired with xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment, much of which has come from the Trump administration and other government officials. Trump has referred to it as the "China Virus" on Twitter. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, a Trump supporter and former Senate majority whip, made ethnocentric comments in an interview, saying it was no surprise the virus was traced back to China "because of some of the cultural practices there." . . .The anti-Chinese fearmongering has spanned multiple ideologies across the radical right, as evidenced by the Media Research Center's letter.The Media Research Center LetterHowever, the actual text of the letter from the Media Research Center (MRC) to Trump (disclosure: this author previously worked for MRC) reads much differently. In the letter, MRC and the co-signers urged Trump to formally investigate the coronavirus, mentioning the Chinese government's role in suppressing information about the virus. The letter also mentions how Chinese propagandists have blamed Trump and the United States for the crisis.Given the letter was about an investigation into the virus and the authoritarian Chinese government's role in suppressing information about the virusand says nothing at all about Chinese Americansthe SPLC appears to be using its unfounded accusations of xenophobia and fearmongering to defend the Chinese government.China's Useful IdiotsWhen people are already scared for their physical safety, organizations such as the WSC and SPLC are adding fuel to the fire by pretending hordes of people are suddenly watching hateful content online and engaging in hateful acts toward Asian Americans. These organizations are trying to justify their existence by asserting that criticism of the Chinese government and just mentioning that the coronavirus came from the Wuhan, China, are acts of hatred toward Asian people.In reality, it looks like the WSC and SPLC are carrying the water for the Chinese government, a real authoritarian regime, and using the crisis to achieve their own political goals.Ashley Rae GoldenbergLoad-Date: April 2, 2020End of Document

China Will 'Nuke Bomb' Apple Over Huawei Penalties: State MediaNewsweek.comMay 16, 2020 Saturday 6:00 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 865 wordsByline: Benjamin FearnowHighlight: The Chinese government may enforce several "countermeasures" against U.S. companies in retaliation for the Trump administration's plans to crack down on shipments of semiconductors to Huawei from chipmakers worldwide.BodyThe Chinese government may enforce several "countermeasures" against U.S. companies—including Apple—in retaliation for the Trump administration's plans to crack down on shipments of semiconductors to Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from chipmakers worldwide.According to analysts cited in the state-run Global Times, such retaliatory measures from China towards large American companies such as Apple, Cisco and Qualcomm could be akin to a "nuke bomb.""China will launch rounds of endless investigations on those firms, just like swords hanging over their head. It will dampen investors' confidence and squeeze their income in the Chinese market," an anonymous insider told the outlet. Global Times also reported Friday that government sources informed them of plans to add U.S. companies to a list of unreliable entities, if Huawei gets pinched by the U.S. government.That same day, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced new regulations strengthening the prohibition on exports of critical electronics such as semiconductors to Huawei.The action is aimed at preventing the company, which reported $100 billion in revenue in 2018, from dominating the global semiconductor market, ostensibly for national security reasons, and is only the latest move by the Trump administration to curb China's trading ability.Huawei has historically relied on U.S. technology firms to support its operations. One analyst told Reuters last year after restrictions were first announced that it would come as a surprise if the company's in-house chipmaker "can make it without any U.S. suppliers."According to an editorialin The Washington Post last October, Apple has made many compromises to do business in China that included hiding an emoji of the Taiwanese flag from its keyboard amid the Hong Kong protests; deleting Quartz from the Chinese version of its app store due to the news outlet's coverage of the protests; and removing the HKmap.live app. "Apple justifies acceding to despotic demands by arguing that it is the cost of operating in China, and that the Chinese people are better off with a big U.S. firm around than without," said the editorial.Requests for comment to Apple, the Commerce Department and the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Saturday were not returned."China should implement these countermeasures to the extent that the U.S. dare not ask for a mile after being given an inch," He Weiwen, a former senior trade official and an executive council member of the China Society for World Trade Organization Studies, told the Global Times, before suggesting the punitive measures China may be planning against the U.S. companies. He advised the Chinese government to conduct a "thorough investigation into the U.S. move and to 'let them feel the pain.'"On Wednesday, the Trump administration addedanother year to the government's export ban targeting Huawei and fellow Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE.The Global Times report Friday relied on a "source close to the Chinese government" saying China will impose restrictions against Qualcomm, Cisco and Apple. The Chinese government is also looking to suspend purchases of Boeing planes. The source repeatedly referred to the Trump administration plan to limit Huawei's global purchasing power as a "suppression" of free market trade."We must be clear that coping with U.S. suppression will be the key focus of China's national strategy. We should enhance cooperation with most countries. The U.S. is expected to contain China's international front lines, and we must knock out this U.S. plot and make China-U.S. rivalry a process of U.S. self-isolation," read the report.The Commerce Department first added Huawei and overseas affiliates to its Entity List in May 2019, requiring that a license first be obtained before exporting or transferring any electronics to the company that could have national security implications, such as computers and telecommunications equipment.There would be a "presumption of denial" for any such license, according to the department. The move substantially curtailed the ability of U.S. corporations to do business with Huawei.China responded with immediate objection, warning at the time that it would seek to create an "unreliable entity list," widely interpreted as a pretext for targeting U.S. companies.The Commerce Department said that Huawei has since worked to evade its Entity List designation, relying increasingly on in-house production or non-U.S. production enabled through U.S.-made software and technology.The new regulations announced on Friday would seek to close this loophole by requiring that any product derived from U.S.-enabled technology—which is itself already subject to export restrictions—also be licensed by the Commerce Department before shipment to Huawei."There has been a very highly technical loophole through which Huawei has been able in effect to use U.S. technology with foreign fab producers," U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told the Fox Business Network on Friday. "We believe that will have a very powerful impact because we never intended that loophole to be there."These new restrictions will not go into effect until September.Link to ImageGraphic AppleKevin Frayer/GettyCustomers gather as they take part in a class to learn how to use their iPhones at an Apple Store on January 7, 2019, in Beijing, China.

PETERS PRESSES ADMINISTRATION TO CRACK DOWN ON CHINESE GOVERNMENT OVER CORONAVIRUS VACCINE RESEARCH HACK WED, 13 MAY 2020 00:00:00 -0400States News ServiceMay 13, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 957 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, D.C. BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Minority Office:U.S. Senator Gary Peters, Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, called on the Trump Administration to take strong action against the Chinese government following reports that state-sponsored hackers attacked American hospitals and research institutions in an effort to steal information related to development of a Coronavirus vaccine. By attacking health care providers' information systems, the Chinese government put the health and safety of Americans at risk. Peters pressed the Administration to take swift action to hold the Chinese government accountable for these breaches, including threatening sanctions, as well as strengthening cybersecurity support for hospitals and research facilities at risk of further cyber-attacks."By targeting hospitals and health care providers, these state-sponsored hackers put the lives of Americans who are seeking care at risk," wrote Senator Peters. "The Administration should use public pressure and the threat of sanctions and additional indictments to deter future Chinese government attacks against research institutions. In the event China's government directly threatens the lives of Americans through actions against hospitals, other Department of Defense capabilities should be considered to make it clear that there will be consequences for these actions."As Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a member of the bipartisan Senate Cybersecurity Caucus, Peters has led efforts to bolster our nation's cybersecurity defenses. Last year, the U.S. Senate unanimously approved Peters' bipartisan legislation to promote stronger cybersecurity coordination between the Department of Homeland Security and state and local governments. The Senate also passed a Peters-led bill to develop and retain highly-skilled cybersecurity professionals in the federal workforce.Peters has also worked to address America's overreliance on China for critical drugs, personal protective equipment and medical supplies needed to address the Coronavirus pandemic. In a 2019 report, Peters raised concerns and recommended actions to address vulnerabilities in our medical supply chain, including shortages for prescription drugs, masks, gloves, and vaccine delivery devices, which are compounded by the United States' dependence on foreign manufacturers like China.Text of Peters' letter is copied below and available here:May 12, 2020Mr. President,I am concerned about recent reported Chinese government sponsored cyber-attacks against the United States and I urge you to take necessary action to mitigate this threat in the future.The Chinese government has reportedly sponsored attacks against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), hospitals, research laboratories, health care providers, and pharmaceutical companies with the goal of stealing COVID-19 treatment and vaccine research. By targeting hospitals and health care providers, these state-sponsored hackers put the lives of Americans who are seeking care at risk.In a March 6, 2019 hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I raised concerns that the federal government has failed to invest effectively in cybersecurity protections and warned that past breaches have shown the severe consequences of inadequate cybersecurity investments. HHS manages massive quantities of sensitive medical research and personal data. Continued cybersecurity deficiencies in our government systems are inexcusible and require immediate attention and additional resources.We should also work to improve the security of state, local, and private sector institutions that are researching COVID-19. Given the life and death consequences of information related to the COVID- 19 pandemic, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) should prioritize their cybersecurity support to safeguard our health care sector.Finally, the United States must communicate a strong message to China's government that this behavior is unacceptable. The Administration should use public pressure and the threat of sanctions and additional indictments to deter future Chinese government attacks against research institutions. In the event China's government directly threatens the lives of Americans through actions against hospitals, other Department of Defense capabilities should be considered to make it clear that there will be consequences for these actions.I urge you to take all necessary measures to protect government and private sector medical institutions working to save lives and develop treatments and a vaccine for COVID-19. These measures should include:Directing CISA and CYBERCOM to prioritize cybersecurity support to hospitals and medical research institutions, including providing risk and vulnerability assessments and sharing cyber threat intelligence information with those organizations.Utilizing all levers of national power diplomatic, military, economic, and law enforcement to deter the Chinese government from any attacks against U.S. medical institutions and make clear that any attack on our medical systems will be treated as a significant threat to our country.Increasing cybersecurity funding as part of future COVID-19 funding requests to Congress for hospitals, medical and research institutions.Directing Secretary Azar to prioritize HHS information technology appropriations towards improvements in cybersecurity, and encouraging the Secretary to work with GAO and the HHS Inspector General to improve its cybersecurity posture.Load-Date: May 13, 2020End of Document

KOLB: It's Time To Boycott ChinaThe Daily CallerApril 9, 2020 Thursday 01:47 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: OPINIONLength: 889 wordsByline: Charles Kolb, Deputy Assistant to George H.W. Bush, ckolb@dc.comCharles Kolb was deputy assistant to the president for domestic policy from 1990-1992 in the George H.W. Bush White House & currently serves as CEO of DisruptDCAuthor ImageBodyLink to ImageActions have consequences; so do ideologies.We now know that the Chinese government took extensive steps to prevent the timely dissemination of information about the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak. Critical medical information was withheld, and medical professionals attempting to alert the public were threatened and/or silenced. An early whistleblower, a doctor in his thirties, subsequently died from the virus.These actions flowed directly from the authoritarian nature of the Chinese Communist Party and its ideology of one-party control and avoiding anything that might provoke social unrest or undermine the CCP's image and authority.The world now faces the consequences of the CCP's reprehensible behavior. Hundreds of thousands of people may die, millions face unemployment and economic hardship and trillions of dollars will be spent rebuilding economies, businesses, and infrastructure.  The human and economic toll is staggering.China must be held accountable. The United States must help ensure that: (1) there is a full accounting for the origins of the Wuhan coronavirus, (2) China faces significant economic penalties for the harm its leaders have inflicted and (3) the Chinese government commits to openness and transparency going forward.The Internet is awash with stories (some or all of which may be Fake News) that the Wuhan virus resulted from a mishap at one or more biowarfare facilities in Hubei province.  Let's determine the coronavirus' origins, its transmission and its infection and mortality rates in China and elsewhere through an independent, international commission, not the compromised, China-centric World Health Organization.Nearly 40 years ago, countries collectively enforced sanctions against South Africa to force that country's regime to end apartheid. These sanctions were morally justified and effective.Today, China engages in serious human rights violations against religious minorities, consistently disseminates unreliable data on several important international issues, blatantly steals intellectual property and erect firewalls blocking citizen access to the internet.China wants the benefits of competitive global markets while also maintaining a closed, nontransparent government and society. China cannot have it both ways. Either China commits to openness, transparency and tolerance, or it should be quarantined economically and politically like South Africa. The world now sees the harm flowing from an authoritarian, closed society. Until China alters its behavior, let's boycott Chinese goods and services.Companies should clearly identify where products are made, assembled and what components, if any, come from China. Consumers can then make informed choices.We have outsourced too many critical aspects of our economy, especially to China. We should rethink globalization, its breadth and depth.  I have long been (and remain) a globalization supporter; communications and information technology alone will ensure significant degrees of positive, global interconnectedness. But healthy globalization must also entail commitments to openness and transparency.The disruptions caused by globalization can impose significant social and economic costs that have not been properly considered by rigorous cost-benefit analysis. For decades, prominent consulting firms and others promoted maximizing shareholder value by reducing production costs and shifting labor costs to lower-cost countries.These same firms should now undertake a thorough globalization cost-benefit analysis that considers the social and economic costs, as well as the national, economic and health security implications associated with outsourcing.Life is not all “buy low, sell high.” Even the chief proponent of free-market capitalism, Adam Smith, recognized the intrinsic value and critical importance of strong, vibrant communities.  While capital today can ricochet around the world in a nanosecond, labor is far less mobile. Governments must identify those industries, goods, services (such as health care) and technologies that are national priorities.Let's be explicit about the costs (not just the benefits) associated with outsourcing: decaying urban centers, opioid addictions and related deaths (including suicides), unemployment payments and trade adjustment assistance (typically ineffective) and retraining expenses.   When those factors are considered, what's the true price of those outsourced “bargains”?Let me be clear: this concern is with the behavior of the Chinese Communist Party, not with the Chinese people or Chinese-Americans. We should welcome China as an economic competitor, much as we compete with the European Union and its member states.  But China is not France.President Trump considers Chinese president Xi Jinping his friend.  Mr. President, Xi Jinping is not your friend: he's a fierce competitor leading a government determined to supplant Western liberal democracy with Chinese authoritarian governance.China is the new South Africa. It's time to be aggressive, firm, principled and unforgiving until China changes course. Let's breach that Chinese firewall. At stake is the future of Western democracy and the liberal world order.Charles Kolb served as Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy from 1990-1992 in the George H.W.

Chinese government sends care packages to students abroad, including UMNMinnesota Daily: University of MinnesotaApril 22, 2020 WednesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 438 wordsBodyAs part of a global health initiative by the Chinese government, all Chinese international students, including those at the University of Minnesota, are eligible to receive personal protective equipment "health packages" to aid them during the COVID-19 pandemic.On March 25, China began sending packages to students studying abroad in multiple countries. The kits include KN95 masks, disposable masks, disinfectant wipes, capsules that ease coronavirus symptoms, protective gloves and disease prevention manuals.China is sending the care packages to 46 embassies in 12 countries, where Chinese embassies will then allocate them to universities or schools within their district.The Consulate-General of The People's Republic of China in Chicago sent the first batch of packages to the University of Minnesota's Chinese Students and Scholars Association, which is in charge of allocating the kits to University students. The Consulate General of China in Chicago coordinated the packages' distribution by the number of students in a given area and the severity of the local epidemic.There will be at least 2,000 health packages sent to the University, according to a staff member in the Chicago embassy.In the 2018-19 school year, there were more than 2,500 Chinese international students registered at the University - the largest demographic of international students on campus.Zijian Jia, a University senior from China, said he was happy that the Chinese government sent these packages."I just feel like someone is concerned about me," Jia said. "Just this kind of feeling, I don't know how to describe it."The University's CSSA created a Google Form for Chinese international students and underage Chinese students near the University to register for a care package. Chinese students holding an F-1 or J-1 visa will be allowed to register.CSSA announced it has received the first batch of packages. All the parcels will be collected and sterilized before being picked up by students."Since Minnesota is not the worst state in terms of the pandemic, the consulate has to give priority to those states that are in critical condition," CSSA said in a statement earlier this month.University Ph.D. student Yichang Liu from the Carlson School of Management said he felt deeply touched when he heard the news."As a Ph.D. student who is currently teaching an undergraduate course, I'm not able to return to China right now," Liu said. "However, the health kits make me and my friends feel the love and care from our home country. I hope that the coronavirus will die out soon and that people all around the world stay healthy and well."Load-Date: April 22, 2020End of Document

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo certifying to Congress yesterday that Hong Kong no longer enjoys a high degree of autonomy from China a move that could result in a loss of Hong Kong's special trading status with the United States. Threatening its standing as an International Financial Hub.Joining me right now is the Founder of Atlas Organization, he is Author of the book "China's Vision of Victory" Dr. Jonathan Ward this morning also with us this morning Fox Businesses' Dagen McDowell campusreform.org Editor and Chief Cabot Phillips and Strategic Wealth Partners President and CEO Mark Tepper. Great to see you everybody this morning thank you so much for being here.Jonathan, let's kick it off with you here. And I want to get your take on the significance of Secretary Pompeo coming out and noting that there's no longer the autonomy that we expected in Hong Kong relative to China. Also assess the situation of where we are today in Hong Kong?JONATHAN D.T. WARD, ATLAS ORGANIZATION FOUNDER: Absolutely good morning. So I mean, this an important statement because essentially China has torn up the joint declaration with Britain in the handover 1997. I mean, this was supposed to happen in 2047, you know 50 years from that date, Hong Kong would become fully part of the People's Republic of China.And at this point they're going to enforce all the sort of national security measures that you see in much more troubled places, like Schengen and Tibet. So, you know, it is the end of one country two systems. I think the United States is recognizing that and that opens door for action against the Chinese regime as they start to move forward on their oppression of Hong Kong.And most importantly I think the moves that we have to make, have to do with cutting off capital flows into China. At the end of the day, this regime is pressing on every front from India to the South China Sea, Schengen they are doing horrible things up there and, now, of course, into Hong Kong, sort of it in unrestricted way.So we can no longer be funding this regime through western capital. So Hong Kong's status as Global Financial Centers is you know chiefly about bringing capital into China and working out to stop those capital flows.BARTIROMO: In fact, I believe Senator Kennedy's bill passed committee yesterday and that bill focuses on those Chinese companies that are trading on U.S. exchange, Jonathan, I'm talking about the - the ADR's of Chinese companies trading on NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange and he says if they do not follow the accounting standards of the United States, they should be yanked off of those exchange. That bill did pass committee yesterday.WARD: Right, China for a long time has considered their accounting to be what they call a national security issue. So they don't reveal that. They consider it state secret. But we have to go further because at the end of the day, you and I have been talking about civil military fusion for about a year now and you have all of these regimes that are owned by the state that are doing the biding of the state that are you know at this point going around the world on Belton Road funded by big Chinese banks and you know building up the infrastructure of China's global power.So we have to start cutting off anything that's linked to civil military fusion anything that's linked to the repression inside China whether that's in Hong Kong or in Schengen or Tibet, that means a lot of tech companies, have been certain banks it means some you know programs that are actually building up their military and then stifling off civilian innovation and bringing up the military sector.A long list of companies and many of those companies are being funded through things like MCI and - so we're going to have to start working on that entire list.BARTIROMO: What about the issue of intellectual property theft to Jonathan, the Trump Administration reportedly planning to cancel the visas of thousands of Chinese graduate students and researchers in the United States if they have ties to military schools. That's according to "The New York Times".Now you know that Senator Tom Cotton and Senator Marsha Blackburn have unveiled a new bill which would block Chinese nationals from receiving visas to study science and engineering fields in the United States. The bill basically prohibits Chinese nationals from receiving visas from the U.S. for graduate or postgraduate studies in STEM fields.It would place restrictions on participants in Chinese foreign talent recruitment programs as well such as the Thousands Talent Program. Talk to us about that.WARD: Well, you definitely have to go after the Thousands Talents Program and this is something that the FBI has been aware for a while. I mean, it is a global prudent program. It's basically - it's the design is to have foreigners serve China, that's sort of the agenda, the idea.So you have to crack down on that and we have to do with our allies and partners around the world. It's not just directed to the United States, it's global. At the same time we have to have a much a very careful scrutiny of anybody who is linked in a certain way to the regime and coming into programs that could have dual use purposes.So we have to look at all of that. But again, actual human activities only religious one dimension of China's global Intellectual Property Theft Program. I mean, the other sides of it cyber I mean, companies are going to need to harden themselves against intrusions by particularly in sensitive areas and strategic industries and that's only going to get worse as we try to cut aspects and economic ties to China.We can still do a lot of this through cyber. You know you have to go after the whole picture now and understand their strategic goals. I mean, they are still working on made in China 2025. They still seek to dominate ten different strategic industries from ICT to Biotech to shipping and aerospace. So they've made very clear what they are after so that's going to make the target list a lot easier for us.BARTIROMO: Right. At the same time - yes, go ahead.WARD: At this point, I think the first thing Maria is every CEO in America needs to rethink their China strategy. If growing in the China market is your base case for growth you need a new strategy for 2020s. At this point U.S.-China relations are essentially ending. I mean, at this point, you know the diplomatic relationship has - going very badly. They are calling Secretary Pompeo an enemy of humanity. You know the military relationship--BARTIROMO: Well, it's hard to differentiate - it's hard to differentiate what students are here to actually learn and - and create value and stay here and which students are just tied to the Chinese communist government and are stealing data and it goes right back to Chinese government?And then you look at the map of the world. First you've got the Hong Kong situation where China is - the Chinese Communist Party is starting an overreach there, you have got an overreach in the South China Sea. The Chinese Communist Party militarizing the China, South China Sea.And then you've got India, these troops at the border, India and China, militaries from both countries in a bitter standoff right now in Northern India with China reportedly moving thousands of troops to the area, in response Delhi is mobilizing army units to the volatile boarder region.The scene of confrontations between two countries earlier this month President Trump says that the U.S. is ready and willing to mediate, Jonathan, your specialty is China and India, how do you read this?WARD: Well, I think this is very significant. I mean, China and India had a very troubled relationship. They fought at border war in 1962 it changed the relationship forever. They were trying to be friends coming out of Indian Independence and the founding of the People's Republic of China.And it has been tense ever since, and you see in sort of increasing pattern to these border crisis. I mean, you had - in 2017 and - 2013 but they usually take shape in one sector on the border. This time it's both the western sector and the central sector and the central sector has been traditional more stable.So at this point all of the infrastructure building that's going on, on both sides as they both increase capabilities for border defense. I mean, this is starting to lead to the kind of tension that you actually have ahead of the big border war in 1962.So at this point China - we have to remember that China - we have to see what they can sustain. You the global pressure of Coronavirus as pandemic and then you have China pushing on all these different fronts including being willing to sacrifice their relationships with the United States and with India.I mean, generally speaking they are fighting a two-front strategic contest with the U.S. in the Pacific and India in the Indian Ocean and across the Himalayan border.BARTIROMO: Okay.WARD: They're trying to push on both of these at once. So we should have India's back on this. That's the key thing as for America to go and be the best partner we can in this moment.BARTIROMO: Well, the President said that we are ready to mediate. He did not go further than that, but this is a situation. We need to be watching for sure. Jonathan, it is good to see you, always great insights from you thank you sir.WARD: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We will keep watching and we will see you soon. Dr. Jonathan Ward, joining us from Atlas. We're just getting started this morning. We've got a big show this morning, I will speak to Focus Brands CEO Jim Holthouser on reshaping the restaurant industry after this pandemic, wait till you hear what he says about how things will be different when we get out of this?At 7:00 am this morning Arizona Senator Martha McSally is here to discuss China's controversial national security law over Hong Kong, also here SeaWorld Entertainment Interim CEO Marc Swanson joins me with his insights as the park details its plans to reopen to the public.And then in the 8:00 am hour Former National Economic Council Director and Former Goldman Sachs President and COO Gary Cohen is here with the expectation of the economic recovery U.S. Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia reacting to a slow economic data out this morning at 8:30 am including those jobless claims April Durable Goods and the GDP.And then Starwood Capital Group Chairman and CEO Barry Stainless weigh in on the state of the travel industry and reopening of America. Don't miss a moment of that we've got a big show coming up. Quick break and we will be right back.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, markets are mixed this morning, Futures indicating a mixed opening with the DOW Industrials up but the other indices lower. Take a look, Futures showing a gain of 87 points on the DOW, the S&P Futures are down about 1 point, the NASDAQ Futures lower by 50 points right now.U.S. stock markets focusing on reopening certainly as well as hopes of a Coronavirus vaccine and treatment this as key economic data is out this morning, jobless claims, first quarter GDP, at the second read, both due out at 8:30 am Eastern estimates calling for an additional 2.1 million jobless claims last week.American Airlines and Boeing announcing additional layoffs meanwhile in the midst of the COVID-19 economic downturn. Joining us right now to talk about investing in all of this is Cornerstone Macros Chief Investment Strategist Michael Kantrowitz. Michael, it's always great to see you, thank you so much for being here.MICHAEL KANTROWITZ, CORNERSTONE MACRO CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: Good morning.BARTIROMO: So your reaction now to all 50 states having some opening at this point. What is it doing in terms of economic activity that you see and compare that with the backdrop for this market activity as well?KANTROWITZ: We're starting to see - we have already seen some early signs of U.S. recovery in housing data which is typically the data and second of the economy that makes up first. That's actually being quite strong; data like NBA purchase index has recovered almost back to levels that were before Coronavirus.And so housing is usually a first sector to pick up and then you typically see others leading indicators like PMI data. And you've seen federal data in the Empire Feds those covers part of the Northeast the Philadelphia business outlook as well as improved and we're seeing the Richmond Fed has also improved.So slowly around the country we are going from data at we're at depressionary levels to better levels and certainly that's something that's help to lift the markets in recent weeks.BARTIROMO: Michael, you think we have seen the worst in terms of economic hit? Don't you?KANTROWITZ: Yes, absolutely. We've got kind of a trifecta going on right now. And in a way is as good as it gets. We have got a tremendous amount of global stimulus. We've had good news on the virus in general. We are opening up.And then now we are actually seeing the data improve so for the time being we think this is right now as good as it gets and know that the markets more or less fairly valued and that the risks are more symmetric certainly than two months ago when the market was a lot lower.BARTIROMO: So then how do you invest in this environment, Michael? I mean, we've talked a lot about growth and you certainly have been following growth but a lot of these growth names, technology stocks have been seeing valuations that are somewhat outsized compared the valuations to actual reality of growth.KANTROWITZ: yes, what was interesting was that year to date, from the beginning of the year, into lower the market growth strategies including defense outperformed by a landslide and then on the recovery, something that's very unique and probably because the recovery in the market is more about stimulus than initially better data.It was growth stocks that also continued to lead the way on that recovery and so right now there's a big debate on Wall Street about is it time to get back into value and other cyclical cheaper parts of the markets?Than the one issue we have with that right now is that the market has done a lot of the heavy lifting, a lot of the low-hanging fruits, gains are behind us. And so from here to expect to see riskier stocks outperform I think it is going to be a high bar.BARTIROMO: Okay, so don't - don't expect the riskier names to outperform. Michael, it is great to get your insights as always. Thank you so much.KANTROWITZ: All right, thanks Maria. Bye.BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon Michael Kantrowitz. We will be right back. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back, Facebook Founder Mark Zuckerberg weighing in the Twitter fact checking controversy. Social media mogul says that Facebook would handle the situation differently. In an interview with Fox News Dana Perino airing later today watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Twitter decided for the first time ever to fact check one of President Trump's tweets. I wonder if you thought that the Twitter may have made the wrong decision here.MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK, FOUNDER & CEO: We have a different policy I think than twitter on this. You know I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online. I think in general private companies probably shouldn't be or especially these platform companies shouldn't be in the position of doing that.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Meanwhile President Trump is preparing his own response reportedly drafting an executive order which will curtail legal protections which currently shield the technology giants from liability for what gets posted on their platforms.Dagen McDowell, could this move spell trouble for both companies? This is an issue that you been talking about for years in terms of liability shields that the technology, social media companies have in place currently.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: This shield has been in place since 1996. It is section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and it prevents social media companies platforms like Facebook, Twitter even YouTube and other sites from bearing any legal liability for what their users post.Okay, so Twitter, you're going to be a publisher but you still want legal protection that you're not a publisher; you can't have it both ways. I will point out that in this draft order that President Trump could introduce today, that this is something that actually Adam Schiff had got behind about a year ago.This has been front and center in front of Congress for a year or even longer. That's why Mark Zuckerberg is speaking out and just a couple of things about Twitter and then getting religion about the President's tweets.Well, one of the men who works on the post policing team is a hard leftist who has compared Kellyanne Conway to propaganda administer of the Nazi Regime Joseph. So let's point that out.This gentleman is on the front page of "The New York Post" today, also if Twitter is going to fact-check the President of the United States, try to fact-check China and their ministers of misinformation and disinformation because Twitter only put in a fact-check on the spokesman for the Communist Party after they were hammered by "The New York Post".And this was a post related to saying that the United States started the Coronavirus. So if they are going to stand up and try and crack down on speech in this country, then those liability protections are going to go away for Twitter and Facebook potentially. That's why Zuckerberg is concerned.BARTIROMO: I think most people see this as total political politics. I think what you're saying right now people understand and particularly what is on their face to actually not call out Chinese Communist Party and what they're doing really to the world.Mark Tepper jumps in here because if these protections are removed, the lawsuits will likely begin will Twitter survive? What does this mean for investments around these social media companies?MARK TEPPER, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS, PRESIDENT & CEO: Yes, I mean they are playing with fire here and, you know, President Trump is being very reasonable about his position. There's no doubt that there's more censorship when it comes to conservative post.And he's just merely trying to level the playing field on how information is being spread via the internet? If you see a company like Twitter censoring everything that has a conservative tilt to it, that's - people aren't going to want to utilize Twitter.So their daily average users are going to go down and when something like that is happening to a company like Twitter where daily engagement means everything to them, their stock price is going to suffer. So certainly there's a big issue there with what they are doing.BARTIROMO: And by the way, I think that the conservatives would like to see the market take care of this so it may very well that a competitor comes in and starts taking market share and that's what you want, you want free markets to take care of the problem rather than big government but we will likely see big government come up with new legislation.We will take a break, when we come back the crack-down on China deepens. Beijing is imposing national security laws over Hong Kong and its freedom. The Trump Administration is taking action.Then opening the gates, the world's biggest theme parks beginning to roll out the red carpets to visitors we've got their plans for reopening, that's next. Stay with us.MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS HOST, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Good morning. Welcome back. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, May 28. Your top stories right now, it is 6:32 a.m. on the East coast.US, China tensions are rising once again. Beijing has approved a security law that strips freedoms from the people of Hong Kong. The White House is considering action and condemning this move.Meanwhile markets are mixed this morning. Take a look at futures indicating a gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but weakness elsewhere. The Dow is up 106 points. The S&P 500 just slipped into positive territory with a point move higher and the NASDAQ is lower by 35 points. Markets surged yesterday, meanwhile the Dow closing above 25,000 for the first time since March 10th. It was a triple digit move with the Dow, the NASDAQ and the S&P 500 now up better than 35 percent from their lows which were hit on March 23rd. Yesterday up 553 points at the close on Wall Street for the Dow.Global markets this morning are mixed. Mostly higher in Europe, though, take a look at European indices. The European Union has proposed a $2 trillion dollar response to the pandemic. It still needs the backing of all 27 member states. Right now, the FT100's up 41 points. The Quatre Quarante is up 37 and the DAX Index in Germany higher by 53.In Asia overnight markets were mixed. Investors are bouncing. The optimism over the economies reopening and economic activity with the concerns over China clamping down on Hong Kong's freedom and the continuing to deteriorating of partnership between the US and China.Meanwhile, an intense multi-state manhunt for a college student wanted for two murders is now over. Cheryl Casone with the details. Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: That's right Maria. Good morning. Peter Manfredonia was captured in Maryland after six days on the run. University of Connecticut Senior arrest near a gas station in Hagerstown last night, just hours after being spotted in a Pennsylvania convenience store near the Maryland border. A gun believed to be used in one murder was found nearby. Manfredonia had been evading capture since Friday morning. He's accused of killing two people, including one of his childhood friends.Well, protests over the death of George Floyd turning violent overnight. One man was killed in Minneapolis as outraged Americans are demanding justice for the killing of the unarmed black man. That is scenes in front of a Target store, we should say. Protesters seen in social media videos burning and looting businesses. Officers using tear gas and rubber bullets to break up these crowds. In Los Angeles, look at this, hundreds of protestors stopped traffic on the 101 freeway. Then they shattered the windows of several police cruisers. They were jumping on police patrol cars as well during all of this. Now, officers claim Floyd was resisting arrest, but new video appears to contradict that. It shows Floyd cooperating as he was escorted to the cruiser. He died after an officer was shown moments later with his knee on Floyds neck. President Trump is calling on the FBI to investigate Floyd's death.Well, some of America's biggest entertainment destinations are gearing up to welcome back the faithful. Several Las Vegas hotel casinos' including MGM Resorts, Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts all plan to reopen on June 4th. Disney looks to turn the magic back on at Walt Disney World on July 11, starting with the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom parks, after a four month shut down. The plans still need approval by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. The Governor must also sign off on SeaWorld's reopening day, that's June 11th. We're going to take a closer at what is next for SeaWorld when Maria speaks with the company's interim CEO Marc Swanson. That interview, 7:30 a.m. Eastern time.Finally, here is a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. Billionaire Carl Icahn exits Hertz with significant losses after bankruptcy filing. Icahn held a 39 percent stake in the company. He sold 55 million shares. 72 cents is what he got for them. Apple beats Netflix for Scorsese, DiCaprio, DeNiro film Killers of the Flower Moon. The deal's being prepared as an Apple original. Paramount will distribute it later in theatres. $200 million dollars to produce. And Popeye's introduces Buffalo Ranch Tenders for Summer. They're being offered nationwide as a three or five piece dinner or combo. And as we talked about yesterday, Maria, the chicken wars are still going on, so, you know, American's are still eating and loving that. Back to you.BARTIROMO: They sure are. Cheryl, thank you. Meanwhile, the big story US China tensions reaching a boiling point now. The Trump administration is planning to cancel visa's for thousands of Chinese graduate students who have ties to Universities that are associated with the Chinese military. According to the New York Times this morning. Beijing approved measures earlier today that could undermine Hong Kong's freedoms and Western ideals making it fully part of China. The State Department making it clear yesterday that the territory is no longer autonomous from China, even going so far as to say that China is modeling Hong Kong after itself. Joining me right now is State Department Spokesperson, Morgan Ortagus. And Morgan, it is great to see you once again. Thanks so much for being here.MORGAN ORTAGUS, SPOKESPERSON, UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE: Great to be back. Thanks for having me Maria.BARTIROMO: Well, this is pretty serious stuff, Morgan. Let's talk about the implications in Hong Kong. And what's the Secretary is saying when he says that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous? What are the implications of that statement Morgan?ORTAGUS: Thanks Maria, so, we are required, the State Department is required by law to certify to Congress the autonomy in Hong Kong. And essentially what that means is, in 1997 the Chinese Communist Party committed to Hong Kong and to the world that Hong Kong would remain autonomous, and that they would be independent of the Chinese Communist Party. So, since last March when we last certified to Congress, we have seen a number of things happen. Beginning with an extradition law. Then you saw a protest, many protests of this extradition law, where Hong Kongers could be subject to arbitrarily going back to the mainland for any sort of prosecution. And then we saw a really violent crackdown of these protests. And this has been boiling for over a year, and the hallmark of the foreign policy of this administration, Maria, is to recognize reality around the world.So, Secretary Pompeo in good conscience could not go to the Congress and to certify that Hong Kong is still autonomous, especially because as we saw overnight, the National People's Congress has passed what they call the National Security Legislation, which is essentially a Chinese Communist Party takeover of Hong Kong.BARTIROMO: You know, it's interesting what has taken place here, because I think the entrance of China into the WTO was something done in good faith on the belief that maybe China would see Democracy elsewhere and say well, you know what, we like Democracy and yeah, this would be good for our people. And Capitalism is okay.ORTAGUS: Yeah.BARTIROMO: Even though we are Communist. But, Morgan, that didn't happen. In fact, they've gone hardline. The complete opposite, so they've really disappointed those that were encouraging the WTO inclusion, isn't that right?ORTAGUS: You're right Maria. This is the third administration I've worked in. I've worked for Democrat and Republican Presidents and I can tell you that until this administration, both parties got it wrong. For almost 40 years, and it's not for lack of trying, I think it made sense to try to bring China into the WTO at the time.BARTIROMO: Right.ORTAGUS: But what we have seen is what we had hoped would happen is that when they did business with Capitalist Societies that they would open up. That they would come more free. But under General Secretary Xi, that has not happened in China. In fact, we see that they're being more belligerent around the world. And what's crucial today, Maria, is for Democracies and freedom loving people around the world, this is a moment in history where people have to stand up and stand on one side of history. You can no longer, especially after COVID-19, you can no longer ignore the actions of the kind the Chinese Communist Party in Hong Kong. You can't look away.BARTIROMO: Yeah.ORTAGUS: And again, the Trump administration, we're basing our foreign policy as we see the world for the reality that it is, not as we hope that the world will be.BARTIROMO: Yeah, and, you know, we had Jimmy Lai on this week live, from Hong Kong.ORTAGUS: Yeah.BARTIROMO: He said the situation is getting real dangerous on the ground. Business leaders I think are little by little getting it in terms of the threat to national security that China represents. But the President of the US China Business Council is urging all sides to de-escalate. Maintain the one country, two systems model that has been in place since the territory was handed over to China in 1997. So, Morgan, with the US target individuals of the Chinese government so that the people of Hong Kong do not bear the brunt of any American action? What's the next move here? And what I was really looking for when I said to you what's the significance of the autonomy statement by the Secretary is what kind of liberties does Hong Kong have now that it may very well not be able to enjoy given this Secretary of State's, you know, pronouncement that there's no more autonomy?ORTAGUS: Yeah. Sure. So, this is step one. We had to certify to the Congress whether we still believe that Hong Kong was autonomous or not. We have clearly making the step to say that we cannot certify that it remains autonomous. I don't want to get ahead of the President. He has a lot of options on the table. Many of which that you have mentioned this morning, but in reference back to the person that you mentioned, I think, from the US China Business Council, we agreed that China should be respecting the two systems. The way that it was supposed to be set up in 1997 under the basic law. We can no longer certify this.So, the media doesn't need to look at the discussion, in my opinion, about necessarily de-escalating from the United States. It is China. It is the Chinese Communist Party that is arbitrarily arrested people like Jimmy Lai, a pro-Democracy protesters that have instituted laws, that have gone around the judicial independence in the autonomy of Hong Kong's body of law makers. And, of course, what we're seeing is important for your viewers to know, the legislation passed overnight in the National People's Congress in China essentially calls these freedom loving protesters terrorists. They're using national security in order to justify violent crackdowns on Democracy. And so I think we'll see what President Trump, and of course, the Congress has many option. I don't want to get in front of any announcements, so we'll see what they have to say today.BARTIROMO: Yeah, Okay. So, real quick before you go. I know it's very difficult to differentiate who is working for the Communist Party and who is actually just studying here in an honest way to progress. But what about this bill from Tom Cotton that says you want to limit visas, and what about the New York Times report today that the President will pull visas of anybody who has ties with the Chinese military, student visa's Morgan.ORTAGUS: Yeah, so, we don't have any announcement to make from the State Department on that, but what I will tell you is what we've looked closely at the past year is just as you said, is scrutinizing the visa process for entry into the United States. One of the things that we have done, for example, is that we looked at these quote unquote journalists, quote unquote media companies, these are really Chinese State propaganda outlets in the United States. And we have taken action there to decrease their numbers significantly. We're not going to allow, you know, a complete propaganda outlet to operate freely here. We believe in operating with China on the principle of sovereignty and of mutual respect, but unfortunately, we're not seeing that.BARTIROMO: Right.ORTAGUS: And we've got to say there's a big difference between a complete propaganda outlet like The Global Times and The Wall Street Journal, for example, and so State Department is taking a number of actions related to that over the past year.BARTIROMO: Right. That's right, they threw out the real journalists out of China and they gave us the spies. Morgan, it's great to see you this morning.ORTAGUS: Thank you Maria.BARTIROMO: And we appreciate your insights on this very important topic. We'll see you soon Morgan Ortagus. More Mornings with Maria right after this. Stay with us.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Some coronavirus shutdowns are easing, with malls and shopping centers welcoming back customers this week. But there's been a lot of pain from retail. It's not just stores that have suffered. Food options popular in malls. Food Courts, airports, also feeling the pinch, including those owned by Focus Brands, like Auntie Anne's Pretzels and Cinnabon. Joining me right now is Focus Brands CEO Jim Holthouser. And Jim, great to have you this morning. These are very familiar brands that you run. Talk to us about the situation today given the loss of foot traffic.JIM HOLTHOUSER, CEO, FOCUS BRANDS: Right. Yeah, good morning Maria. Yeah, I would say there's been, there's been quite a bit of pain over the last couple of months. I'm pleased to report that we're, that there could be light at the end of the tunnel based on the sales numbers we've been seeing over the last couple of weeks. You know, the pain hasn't been equally distributed across all segments of, at least of our portfolio. To your point, you know, malls have definitely been hit the hardest, simply because they've been closed, right. And then all of a sudden, then you can look at other segments of our business, for example, some of our sandwich brand like Schlotzky's that have a lot of drive through's that actually worked very well during the pandemic and today, Schlotzky's is doing about 90 percent of the revenue it did pre pandemic. So, again, it's a little bit all over the board, but definitely malls have been hit the hardest.BARTIROMO: So, what do you do here, at this point, given the loss of business? I know you're shifting to stand alone stores, mobile units, even food trucks. Tell me about that, and will you be able to regain the revenue position that you were at with this new shift?HOLTHOUSER: Yeah, you know, all malls aren't created equal. I don't know if you know this, but they tend to be categorized based upon their sales per square foot. Right? So, the good news is the most of the malls that we're are what we call A or B malls, so their really, that's where you'll find the most of the foot traffic. These malls are largely beginning to open. Foot traffic is not, obviously, to pre pandemic standards, but customers are returning. Retailers are returning. It's going to be, my guess is, a few more weeks before we see any kind of appreciable traffic in malls these days.BARTIROMO: Alright, we will leave it there. We know it's been a real tough period Jim. We wish you the best. We hope you'll come back soon. Give us an update. Jim Holthouser joining us this morning. Thank you, sir.HOLTHOUSER: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: We will see you soon. Coming up, Dolly Parton still working 9 to 5, even in quarantine. The country music legend releasing a brand new hit, and we've got it for you right here. That's next.BARTIROMO: Welcome back. It is time for the morning buzz. First up, if your kid is a picky eater like I was, it may be partly your fault. A new study shows parents who put more pressure on their kids eating habits may cause them to exert more control over what they consume. Mark, what do you think? Are your kid's picky eaters?MARK TEPPER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS: Yes they are, and this is absolute gold. So, you know, I guess this explains why my wife and I have been having serious serious problems with our eight year old son. The dude literally only eats chicken fingers and macaroni and cheese. And then once in a while, you know, we might find like an ice cream sandwich wrapper under his bed, you know, so he sneaks those from time to time. So, one of the best recommendations here is to get the kids involved in preparing the food. And I can tell you from experience recently, ever since this crisis started, I've been having my son join me for a short workout in the morning, and then we go upstairs in the kitchen, and we make our own smoothies together. So, that's been working very well. Now we have to figure out how to master lunch and dinner, so maybe cutting some veggie. Grilling with dad outside. We got to get that done.BARTIROMO: I like that idea. That is good. Make them part of the solution. Alright, how about this. Dolly Parton save us. Will she save us from quarantine boredom? She's got a new song, of course. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(SINGING)(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: The national treasure herself, releasing When Life is Good Again, inspired by lessons learned while staying home during the pandemic. Dagen, we love Dolly Parton.DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: She is one of my favorite people on planet Earth. She is the queen of the United States. I got to meet her a few years ago and she is as lovely and gracious in person as you could imagine. And Dolly has donated so much money over the years. She recently donated a million dollars to Vanderbilt University for COVID-19 research. What can't this woman do? She wrote I Will Always Love You and Jolene on the same day in the 70's. Two of the greatest songs of all time.BARTIROMO: That's good. That is great. That's good. Good point. Yeah, she's been on the show. I love her too. Alright, let's take a break. When we come back, I'll speak with SeaWorld Entertainment interim CEO Marc Swanson this morning as the park details its plans to reopen to the public. We want to see how he's doing that. That's next hour right here, Mornings with Maria. Stay with us.Load-Date: May 28, 2020End of Document

Continue reading Inside China s Plan to Power Global Blockchain AdoptionChina is about to launch its national blockchain platform, part of the country s grand strategy to lead the digital transformation of the world economy.Led by the State Information Center, the Blockchain Service Network (BSN) is poised to launch for domestic commercial use Wednesday and globally on April 25. If it works as envisioned, companies and software developers will be able to plug into the BSN and build blockchain-based applications as easily as assembling Lego sets.But the ultimate goal may go well beyond technical support for coders. As the BSN takes hold in worldwide countries, it will become the only global infrastructure network that is innovated by China, whose gateway access is controlled by China,  declares the latest white paper penned by the BSN Alliance, led by the government agency, several state-owned entities and blockchain firms.As such, the project has geopolitical and macroeconomic implications. The move is very much like the  One Belt One Road Initiative  in which China provides other countries with infrastructure and gains some first-mover advantage,  said James Cooper, a law professor and director of international legal studies at California Western School of Law.The project also reminds Cooper of  Made in China 2025,  a nationwide initiative to spearhead innovation in areas such as robotics and artificial intelligence, he said. The subtext is a desire to overcome China s image as a copycat, reverse-engineering innovations from elsewhere.In the October announcement of the BSN s internal testing, the Chinese government envisioned a variety of use cases. These included smart city applications, which use sensors connected to the internet to collect data and glean insights for managing public resources; in particular, the alliance mentioned energy conservation. It also listed identity registration and data storage as opportunities for BSN. China has the ambition to be the technology leader in the world. And I think they might have enough technology chops to pull this off, at least within the blockchain industry,  said Edith Yeung, managing partner at blockchain-focused venture capital firm Proof of Capital.Read more:From Banking Giants to Tech Darlings, China Reveals Over 500 Enterprise Blockchain ProjectsSeveral signs indicate China has been building to this moment. China files the most blockchain patents in the world,  Yeung said.  They got the most important infrastructure companies on board: banks, telecom and internet giants. Part of the network s mission, once it is proven to be efficient and scalable in China, is to go abroad. Hong Kong and Singapore are among the 56 cities where the alliance is testing the network first. We have already deployed some international nodes in other countries, such as the U.S, Japan, Australia, Brazil, South Africa, Singapore and France,  Leon Li, CEO of crypto exchange operator Huobi Group, said through a spokesperson. His Singapore-based company s blockchain development arm is a founding member of BSN.Other countries will have incentives to join the network, Yeung said, pointing to the BSN s business-friendly priorities. They get the selling point for enterprises right in their white paper,  she said.  For anyone to come on board, it needs to be low-cost, fast deployment and easy to manage. What is the BSN?The initiative   which is rolling out next week after a six-month internal test   is led by the State Information Center, a government agency under the National Development and Reform Commission, as well as state-owned telecommunication giants including China Telecom, China Unicom and payments firm China Union Pay.But the BSN itself is not a blockchain protocol. Rather, it s a centralized platform that has done the heavy lifting for developers so they can plug in and code, choosing from several enterprise blockchain protocols or public chains. The goal is to reduce their operational costs, improve flexibility and provide better regulatory oversight, according to the white paper. Designed to unify the fragmented market, BSN is a cross-cloud, cross-portal and cross-framework public network that enables developers to easily and affordably develop, deploy, operate and maintain permissioned   and permissionless blockchain applications and nodes,  Leon Li, CEO of crypto exchange operator Huobi Group, said through a spokesperson. His Singapore-based company s blockchain development arm is a founding member of BSN.During the beta testing period that began on Oct. 15 of last year and ends Wednesday, more than 2,000 participants signed up. A third of them are enterprises while the rest are individual developers, Li said.One of the network s advantages for BSN is its low price, which makes it accessible to a wider range of users compared to some of its prospective competitors, according to Li. Deploying [distributed ledger technology] applications on major cloud services such as Ali Cloud and Huawei Cloud can cost developers tens of thousands of dollars per year,  he said.  To make it less cost-prohibitive for developers to deploy DLT applications, the minimal cost on BSN is only $300 per year. Read more: Fintech Firm Joins Chinese Conglomerate to Build Blockchain PlatformThe low price will encourage a vast number of small and medium-sized enterprises and individuals. including students. to use the BSN to invent and innovate, thereby accelerating the rapid development and widespread use of blockchain technology, Li said.According to the white paper, there are two main parts to laying the groundwork. The first is deploying the so-called public city nodes, essentially data centers or cloud computing resources dedicated in certain cities to processing transactions.The white paper boasts that the BSN has signed up 100 city nodes via its telecom members and is hoping to deploy up to 200 more by the end of this year.The second part is the configuration and modification of several enterprise blockchain protocols to fit uniform standards, in areas such as cryptography and software development kits (SDKs), so these systems can work in conjunction with each other.So far, the BSN has configured and added several permissioned blockchain protocols to its pool including Hyperledger Fabric, the open-source software Walmart uses to track food along its supply chains. The network has done the same for China s home-grown protocols such as internet giant Baidu s Xuper Chain, and FISCO, developed by a consortium of China s Shenzhen government agencies and local tech companies including Tencent, WeBank and Huawei.Most recently, CITA, the enterprise blockchain project initiated by developers at Cryptape, who backed the development of Nervos public chain, has also been added to the BSN.Once authorized by the alliance and given a standardized SDK, developers will be able to choose a protocol and rent computing resources in locations they need to deploy a blockchain application. Because the permissioned protocols are adapted to support interoperability, developers will have more flexibility to switch from one to the other, the whitepaper said.The top-down approach enables China to build a large-scale network quickly while avoiding regulatory red tape, Cooper said.  China has a national strategy. Public chainsIn an initial BSN white paper published last year, the alliance only mentioned support for Hyperledger Fabric, the permissioned blockchain initiated by the Linux Foundation with contributions from tech giants including IBM.Unlike the public blockchains underpinning bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which anyone with an internet connection can download and run, permissioned systems can only be used by approved parties.But the latest version of the white paper said it s also including other permissioned blockchain frameworks. More surprisingly, it specifies the BSN will incorporate two public protocols: Ethereum and EOS.There are a few reasons why the Chinese government is wary of open networks. Numerous scammers in the country lacking any technical foundations have used  community-driven  public chain projects to raise money from investors via initial coin offerings (ICO).Even public chains with legitimate technology pose risks, as the Chinese government sees it. If widely adopted as currency, digital tokens could undermine the Chinese central bank s monetary sovereignty, for instance.As China aims to expand its network of its city nodes worldwide to create a global infrastructure, it s unclear how well it will be received if the state controls the access points.Still, while the Chinese government has predominantly focused its resources on private blockchain projects, it has been engaging in public blockchain projects cautiously and discreetly.The Shanghai government, for example, announced it would write grants and set up a research institute for Conflux, a public chain project founded by a group of top Chinese engineers.China Merchants Bank International (CMBI), whose major shareholders include entities partly or fully owned by the state, is working with Nervos, a public permissionless network, to develop blockchain-based financial applications.The logic behind the government s (limited) involvement with public chains is that China needs to understand the technology, and it could have its own Ethereum-like networks if such systems succeed, said Omer Ozden, chairman of RockTree Capital.Yeung said the Chinese government is surprisingly savvy about grassroots developer communication. If you look at their website and WeChat channel, they are now hosting their second developer competition,  she said.According to Li, BSN doesn t support public chains outside China, but it will support Ethereum and EOS nodes outside China after the international beta testing phase ends in July.Big Brother?Such a change attests to China s complicated relationship with public blockchains.Such networks underpin major cryptocurrency assets that are seen by the authorities as a source of speculation and systemic risk. But they arguably inspired the country s pursuit of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).In the early days of its CBDC development, the People s Bank of China (PBoC) considered distributed ledger technology but has pivoted to exploring a sort of middle ground between decentralization and centralization. China is doing what they say they would do,  Yeung said.   Their virtual currency may be rolled out within a year. And they are doing it, at least the infrastructure piece, even with everyone locked up during COVID time for the past 90 days. The BSN white paper spells out the thinking of the state-sponsored group that the  complete decentralization  and  libertarian  nature of public blockchains make them ungovernable. Many countries are able to formulate their own regulatory policies in relation to the Libra consortium blockchain founded by Facebook but are powerless over the permissionless blockchain framework of bitcoin,  the white paper said.Therefore, even though the BSN will support Ethereum and EOS,  it is not allowed to deploy and operate public blockchain nodes on BSN portals and city nodes that are within China. The logic behind the digital yuan and BSN could be that China has to study these technologies to prevent a company like Facebook or another country from gaining a monopoly on digital currency, Cooper said. I think the irony is that a highly centralized system is embracing a distributed ledger or a decentralized technology,  he said.As China aims to expand its network of its city nodes worldwide to create a global infrastructure, it s unclear how well it will be received if the state controls the access points.A recent article in engineering publication IEEE Spectrum suggested BSN s global partners, such as overseas developers or data center providers, may balk since holding the BSN s root key    a unique passcode that s generated to secure server interaction with a network   would allow the State Information Center to view transactions made on the platform.The white paper did not specify whether the authority could monitor transactions, only that transactions made within an application will be kept private from each other.However, Yeung believes the Chinese government wants to be able to track everything with the network. There is nothing decentralized about BSN,  she said, arguing the setup will help the government to fight fraud. If the government has access to everything via handpicked nodes, everything is developed and maintained by the government, no more cash,  Yeung said.  It s hard to have any fraud if all telco, banks, transportation, Alipay or WeChat is part of the government network. See Campaign:https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.bsnbase.com/sys/file/downLoadPdf%3Ftype%3DCNContact Information:David panTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: April 15, 2020End of Document

Republicans: It's time to ban the Chinese government from Twitter for its 'whitewash' of coronavirus historyBusiness Insider USMarch 22, 2020 Sunday 05:57 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 901 wordsByline: dchoi@businessinsider.com,  (David Choi)Highlight: Twitter is officially blocked in China. But that isn't stopping Chinese government officials from spreading disinformation online.BodyJim Bourg-Pool/Getty Images• Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin in a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey urged that the Chinese government should be banned from the platform.• The two Republicans stressed that the Chinese government was using the social media platform to "disseminate propaganda" amid the coronavirus pandemic.• "While the coronavirus pandemic is afflicting families, governments, and markets around the world, the Chinese Communist Party is waging a massive propaganda campaign to rewrite the history of COVID-19 and whitewash the Party's lies to the Chinese people and the world," the GOP senators said.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.A pair of GOP lawmakers urged Twitter to ban scores of Chinese government accounts that attempt to "spread propaganda and whitewash" evidence suggesting China downplayed and covered-up early indications of the coronavirus's impact.Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin in a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey stressed that the Chinese government was using the platform to "disseminate propaganda" amid the coronavirus pandemic.Both pointed to the Communist Party of China's (CCP) obfuscation over the origins of the coronavirus in recent weeks, when Chinese senior officials alleged without evidence that the US Army "brought" the virus to their country."We believe this behavior more than warrants their removal from the platform," the Sasse and Gallagher said in the letter. "Additionally, given the humanitarian importance of free and open access to the internet, we believe that access to social media platforms should be denied to government officials from countries that prohibit their own populations from accessing this very content."Similar to other authoritarian countries like Iran, Twitter is officially blocked in China. In 2019, Twitter removed nearly 4,800 accounts, over 1,600 of which sent out 2 million tweets that frequently shared news content "with an angle that benefited the diplomatic and geostrategic views of the Iranian state."Getty Images / Thomas Peter-PoolDespite the official ban, state-influenced media organizations like Xinhua, as well as Chinese government officials, have accounts on the social media platform."When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US Army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian tweeted on March 12. "Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation."The novel coronavirus is widely believed to have originated from wild animals, with early cases in December indicating it may have spread from a wildlife market in Wuhan, China. "While the coronavirus pandemic is afflicting families, governments, and markets around the world, the Chinese Communist Party is waging a massive propaganda campaign to rewrite the history of COVID-19 and whitewash the Party's lies to the Chinese people and the world," the Republicans said.The Republican letter comes days after a party colleague, Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, was blocked on Twitter by Zhao. Neither Banks nor Zhao previously tweeted to each other; however, the Republican has been critical of the CCP for targeting "politicians that are generally critical of China," the lawmaker previously said to Insider.Some Republican lawmakers and personalities have also suggested that the Chinese government could have manufactured the disease. Republicans like longtime China-hawk Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas pointed to the proximity of the Wuhan wildlife markets to a Chinese "superlaboratory" and questioned whether the coronavirus may have been developed there.Cotton has yet to provide evidence of the suggestion, but referenced the Chinese government's indisputable sequence of suppressing information and downplaying the outbreak in its early stages, and alleged it was "lying about it from the very beginning."Chinese officials have been accused of lowering the number of positive cases and tamping down on reports since December, prior to when the virus's spread was formally acknowledged by the government. The lack of transparency and action has been scrutinized in the US, where lawmakers claim that the information may have allowed the country to better prepare for the pandemic.The hawkish sentiment towards the CCP comes as the White House is pushing talking points that accuse Beijing of a "cover-up," according to a US State Department cable and two officials cited in a Daily Beast report."The [CCP] is waging a propaganda campaign to desperately try to shift responsibility for the global pandemic to the United States. This effort is futile," the cable said, according to The Daily Beast. "Thanks to the ... cover-up, Chinese and international experts missed a critical window to contain the outbreak within China and stop its global spread. Saving lives is more important than saving face."See Also:• Trump says the US is 'at war' with the coronavirus - here's what the military is bringing to the fight• The US Navy is deploying a fully-equipped hospital ship to help in the fight against the coronavirus in New York• China complains its image is 'seriously tarnished' by American journalists and is retaliating against themSEE ALSO: China complains its image is 'seriously tarnished' by American journalists and is retaliating against themLoad-Date: March 22, 2020End of Document

Chinese Government Claims To Be Victim Of Coronavirus Disinformation, Turns Around And Accuses US Of 'Hiding Something'The Daily CallerApril 27, 2020 Monday 02:35 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; worldLength: 590 wordsByline: Chuck Ross, Investigative Reporter, chuck@dailycaller.comChuck Ross is a reporter at The Daily Caller.Author ImageBodyLink to ImageThe Chinese government's foreign ministry portrayed China as the victim of coronavirus disinformation on Monday, before suggesting minutes later that the U.S. government is “hiding something” regarding the pandemic.“China always stands against disinformation campaign. We are victim rather than producer of disinformation,” the Chinese foreign ministry wrote from its Twitter account.The account then suggested without evidence that the U.S. government has lied about the extent of the coronavirus pandemic here.“Growing doubts over the US government's handling of the #COVID19,” the Chinese foreign ministry tweeted.“When did the first infection occur in the US? Is the US government hiding something? Why they opt to blame others?” Growing doubts over the US government's handling of the #COVID19, e.g. When did the first infection occur in the US? Is the US government hiding something? Why they opt to blame others? American people and the international community need an answer from the US government. - Spokesperson发言人办公室 (@MFA_China)            April 27, 2020The Chinese government has come under withering criticism both for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak in late 2019, and a disinformation campaign it has waged to deflect blame for Beijing's handling of the crisis. (RELATED: Chinese Government Pressured EU To Alter Report On Coronavirus Disinformation)The virus originated in Wuhan in November 2019, either from an outdoor wildlife market or a lab that studies viruses in bats, according to reports.Experts in infectious diseases have accused the Chinese government of withholding vital information about the severity of the virus.Chinese officials assured the World Health Organization as recently as the middle of January that the virus was not being transmitted through human-to-human contact. They also refused to share live strains of the virus, which slowed the ability of foreign scientists to develop tests to diagnose those infected with the virus.The Chinese government has waged a multi-prong disinformation strategy. Government officials and government-controlled propaganda mills have criticized other nations for their handling of their own coronavirus outbreaks. They have also accused President Donald Trump and U.S. policy makers of racism for calling the virus the “Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus.”Beijing has also portrayed itself as helping other nations with medical supplies and equipment, even though much of it has been found to be defective.The communist regime's most aggressive disinformation strategy has involved blaming the United States and other Western nations of being the point of origin for the virus.On March 12, Zhao Lijian, a deputy director of the Chinese foreign ministry information department, asserted on Twitter that the U.S. military might have seeded coronavirus in China.“It may be that the U.S. military brought the epidemic to Wuhan,” he tweeted.U.S. intelligence officials reportedly assessed that Chinese government agents helped disseminate text messages and social media posts asserting that the U.S. government planned to institute a nationwide curfew. The CIA has also reportedly concluded that the Chinese government has falsified data on the number of coronavirus cases and deaths in the country.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

CHINA TELECOM SPENDING ON FOREIGN INFLUENCE AMID TRUMP ADMIN CRACKDOWNStates News ServiceMay 14, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1086 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by the Center for Responsive Politics:By Anna MassogliaChinese telecommunications operators poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into foreign influence operations targeting the U.S. amid escalating tensions between the two countries over a range of issues from cybersecurity to trade and the coronavirus pandemic.China Telecom shelled out more than $428,000 to foreign agents paid through its U.S. subsidiary since the start of 2019 and leading up to the Federal Communications Commission's April threat to revoke the Chinese government-owned telecommunications operator's license to operate in the U.S. That's according to new disclosures under the Foreign Agents Registration Act identified using OpenSecrets' Foreign Lobby Watch tool.An executive order signed April 4 by President Donald Trump turned an ad hoc interagency group dubbed Team Telecom into the official Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector chaired by Attorney General Bill Barr. Like its predecessor, the committee is intended to limit foreign influence on U.S. telecommunications where security risks are identified.New applications and existing licenses may be reviewed at the committee's discretion without referral from the FCC and without any specific deadlines. While the ultimate decision to revoke or reject a license still rests with the FCC, the order formally shifts significant power from a commission designed to operate independent of presidential control to committee members in federal executive departments serving at the pleasure of the president.On April 9, less than a week after the executive order, the Department of Justice released executive branch agency recommendations calling on the FCC to terminate China Telecom's authorization to provide mobile internet, cloud data storage, television, voice platforms and other telecommunications services in the U.S.The recommendations were based on a review by the ad hoc Team Telecom group in place prior to Trump's executive order, echoing earlier concerns such as potential risks of "exploitation, influence, and control" of the company by the Chinese government.By April 24, the FCC threatened to revoke authorizations for U.S. operations of China Telecom along with three other Chinese telecommunications operators unless they can each show they are independent from the Chinese government and "China's communist regime."The Chinese telecommunication operators, including China Unicom Americas and Pacific Networks along with its subsidiary ComNet USA LLC, were given until May 24 to respond to the federal government. China Telecom's legal counsel filed a motion asking the FCC for extra time to respond and seeking clarification on the scope of information required to respond. In a May 4 reply, the FCC agreed to consider extending the deadline if China Telecom identified which parts of the order it wanted clarified by May 11.In a May 8 letter, China Telecom told the FCC that its response is "frustrated" by lack of access to classified information and other information related to a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act notice. The notice revealed the government's intent to use information from classified information-gathering methods, including electronic surveillance, in the investigation of China Telecom.Help us keep government accountable by making a donation today.In the year leading up to Team Telecom's recommendations, China Telecom racked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in spending on foreign influence and lobbying operations targeting the U.S.China Telecom first hired Ogilvy Group to target the U.S. with lobbying, public relations campaigns and other influence operations from January through July 2019, including "social media research and analysis, influencer identification" and "audience analysis"Ogilvy's strategy was to "activate" at least 10 "third-party influencers" to "reinforce a positive narrative" about China Telecom with tactics such as posting content on social media, publishing research briefs and opinion pieces, and submitting information to policymakers.The agreement between China Telecom and Ogilvy specifies that "should a negative story appear, the firm will recommend and execute a response" such as requesting clarification to the story from the editor or a briefing with the reporter and "mobilizing" a third-party influencer.In October 2019, China Telecom inked a new agreement with Levick Communications, a PR firm with a history of handling crisis communications for high-profile cases. Levick was promised a $45,000-per-month retainer from China Telecom and a $400 hourly rate for crisis communications support. Originally slated to last through the end of that year, China Telecom's arrangement with Levick continued through at least March 2020.Both firms registered under FARA as part of the foreign influence operation acknowledge that their client is a subsidiary of the Chinese state-owned China Telecom Corporation Limited, a joint stock limited company that originated as a government agency. However, they maintain that they are without knowledge that any foreign government or political party controls, directs, finances or subsidizes Chinese Telecom."While Chinese telecom operators have taken center stage in the Trump administration crackdown on China's technological influence in recent weeks, the recent executive order could potentially impact a wide range of operations since some foreign-owned media outlets fall under the FCC's purview. The agency issues licenses for a variety of services including television or radio broadcasting.Chinese telecommunications manufacturers ZTE and Huawei have long faced accusations from the administration and members of Congress, who say the company could endanger national security by providing espionage opportunities for the Chinese government. This week, Trump extended his May 2019 emergency declaration aimed at Chinese telecommunications manufacturers to bar U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by foreign firms posing national security risks through at least May 2020.ZTE spent nearly $4 million on lobbying in 2019, more than the Chinese telecom giant spent any prior year. Huawei budgeted more than $3.5 million for foreign influence operations targeting the U.S. in 2019 in a multi-part strategy to reshape the embattled Chinese telecom giant's image through litigation, lobbying and public relations efforts.Load-Date: May 15, 2020End of Document

Don't disregard the Chinese government's role in this pandemicThe California Aggie: University of California, DavisApril 21, 2020 TuesdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 1Length: 932 wordsByline: Brandon JetterBodyAs Americans debate over the domestic response to the coronavirus pandemic, China is engaging in a deliberate misinformation campaign. Don't fall for it.The Chinese Communist Party has blood on its hands.From ignoring and silencing whistleblowers, to downplaying social distancing during the initial outbreak to preventing doctors from consulting with infectious disease experts, China very clearly downplayed the Coronavirus risk. Then, it engaged in a massive coverup of its odious response. In hopes of covering their trail, Chinese officials are now promoting the theory that the U.S. Army is to blame for the outbreak of the virus, just as xenophobic and racist messages about foreigners continue to circulate on Chinese social media.In the meantime, the Chinese Communist Party has doubled down on disseminating its own propaganda. In a campaign described by one European Union chief diplomat as a "struggle for influence through spinning and the 'politics of generosity,'" China is actively exporting medical supplies and doctors to the most devastated European countries. Simultaneously, it is also sowing discord among competing democratic governments. Even the very equipment that China has so generously donated has wound up widely useless, with the vast majority of tools proving defective. Of the countries receiving aid from China, Spain, the Netherlands and Turkey are reporting that their China-produced equipment is essentially useless. To add insult to injury, these donations came with a price tag.The response from international organizations has likewise proved disappointing.The World Health Organization , for example, appears to be acting increasingly in the interest of the Chinese government. When pressed by the Hong Kong broadcaster RTHK last month about granting membership status to Taiwan, Dr. Bruce Aylward, the co-lead of the WHO-China joint mission on COVID-19, cowardly faked technical difficulties to avoid answering the question. When the call reconnected, the RTHK reporter asked Aylward about Taiwan's efforts in containing the virus, at which point Aylward refused to acknowledge the country's sovereignty and immediately hung up.Only days later, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom falsely accused Taiwan of encouraging racist rhetoric against himself and the organization, apparently in a ploy to demonize Taiwanese dissidents. The accusation, of course, comes as China has taken note of the West's rhetorical obsession with racialization, effectively weaponizing wokeness, by using baseless accusations of bigotry as a means of absolving themselves of responsibility.Elsewhere, WHO's incompetence is on full display. In fact, WHO still has a tweet up from Jan. 14, 2020, claiming that Chinese officials have found no evidence of human-to-human transmission of COVID-19. The statement, which is either a blatant lie or an example of gross incompetence, would be hilarious for its sheer absurdity, were it not for the millions - if not billions - of lives at stake.Despite China's disregard for the truth, a number of groups in the U.S. continue to play the role of useful idiots for Beijing. Twitter, for example, is allowing a deliberate misinformation campaign by Chinese officials to continue on its platform. Many in the American media also seem reluctant to focus on the role of China in the early stages of this crisis.Although I'm not very supportive of the notion that crude graffiti is an effective method of protest, it was still incredibly perplexing when The California Aggie described an image as "xenophobic," especially considering the depiction in question specifically mentioned the Chinese Communist Party - not Chinese citizens - as a threat to society.In some regard, this makes sense. Indeed, it can be conceded that as Americans, it is certainly more beneficial to our general public to critique our domestic response first. It is our responsibility to hold our government officials accountable before we opt to intervene in the affairs of others.In the end, however, the U.S. must also adopt a universal approach that holds all actors accountable. The CCP currently operates a racist and oppressive regime, one which is currently ethnically cleansing millions of Uyghur Muslims and suppressing political dissidents everywhere from Hong Kong to Tibet. This is not a government that should be allowed to consolidate any sort of international power.Ultimately, the reality is that there will be blowback from this affair, irrespective of whether the American pundit class is willing to acknowledge the Chinese government's initial mishandling of the virus outbreak. The current pandemic is a cataclysmic event that will devastate the global world order as we know it. It will bring about a skepticism of globalism that, while probably coming short of an embrace of full-on autarky, will likely see the U.S. and other Western countries abandon their total reliance on Chinese supply lines.The political ramifications will be felt in the U.S. sooner rather than later. And the inability of both American politicians and the international community to hold the Chinese government accountable for their role in the crisis leaves us vulnerable to the issue being hijacked, whether it be by opportunistic demagogues or war-hungry neoconservatives - both would gladly take up the reigns of the aggressor. Written by: Brandon Jetter -brjetter@ucdavis.eduDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by individual columnists belong to the columnists alone and do not necessarily indicate the views and opinions held by The California AggieLoad-Date: April 21, 2020End of Document

It was a derogatory term used by Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War that ended in 1949. It continues to be used by Chinese-speaking critics of the Beijing regime, including           in Taiwan.     means  50-cent party.  It's a derogatory term for people who are paid by the Chinese government to participate in online discussions and promote official Communist Party positions. In the early years of China's censored Internet, such commenters were allegedly paid 50 cents (in China's currency, the yuan) per post.I've confirmed the behavior of YouTube's commenting algorithm. Around 11:30am, Iposted several commentson a YouTube video, some containing one of the two phrases, two with other Chinese phrases, and several with English content. The comments with      and      in them disappeared in less than a minute. The others are still up as I write this around noon Eastern time.YouTube's apparent policy is especially surprising because the search giant has long had an adversarial relationship with the communist regime. YouTube has been officially blocked in China since 2009. Google has refused to comply with China's censorship requirements for search engines, which has locked Google out of the Chinese search market. Plans to re-enter the market with a censored search engine werescuttled last yearafter protests from Google employees, American elected officials, and human rights advocates.The Chinese government has been exerting increasing pressure on companies around the world to censor content critical of the Communist regime in Beijing. Last fall, for example, Blizzardbanneda professionalHearthstonegamer for expressing support for Hong Kong during a livestream. The National Basketball Association           faced reprisalsfrom the Chinese government after Rockets manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for Hong Kong's protesters.We don't know if the Chinese government has been pressuring YouTube to censor phrases critical of the Communist Party, if YouTube adopted the policy for other reasons, or if it's some kind of technical mistake.While this is the first time we've heard about this policy, it's not actually new. Users have beenreporting iton YouTube's support forums since at least last October.See Campaign:https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21270290/youtube-deleting-comments-censorship-chinese-communist-party-ccpContact Information:TIMOTHY B.

Blasting COVID-19 response in China, McMaster advocates 'bypass' of foreign firewalls to spread truthThe Stanford Daily: Stanford UniversityApril 24, 2020 FridayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 1851 wordsByline: Nicholas MidlerBody"I think it's bad for dictators," said Former National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster at a Thursday webinar about the geopolitics of COVID-19. "I think what we're seeing is the benefit of our free, open, democratic system.In the Hoover Institution-sponsored event, McMaster disparaged China's response to COVID-19, warned of a possible U.S. "reprisal" against Iran and called for the U.S. to "bypass" China and Iran's internet censorship to combat COVID-19 disinformation. He also questioned whether the pandemic could cause a power shift in Russia and excoriated social media companies for allowing falsehoods to spread. McMaster spoke about COVID-19's ability to accelerate pre-existing trends and the challenges it presents to authoritarian governments."As dissatisfied as Americans are with the government's initial response, we have a self-correcting mechanism," McMaster said. "We have a say in how we're governed. In societies that don't, as the people's voices are suppressed, the only alternative to change might be a revolution."The challenges presented by COVID-19 to autocracies remained a prominent theme throughout the discussion.The webinar was moderated by Hoover Director Thomas Gilligan, who first asked McMaster about China's response to COVID-19. McMaster criticized China's initial handling of the outbreak, blaming the Chinese Communist Party for silencing early warnings."China has acted in an egregious manner harassing the doctors trying to warn about this," McMaster said.He criticized China's recent moves to arrest pro-democracy advocates "who advocate for the Chinese people having a say in how they're governed in Hong Kong and in the mainland."McMaster also spoke about the heightening of tensions between China and the rest of the international community. He described China's information warfare and aggressive militarization as two causes for concern."We can see in recent days an intensification of the information warfare that the Chinese Communist Party is waging against the United States, with the narrative that the United States and other free and open democratic systems have failed," McMaster said.He attributed this escalation as an attempt by China to "mask their responsibility for how rapidly and widely this pandemic spread."McMaster said the U.S. should not just defend against misinformation, but also actively seek to spread factual reporting to autocratic regimes.Both Iran and China censor the internet among their populations, banning many foreign news services."I do think our government does have a role in trying to figure out how to bypass these firewalls," McMaster said. "I think we should bypass Iran and China's firewall and reach those people with information that can allow them to form their own judgements based on the truth rather than on disinformation and propaganda."Former Secretary of State and incoming Hoover Director Condoleezza Rice voiced similar criticisms about China during her Hoover webinar last Tuesday."It is the nature of the Chinese system, and authoritarianism, that control of information is power," Rice said. "So we shouldn't be surprised that when this outbreak happened in Wuhan, they silenced the young physicians and medical students who were trying to sound the alarm.""I think what you're seeing is the Chinese Communist Party racing to put in place this Orwellian police state," McMaster said.China has received praise from the World Health Organization for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic and its aggressive policies of quarantining infected regions. The WHO's early support for China later drew criticism for creating what some have seen as an overconfidence in China's handling of the virus.McMaster also spoke about what he saw as China's growing military aggression, citing its actions in the South China Sea."In the last couple days they formed these two municipalities to govern this big land grab in the South China Sea," McMaster said.China is currently contesting ownership of numerous islands in the sea and drew criticism when satellite images revealed the construction of military bases on the contested islands.Rising tensions with China have the potential to further decouple the U.S. and Chinese economies, according to McMaster."What you're seeing as a result of this kind of behavior is a backlash internationally, and I think that's a positive trend," McMaster said. "The United States and other free and open societies ought to do everything we can to protect ourselves against the efforts of the Chinese Communist Party to subvert our free market economic systems and our democratic form of governance.""The Chinese government is not a trusted partner," he added. "It is not a good place to do business. We can no longer have some of our critical supply chains vulnerable to disruption by the Chinese Communist Party."McMaster also hinted at the possibility of unrest within China."The Chinese population is becoming more critical of the party, particularly in the way they've handled the crisis," McMaster said. "This is going to happen against a backdrop of a slowing economy and China not being able to make good on the promise it's made to its own people under this program of national rejuvenation. As the economy contracts I think there will be a tendency to double down on practices that actually exacerbate the weaknesses and vulnerabilities in that economy, especially state-owned enterprises."McMaster isn't the first to link China's slowing economic growth to rising internal unrest. The argument hinges upon the assumption that Chinese citizens will happily trade political power for a growing economy rapidly affording middle class lifestyles to millions. The self-correcting mechanism McMaster mentioned about democracies is only relevant when the populace is unhappy with the government. China reported an 6.2% unemployment rate, a 13.5% drop in industrial output, and a 20.5% drop in retail sales in January and February.McMaster also attacked social media companies for their role in spreading misinformation about COVID-19."I think it's abhorrent that U.S. social media companies won't take down blatant state-sponsored disinformation and propaganda in the United States, when they don't even get to have access into the Chinese market," McMaster said.He credited the American free press as the best defense against what Gilligan referred to as the "information warfare" related to COVID-19."I think our media should be very active at exposing their [foreign states] nefarious activity and their dishonesty and disinformation efforts," McMaster said.He also took aim at China's One Belt, One Road initiative. OBOR is a Chinese program that finances development projects in other countries."I hope that there's going to be an effort among countries that have been vulnerable to Chinese influence in the so-called debt trap associated with the one belt one road initiative to protect themselves against China attempting to create a servile relationship with these countries," McMaster said.OBOR has come under criticism after several of its projects defaulted, forcing recipient countries to sign long-term leases to China. The initiative has also garnered more positive press for fostering development in Africa and Southeast Asia.McMaster also spoke about the effect of COVID-19 in the Middle East."It is a humanitarian crisis of colossal scale that we are witnessing across the region," he said.Iran is going through a crisis of the regime's own making," McMaster said. COVID-19 is exacerbating the country's preexistent problems, such as collapsing oil prices and a corrupt economic system, McMaster said, and bringing the whole country under increasing strain. Iran has addressed its internal challenges by turning outwards, launching 20 attacks against U.S. forces since the killing of top Iranian general Qasim Soleimani on Jan. 3."COVID has hidden from our attention a real escalation by the Iranians in Iraq and the Gulf," McMaster said. "I think there's a chance for an escalation that will result in a reprisal maybe against Iran or Iranian assets."McMaster also spoke about the challenges facing Iraq."Iraq is a country that is going into an even worse crisis and I think we ought to try and maintain our influence and support there," McMaster said. "I think the Iraqi people are going to want that more and more as they see that their fate alternative to this is tied to Iranian influence."McMaster also spoke about the challenges COVID-19 poses to the Russian government, where the government is already facing a collapse in oil prices and internal political unrest, particularly over recent municipal elections."This could be the biggest challenge that Putin's faced in Russia," McMaster said."I think that the pressure on Putin is certainly going to mount," he added. "Something we're going to be watching at Hoover is who is going to emerge as a potential new leader of Russia - not that Putin is going to lose power, but I think power is certainly really going to shift away from him to others."McMaster also briefly discussed North Korea, adding that the coronavirus may be the best method to enforce United Nations sanctions. Satellite photographs taken of North Korean ships show them idled in port, avoiding trading with China and the risk of bringing COVID-19 to North Korea. McMaster also advocated support for a "maximum pressure" campaign against North Korea, saying the policy "has been reinforced by the COVID-19 experience in North Korea."McMaster, who left the national security council in April 2018, also spoke about the administration's preparation for a global pandemic. Preparing for a pandemic "was one of our top national security challenges," McMaster said. The administration had a three pronged approach to combating pandemics. The first prong was "improving global surveillance and trying to contain these problems. That effort was foiled by the fundamental dishonesty of the Chinese Communist Party," McMaster said.Innovating and developing treatments was the second part of the administration's strategy, according to McMaster.The third was rapidly mobilizing a response."This is where we've fallen short," McMaster said. "We didn't have enough personal protective equipment, ventilators and so forth."The solution, he said, might lie in "understanding what we have to do to ensure more effective integration across different departments and agencies."Closer to home, McMaster hopes that COVID-19 will allow America to build closer ties with its South American neighbors."I think we ought to continue to support our friends in the region who are democratic countries," he said, "... and help all of us succeed and then demonstrate to the people of the hemisphere that what works is rule of law, strong democratic institutions and a responsible free market economic system."Contact Nicholas Midler at midler 'at' stanford.edu..css-10w0hkr{margin:0 auto;width:100%;}@media (min-width:1100px){.css-10w0hkr{width:650px;}}Nicholas Midler.css-qmqbsq{margin:0 auto;width:100%;}@media (min-width:1100px){.css-qmqbsq{width:600px;}}Load-Date: April 24, 2020End of Document

Former Emory University Professor Pleads Guilty To Omitting Chinese Government Funding In Tax ReturnsThe Daily CallerMay 11, 2020 Monday 10:09 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: USLength: 506 wordsByline: Marlo Safi, Culture Reporter, marlo@dailycaller.comMarlo Safi is a 2018 graduate of the University of Pittsburgh. When she is not reporting on subjects like religion and culture, she is cooking or writing about cooking.Author ImageBodyLink to ImageA former Emory University professor pleaded guilty to charges of filing false tax returns after accepting at least $500,000 in Chinese government funding that he never reported on federal income tax returns, the Justice Department announced Monday. Dr. Xiao-Jiang Li was sentenced Friday by a U.S. District Judge after failing to report foreign income he earned for working at two Chinese universities, the            Justice Department press release said. From 2012 to 2018, Li did not report at least $500,00 in foreign income while he worked at the Chinese universities.Li participated in the Thousand Talents Program, a Chinese-government talent recruitment program that in some cases has resulted in violations of U.S law, including espionage, theft of trade secrets and grant fraud. In Li's case, the discovery of tax fraud emerged when the National Institute of Health reviewed his NIH research grant applications and became concerned that he had omitted foreign research activity.While working for Emory University, Li also worked at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and then at Jinan University, where he conducted research.He was sentenced to one year of probation on a felony charge and was ordered to repay $35,089.Link to ImageTwo cleaners clean the ground in front of the portrait of the late Communist Party leader Mao Zedong on April 29, 2020 in Beijing, China. (Photo by Lintao Zhang/Getty Images)“This defendant thought that he could live two, separate lives - one here at Emory University and one in China as a Thousand Talents Program participant,” U.S. Attorney Byung J. “BJay” Pak said according to the release.“Eventually, the truth caught up to this defendant, and he is now a convicted felon who is ordered to repay over $35,000 to the IRS.”U.S. law enforcement agencies have been cracking down on foreign influence within the country, particularly at college campuses where Chinese-government programs, like Thousand Talents and Confucius Institutes, exert soft power. Charles Lieber, the chair of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard, was charged earlier this year with aiding the Chinese government and hiding his ties to the country by not reporting the millions in funding he accepted.            (RELATED: Harvard Professor's Arrest For Lying About China Ties Is Part Of Ongoing Crackdown On Chinese Government Influence At American Campuses)The FBI also issued a federal arrest warrant for Yanqing Ye, a lieutenant of the People's Liberation Army, China's armed forces, and a member of the Chinese Communist Party who studies at Boston University. During her time in the U.S., she accessed American military websites and sent documents and information to China.“Li's actions demonstrated a flagrant disrespect for the law and all taxpayers,” said Chris Hacker, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta, according to the Justice Department.“The FBI and our federal partners will always pursue individuals like Li, who victimize innocent taxpayers for their own personal gain.”Graphic The Chinese national flag flies at half-mast at the Bund to mourn victims of COVID-19 on April 04, 2020 in Shanghai, China.

WHAT ARE THE GLOBAL AMBITIONS OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT?States News ServiceMay 7, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 812 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Cato Institute:By Simon Lester and Huan ZhuIn a blog post entitled "It Is Time For a Libertarian Case Against China," Tanner Greer responds to a piece in Reason magazine by Dan Drezner, in which Dan argued that "There is No China Crisis." Greer says that libertarians need "to take the [China] problem with the seriousness it deserves."Not that it matters much, but if he wants to make "a libertarian case against China," is Greer even a libertarian? Kind of, sort of, maybe, but not really. He says:I like libertarians and libertarianism. I can't bring myself to identify as one, but someone recently described me as "libertarian adjacent," and I will not dispute the label.But regardless of whether Greer identifies as a libertarian, the issue of how to deal with a rising power that is authoritarian and looking to expand its influence in world affairs is certainly one of the biggest foreign policy challenges the U.S. government faces. We do need to take it seriously. (And if you read Dan's piece, I think it's clear that he does take it seriously, in the sense of offering thoughtful and nuanced analysis). How people in the United States (including, but not limited to, libertarians) think about this issue is extremely important. Having gotten so many of our foreign policy challenges wrong in recent decades, it would be nice to get this one right.But in order to think about it clearly and rationally, we need to understand exactly what China's goals are, in particular in the global arena. This post won't answer that question fully, because it would take much longer than a blog post to do so. But we do want to push back on some of Greer's characterizations, which reflect the overheated rhetoric of many China hawks. Greer says this about President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party:What [Liza] Tobin describes as "a new path to peace, prosperity, and modernity" ... Xi has variously described as "Chinese wisdom and a Chinese answer to solving the problems of the mankind," "a new [achievement] ... in the history of the development of human society," a "new and greater contribution to mankind," and "new advance in political civilization."[8] Notice the scope of what the Party hopes to reshape. They hope not to remake China, nor even Asia, but "human society," "civilization," and "mankind." As Politburo member Yang Jiechi exhorted in 2018, the time has come for the Party to "energetically control the new direction of the common progress of China and the world." [9]Clearly, then, based on this language, China is out to dominate the world, right? Not so fast. First of all, relying too much on official government statements (of any government!) may be a mistake, in part because governments have many audiences in mind when they speak (importantly, their own citizens). But if you are going to use them, you need the full context. In the first sentence that Greer quotes, Xi does, in fact, use the quoted words. But when you read them in context, you don't get the impression that the Communist Party hopes to "remake," as Greer puts it, "human society," "civilization," and "mankind." For example, the speech by Xi says this: "The Communist Party of China strives for both the wellbeing of the Chinese people and human progress. To make new and greater contributions for mankind is our Party's abiding mission." That sounds like the usual generalities of a government's public relations campaign rather than an objective of remaking the world.And with regard to the phrase "energetically control the new direction of the common progress of China and the world," translations are difficult, and word choices between languages are not always clear, but we offer this translation of the broader passage at issue:We (China) should have a profound insight into the new developments in China and the world, fully understand the new connotations of China's relations with the world, accurately grasp the new law of interaction between China and the world, and proactively drive the new direction that China and the world are heading together.Again, this seems like somewhat normal and expected government" speak.So what are the actual goals of the Chinese government in world affairs? That's an area where we need more analysis from unbiased experts. For security hawks, it's very convenient to have found a new "existential threat" that can justify a confrontational foreign policy and more military spending. But in order to craft the appropriate policy here, we need to get past the self" serving assumptions of certain members of the foreign policy establishment, and sort out exactly what we are dealing with in terms of the Chinese government's global ambitions. The "case against China" needs examining, but an over" excited rush in one direction could be very damaging (and has been before).Load-Date: May 8, 2020End of Document

US couple's nightmare: Held in China, away from daughterAssociated Press InternationalMay 5, 2020 Tuesday 7:34 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: INTERNATIONAL NEWS; Only on APLength: 2844 wordsByline: By ERIKA KINETZ, Associated PressDateline: SHANGHAI BodySHANGHAI (AP) - The first thing Daniel Hsu noticed about the room was that there were no sharp edges. The walls were covered with beige rubber, the table wrapped in soft, grey leather. White blinds covered two barred windows.Five surveillance cameras recorded his movements, and two guards kept constant, silent watch. They followed Hsu to the shower and stood beside him at the toilet.Lights blazed through the night. If he rolled over on his mattress, guards woke him and made him turn his face toward a surveillance camera that recorded him as he slept. He listened for sounds of other prisoners -- a door slamming, a human voice. But he heard only the occasional roar of a passing train."First, keep healthy," Hsu told himself. "Second, keep strong."He had no idea when or how he would get out.Hsu is a U.S. citizen. He has not been convicted of any crime in China, yet he was detained there for six months in solitary confinement under conditions that could qualify as torture under international conventions. Authorities from eastern Anhui province placed exit bans on Hsu and his wife, Jodie Chen, blocking them from returning home to suburban Seattle in August 2017 and effectively orphaning their 16-year-old daughter in America.Critics say the Chinese Communist Party's expanding use of exit bans to block people - including U.S., Australian and Canadian citizens and permanent residents - from leaving China reeks of hostage-taking and collective punishment. They also warn that it lays bare China's will to exert influence, not just over Chinese citizens in China, but also permanent residents and citizens of other countries."American citizens are too often being detained as de facto hostages in business disputes or to coerce family members to return to China-this is shocking and unacceptable behavior by the Chinese government and a clear violation of international law," said James P. McGovern, chair of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China.Hsu says Anhui authorities have been effectively holding them hostage in order to convince his father, Xu Weiming, to come back from the U.S. and face charges he embezzled 447,874 yuan (worth $63,000 today) over 20 years ago - an allegation Xu denies.The COVID-19 pandemic has added grave new urgency to their desire to leave. Despite fear of retribution, the family is speaking out for the first time, offering a rare account of life inside China's opaque system of exit bans and secretive detention centers.Their story is supported by Chinese court documents and correspondence and interviews with U.S. and Chinese government officials. Some details could not be independently verified but are in line with accounts from other detainees.'WHY ARE YOU NOT HERE?'Five days before Hsu entered the smooth beige room at a Communist Party-run "education center" in Hefei, the capital of Anhui province, his stepdaughter, Mandy Luo, boarded a flight from Shanghai to Seattle alone. She had been on a family visit to China and was supposed to return with her mother to finish high school. But airport security had blocked her mother from boarding.Mandy vomited for 10 hours on the flight home. When Luo felt bad, she liked to curl up on her mother's lap. But now it was just her, a barf bag and a snoring man next to her."Mom," she kept thinking, "why are you not here?"The answer to that question lies in Chinese laws that give authorities broad discretion to block both Chinese citizens and foreign nationals from leaving the country. Minor children, a pregnant woman and a pastor - all with foreign passports - have been exit banned, according to people with direct knowledge of the cases.The U.S., Canada and Australia have issued advisories warning their citizens that they can be prevented from leaving China over disputes they may not be directly involved in. People may not realize they can't leave until they try to depart."We have frequently stressed to the government of China our concerns about their use of coercive exit bans," Ian Brownlee, the U.S. State Department's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs, said in Washington Tuesday. "We're going to continue to do so until we see a fair and transparent process.""The misuse of exit bans is troubling," said a spokesman for Canada's Foreign Minister. "Promoting and protecting human rights is an integral part of Canada's foreign policy."Australian consular cables obtained by the AP through a freedom of information request show that diplomats have repeatedly flagged concerns to Chinese counterparts about the growing number of exit bans on Australians.Within China, exit bans have been celebrated as part of a best-practices toolkit for convincing corrupt officials to return to the motherland for prosecution, part of President Xi Jinping's sweeping campaign to purify the ruling Communist Party and shore up its moral authority. Many corruption suspects fled to the U.S., Australia and Canada, which do not have extradition treaties with China.Requests for comment to Anhui Province's Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision, Public Security Department and procuratorate, as well as the province's foreign affairs and propaganda offices all went unanswered. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing declined to comment.I DON'T HAVE A FERRARIHsu was accused of being a co-conspirator in the corruption case against his father, Xu. The Hefei Intermediate People's Court found that Xu embezzled money for real estate in the 1990s, while serving as chairman of Shanghai Anhui Yu'an Industrial Corporation, a developer owned by the Anhui Provincial People's Government. At the time, Hsu was half a world away, studying accounting at the University of San Francisco.Xu denies the charges. In a letter to the court, he wrote that the money was a housing stipend, vetted by a government audit committee and awarded to dozens of employees. He said he is the target of a political vendetta.If he had really been interested in corruption, Xu added, he would have stolen far more than $63,000."If my dad's rich, OK, I deserve this maybe," said Hsu, who ran a barbecue restaurant in Bellevue, Washington, which he was forced to sell during his involuntary exile. "But I never enjoy anything. I don't have a Ferrari. I don't have a yacht. I'm just a small business owner. I work by my hands, cutting meat."His interrogations came in fits and starts. He gazed at the smooth edges in his room and thought about hurting himself. He fantasized a Delta Force chopper would rescue him. The men would break through the walls and say, "You're free, sir. Come with us." No one came. He read sports magazines and the Bible."Try to sit in a room for three hours and tell me how do you feel, just by yourself. You have nothing," he said in an interview.Before coming to the party education center, Hsu had spent 14 days in detention in Hefei, sharing a cell and one bucket toilet with two dozen men. Hsu asked police to send him back. At least there were other people, TV, chess. Even his cellmate who allegedly murdered his girlfriend was kind of nice.In mid-September police gave Hsu a phone so he could convince his parents to return. His mother told him they'd written letters to Washington. Surely, there would be justice. "Be strong," she said. "I am proud of you."Hsu's mother told him he was living in the dark. No, he argued, there is a window in my room: "I can sometimes see the sun and the moon."Now, he said, he knows what she meant. "I knew nothing else, nothing that happens in the world, they closed everything," he said. "She told me, 'In your heart there should be a light. You should keep that light on.'"After a few days, the phone was taken away. Hsu had been given a mission - convince his father to return - and he'd failed.Hsu was being held under "residential surveillance in a designated location," a legal mechanism that allows detentions of up to six months without formal charges or judicial review in certain cases.The United Nations has urged Beijing to halt the practice, saying it "may amount to incommunicado detention in secret places, putting detainees at a high risk of torture or ill-treatment."China is a signatory to the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which defines torture as an intentional abuse of power by the state that causes severe physical or mental suffering. It signed, but did not ratify, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which precludes torture as well as "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment."Joshua Rosenzweig, a deputy regional director at Amnesty International in Hong Kong, said that though residential surveillance sounds better than throwing someone in jail, in practice it's one of the most excruciating forms of detention under Chinese law. In Hsu's case, he said prolonged solitary confinement and 24-hour surveillance seemed designed to cause psychological suffering with the aim of coercing him to do something."That would clearly satisfy the criteria for torture and other ill treatment," Rosenzweig said. "The ability, inside a black box, to carry out this kind of coercion against someone - it's incredible this is allowed to go on."SURVIVING SOLITUDEHsu set a new challenge for himself: He would convince his guards, who had been ordered not to speak to him, to tell him their names."You study me. I study you back," he said. "Who is stronger."Over time, and late at night, his guards relaxed. Hsu discovered one was a fan of Manchester United. Others wanted to know what the schools were like in America and how much real estate cost. Eventually, he said, he got one guy to bring him a caramel macchiato from Starbucks.In December, police announced Hsu's father had agreed to go back to China. Hsu was shocked. On Dec. 14, a consular officer came with news that his father had made a sworn statement declaring Hsu's innocence.His mother also sent word that her husband's health was poor and he would postpone his return.Hsu held his fists and began to shake.The next morning, his minders yelled at him. They made him make a videotaped message. Hsu told his parents they should have kept their word and returned. He wrote a letter, telling them he was getting sick in his head, pulling his hair out, not sleeping.The new rotation of guards refused to speak to him. He dreamed about his daughter and woke in the night, his face wet with tears.Back in Seattle, Mandy was also struggling with solitude. Her mother's presence had been like the air she breathed, invisible until it was gone. She missed the security of knowing someone was in the next room, just in case.She expanded her cooking repertoire beyond boiled eggs. She managed the garden, got the boiler fixed, put up her Christmas tree by herself and waded through college financial aid forms on her own, all while pulling straight A's and helping her grandmother fire off petitions to Washington."What I need to do gives me a lot of pressure," she said. "I have to be a mom and then be a student at the same time."She didn't want to add to the general misery, so she boxed up the rage and helplessness. Instead of shouting at her relatives, she wept in her family's big, empty house."Why me?" she cried out, to no one in particular. "I'm only 16. What are you expecting of me?"WHO GETS SAVEDOn Feb. 11, 2018, near the end of Hsu's sixth month in detention, he was released. His wife drove nine hours to pick him up. They tossed his prison books in a dumpster and went out to dinner.Hsu watched his wife eat. He couldn't bring himself to hug her.He was so sorry.Maybe he had been alone too long.After sleeping under blazing lights for six months, he could no longer sleep in the dark. Shanghai's jostling crowds made him nervous. He kept crying.In Chinese tradition, he reasoned, nothing is more important than a son. The father should come back, even at pain of death, for his son. But what, then, of the son? Hsu said if his father returned to China and something bad happened, he would never forgive himself.Hsu's mother, Qin Peiyun, insisted she and Hsu's father would return to China only after Hsu and Chen, a U.S. green card holder, were safely back in Seattle."My husband and I go to China, we can't save Daniel and Jodie," Qin said in an interview. "If we go to China, they will destroy our whole family."Hsu, 43, and Chen, 44, were living off savings. Their marriage was rapidly deteriorating. When they weren't fighting, they sat at home and stared at each other.They couldn't say much on the phone because they figured their communications were monitored. It was a struggle to make their Americanized teenager understand how they could be stuck in China if they had done nothing wrong. Thousands of years ago, people who angered the Emperor risked having their entire family executed. But blood bonds and collective punishment were difficult for a person born in 2001 and living in Seattle to grasp.Friends offered Hsu jobs or money to start a restaurant in Shanghai. But he always declined, worried he'd get them in trouble. He couldn't work legally because he had a U.S. passport with an expired visa and the Anhui authorities wouldn't give him paperwork needed to get a new one.The U.S. Consulate in Shanghai lobbied intensively on their behalf. But nothing changed.Hsu spent a lot of time at Starbucks. He realized that by sinking into the ruin of his life he was doing exactly what Anhui authorities wanted. The more miserable Hsu became, the more pressure it would put on his father to return. He decided to change things, starting with his marriage."We have to show them no matter how hard the situation, we are fine, we are better somehow," he told his wife. This might be their final chapter in China, so they should do their best to relish the country.Chen got a job. They went out with friends, ate crawfish and went to the beach at Sanya.In May 2019, immigration officers came to Hsu's home and told him they were going to deport him because his visa had expired. They warned him he'd never be able to return to China."I said, 'We can talk about that later, but deport me, please.'"They didn't.That same month a court notice went up outside their apartment saying the property would be auctioned."We still need a happy life," Hsu said. "We have to show people the positive side."Tears were running down his face.A HOMECOMINGIn June 2019, Hsu and Chen missed their daughter's high school graduation. In August, they recruited relatives to see her off to college. The days inched by."Jail, I know my release date," Hsu said. "I'm still in jail. The (expletive) China jail. And I don't know my release date."In early April, at the request of Anhui authorities, Chen wrote a formal petition for her exit ban to be lifted."I miss my daughter so much, especially at this critical moment," she wrote. "I do hope to take care of her, side by side, to fulfill my duty as a mother."She pledged to persuade her father-in-law to return to China, saying she would deepen her emotional bond with her in-laws to establish mutual trust, then explain the "tolerant and humanized approach" of Chinese justice. She would use her wisdom and emotional suasion to reassure them that "the party and government will be fair and impartial."It was unclear why Chen's exit ban was lifted. Hsu would have to stay in China. "They told me if my dad is not coming back, I will never leave this country," he said.Talking on FaceTime with her parents a week before her mother's departure, Mandy, now 19, began to cry over a minor disagreement, then found she couldn't stop. She cried so long and so deeply she could barely breathe, pouring out three years of stress and loneliness.The morning of April 10, Chen and Hsu rode to Shanghai's Pudong International Airport in a diplomatic sedan, a small American flag on the hood flapping in the wind. The Shanghai consul general, Sean Stein, escorted Chen to the departure gate.Chen's trip back to Seattle took more than 24 hours. Concerned she might have picked up COVID-19 on the journey, she took an Uber from the airport to the leafy cul-de-sac they call home. Her daughter and her mother-in-law were waiting outside in the dark.It had been 971 days since Chen had touched her daughter."Finally, Mom's back," Chen said.Mandy ached to embrace her mother, but her grandmother had her by the arm, holding her back. No one knew what terrible germs Chen might be carrying.Chen had planned to self-quarantine for two weeks, but Mandy couldn't wait. She moved from her grandparents' house and went into quarantine with her mother."It's 50 percent over," Mandy said. "My dad is the other 50 percent."Back in Shanghai, Daniel went home from Pudong airport and slept most of the day.When he awoke, he was alone.--Associated Press correspondents Kristen Gelineau in Sydney and Rob Gillies in Toronto, AP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee in Washington, D.C., and researcher Chen Si in Shanghai contributed to this story.Follow Kinetz on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ekinetzLoad-Date: May 6, 2020End of Document

AMBASSADOR LIU XIAOMING HAS AN ONLINE DISCUSSION WITH THE BRITISH CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN CHINAStates News ServiceMarch 28, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 5764 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:From Chinese EmbassyOn March 24th, Ambassador Liu Xiaoming had an online discussion with St. John Moore, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in China, to exchange views on a wide range of issues including joint response to Covid-19 outbreak and Sino-British economic and trade cooperation. More than 430 representatives from British companies in China, Chinese businesses in the UK, third-party agencies and other stake holders from both countries attended the webinar. St. John Moore: Welcome everybody. Thank you for joining us on our latest webcast. We are honored to have Ambassador Liu with us. For myself, I'm the Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce based in Beijing. Ambassador Liu is in London. We are brought together by the wonders of technology. I currently serve as the Chair of Chamber based in Beijing overseeing the Chamber. Ambassador Liu, It is an absolute honor to have you here. We have people dial in across China. We have members dial in from across the UK and far beyond. This is part of the series of webinars we have been running since Chinese New Year when we entered the lockdown period in response to the Covid-19. We have been running these webinars with key figures in the UK-China relationship. For those who are less familiar with Ambassador Liu, let me start by saying a few words. I think for most people, you need no introduction because you have been the key figures in the UK-China relationship for the last ten years entering the 11th year. Ambassador Liu has a phenomenal career in the diplomatic service since graduating from Dalian University of Foreign Languages, including postings in four continents, including Zambia, multiple positions in the United States, Egypt, where you serves as the Ambassador, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea again as the Ambassador, and now since 2009, the Ambassador to the UK. Safe to say that Ambassador Liu has been an integral figure at the heart of our bilateral relationship for the last 11 years now. I could think of few more knowledgeable to join us today to talk about China-UK relations. Thank you, Ambassador Liu. Ambassador Liu: My pleasure. St. John Moore: Before we jump into questions that we have, I'd like to say a few more words. The British business community has a long history here in China. The Chamber is now nearly 40 years old. So we have been here through the "opening up and reform" period. We've continued this commitment over the past few months as China responded to Covid-19. Our hearts and minds have gone out to those having been impacted by the Covid-19 across China. The strong response taken by the government has been decisive. Sitting here in Beijing in the early days of spring, I see the first shoots coming through of recovery. And I can see this first hand as I go around the city and into parks, with the resolve that is coming through in the city. But now, when we set up this call to go into the diary a couple of weeks ago, a lot have changed. We now sit here from Beijing with great concern as the world responds. And this includes home in the UK. So once again, thank you. And I thought that may be a good starting point, Ambassador Liu, if I can jump into questions. Ambassador Liu: I appreciate this opportunity to communicate with your members. I know the British Chamber of Commerce in China has been playing a very important role in promoting China UK relations, especially the economic and trade relationship. I'm pleased to learn that you are going to celebrate your 40th anniversary. So I'd like to give you my congratulations in advance. And so that means your chamber has been growing with China, with the reform and opening up. We are in a very challenging time, as you put it. We have to take extreme and challenging measures. I'm very pleased that the top leaders of our two countries maintain very active and intensive communications. Just yesterday, President Xi Jinping had another phone conversation with Prime Minister Johnson. This is their second telephone conversation within one month. That was very rare even in my 10-year Ambassadorship in London to see such an intensive communication between the leaders. It's also good for you to notice, the first conversation was more about the British side expressing sympathy and support towards Chinese side. That was on the 18th of February. Now President Xi Jinping conveys his sympathy and support to the UK and expresses our solidarity with British people fighting against this virus. We are pleased that things are improving in China, but we haven't won the final battle yet. But we have the confidence in the strong leadership of President Xi and in the Chinese people who are united as one. This virus is spreading fast, and especially the situation in the UK is worrying. We are standing with the British people, as President Xi said, and we are also standing ready to offer assistance and support, as the British side did a month ago. So China and the UK are standing together. I firmly believe that the relationship between our two countries will emerge stronger, and the friendship between our two peoples will emerge deeper, after we win this battle against the virus. St. John Moore: Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. It is clear that this is the battle in the first phase in China. We are seeing positive signs there. And as you noted, the reports over the past week or so have indicated that in Hubei, we're seeing very low, if not zero, rates of infection. It's an important victory in that regard. Yet, as we are saying, the UK as well as many other places is now feeling this. And you spoke a little bit about this cooperation. And indeed the call last night between President Xi and Prime Minister Johnson is a great representation of cooperation. Can you speak a little bit more about those cooperative efforts and how the learning of the last two months that we in China have experienced -- how has that been shared to the UK for the moment? Ambassador Liu: I would say the collaboration in China and the UK in this battle against the virus is multi-fold. Firstly, the communications of policy coordination at the top level. We have top leaders of the two countries keeping very intensive communications. And there are also close communications at the ministerial level. State Counselor, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, had talked to Secretary Raab two times, and Yang Jiechi, the Director of the Office of Central Foreign Affairs Commission, talked to Mark Sedwill, the National Security Adviser to the Prime Minister. So at the top level, we have this very close communications. Secondly, we also share experiences, as you said, with the British side here in the UK. I kept very close contact with Secretary for Health and Secretary for International Development. I share the newest edition of the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol and China's experience of coping with the virus with the British Government. And our experts, doctors, share their experience through internet. Just a few days ago, the Chinese side hosted a webinar with 18 European countries. British scientists, experts, specialists and doctors attended and asked lots of questions. I was told that 80 questions were asked and the Chinese doctors were open and tried their very best to answer all these questions. Thirdly, we also have this collaboration on vaccine, on drugs to cure this disease, and the collaboration between the scientific institutions and colleges. Here on the British side, Oxford, Imperial College, Cambridge, and on the Chinese side, there are several universities and scientific institutions. We encourage businesses to play an important part in the collaboration. I met the global CEO of GSK who told me they are working with their counterparts in Sichuan on vaccine development. President Xi and Prime Minister Johnson expressed their support for the collaboration between our two sides, and especially between the scientists working on the vaccine. Fourthly, we also supported each other at critical moments. When China was fighting the virus, especially when we had this lockdown in Wuhan, the British side donated two shipments of medical supplies, which were badly needed. Now the Chinese side stands ready to send assistance to the British people. We are also sending one or two medical teams to the UK, consisting of doctors and scientists. They will be here to share their knowledge, share their experience, on how to kill the virus. So there are a lot of things going on here. Fifthly, China and the UK are collaborating in the global arena. Both China and the UK are countries of global influence. We're both permanent members of UN Security Council, and we are also members of the G20. President Xi and Prime Minister Johnson both expressed willingness to strengthen our collaboration in the framework of the UN and the G20, and provide leadership. At this important moment, we have to do more to strengthen multilateralism against unilateralism. And we need to show that we are one community, and China and the UK are working together to build a community with a shared future for mankind. St. John Moore:That is very positive to hear this and also about the shared responsibility in both to respond to this. As you can probably appreciate, being a Business Chamber here, the community is greatly concerned about the business impact. As I know we all are as we look at the economic consequence this is having in China, but now it ripples around the world. During the response in China, the business environment has been significantly impacted. This includes many British businesses that operate there, many locally established British businesses. They are going to ask you around this aspect. The British chamber has ran multiple surveys of its members since coming back from the Chinese New Year to really understand what is the real impact to members across the country. It is very real. I'd like to ask you about what the government is doing to support these businesses right now. These businesses are the backbone of the economy. They are delivering for citizens, including foreign business community here, and particularly British business communities. Can you share a little bit about what is available to support and what the government is doing? Ambassador Liu: Yeah. I quite understand the concerns of some businesses with regard to the future of trade and investment. Some are concerned about the prospect of China-UK economic relations. I also understand the negative impact on the economy in general, but I always believe, and I'm not just talking to you, but also talking to the business community here, that this negative impact is short term and temporary. Firstly, I would say, as you can see, this virus is controllable, curable and preventable as a result of China's efforts and I also believe that it will be true worldwide. So the economy will come back. Secondly, I think the fundamentals of China's economy are still strong. You can see for yourself the short term impact. But in the long term, the economy is still healthy and sound. Thirdly, the Chinese government is very much determined to restore production, to provide stimulus and impetus to the recovery of the economy. President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang said on many occasions, that we will get back to work as soon as possible. They both emphasized we are fighting two battles: one battle against the virus and the other battle is to resume production. Premier Li has laid out 6 main policies, which we called "six stabilizing methods". I guess you probably have all been informed. I do not need to go into the details of the six policies. Basically, they call for more relaxation of the restrictions, to open up wider, to shorten the negative list, and to give more benefits to the businesses, and loan credit and tax rebates for the export businesses. You know, since the beginning of this year, the foreign investment law has come into effect. And we are going to implement this law. Also, there are more favorable policies with regard to the financial sector and service sectors where British businesses are strong. And I am very optimistic about it. When it comes to China-UK business relations, the leaders of the two countries are very supportive for collaborations. Now the UK is leaving the EU and anxious to reach new arrangements with its main trading partners. We are ready for discussions on Free Trade Agreement. We are open and transparent. We even set a time table, a roadmap, which I presented to the senior officials of the Foreign Office. I look forward to meeting the Secretary of State for International Trade, and my counterparts. My colleagues in Beijing are also talking to your Ambassador about this. People are now reducing face-to-face meetings, but I still conduct my diplomacy face to face. After I heard what the Prime Minister said yesterday, we are going to do more online discussions. But we are very active and we encourage Chinese businesses to come here to the UK. Just few weeks ago, during the high time of this epidemic, I went to Scuthorpe to attend the Hebei Jingye acquisition of British Steel, together with the BEIS Secretary. I delivered a very upbeat speech to encourage the businesses of the two countries to work harder. This is a very good agreement. Jingye is going to invest 1.2 billion GBP, not only saving 3200 jobs, but also trying to transform and to upgrade British Steel. What is more, the deal gives people confidence. I regard it as a vote of confidence not only in British economy but also in China-UK collaborations in the next ten years. We have good news, though we are fighting against the virus. We, of course, expect more good news. And also, Huawei. The British decision is a good decision. Maybe this is a question you are going to ask. I just jumped into your subject. We welcome this decision by the British government, though we are not 100 percent satisfied, because it also imposes a 35 percent cap. We don't think it is in conformity with British free trade, business friendly environment, but on the whole, we know it is not an easy decision, and it is conducive to collaboration between our two countries in 5G. We know Huawei is a good company, a leader in 5G. I wrote many articles about this. I think they can be a great help to the Prime Minister to realize his ambitious plan to provide whole coverage of 5G in the UK by 2025. I think I need to stop here and listen to your questions. You know there is a lot to talk about when it comes to China-UK relationship. There are robust relations between our two countries. One thing I want to mention is that our economies are complementary to each other. That's the strength of our economy. There is great potential for cooperation. The UK is strong in services and finance, and China is very strong in manufacturing and has a huge market. It provides great opportunities and potential. So I feel very confident. And this year, if it were not for this virus, is a very important year for China-UK relations. This is the first year after Britain leaves the EU. This is the year when China is going to achieve its first centenary goal, to build a moderately prosperous society in all aspects and we will eliminate absolute poverty. This is another area, poverty reduction, where China and UK can work together. I was working with the City of London and British businesses on these projects. And you know even on health, when we are fighting the battle against the virus, China and the UK can strengthen our collaboration. The UK is a leader in medicine and vaccine, and China has frontline doctors' experiences. We can cooperate on this vaccine to contribute to global health security. The UK donated about 90 million pounds to the WHO, and we also donated about 20 million US dollars to support the WHO to work together on this very important task. St. John Moore: Ambassador Liu, You are right. You already addressed brilliantly many questions on my list to ask you. I would like to go back. This is the question that we received multiple times. You spoke about the six steps the Chinese leaders took to support the economy, to get ourselves back and working in your country. Are these measures equally available to British investors that are on the ground here? Is that an equal platform for everybody? Ambassador Liu: That is a very good question. Yes. The six measures are applicable to both domestic and foreign businesses. This is what we call national treatment. You can find out more details from the Embassy's Economic and Commercial Office and the Ministry of Commerce of China, and get answers for you specific questions. All businesses are treated as equal in China. St. John Moore: That's certainly what we strive for. You've also covered another very important point that last night President Xi and Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke by phone. And this is the second time in only a matter of a month. You spoke about the differences between the two conversations, one being about UK's concern about China, and now China's concern about the UK. Let's focus on the first call. During that call, President Xi spoke about the future of the "Golden Era". In fact the conversation was about the development of the "Golden Era". I just wonder if you could elaborate on that era. Is that a critical step after the last five years? Does China really strives for this "Golden Era" concept? What will we see when we past COVID-19, what is the future of the Golden Era? Ambassador Liu: We are still committed to this "Golden Era". When I said this is a very important year for China-UK relationship, I should also say this is the fifth year of the "Golden Era" started by President Xi's state visit to the UK. The relationship in the "Golden Era" is a cross-board relationship. We have very strong political relationship. At the very top, the leaders of our two countries maintain close and intensive communication. They've never met each other. People would describe it as a get-to-know-each other conversation. But it covered a lot of areas and they've become old friends at the end of the conversation. So I feel very heartened and encouraged by their first conversation. President Xi also proposed that we should strengthen the interaction and exchange visits at the very top. It has been 5 years since President Xi's visit to the UK and it has been 6 years since the Chinese Premier's visit. They are supposed to meet on a yearly basis, but because of Brexit, there were many opportunities missed. So we need to catch up and seize the opportunities. Prime Minister Johnson has been to China three times as Mayor of London, and he also expressed his wish to visit China soon, when he has Brexit done. Now I would say, when we have the battle won, we expect him to visit China and have face-to-face meetings with the top leaders. And also economically, we have very robust relationship. As I said, our economies are very complimentary to each other. There is great potential for collaboration across the board. Last year, we have made new record in trade sector, despite the downturn of world economy. We have 7% of increase of trade between China and the UK. In the first year I was here, our trade was 40 million USD. In my ten years' time, our trade doubled. I can't claim all the credit. I give the credit all to you. So that shows how robust and how strong this relationship is. In terms of investment, the UK is now the No.1 destination for Chinese investment in Europe. Chinese investment in the past five years is more than the total in the previous 30 years combined. So I'm really witnessing the growth of economic and trade relations between our two countries. In the financial sector, last year we launched the Shanghai-London stock exchange. That was historic, and there are so many "firsts" between China and the UK. The UK became the first Western country to join the AIIB; the first Western country to issue RMB sovereign bond; London is now the No. 1 offshore RMB market, and second RMB clearance center in the world. So we've seen lots of things going on. Since I became the Chinese Ambassador, I have attended dozens of launching ceremonies of Chinese businesses here, including all Chinese commercial banks opening up their branches here, except for one, and that was Bank of China, because the Bank of China branch was opened in 1929, long before I was born. They just celebrated their 90th birthday last year. We also have some big projects, like Hinckley Point C, and we were working on the phase 4 of Hualong technology. We also have Geely, doing very well with British taxis cars, and also Beijing Construction Company doing very well in the Manchester airport project. We are encouraging more businesses to come to the UK, because most businesses regard the UK as a country that has a more open, transparent and business-friendly environment. So I think Huawei is very important, I always want to talk to British government officials that you have to send a strong positive message, not only to the world, but also to Chinese businesses, that is, Britain welcomes foreign businesses, including Chinese investment. That is exactly the message Prime Minister Johnson told President Xi in their first conversation. They covered a lot of areas, they covered big projects, they covered financial service collaboration, they covered the Belt and Road Initiative, and Prime Minister Johnson said "we welcome Chinese businesses with open arms". St. John Moore: Ambassador, that is of course the backbone of Britain, which is a philosophy of openness to investment, and you captured that perfectly. Ambassador Liu: One more area I should mention, and that is people-to-people exchange. That was started in 2012, between China and the UK. You call it Summit, we call it annual meeting between the Premiers, it's an annual meeting at the top of the government. Then we have three mechanisms: Economic and Financial Dialogue, co-chaired by Chinese Vice Premier and the Chancellor Exchequer of UK; strategic dialogue, co-chaired by Chinese State Councellor and UK Foreign Secretary; and high-level people-to-people dialogue. The last one was very important. It's cross-board, about education, health, sports and media. Right now there are about 220,000 Chinese studying in the UK. The UK is the largest recipient of Chinese students, second only to the United States. They are studying in 154 British universities. Included in these 220,000 students are 15,000 young pupils. They are here in boarding schools. So it's a very robust relationship on education. Every year there are hundreds of Chinese art groups visiting Edinburgh for festivals of art, and also, the flights between our two counties are increasing. If it were not for this epidemic, every week there would be about 168 flights linking our two countries. I'm sorry to say it's been reduced to 23 now, but I think it will come back. Some of the airline CEOs I have met are planning more flights linking the two countries in June and July, so I feel very optimistic about the future of our relationship. St. John Moore: I of course sit here with similar optimism. You touched on a very interesting point that I'd like to come back to, because it's of course a privilege to sit here with you. As someone who has been at the heart of the relationship for ten years, going into its eleventh year, you highlighted all of the amazing firsts in the relationship. Maybe there is no answer to this question because it's all perfect, but I wonder if you reflect back on the ten or eleven years in this role, are there missed opportunities in this relationship beyond what has happened during Brexit with many attention focused on that, are there missed opportunities that bilateral relationships should focus upon, next year or the year after? Ambassador Liu: I would say relationship is not free of problems, but we fully understand that we have to face up to these problems. China and UK have many common interests, but we also differ in many things, in social systems, historic heritage, cultural traditions, even stage of development. You are a developed country, we are a developing country. It's natural that sometimes we have differences, but one import thing is how to approach these differences. Talking about the first conversation, President Xi said we need to respect each other, we need to respect the core interests and mutual concerns of each other. When we do this, our relationship will move forward; when we do not respect the core interests and mutual concerns, the relationship will run into difficulties. There are some sensitive issues between our two countries, like Tibet. We regards Tibet as part of China, we regard Dalai Lama as leader of the separatists. If the British leaders, especially the top leader, met with Dalai Lama, there was a problem. It means you do not respect our core interests, do not respect our sovereignty, integrity of our country, and sent out a wrong message to the outside world, that UK supporting the separatist leader. And with regard to the South China Sea, we are working for peace and stability in the region. If you have foreign ships invade into China's territorial waters, it might be a problem. You challenge China's sovereignty, and you invade Chinese territorial waters. And also on Hong Kong, it has been returned to China, it's part of China. We have "one country two systems" and we are committed to this formula. But if British politicians make irresponsible remarks interfering in our internal affairs of Hong Kong, still regarding HK under British colonial rule, there might be a problem. Also on human rights, we are all working for the better human rights. The goal of the Chinese government is to enable Chinese people to live happier, longer, enjoying much more freedom. But on the British side, you may have a different interpretation. With regard to democracy, I don't think there is a universal standard of democracy. Every country differs. British democracy is different from American democracy. If you look what is going on in the United States, many British friends have different views of American democracy. Here in China we are building democracy of Chinese socialistic characteristics. We need to respect each other. When we have differences, we can have a frank, candid discussion. But we do not need to resort to microphone diplomacy, yelling at each other and calling the other side bad names. That will undermine the mutual trust between the two countries. So mutual trust, political trust and strategic trust, is the key. It is very important. So I think if we can respect each other, respect the core interests and mutual concerns on an equal basis, I do not see major problems between China and the UK. I think our relationship is very strong, strong enough to have a candid and frank discussion even on some difficult issues. But we need to approach those difficult issues with caution, with prudence, and with respect. That's the key. That's my advice to my British colleagues. You talk about missed opportunities. We did missed some opportunities, because of the mishandling of these sensitive issues, and also because of Brexit. In the past 3 years, people in the UK had to focus on the Brexit. Some British friends said that we British people can do many things at one given time, but I don't think you can concentrate, sometimes, when something is distracting your attention. So I'm pleased now the Brexit is done, though you are still working with your European partners. I hope that after Brexit, we can tap the great potential between our two countries. St. John Moore: Ambassador Liu, there's much I'd like to unpick in your reflections upon the past ten years. But I'm also conscious of time. Your point around mutual respect, dialogue and dialogue is critical through this, remains key. You highlighted a lot of positives, both for Chinese investments into the UK and the continued investments of British businesses into China. Once on the other side of COVID-19, we definitely want to work towards mutual benefit in that regards. There are two other topics that I know that our members will be very interested in your perspectives. I will combine them together to see if you have some short remarks on those before we wrap up. The first was with the impact that Covid-19 has had on other topics that also has mutual concern to our countries, Climate change is one example. Hopefully COVID-19 is resolved very soon and will not impact the meeting in Glasgow later this year for the COP26. The first question is around how are the two countries working together and what else can be done for climate change? The second is also a question about the impact that COVID-19 is having on another important initiative, and this is the Belt and Road Initiative. The BRI is an important initiative British businesses have a significant interest in, and we can play a significant role in BRI. I'm curious of your perspectives on BRI and the impact that COVID-19 is having on the BRI plans. Ambassador Liu: So first thing first. On climate change, I think both governments are very committed to working together on climate change. This year also provides a golden opportunity for China and the UK to work together. We will be hosting COP15, and you will be hosting COP26. Though the two conferences have their different mandates, they're very closely connected. I quite agree with Prime Minister Johnson when he launched COP26 he expressed his support for China hosting COP15. Though it's about biological diversity, it works for protection of the environment, wildlife, and to make the ocean and water cleaner and greener, and that in turn will have an impact on climate change. Improvement of the climate will also have an impact on the environment - water, ocean, mountain and wildlife. Therefore there is a linkage between the two, and I think China and the UK can work together to ensure the success of the two conferences. By doing that, it will not only strengthen the bilateral cooperation between China and the UK on environment and climate change, but also contribute to the global effort, to global endeavors. So China and the UK can provide leadership on this important agenda. Of course, we hope the virus will be behind us by then. We will host COP15 in October in Kunming. Here in the UK, I am already talking to businesses, including the City of London. I talked to the Lord Mayor. They expressed their willingness to participate in COP15 and COP26 and to see what contributions British businesses can make to this important agenda. On the BRI, I think there is opportunity and potential for cooperation between the two sides. Last year, during the 10thEFD we signed the agreement on collaboration in third market. And, I think this is an area where China and the UK can dovetail our strategies and match our strengths. I quite agree with the former Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond when he said that UK was a natural partner for China in building the Belt and Road Initiative. I think UK is very strong in service, in finance, even in law, and in risk management, project management, and China is strong in building infrastructure and China has the capital. I think our two countries can work together on this project. And now in fighting against this Virus we have another agenda we can build a "health silk road". I know you speak good Chinese. When I was on Andrew Marr Show, I tried to share with him what "Weiji"(the Chinese word for "crisis") is about. You know when Chinese people talk about "Weiji" we are thinking about opportunities. First we believe that there are opportunities in crisis and that we can turn crisis into opportunities. I think this pandemic is very worrying but also it provides us with opportunities to work together to build a better world, and to build a stronger Belt and Road Initiative. St. John Moore: Ambassador Liu, I couldn't think of a better way to end than looking at the optimism and opportunity that is ahead of us. A large part of our conversation comes at the backdrop of COVID-19, and this is clearly the issue of the day. But it will be dealt with, and there will be a future that is brighter for all of us. Once again, thank you so much for your time today. It's been a genuine privilege to speak with you. I'm speaking on behalf of all of our members across China, in the UK and elsewhere that this is genuinely important. Hopefully this is the first of many opportunities that we could hear directly from you to the British business community. At the end of last year, the Chamber surveyed all our members across China, and that finds clear optimism amongst the British business community about doing business in China. Yes, there were concerns, and we have addressed those directly to the British government and your colleagues in the Chinese government, and we'll continue to do that. But there's underlying optimism. Clearly COVID-19 might impact a little bit, but the fundamentals, as you said before, still hold. That optimism is still underneath there. We are finalizing the British Chamber of Commerce's National Position Paper right now, and that will be launched very soon. I look forward to sharing it with you and your colleagues in the months ahead once it's finalized, and of course meeting and discussing in person when we are allowed to travel again. Ambassador Liu: Certainly I look forward to reading your papers. I also want to take this opportunity to express my best wishes to your members, and also my hearty thanks to your members. At the early stage when China was fighting this Virus, many of your members showed sympathy and support to the Chinese people. They donated, as I understand, more than 100 million RMB. It will be remembered by the Chinese people and we appreciate that. It really shows the solidarity and strength of our relationship and I always believe that there is a great future for our relationship. And the British businesses have this entrepreneurship, they think long term, and they are always optimistic about the future. So that is the strength of the UK. That is the cultural DNA in UK, and it is also shared by China. We are nations that think long term, that think in the optimistic way. So I always believe there is a great future between our two countries. St. John Moore: Thank you, Ambassador Liu. Ambassador Liu: My pleasure. Thank you, too.Load-Date: March 31, 2020End of Document

Here comes the US crackdown on China stocksCNN WireMay 21, 2020 Thursday 7:04 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 1017 wordsDateline: NEW YORK (CNN Business) BodyNEW YORK (CNN Business) --  Chinese stocks are the latest flashpoint in an intensifying standoff between the United States and China. In recent days, US lawmakers, government agencies and stock exchanges have taken steps aimed at limiting Beijing's access to America's vast capital markets. The US Senate unanimously passed a bill Wednesday that would prevent companies that refuse to open their books from listing on Wall Street. The bill's bipartisan cosponsors said the goal is to "kick deceitful Chinese companies off US exchanges." Earlier this week, Nasdaq proposed a trio of rules that would make it tougher for Chinese companies to go public on that exchange. Nasdaq also moved to delist Luckin Coffee in the wake of the Chinese firm's accounting fraud. Last week, a US government pension fund with nearly $600 billion in assets shelved plans to invest in Chinese stocks. The reversal came after the White House warned that investing in Chinese companies posed national security risks. The moves, coupled with President Donald Trump's threats to impose additional tariffs, underscore surging tensions between the world's two largest economies. The risk is a return of a full-scale trade war, except this time the battle would be waged during a pandemic that is already crushing the world economy. "The list of anti-China actions is quickly growing in DC," Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, wrote in a note to clients Thursday. 'Warp speed'Although the pressure on China is being led by Trump, there is bipartisan support in Washington for confronting Beijing, especially because of criticism of China's initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak. It's telling that the Senate bill passed by unanimous consent, meaning a single US senator could have blocked it. None did. "In the current political environment, few, if any, members of Congress want to be seen as supporting China," said Mills. "This legislation is moving at warp speed," he said. Shares of US-listed Chinese companies, including e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com, retreated more than 3% on Thursday. Social media company Weibo, which is listed in Nasdaq, fell 2%. "This bill is to protect investors and it's long overdue," Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland who introduced the legislation, told CNN Business. He predicted the legislation will ultimately get passed by his colleagues in the House of Representatives. "It's not that we're picking on China. We want them to play by the same rules as everyone else," Van Hollen said.Lack of transparency The Luckin Coffee accounting scandal has brought renewed attention to the transparency problems linked to US-listed companies from China. Last month, Luckin shares crashed more than 75% after it disclosed that an internal investigation discovered fabricated transactions. The nosedive wiped out more than $5 billion of the company's market value, hurting US mom-and-pop investors in the process. Luckin, which went public a year ago, fired its CEO and chief operating officer on May 12. Investors often face a lack of transparency when it comes to Chinese stocks. China does not allow US audit watchdogs at the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to inspect audits of companies registered in China and Hong Kong. "It's asinine that we're giving Chinese companies the opportunity to exploit hardworking Americans --- people who put their retirement and college savings in our exchanges --- because we don't insist on examining their books," Senator John Neely Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana who introduced the legislation, said in a statement. "There are plenty of markets all over the world open to cheaters, but America can't afford to be one of them." The bill would bar foreign companies from listing on US exchanges if they fail to adhere with US auditors for three straight years. "It's important for investors to know that, because companies that are ultimately controlled by a foreign government are subject to the political whims of that government," Van Hollen said. All US-listed public companies would also be required to disclose whether they are owned or controlled by a foreign government, including China's Communist party. Chinese IPOs face new roadblocks Meanwhile, Nasdaq proposed three new rules that would limit the ability of Chinese companies to go public on the exchange. Among other things, the rules would prevent the listing of smaller stocks, which can be vulnerable to market manipulation, and require that at least one senior executive or director has past work experience at a US-listed public company or other relevant background. Although the proposed rules do not specifically target China, it's clear that's their focus. Nasdaq said the rules would apply to all companies from "restrictive market" countries that have "secrecy laws, blocking statutes, national security laws...or regulations restricting access to information by regulators." SEC Chairman Jay Clayton praised Nasdaq's efforts to crack down on IPOs from emerging markets such as China. "Investors should be cheering," Clayton told CNBC this week. Tech cold warAlthough the latest battleground is over Chinese securities, it is part of a broader battle over technology, national security and global supremacy. "The Chinese government is playing to win. They believe technology leadership is why the United States became the only superpower in the world," said David Weild, a capital markets expert and former vice chairman of Nasdaq. Last week, the US Commerce Department moved to restrict the ability of Huawei, China's tech crown jewel, to make and obtain semiconductor chips that use American-made software and technology. "China is on a glidepath to dominance and is cheating at every turn," said Kennedy, the Louisiana senator, in his statement. This battle is unlikely to be settled by simply delisting Chinese stocks or through more transparent accounting standards. It's part of a deeper cold war that will span years, if not decades. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company. All rights reserved.Load-Date: May 21, 2020End of Document

Chinese surveillance giants blacklisted by Trump's administration are set to appear at a major US security trade showBusiness Insider USMarch 5, 2020 Thursday 05:34 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 1190 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Isobel Asher Hamilton)Highlight: Hikvision and Dahua were blacklisted last year because of their involvement in the persecution of the Uighur people in Xinjiang.BodyREUTERS/Thomas Peter• New research shows Chinese companies offering surveillance technologies- including two firms on a US trade blacklist - will exhibit at a major US security trade fair later this month.• Hikvision and Dahua were placed on the entity list by the Department of Commerce in 2019 because of their involvement in the persecution of the Uighur people in Xinjiang.• Also attending the fair will be two companies with close ties to Huawei. Huawei has been blacklisted by the US since May 2019 over worries about alleged ties to China's government.• The number of Chinese companies exhibiting would have been much higher had it not been for the novel coronavirus outbreak, which forced numerous planned exhibitors to pull out of the conference.• Researcher Sam Woodhams says the companies' presence at the trade fair suggests recent US efforts to sanction Chinese tech firms have fallen short.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.Chinese surveillance companies blacklisted by the US are openly touting their technologies to the American and international market, despite criticism for human rights abuses and alleged snooping.A new report from security researcher Samuel Woodhams at Top10VPN reveals that several Chinese companies, including two currently on the US Department of Commerce's official trade blacklist and two more with close links to Huawei, are due to exhibit at a major US trade show later in March.American companies are forbidden from doing business with blacklisted companies unless they have a special license from the government. The International Security Conference & Exposition (ISC) West is due to take place on March 17 to 20 in Las Vegas and claims to be hosting over 1,000 exhibitors and brands.Hikvision and Dahua have been implicated in Uighur oppression in ChinaExhibiting at the event are the American subsidiaries of Hikvision and Dahua. The two firms are Chinese video surveillance giants which were placed on the Department of Commerce's entity list in 2019 for alleged involvement in human rights abuses in Xinjiang, China. The Chinese government has pursued a campaign of imprisonment and persecution against the predominantly Muslim Uighur minority.Woodhams' research found that not only is Dahua scheduled to appear at the trade fair, it has hired the biggest stands available. According to a press release on ISC's website, Dahua will be touting a "Wi-Fi enabled video doorbell, floodlight camera, and mini camera."Hikvision meanwhile will be selling a camera with "thermal imaging-based fire detection, temperature monitoring, [and] cigarette smoking detection."REUTERS/Murad SezerThe companies' presence at ISC raises questions about how effective the US ban really is, and how it applies to US subsidiaries of Chinese companies.Woodhams told Business Insider: "That several companies with problematic human rights records will be free to promote their invasive technologies to US security professionals raises significant concerns about creeping surveillance across the US and attests to the lack of human rights safeguards in the security industry more broadly."Further, the number of Chinese companies and their American subsidiaries that continue to feature in US security trade fairs suggests that recent efforts to decouple the American and Chinese technology sectors have had limited success."In the case of Dahua, the company seemed to revel in the Commerce Department's sanction. Per video surveillance researchers IPVM, Dahua's VP Zhu Jiangming told the press in the week following the blacklisting: "The fact that we are under the US control list shows that we indeed have a strong technological capability."Neither Dahua nor Hikvision responded to requests for comment from Business Insider.A spokesman for the Bureau of Industry and Security (the sub-section of the Commerce Department that deals with the entity list) told Business Insider that participants at a trade conference would have to comply with the export restrictions imposed on companies on the list.The spokesman didn't give further clarification, but this suggests blacklisted companies are free to advertise their wares in the US as long as they don't strike deals with American businesses without the proper approvals.ReutersAnthropology researcher and Uighur expert Darren Byler told Business Insider Dahua and Hikvision played a pivotal role in China's crackdown on the country's minority Uighur population.Both were paid hundreds of millions of dollars by China to build video surveillance systems, he said - Hikvision has been awarded at least $293 million in government contracts, while Dahua has received over $900 million."Hikvision and Dahua are two of the key technology firms responsible for the surveillance systems that have been built in Xinjiang," he said. "These systems produce a web of face and voice recognition-enabled surveillance cameras, face-recognition checkpoints at jurisdictional boundaries, license plate recognition technologies, command centers, data storage centers, data interface platforms, portable data assessment tools, and rapid response capacity building."Two firms with close connections to Huawei are exhibitingAlso present at the event will be two companies with close ties to phone and equipment maker Huawei, the most high-profile Chinese company to be placed on the entity list by the Trump administration.The US and Huawei have been engaged in a fierce political dogfight for more than a year, and the Trump administration has been heavily lobbying allies to freeze out Huawei's 5G equipment from national networks on the grounds the company spies for the Chinese government. Huawei has consistently denied the allegations.AP Photo/Ng Han GuanThe first of the Huawei-linked companies is wireless tech company Quectel. Quectel has been an official partner of Huawei's since at least 2017, but            more recently in February 2020 the two companies announced a partnership along with several other companies to "launch 5G industrial modules."The second is SIP telecoms company Fanvil Technology, which announced a partnership to give its products "full interoperability" with Huawei services in 2014.The list of Huawei-linked companies would have been higher, Woodhams reports, but the majority of Chinese companies originally slated to appear at ISC pulled out due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.Neither Quectel nor Fanvil responded to requests for comment from Business Insider. The conference organizer, Reed Exhibitions, was not immediately available for comment.NOW WATCH: Apple just revealed its AirPods Pro for $249, which feature noise cancellation. Here's everything that was wrong with the $159 pair of the wireless headphones.See Also:• Two Amazon employees in Italy have contracted the coronavirus• China's air pollution dropped dramatically after coronavirus lockdown• Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt says China could supplant Silicon Valley as the world's tech powerhouse unless the US government steps inSEE ALSO: Apple benefits from forced Uighur labor at its iPhone supplier factories in China, according to an explosive new reportLoad-Date: March 5, 2020End of Document

Alibaba (NASDAQ: BABA) Shares are Collateral Damage in U.S. China Cold WarAmerican Banking and Market NewsMay 29, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 American Banking and Market News All Rights ReservedLength: 1068 wordsBodyChinese e-commerce platform Alibaba (NASDAQ: BABA)  shares are feeling the impact of the accelerating geopolitical tensions between the  U.S. and China. While this strikes as déjà vu from the trade war uncertainty that was put to rest at the start of 2020, the growing resurgence seeks to unravel the phase one trade pact and overall relations. Allegation ranging from deceptive handling to the creation of the COVID-19 virus that leads to a global pandemic, has been launched at China. The U.S. ban on China-based Huawei Technologies from doing business with U.S. companies over 5G security concerns is still on the table. Tension is rising again in Hong Kong as protestors resumed clashes with the government when China implemented new security laws heading into the end of May warning the U.S. not to intervene. The rhetoric between the two superpowers are heating up tremendously as it seems hostility towards China s tactics seem to be the single bipartisan issue that both parties are united on. The recently passed Senate China oversight bill is a punch in the nose directed at China in regard to the potential de-listing of U.S.-listed Chinese companies. Investors in BABA may find it prudent to unwind positions before hostilities climb to a boiling point between the nations. The Senate Chinese Oversight BillOn May 20, 2020, the U.S. Senate passed legislation requiring U.S. listed foreign companies to certify they are not owned or controlled by a foreign government. While the bill itself applies to all foreign companies, the direct jab at China was summed up by the bill s sponsor Senator John Kennedy. His statement held nothing back, "The Chinese Communist Party cheats, and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act would stop them from cheating on U.S. stock exchanges  We can t let foreign threats to Americans  retirement funds take root in our exchanges." It can t be understated the history of fraudulent Chinese internet companies dating back to the internet bubble of 2000. The recent stock implosion of Chinese coffee chain Luckin Coffee (NYSE: LK)  is yet another cautionary tale for investors in fraudulent reporting from Chinese companies. The bill is expected to pass the House of Representatives as attacking China seems to be the one bipartisan issue between the two sides. Q4 FY2021 Earnings ResultsOn May 22nd, Alibaba reported its Q4 Fiscal Year 2021 earnings of RMB 9.20-per share, beating consensus analyst estimates by RMB 3.13. Revenues grew to RMB 114.31 billion versus RMB 108.31 estimates, up 22.3% year-over-year (YoY). Annual active consumers on China retail marketplaces rose to 726 million, up 15 million YoY. Mobile monthly active users (MAUs) grew to 846 million in March 2020, up 22 million YoY. Despite COVID-19, Alibaba  grew total annual active consumer base to 960 million globally and  achieved a historic milestone of $1 trillion across our digital economy this fiscal year.  As per Chairman and CEO, Daniel Zhang. The Company adjusted down guidance to RMB 650 billion versus RMB 656.44 consensus estimates. By any metric, Alibaba s numbers are still impressive in the backdrop of a global pandemic that peaked in China during the first three months of 2020. So why did the stock sell-off (-6%)? All War is Based on DeceptionRevered Chinese General Sun Tzu, author of The Ancient Art of War, notes that all war is based on deception. If this is the new cold war, then those words should be taken to heart for U.S. investors. The Senate s oversight bill calls into question whether U.S.-listed Chinese companies  numbers are real, and can they be trusted? This will rely on the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board s (PCAOB) determination which will require validating three consecutive years of accounting inspection for companies using a foreign public accounting firm. This would require companies to turn over original auditing documents which are restricted by Chinese law. It s also an accepted practice for the Chinese government to own a piece of most businesses operating in China. The SEC and analysts have questions about how Ali Baba calculates it gross merchandise value (GMV) for years as well as the underlying structure of the many subsidiaries within. The Controversial Loophole with Chinese Stocks It is illegal for non-Chinese citizens to own shares of Chinese companies. To bypass this regulation, Chinese companies create pass-through entities in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands that track or receive proceeds of funds. These are basically shell company entities that then get listed on the U.S. stock exchanges enabling U.S. investors to  invest  in the Chinese companies. It s a loophole that China has purposely  overlooked  in the past. However, this structure can collapse the moment China closes this loophole, a possibility very few investors ever thought would become a reality. Opportunistic Entry LevelsUsing the rifle charts  on a monthly, weekly and daily time frame provides a broader view of the landscape for BABA stock. BABA shares have been resilient throughout the COVID-19 pandemic until the most recent earnings release combined with the threat of the Senate oversight bill. The monthly rifle chart shows a make or break forming with the falling stochastic and 5/15-period moving averages (MAs) capping the channels at $202.29 and the $186.50 .  The weekly rifle chart is a make or break situation with a rising weekly stochastic and flat 5/15-period MAs that were challenged at $199.70 on the recent earnings sell-off. The most recent market structure low (MSL)  buy triggered above the $194.74 fib, which is a key line in the sand now. The daily stochastic was rejected hard off the 80-band to cross down. This set-sup a reversion or a perfect storm breakdown in the coming week. Investors should pay attention to the trajectories as potential downside and plan accordingly in a timely manner to protect gains or minimize losses. The upside reversion trajectory sits at the $207.69 and $211.59 fibs. If the weekly stochastic crosses down from the daily stochastic oscillation down, then a perfect storm can trigger for downside trajectories to $194.74 daily MSL trigger/fib key line in the sand if broken triggers further selling to the $190.96 fib then $186.40 monthly 15-pd MA/fib. If the monthly candle closes under the 15-pd MA, then a further downside move would target the $170.49-$166.10 fib range.   Load-Date: July 19, 2020End of Document

Targets of crackdown in China fear government's reach in USAssociated Press State & LocalMarch 8, 2020 Sunday 11:46 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICAL NEWSLength: 1352 wordsByline: By BEN FOX and CHRISTINA LARSON, Associated PressDateline: WASHINGTON BodyWASHINGTON (AP) - The photo of his father was barely recognizable. The old man looked unusually pale and tired, and his customary beard was shaved off. The son who received the photo over WhatsApp was immediately suspicious.He hadn't heard from his family in western China for two years while he studied at a U.S. university.His family are Uighurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group that has become the target of a massive crackdown in China. Since 2017, more than 1 million people have been confined to internment camps and many more are monitored in their own homes.Why would he get this message now? And why would it come over WhatsApp? The messaging platform is censored for ordinary people in China, but often is used by authorities.No words accompanied the photo, but he interpreted it as a kind of warning."I feel like I'm being watched even in the United States," he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he fears reprisals from the Chinese government. "They have all of our information. They know where we live."Such fear of surveillance has become a fact of life for thousands of Uighurs living outside China and struggling to rebuild lives abroad, while family and friends go missing in China's western Xinjiang region. Within China, the State Department says, many Uighurs have been subjected to torture and other abuse.Even Uighurs who now live in the relative safety of the United States, where their situation has sparked bipartisan concern in Congress, say they still fear being monitored and worry that speaking freely may spur reprisals against family members in Xinjiang."I hear these stories all the time," said Kuzzat Altay, president of the Uighur American Association whose own father renounced him in a video released by Chinese authorities on social media. "People come to me crying."Altay, who came to the U.S. as a refugee and has become a citizen, started a Uighur entrepreneurship network outside Washington. But most of the 25 members dropped out at the urging of family members in Xinjiang who had been visited by local authorities.Altay said he thinks Chinese authorities worried that his entrepreneurship group would have discussed the crackdown back home.The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.Ferkat Jawdat is a naturalized American citizen who came to the U.S. nine years ago and works as a software engineer in Virginia. His mother was taken into the Xinjiang internment camps in 2018.Last May, when she was briefly released, she called and told him not to speak out about Uighur issues. He later learned from relatives that she had contacted him at police insistence and was taken back into police custody the very next day.The Chinese government is broadly suspicious of Uighurs who have spent significant time abroad, said Brian Mezger, an immigration lawyer who specializes in Uighur asylum cases."The Chinese government views exposure to foreign influence as basically polluting the Uighurs," said Mezger, whose practice is based in Rockville, Maryland.A dozen Uighurs in the U.S. interviewed by The Associated Press, most of whom did not want their names used, described various forms of intimidation.They described calls from Chinese government officials instructing them to "check in" at Chinese consulates. Some were told their Chinese passports would not be renewed and were offered one-way travel documents back to China. Several said relatives back home were visited by local police looking for information about family members abroad.The young man who received the photo of his father in June, two years after family members in Xinjiang warned him to cut off contact, says he doesn't know what authorities wanted from him.He also received a series of unsettling text messages in the Uighur language, but he responded in Chinese to ask why the sender had contacted him. The person sending the messages said that if he wanted to have a video chat with my father, he could arrange it. "He wouldn't say what he wanted from me."These accounts of harassment match reports compiled by activists and human rights groups, including Amnesty International, which last month documented widespread fear of surveillance and retribution among 400 Uighurs living in 22 countries.The Uighur global diaspora is estimated to be between 1 million and 1.6 million people.There are several thousand Uighurs in the United States, with the largest concentration living in the Washington D.C. area."This is happening to people's neighbors, to fellow Americans - that's what's so scary," said Francisco Bencosme, an Asia-Pacific advocacy manager for Amnesty International.Uighurs qualify for asylum in the U.S. because today they face almost certain detention if they return to China, said Mezger, who has represented hundreds of people from Xinjiang. He said nearly all of his cases have been successful.The wait for asylum, however, can take years and the anxiety can be grueling."Even if you're free in the U.S., you can't leave the U.S. while your asylum application is pending," said James Millward, a professor of history who researches Xinjiang at Georgetown University. "If you have relatives in Europe or Canada, you can't go see them. You can't travel there for work. And you may have to wait for years."Xinjiang, which means "new frontier" in Chinese, was brought under control of Chinese authorities in Beijing in the 19th century. But the western desert region has longstanding cultural, religious, and linguistic ties to Central Asia and to Turkey.Uighurs have faced numerous previous persecution and assimilation campaigns by the Chinese government.An enhanced security state began to take shape in Xinjiang after 2009, when race riots left around 200 people dead in the capital city of Urumqi. In recent years, surveillance cameras and police checkpoints have become ubiquitous.The government began to build internment camps in 2017 as a means of intimidation and social control. Former camp detainees have previously told the AP that after being confined in the camps, they were forced to renounce their faith and swear fealty to China's ruling Communist Party.Uighurs face limits on the use of their language in schools, their ability to check into hotels and restrictions on cultural practices such as wearing beards and fasting during religious holidays.The government's goal is to "eradicate Uighur culture," said Dolkun Isa, president of the World Uighur Congress.He added that social controls have grown more stringent since the inception of Chinese leader Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative - an overseas infrastructure funding policy - has enhanced the strategic importance of Xinjiang's location bordering Central Asia.China's foreign ministry regularly bristles at international criticism of policies in Xinjiang, which it views as an internal matter. It has said that measures in Xinjiang are intended to curb religious extremism and that the detention camps are "vocational centers," where people are held voluntarily. But it has refused to permit independent monitors to visit.It's not possible to confirm that the intimidating messages received by Uighurs abroad come from Chinese officials. But the Uighurs' accounts of harassment have been consistent enough that both Republicans and Democrats in Congress back legislation that would require the FBI to help protect Uighurs in the United States.The young man who received the photo of his father and the string of suspicious messages said he called the FBI and that two agents met with him. The agency wouldn't comment on whether it investigated the particular case, but said in a statement, "Without discussing specifics, we take all reports of threats or intimidation seriously."Meanwhile, the man has continued his studies while he awaits a decision on his asylum application and worries about relatives in China.

Senate Judiciary Subcommittee Issues Testimony From Justice Deputy Assistant A.G. HickeyTargeted News ServiceMarch 6, 2020 Friday 6:40 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 9932 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism issued the following testimony on March 4 by Adam Hickey, deputy assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's National Security Division, at a hearing entitled "Dangerous Partners: Big Tech and Beijing":Thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of the Department of Justice regarding the threats that foreign adversaries pose to our information security, the vulnerabilities that can arise from doing business in those nations or with companies they can control, and the national security implications of an increasingly integrated internet.The Department's leadership has identified these issues as priorities. Attorney General Barr has emphasized the importance of cybersecurity, having spoken publicly about the risks our telecommunications sector faces, especially from China, and personally announced charges against Chinese military hackers. Prior to that, in February 2018, then-Attorney General Sessions established a Cyber-Digital Task Force to canvass how the Department combats the global cyber threat and to identify how law enforcement can more effectively accomplish its mission in this area. The Task Force's July 2018 report/1 did just that, and I will draw from it in my testimony today.Below I will outline some of the threats we have identified, particularly from foreign nation-states, and how we have responded through our investigations and other operational work, before going on to describe some of the legislative changes that, we believe, would help us better confront them.I. Cyber Threats from Foreign Nation StatesA. State-Sponsored IntrusionsBeginning in 2012, the Department's National Security Division shifted our approach to malicious cyber activity sponsored by foreign nation states. Applying the rationale that all tools of government power should be brought to bear on national security threats, we began opening criminal investigations of state-sponsored computer intrusions and attacks, with the intention of identifying, charging, arresting, prosecuting, and otherwise disrupting those responsible according to the same Principles of Federal Prosecution that apply in other, purely criminal contexts. We took this approach based on lessons learned from the counter-terrorism and counter-espionage contexts, where our objectives include a mix of intelligence collection and detection, disruption of illegal activity, and deterrence, and law enforcement has proven effective at those ends, especially when combined with other Executive Branch efforts. Since then, our investigations have exposed a number of disturbing trends.First, China, in particular, has for years sponsored computer intrusions to steal trade secrets and other confidential business information from American companies (among others) for the apparent benefit of its own industries, to give them a competitive advantage or to advance its military:* In 2014, for example, a grand jury in Pittsburgh, Pa., indicted five Chinese military hackers for computer hacking, economic espionage and other offenses directed at six American victims in the U.S. nuclear power, metals and solar products industries. According to the indictment, the defendants conspired to steal information from those entities that would be useful to their competitors in China, including state-owned enterprises (SOEs), including trade secrets, communications about business strategy, cost and pricing information, and litigation strategy./2* Later that year, Su Bin, a Chinese engineer, was arrested in Canada at the Department's request, on charges that he conspired with Chinese military officers to target U.S. defense contractors in order to steal military technical data related to aircraft. Su used his expertise to advise the military officers which companies to target, what files to steal, and why it was significant. (He was ultimately sent to federal court in Los Angeles, Cal., where he pled guilty and was sentenced to prison.)/3* In October 2018, a San Diego, Cal., grand jury indicted Chinese intelligence officers, among others, on charges of conspiring to steal turbofan technology used in U.S. and European commercial airliners. According to the charges in that case, the defendants relied on computer hackers to infiltrate company networks, but they were assisted by employees of a victim company who were working in China and who are accused of facilitating the computer intrusions./4* And in December 2018, the Department unsealed charges in Manhattan, N.Y., against two Chinese nationals accused of working in association with a Chinese intelligence service (the Ministry of State Security) in a global campaign of computer intrusions targeting managed service providers (MSPs), which are companies that remotely manage the information technology infrastructure of businesses and governments around the world. According to the charges, the conspiracy targeted a diverse array of commercial activity, industries and technologies, including aviation, satellite and maritime technology, industrial factory automation, automotive supplies, laboratory instruments, banking and finance, telecommunications and consumer electronics, computer processor technology, information technology services, packaging, consulting, medical equipment, healthcare, biotechnology, pharmaceutical manufacturing, mining, and oil and gas exploration and production./5That activity violated China's 2015 commitment to stop stealing trade secrets and other confidential business information through computer hacking "with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sectors."/6As we have spoken about in other forums, breaches like these (as well as trade secret thefts committed by company insiders) leach hard-earned intellectual property from American firms, unjustly enrich Chinese firms, and, at scale, threaten our economic security./7Second, China has also targeted large stores of personally identifiable information (PII), personal health information (PHI), and the like. In February, an Atlanta, Ga., grand jury indicted four Chinese military hackers on charges of hacking into the computer systems of the credit reporting agency Equifax in 2017, where, according to the indictment, they stole names, addresses, birthdates, and social security numbers belonging to nearly half of all American citizens (and driver's license numbers belonging to millions).As the Attorney General said in announcing the charges, this data breach was "of a piece with other Chinese illegal acquisitions of sensitive personal data," including the theft of personnel records from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management./9 Bulk thefts of sensitive personal data like these can support China's development of artificial intelligence tools as well as aid their intelligence services in targeting U.S. government employees and those they work with.The Department has been increasingly concerned about the national security consequences of sensitive personal data falling into our adversaries' hands. For a few reasons, the theft of PII, PHI, locational data, electronic communications, and the like is more than an inconvenience and can present more than a risk of criminal identity theft or embarrassment to an individual victim. First, there is vastly more information about us and our habits stored online than there ever was before, and with the proliferation of connected devices, the volume of that information will continue to increase exponentially./10Second, while any individual piece of consumer data is probably not a national security secret, a mosaic of personal information can enable computer hackers and intelligence officers alike to better target us, by guessing our passwords, tricking us into responding to a phishing request, or, more darkly, exploiting our weaknesses, fears, or ambitions. Third, the extent to which we are connected to each other (online and otherwise) means that information about people who do not themselves know national security or corporate secrets (perhaps our friends and relatives) can be exploited to target those of us who do. And, fourth, as recent studies have shown,/11 even masked or purely transactional information, when collected in bulk, can be very revealing when mined and analyzed./12All too often, privacy is spoken about as if it is a value opposed to law enforcement. But, in fact, our prosecutions vindicate the right to privacy, whether it is the right of a company to control who has access to its trade secrets; or the expectation of privacy we have in our e-mail communications and medical records. When a company faces retaliation through exposure of its internal communications, a political campaign's e-mails are hacked and dumped, or an Olympic athlete's medical records are exposed online, we will respond to these violations of privacy, both by investigating and charging those responsible (as we have in all of those situations) and by working to mitigate the harm (such as by working with providers and foreign law enforcement in countries where the stolen information is hosted to facilitate takedown requests).It is troubling, however, that our efforts to hold nation states and ordinary criminals alike accountable for their violations of privacy (among other crimes) are increasingly stymied by providers that seem determined to frustrate law enforcement access, not just to prevent unauthorized intrusions by bad actors. To be sure, the increasing prevalence of encryption has raised the baseline of protection and privacy we all enjoy, and it has been a net social benefit. As the Attorney General has observed, encryption "provides enormous benefits to society by enabling secure communications, data storage, and on-line transactions," and "[b]ecause of advances in encryption, we can now better protect our personal information; more securely engage in e-commerce and internet communications; obtain secure software updates; and limit access to sensitive computers, devices, and networks."/13But encryption, like other decisions requiring tradeoffs between functionality and security, is not an all-or-nothing proposition. In the Department of Justice's opinion, in some circumstances, companies have gone well past the point of ensuring, to a high degree of confidence, that unauthorized outsiders cannot compromise the security of your communications, choosing instead to blind both themselves and law enforcement officials attempting to execute court-authorized warrants to the malicious activity occurring on their platforms. In the United States, that decision might qualify as a marketing opportunity. Yet, some of these same companies willingly accommodate the demands of authoritarian regimes by relocating data centers to enable warrantless, bulk surveillance; disabling features and applications used by pro-democracy advocates; and otherwise catering to the whims of the politically powerful, where doing so is a pre-requisite for market access./14Their systems design, in other words, reflects a business decision, not an immutable principle. As the Attorney General has said about engaging with the private sector on this issue, it is well past time for the tech community to "abandon the indefensible posture that a technical solution is not worth exploring, and instead turn their considerable talent and ingenuity to developing products that will reconcile good cybersecurity to the imperative of public safety and national security."/15B. The Rule of LawChina is not limited to using intelligence and military officers and their proxies to hack U.S. systems. The legal environment in China--the authorities the Communist Party can bring to bear on Chinese companies and individuals to cooperate, combined with the government's failure to honor its commitments or to respect the rule of law and legal process more generally--has grave implications for trusting Chinese companies beholden to that political party for success.Starting in 2014, the Chinese Communist Party began enacting an interrelated package of national security, cyberspace, and law enforcement legislation. They include the 2014 Counterespionage Law, the 2015 National/State Security Law, the 2015 Counterterrorism Law, the 2016 Foreign Non-Governmental Organization Law, the 2017 Cybersecurity Law, and the 2017 National Intelligence Law, and most recently, the 2019 Cryptography Law. Together, these laws reflect President Xi Jinping's effort to transform Chinese national and state security in accordance with his vision of the "China Model."/16While some of the provisions of these laws could support legitimate, defensive national security activities, the 2017 Cybersecurity Law and the 2017 National Intelligence Law, in particular, impose affirmative legal responsibilities on Chinese and foreign citizens, companies, and organizations operating in China to provide access, cooperation, and support for Beijing's intelligence gathering activities. Other provisions, such as those contained in the 2019 Cryptography Law, impose requirements that will expose commercial encryption used within China to testing and certification by the Chinese government, potentially facilitating those same intelligence activities..Article 28 of the 2017 Cybersecurity Law states, "[n]etwork operators shall provide technical support and assistance to public security organs and national security organs that are safe guarding national security and investigating criminal activities in accordance with the law."/17Article 7 of the 2017 National Intelligence Law states explicitly, "[a]ny organization and citizen shall support, assist, and cooperate with the state intelligence work in accordance with the law, and maintain the secrecy of all knowledge of state intelligence work."18 Article 26 of the 2019 Cryptography Law requires any "[c]ommercial cryptography products that involve national security, the national welfare and the people's livelihood, or the societal public interest" to be tested and certified by Chinese government authorities, pursuant to the relevant provisions of the 2017 Cybersecurity Law.19 None of these laws provide much, if any, detail about legal procedures or judicial oversight available to challenge Chinese government demands. These laws are not merely defensive in nature: they enable the Chinese government to make affirmative demands on its people and entities to advance the Communist Party's interest.While it demands obedience to the law from its firms - as well as foreign firms that choose to operate within its borders - on the one hand, the Chinese government has demonstrated a willingness to break its commitments and disregard our laws, on the other. In 2015, China and the United States agreed to cooperate with requests to investigate computer crime, collect electronic evidence, and mitigate malicious cyber activity emanating from their respective territories. Yet in 2017, when the Department invoked that commitment to request assistance in connection with an investigation of a purported Internet security firm for trade secret theft, we received no meaningful response.Since 2001, the United States and China have had a Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement (MLAA). The Agreement creates an obligation, after one country makes a request to the other, to share evidence and provide other assistance "in investigations, in prosecutions, and in proceedings related to criminal matters." Over the past 10 years, however, China has rarely produced bank records or similar business transactional records pursuant to the United States' MLAA requests. In the few cases where China produced records, they were incomplete, untimely, or inadmissible./20On the other hand, when we exercise our authorities as federal prosecutors to compel businesses located here to produce records, the Chinese government threatens them not to comply, on pain of sanctions under their laws./21And when a foreign government cooperates with the United States, in our effort to vindicate our laws and protect our people, that government may face threats and reprisals from China, such as economic pressure or even the detention of its nationals on trumped-up charges.For these reasons, among others, the Department has been sounding the alarm about Chinese providers that are ultimately subject to direction or control by the Communist Party. All too often we talk about the security of a product or service in a simplistic way: whether there is proof that a company has already conducted illicit surveillance, for example. But if we wait for a smoking gun in this context, we might get shot.Whether a company has a culture that promotes theft, dishonesty, or obstruction of justice is just as relevant, because it tells you how the company will behave when it suits its interests. And that is all the more true if the company operates in a legal environment, like China's, where success depends on cooperation with the authorities, no matter how sweeping or illegal their requests. As the Attorney General wrote to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai late last year, urging the FCC to designate Huawei and ZTE as threats to the telecommunications supply chain that are ineligible for FCC programs, "Surely a willingness to break U.S. law combined with a determination to avoid the consequences by obstructing justice argues against the reliability of a provider."/22Our cases show that the Chinese government will use the employees of Chinese companies doing business here, and Chinese employees of foreign companies in China, to engage in illegal activity. Last year, for example, a former airline ticket counter agent pleaded guilty to acting as an agent of the Chinese government, without notification to the Attorney General, by working at the direction and control of military officers assigned to China's Mission to the United Nations. During her employment at JFK airport in New York for a Chinese Air Carrier, she accepted packages from PRC military officers, and placed those packages aboard flights to China as unaccompanied luggage or checked in the packages under the names of other passengers flying on those flights. She encouraged her coworkers to assist the military officers, telling them that, because the Air Carrier was a Chinese company, their primary loyalty should be to China. But covertly doing the Chinese military's bidding on U.S. soil is a crime, and the defendant and the Chinese military took advantage of a commercial enterprise to evade legitimate U.S. government oversight, violating TSA regulations./23This record--of intent, capability, and practice of exploiting access to U.S. systems; and of violating our laws and refusing to honor commitments--has led this Administration to take unprecedented steps to protect our critical infrastructure. In July 2018, for example, the Executive Branch recommended that the FCC deny an application for a license to offer international telecommunications services in the United States. The applicant was a subsidiary of China Mobile Communications Corporation (a Chinese state-owned enterprise and the world's largest mobile carrier). The Justice Department led the national security and law enforcement review of the application, and the Executive Branch's recommendation highlights the risks of granting a Chinese SOE common carrier status and, with it, access to trusted, peering relationships with American carriers./24We considered a number of factors, including whether the applicant's planned operations would provide opportunities* to disrupt our communications infrastructure;* to enable economic espionage; or* to undermine authorized law enforcement or national security missions.Because China Mobile is subject to exploitation, influence, and control by the Chinese government, we advised the FCC that granting China Mobile's application would pose unacceptable national security and law enforcement risks. And we were gratified when the FCC accepted that recommendation and denied the application, in May 2019.Cases like China Mobile have brought home to the Department how important our foreign investment review work is to protecting our equities in law enforcement, counterintelligence, and telecom security.* That is why, during the first two years of this Administration, we co-led more CFIUS reviews than in the five years before that, combined.* That is why we have renamed the staff that conducts these reviews to be a "Section," and reorganized its management structure, to match other operational components of NSD.* And that is why the President's FY2020 budget for the Department significantly increased the staff and other resources devoted to this work; an increase, fortunately, that Congress approved.To be clear, China is not the only country whose political and legal environment presents a challenge. As we found during an investigation of a software company that performed contract work for the Defense Department, even an American firm can present risks, depending on where it performs critical functions. In that case, the vendor used a Russian back office to code software intended for a classified network. But under a legal regime known as the Russian System of Operative-Investigative Measures ("SORM"), that software was subject to collection by Russia's Federal Security Service (the "FSB"), raising a risk that the FSB could gather information about our defense networks./25Similarly, the Department of Homeland Security barred federal agencies from using Kaspersky anti-virus software, because it was concerned about the ties between Kaspersky officials and Russian intelligence, and because Russian law allows Russian intelligence agencies to request or compel assistance from Kaspersky, and to intercept communications on Russian networks. The risk that the Russian government, whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky, could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicated U.S. national security./26II. New Ideas to Combat Cyber ThreatsIn the face of these disturbing and ever-increasing threats, I know the Subcommittee has on its mind a key question: How can Congress help, today? The good news is that, as the Attorney General's Cyber-Digital Task Force concluded, there are several key changes to Federal law that would greatly aid our work to combat threats online.A. Data Breach NotificationIn 2018, the White House's Council of Economic Advisors observed that most data breaches are not reported to the U.S. government./27This reluctance may be driven by a fear of regulatory action, of reputational harm, or of an interruption to business operations. The reluctance of organizations and businesses to disclose that they have been attacked constitutes a major challenge for the U.S. government in its battle against cybercrime. Law enforcement cannot be effective without the cooperation of crime victims. A lack of cooperation may not only prevent discovery of evidence that could lead to identifying and holding the threat actors accountable, but also creates barriers to fully understanding the threat environment.The Department has been actively evaluating statutory data breach notification requirements. Currently, there is no federal reporting requirement or standard. All 50 States have enacted separate notification laws setting standards governing notification by private entities when a data breach occurs, and companies must navigate and comply with the varying requirements in multiple jurisdictions. In the wake of recent high-profile data breaches exposing Americans' personal information, there is revived interest in national notification requirements.As you and your colleagues consider a national data breach standard, we would urge you to follow the model of many State statutes and include a requirement to promptly notify law enforcement in addition to, and in advance of, notification of impacted consumers. Government notification would increase Federal law enforcement's ability to pursue hackers and prevent data breaches. The Administration is actively working on proposed legislation, and we look forward to working with Congress on this important issue.B. Deterring Insider ThreatsI would like to spend the balance of my time today focusing on areas of concern in the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ("CFAA") and related statutes that currently hamper our work to combat threats online. The CFAA is the primary Federal law against hacking. It protects the public against criminals who intrude into computers to steal information, install malicious software, and delete files. It was also intended to criminalize malicious conduct by insiders who abuse their right of access to computer systems and networks to commit online crime. The CFAA, in short, reflects our baseline expectation that people are entitled to have control over their own computers and are entitled to trust that the information they store in their computers remains safe.The CFAA was enacted in 1986, at a time when the problem of online crime was still in its infancy. Over the years, Congress has enacted a series of measured, modest changes to the CFAA to encompass new technologies and to equip law enforcement to respond to changing threats. The CFAA has not been amended since 2008, however, and the intervening years have again witnessed the need for the enactment of modest, incremental changes. The CFAA needs to be updated to make sure that it continues to appropriately deter violations of Americans' privacy and security.At its core, the CFAA is a privacy statute, because it deters criminals from stealing peoples' information. Yet, the CFAA's privacy protections now contain a significant gap. The statute was meant to apply both to hackers who gain access to victim computers without authorization from halfway around the world, and to so-called "insiders" who have some authorization to access a computer -- like company employees entitled to access a sensitive database for specified work purposes -- but who intentionally abuse that access. The part of the CFAA that covers the conduct of those who have some authorization to access a computer is the tool that Department prosecutors have used to charge, for example, police officers who misuse their access to confidential criminal records databases in order to look up sensitive information about a boyfriend or girlfriend, who sell access to private records to others, or who provide confidential law enforcement information to a charged drug trafficker. As a recent survey of 472 cybersecurity professionals indicated, 90% percent of organizations feel vulnerable to insider attacks, and 53% have confirmed insider attacks against their organization in the previous 12 months. The survey also found that the type of data most vulnerable to insider attacks is confidential business information, and that a plurality of those surveyed estimated that the potential cost/loss of an insider attack was between $100,000 and $500,000./28Unfortunately, recent judicial decisions have limited the Government's ability to prosecute such cases. As a result, in circuits covered by these decisions, insiders cannot be charged under the CFAA -- even where the insider has intentionally exceeded the bounds of his legitimate access to confidential information and has caused significant harm to his employer and to the people, often everyday Americans, whose data he has improperly accessed.The insider threat is relevant to voting security. Currently, for example, if a foreign hacker accessed a State's voter registration database over the Internet, that could be charged under the CFAA as an access "without authorization." But if an insider, such as a State government employee, used his privileges to access the same information, that insider could not be prosecuted under the CFAA, at least as several courts have interpreted the statute.The narrow judicial interpretation of the term "exceeds authorized access" in the CFAA stems from concerns that the statute potentially makes relatively trivial conduct a Federal crime. We understand the concerns of the courts, and I would like to reiterate that the Department of Justice has no interest in prosecuting harmless violations, to the extent that the statute could be construed to cover them.However, by essentially barring CFAA prosecutions of insiders in certain circuits, these court decisions have constrained our ability to bring certain cybercriminals to justice. Over the last several years, numerous Department of Justice officials have called on Congress to address this issue in a manner that would maintain the law's key privacy-protecting function, while providing further reassurance that trivial violations of things like a website's terms of service will not be prosecuted as Federal crimes.The Department supports efforts that would accomplish this task. This can be done by reaffirming that the definition of "exceeds authorized access" includes the situation where the person accesses the computer for a purpose that he knows is not authorized by the computer owner. Such an amendment is necessary to ensure the nationwide ability to prosecute, for example, a law enforcement officer who is permitted access to criminal records databases, but only for official business purposes. At the same time, a legislative fix could add further limitations that reflect the statute's focus. For example, a limitation could be put into the CFAA making clear that in order to constitute a crime under the new insider provision, not only must an offender access a protected computer in excess of authorization and obtain information, but the information must be worth $5,000 or more, the access must be in furtherance of a separate felony offense, or the information must be stored on a government computer.We strongly believe that the insider threat problem in the CFAA can be fixed in a way that empowers the Department to prosecute and deter significant threats to privacy and security and further assures that prosecutions will remain focused on such crimes. Of all of the reforms to the CFAA under consideration by this Subcommittee, addressing this problem would have the most immediate, significant impact in improving our ability to punish and deter cybercriminals. We would like to work closely with Congress and, specifically, this Subcommittee, to find a way forward on this pressing issue.C. Certain Malicious Activities as RICO PredicatesWe support the efforts to update the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ("RICO") to make CFAA offenses and certain Wiretap Act offenses subject to RICO as was proposed in the International Cybercrime Prevention Act ("ICPA"), which was sponsored by Senator Graham and the Ranking Member in the last Congress. As computer technology has evolved, it has become a key tool of organized crime. Criminal organizations operating around the world hack into public and private computer systems, including systems key to America's national security and defense. They hijack computers to steal Americans' identity and financial information; they extort American businesses with threats to disrupt computers; and they commit a range of other online crimes.Accordingly, much of the fight against transnational organized crime has moved online. Federal prosecutors have used RICO for over forty years to prosecute organized criminals ranging from mob bosses to Hells Angels to members of MS-13. Just as RICO has proven to be an effective tool to prosecute the leaders of these organizations who may not have been directly involved in committing the underlying crimes, it should be a tool to fight criminal organizations that use computer intrusions and other CFAA violations to further their schemes. These changes, as proposed in ICPA, would simply make clear that all types of CFAA violations should be considered criminal activities under the RICO statute, with the associated heavy penalties.D. Protecting Election Computers from AttackProtecting election infrastructure from attack is another important goal. Yet, as the Department's recent Cyber-Digital Task Force report noted, "should hacking of a voting machine occur, the government would not, in many conceivable circumstances, be able to use the CFAA to prosecute the hackers."/29The CFAA's current definition of "protected computer" includes computers "affecting interstate or foreign commerce," a definition that attempts to encompass the breadth of congressional power under the Commerce Clause. We are concerned that courts might conclude that the Commerce Clause power, alone, does not reach voting machine computers that are not used in a commercial setting, are not used in interstate communication, and are typically never connected to the Internet or to any other network.The Department and each of its components has consistently recognized the primacy of State and local jurisdictions in the administration and policing of electoral processes under Article I, Section 4, of the Constitution. Accordingly, the Department remains committed to its longstanding policy in criminal law enforcement against operations, actions, or public statements that would interfere with State and local election administration, or appear to do so. Nevertheless, the Constitution in that same Section also provides for a federal role in regulating elections that include federal candidates on the ballot, and we believe that this provision provides additional support for an amendment that would cover election-related hacking.Expanding the definition of a protected computer to include electronic voting machines will strengthen confidence in the integrity of our electoral system and ensure that any attempts to manipulate the results of an election can be prosecuted to the fullest extent under Federal law. We therefore applaud the Senate's passage of the Defending the Integrity of Voting Systems Act last year, which would accomplish this important goal.E. BotnetsAnother striking example of online crime that victimizes Americans is the threat from botnets -- networks of victim computers surreptitiously infected with malicious software, or "malware." Once a computer is infected with malware, it can be controlled remotely from another computer with a so-called "command and control" server. Using that control, criminals (including nation-state actors) can steal usernames, passwords, and other personal and financial information from the computer user, or hold computers and computer systems for ransom. Criminals can also use armies of infected computers to commit other crimes, such as DDoS attacks, or to conceal their identities and locations while perpetrating crimes ranging from drug dealing to online child sexual exploitation.The scale and sophistication of the threat posed by botnets is increasing every day. Individual hackers and organized criminal groups are using state-of-the-art techniques to infect hundreds of thousands -- sometimes millions -- of computers and cause massive financial losses, all while becoming increasingly difficult to detect. If we want security to keep pace with criminals' technological innovations, we need to ensure that we have a variety of effective tools to combat rapidly evolving cyber threats like these.One powerful tool that the Department has used to disrupt botnets and free victim computers from criminal malware is the civil injunction process. Current law gives Federal courts the authority to issue injunctions to stop the ongoing commission of certain crimes by authorizing actions that prevent a continuing and substantial injury. This authority played a critical role in the Department's successful disruption of the Coreflood botnet in 2011 and of the Gameover Zeus botnet in 2014. (The Gameover Zeus botnet, which infected computers worldwide, inflicted over $100 million in losses on American victims alone, many of them small- and medium-sized businesses.) Because the criminals behind these particular botnets used them to commit fraud against banks and bank customers, existing law allowed the Department to obtain court authority to disrupt the botnets by taking actions such as disabling communications between infected computers and the command and control servers.The problem is that current law permits courts to consider injunctions only for limited categories of crimes, including certain frauds and illegal wiretapping. Botnets, however, can be used for many different types of illegal activity. They can be used to steal sensitive corporate information, to harvest email account addresses, to hack other computers, or to execute denial of service attacks against websites or other computers. Yet -- depending on the facts of any given case -- these crimes may not constitute fraud or illegal wiretapping. In those cases, courts may lack the statutory authority to consider an application by prosecutors for an injunction to disrupt the botnets in the same way that injunctions were successfully used to incapacitate the Coreflood and Gameover Zeus botnets.Thus, we support the provision in ICPA that would add activities like the operation of a malicious botnet to the list of offenses eligible for injunctive relief. ICPA would allow the Department to seek an injunction to prevent ongoing hacking violations in cases where 100 or more victim computers have been hacked. This numerical threshold focuses the injunctive authority on enjoining the creation, maintenance, operation, or use of a malicious botnet, as well as other widespread attacks on computers using malicious software (such as ransomware).The same legal safeguards that currently apply to obtaining civil injunctions, and that applied to the injunctions obtained by the Department in the Coreflood and Gameover Zeus cases, would also apply under the ICPA proposal. Before an injunction is issued, the Government must civilly sue the defendant and demonstrate to a court that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its lawsuit and that the public interest favors an injunction; the defendants and enjoined parties have the right to notice and to have a hearing before a permanent injunction is issued; and the defendants and enjoined parties may move to quash or modify any injunctions that the court issues.I would now like to turn to the criminal statutes that prohibit the creation and use of botnets. Unfortunately, these statutes also contain shortcomings. We find that criminals continue to find new ways to make money illegally through botnets. Law enforcement officers now frequently observe that creators and operators of botnets not only use botnets for their own illicit purposes, but also sell or even rent access to the infected computers to other criminals.Current criminal law prohibits the creation of a malicious botnet because it prohibits hacking into computers without authorization. It also prohibits the use of botnets to commit other crimes. But it is not similarly clear that the law prohibits the sale or renting of a botnet. In one case, for example, undercover officers discovered that a criminal was offering to sell a botnet consisting of thousands of victim computers. The officers accordingly "bought" the botnet from the criminal and notified the victims that their computers were infected. The operation, however, did not result in a prosecutable U.S. offense because there was no evidence that the seller himself had created the botnet in question. While trafficking in botnets is sometimes chargeable under other subsections of the CFAA, this problem has resulted in, and will increasingly result in, the inability to prosecute individuals selling or renting access to thousands of hacked computers.We believe that it should be illegal to sell or rent surreptitious control over infected computers to another person, just like it is already clearly illegal to sell or transfer computer passwords. That is why we support the provision in ICPA to prohibit the sale or transfer not only of "password[s] and similar information" (the wording of the existing statute) but also of "means of access," which would include the ability to access computers that were previously hacked and are now part of a botnet. In addition, we recommend replacing the current requirement that the Government prove that the offender had an "intent to defraud" with a requirement to prove that the offender not only knew his conduct is "wrongful," but also that he knew or should have known that the means of access would be used to hack or damage a computer. This last change is necessary because, as noted above, criminals do not use botnets only to commit fraud -- they also use them to commit a variety of other crimes.Some commentators have raised the concern that this proposal would chill the activities of legitimate security researchers, academics, and system administrators. The Department takes this concern seriously. We have no interest in prosecuting such individuals, and our proposal would not prohibit legitimate activity. That is because the Government should have the burden to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the individual intentionally undertook an act (trafficking in a means of access) that he or she knew to be wrongful. The Government should similarly have to prove that the individual knew or had reason to know that the means of access would be used to commit a crime by hacking someone else's computer without authorization.ICPA's approach makes clear that ordinary conduct by legitimate security researchers and others is not a crime. We believe that ICPA's botnet injunction provision strikes the proper balance in prohibiting the pernicious conduct I have described without chilling the activities of those who are trying to improve cybersecurity for us all.F. Enhanced Penalties for Malicious Activity Directed at Critical InfrastructureThe Department also supports the efforts in ICPA to strengthen the criminal code to better deter malicious activities directed at computers and networks that control our critical infrastructures. As I have discussed, America's open and technologically complex society includes, as a part of its critical infrastructure, numerous vulnerable targets. While the CFAA's maximum penalties apply to malicious efforts to harm the computers and networks that run our critical infrastructure, the statute does not currently require any enhanced penalties for such conduct. While it is reasonable to believe that judges would impose appropriate prison terms if malicious activity severely debilitates a critical infrastructure system, it is possible that courts may not impose adequate penalties for activities that cause less disruption -- and they could conceivably impose no penalty at all in the case of an attempt that is thwarted before it is completed.In light of the grave risk posed by those who might compromise our critical infrastructure, the Department believes that the enhanced penalties for such malicious activity called for in ICPA not only will appropriately punish offenders, but also will more effectively deter others who would engage in misconduct that puts public safety and national security at risk. Criminals and other malicious actors should know that any attempt to damage a vital national resource will result in serious consequences.G. Updated Tools for Investigators and ProsecutorsWe have long had concerns about the text of the "Pen Register and Trap and Trace" ("PRTT") statute that is used, among other things, to support criminal investigations and the security of government networks. The PRTT statute's exceptions -- which, for example, permit a provider, but not a user, of wire or electronic communications services to monitor their own network -- are subtly and inexplicably different than the Wiretap Act's exceptions. The existing language in the PRTT statute has been difficult to apply, resulting in complex legal analyses for services as simple as Caller ID. The Wiretap Act's rules appropriately protect the content of communications; they are more than adequate to protect non-content information, which is much less sensitive. Importing the Wiretap Act's exceptions into the PRTT statute would remedy these problems and result in a more logical framework for applying these two related statutes that regulate the real-time collection of communications. There is no reason why a user of a PRTT device, whether a private or governmental entity, should be precluded from logging his or her own communications. We have proposed language under which the PRTT statute would continue to protect user privacy, but it would no longer inappropriately limit private entities' or the Government's ability to use PRTT devices on their own computer networks.Finally, we support several amendments to the CFAA, which are reflected in the ICPA. Key amongst these changes would be amendments to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2513, which would bring the forfeiture provisions of the CFAA in line with other Federal criminal statutes, providing concrete procedures for the forfeiture of property used to commit or facilitate a violation of this statute as well as the proceeds of such violation. These amendments support consistent application of the law, while maintaining the Government's ability to dismantle and disrupt criminal operations and deter future violations, both when prosecutors are able to reach violators and when those violators are located overseas beyond the judicial reach of our courts. The amendments in ICPA are a measured and sensible addition that will help assure that criminal hackers do not profit from their crimes.We also support the change in ICPA that would make the sale or advertising of a surreptitious interception device under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2512 a predicate offense under the Federal money laundering statutes. Section 2512, which is part of the Wiretap Act, has proven to be a valuable tool for protecting the privacy of innocent Americans by criminalizing the manufacture, distribution, possession, and advertising of devices, such as spyware, that unlawfully collect private communications. Section 2512 is not a predicate offense under 18 U.S.C. Sec.Sec. 1956 and 1957, however, which impedes the Government's ability to punish and deter certain offenders who conceal and spend their ill-gotten gains by selling and advertising spyware and other illegal interception devices.H. Assuring Jurisdiction of Thefts of U.S. Companies' Trade SecretsThe Economic Espionage Act recognizes that trade secret theft frequently involves an international component (and section 1831 of Title 18 specifically criminalizes trade secret theft committed for the benefit of foreign instrumentalities). However, since the statute came into force in 1996, manufacturing, research, and development have become increasingly dispersed geographically. Just as manufacturing supply chains often cross borders, U.S. firms conduct research and development across international borders, with collaboration between facilities in multiple countries. With this trend, U.S. companies face increasing risk that their trade secrets may be stolen from facilities they own or operate outside U.S. borders.Under the current EEA, the Department can prosecute trade secret thefts occurring abroad, but only where either (1) the defendant(s) are U.S. persons or organizations, or (2) an act in furtherance of the offense is committed in the United States. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1837. One illustration of the EEA's extraterritorial reach is the Department's ongoing prosecution of United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., and three Taiwan nationals for theft of trade secrets belonging to Micron Technologies. In that case, the defendants are charged with stealing trade secrets from a Micron facility in Taiwan, but acts in furtherance of the theft were committed within the U.S. However, it is easy to imagine future cases in which trade secrets owned by a U.S. company may be stolen by foreign nationals from facilities outside the U.S., which would fall outside the extraterritorial reach of the current statute. To address this scenario, Congress could amend Section 1837 to permit jurisdiction over extraterritorial conduct, at least in criminal cases, where "the trade secret owner injured as a result of the offense conduct is a natural person who is a citizen or permanent resident alien of the United States, or an organization organized under the laws of the United States or a State or political subdivision thereof."III. ConclusionI want to thank the Subcommittee again for providing me this opportunity to discuss these important issues on behalf of the Department of Justice. We look forward to continuing to work with Congress to improve the Government's ability to counter threats posed by our foreign adversaries in cyberspace. I am happy to answer any questions you may have.* * *Footnotes:1.

Accordingly, the Department was pleased to support Congress's recent expansion of authority of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), by the Foreign Investment Risk Review and Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA), to consider investments in U.S. businesses that maintain or collect sensitive personal data of United States citizens that may be exploited in a manner that threatens national security. In regulations implementing this authority, CFIUS defined "sensitive personal data" for purposes of its jurisdiction by describing categories of identifiable data that could potentially implicate national security, including financial data that could be used to analyze or determine an individual's distress or hardship, consumer report information, insurance applications, health information, non-public electronic communications, geolocation data, biometric data, government identification information, security clearance status, government employment applications, and genetic tests. 85 Fed. Reg. 3112, 3132 (Jan. 17, 2020) (to be codified at 31 C.F.R. pt. 800.241(a)(1)(ii)). These categories reflect some of the most sensitive types of data that could be used to target individuals in ways that threaten national security. We look forward to working with other members of CFIUS to review qualifying foreign investments with an eye towards protecting national security by safeguarding Americans' sensitive personal data.13.

We believe the Enhanced Security Plan (which can be accessed through the above link) is a model of good security practices: it requires Netcracker to use U.S.-based infrastructure to provide certain services to U.S.-based clients; obtain prior, written consent from U.S.-based clients before remotely accessing their networks; and avoid transferring certain categories of sensitive client data outside the U.S. without taking certain precautions. In addition, Netcracker was required to engage an auditor to ensure compliance with the Enhanced Security Plan. Based on our direct engagement with the company as well as external information and analysis to-date, we believe Netcracker has so far complied with its obligations under the agreement.26.

China's Race to Eradicate All Extreme Poverty by 2020 Explored in New PBS SoCal Documentary Debuting May 11 VOICES FROM THE FRONTLINE: CHINA'S WAR ON POVERTY; Through Unprecedented Access to China, the Film Offers Insight Into How the Country Has Mobilized to Fight the CoronavirusPR NewswireApril 15, 2020 Wednesday 5:00 PM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 938 wordsDateline: BURBANK, Calif., April 15, 2020 BodyPR NewswireBURBANK, Calif., April 15, 2020 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- PBS SoCal, Southern California's home for the premieres of new PBS programs, announced today the presentation of its co-production VOICES FROM THE FRONTLINE: CHINA'S WAR ON POVERTY. Hosted and written by Dr. Robert Lawrence Kuhn, a renowned China expert and recipient of the China Reform Friendship Medal, and executive produced by Adam Zhu, VOICES FROM THE FRONTLINE: CHINA'S WAR ON POVERTY is produced by a joint US-China production team, led by award-winning director Peter Getzels. The documentary provides a textured and intimate portrayal of China's historic anti-poverty campaign by following five cases that highlight China's poverty alleviation policies. With unprecedented access to travel in China, the film explores the country's poverty alleviation programs, while interviewing villagers and local officials along the way. VOICES FROM THE FRONTLINE: CHINA'S WAR ON POVERTY will air Mon. May 11 at 7 p.m. on PBS SoCal, Sat. May 16 at 7 p.m. on KCET, Wed. May 20 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on Link TV Nationwide (DirecTV 375 and DISH Network 9410) and will be broadcast on PBS stations across the country with streaming available online at pbssocal.org/voicesfromthefrontline, as well as on pbs.org and on the free PBS App."2020 is the year that China intends to eliminate all absolute poverty nationwide and this film is the inside story of how it is happening," said Kuhn. "But 2020 is also the year of the novel coronavirus, and when you look at how the government has mobilized to fight the contagion, similarities between China's war on the epidemic and China's war on poverty are striking. During the production, we discovered every poor family had a targeted plan to lift it out of poverty; we witnessed village meetings to determine people's poverty status; and we watched local officials being held accountable, their careers at stake.""To understand China's approach to poverty alleviation helps people to understand how China's system works," said Zhu. "Directing a cross-cultural team in remote parts of China led to insights on how this extraordinary program works." said Getzels, adding "we took a cinematic approach, enabling people to present their own stories."According to the Chinese government, China's economic development has lifted more than 750 million people out of poverty. But for the more than 100 million intractably poor, who are often living in remote mountainous regions, economic development is not enough. With President Xi Jinping introducing 'targeted poverty alleviation' as his most important task, measures to eliminate destitution involve customized programs with third-party evaluations to assure accuracy and honesty.Voices from the Frontline: China's War on Poverty is co-produced by The Kuhn Foundation and PBS SoCal in association with CGTN.Join the conversation on social media using #ChinasChallengesPBSABOUT PBS SOCALPBS SoCal is a donor-supported community institution that is a part of Public Media Group of Southern California, the flagship PBS station for 19 million diverse people across California formed by the merger of PBS SoCal and KCETLink Media Group.

'A Regime That Fears Religion:' New Report Details China's Crackdown On ReligionThe Daily CallerApril 28, 2020 Tuesday 09:04 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: WORLDLength: 1413 wordsByline: Marlo Safi, Culture Reporter, marlo@dailycaller.comMarlo Safi is a 2018 graduate of the University of Pittsburgh. When she is not reporting on subjects like religion and culture, she is cooking or writing about cooking.Author ImageBodyLink to ImageA new report by a federal religious freedom commission describes the “deteriorating” conditions worshippers face in China, a country that has “declared war on all religious faiths,” a commissioner told Daily Caller.The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom released their annual report Tuesday, which assesses religious freedom violations and progress in 29 countries during 2019. Among those countries, China has been designated a “country of particular concern” (CPC), meaning the government engages in or tolerates “particularly severe” violations of religious freedom, including torture, prolonged detentions without charges, and abductions.Gary Bauer, a commissioner at USCIRF appointed by President Donald Trump, tells the Daily Caller that the Chinese government is a “regime that fears religion.”The Chinese government has created a high-tech surveillance state using facial recognition and artificial intelligence to monitor religious minorities, the report describes. “In China's case, they've almost accomplished an Orwellian type of society where they're marrying tech facial recognition and artificial intelligence to monitor religious groups, and everyone,” Bauer describes to the Caller.Between 900,000 and 1.8 million Muslims have been detained in more than 1,300 concentration camps in Xinjiang - a region that has become infamous for the hundreds of camps where Uyghur Muslims are detained and never charged with crimes. Link to ImageChinese paramilitary policemen stand guard on a street in the Uighur district of Urumqi city, in China's Xinjiang region, on July 14, 2009. (PETER PARKS/AFP via Getty Images)Chinese documents leaked in late 2019 revealed secret speeches Chinese President Xi Jinping gave warning of the “toxicity of religious extremism,” and called for officials to “round up everyone who should be rounded up,” the New York Times reported. Individuals have been sent to camps for wearing long beards or refusing alcohol, and mosques and Arabic-language signs have been destroyed or damaged. The camps have also transitioned from reeducation to forced labor, with reports of torture, rape, and sterilization from former detainees. Link to ImageThis photo taken on June 4, 2019 shows a facility believed to be a re-education camp where mostly Muslim ethnic minorities are detained. (GREG BAKER/AFP via Getty Images)The Chinese government also raided or closed down hundreds of churches in 2019. Authorities removed crosses from churches and banned youth under the age of 18 from participating in religious services, the report says. Images of Jesus Christ or the Virgin Mary were also replaced with pictures of President Xi Jinping. “They just can not tolerate citizens having loyalty to anything higher than the Chinese Community Party,” Bauer said. “In the last 30 years, a lot of Americans forgot that the country is “communist” China.  And being a committed communist regime, they will not tolerate any loyalty by the people they rule over to something higher than the Communist Party of China. Any loyalty is seen as dangerous and unacceptable.”During a webinar earlier in the day, Bauer described his shock when reading a news headline earlier this month about China being appointed to a panel on the U.N. Human Rights Council, analogizing it to a school inviting a drug cartel leader to teach students about why they shouldn't use drugs.In recent years, the Chinese government has initiated campaigns to “sinicize” religions like Islam, Tibetan Buddhism, and Christianity to rid them of “foreign influence,” the report said. The churches that are maintained are state-run. Instead of joining these “churches,” where worshippers are closely monitored and spied on, many Christians, which make up 5% of the country, worship underground.Link to ImageChinese Catholic worshippers wait to take communion at the Palm Sunday Mass during the Easter Holy Week at an “underground” or “unofficial” church. (Photo by Kevin Frayer/Getty Images)“The old Soviet Union did this for decades. They maintained some churches to be open but the “pastors” in those churches were working for the KGB,” Bauer said. “It's an old tactic by the authorities of communist regimes. It becomes very easy for the Chinese communists to use facial recognition devices in churches so everyone who enters the church to worship has their image captured and used for nefarious purposes.”Chinese Christians instead opt for underground churches, even baptizing their children in the dead of the night at local rivers so as to not appear on the government's radar, Bauer said.USCIRF includes several recommendations to the U.S. government for mitigating and improving religious freedom in China, including sanctioning Chinese government agencies and officials responsible for the violations, stating that U.S. government officials will not attend the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games, and intensifying efforts to counter Chinese government influence operations in the U.S. Bauer, however, is pessimistic for the future of religious freedom in China given recent and current trends showing China tightening its grip on dissent or unfavorable portrayal of the regime. Link to ImageMembers of the Falun Gong spiritual movement hold candles during a candlelight vigil July 19, 2001 in Washington, DC to mark the second anniversary of a Chinese government crackdown on the outlawed religious sect. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)In March, China announced it would expel journalists working for the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post. The announcement came as tensions between the U.S. and China were escalating due to the coronavirus outbreak that originated in Wuhan.The NBA censored a team manager in October for tweeting support of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, costing the NBA all of its official partner companies in China. Video game giant Activision-Blizzard also banned a prominent player from competing for a year for showing solidarity with Hong Kong protestors, and MGM Studios digitally altered the 2012 remake of “Red Dawn” to portray forces invading the U.S. as North Korean rather than Chinese. (RELATED: All Of The NBA's Chinese Partners Have Severed Their Relationships)“The expulsion of American media outlets, the excuse we were given at the time, was that they disliked the reporting they were seeing with China's coronavirus,” Bauer tells the Caller. “Kicking the papers out serves a couple purposes for the CCP: Not only sends the message on reporting of the virus, but also makes it a lot harder for newspapers and media outlets in free countries to report on increasing persecution of religious groups.”The dependence on China by major American companies and the apprehension about economic consequences that could follow if any criticism of China is voiced also highlights a concern that President Trump brought to the fore in his presidential campaign and administration.Link to ImageFalun Gong protestors gather outside 10 Downing Street in London, 13 September 2006. (JOHN D MCHUGH/AFP via Getty Images)“President Trump was way ahead of everybody in the political establishment,” Bauer said. “Warning that China is a problem, and shifting manufacturing there would come back to haunt us even more than it already has.” The Reagan administration helped to normalize relations with China, working to improve the ties at the height of U.S. concerns over Soviet expansionism. Nearly two decades later, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the U.S.-China Relations Act of 2000, granting Beijing permanent normal trade relations with the U.S. Bauer says that the idea of some people was that the more trade with China there was, the more China would change. Others believed the opposite - that more trade with China would only change America. This relationship has been pernicious for not only the Hong Kong protestors seeking support from Americans, but also for the persecuted in China. “There are other media outlets in the U.S. who hope to do business with China and be in the Chinese market who don't really report on Chinese abuses of religious liberty. We've seen even good American capitalists look the other way rather than critique China's human rights infringements and how workers are treated because those companies don't want to jeopardize the dream they had of great profits with China.”“So sadly, those of us who predicted that trade with China would change us, were right.”Load-Date: April 28, 2020End of Document

Senate Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs Committee Issue Testimony From Railway Supply InstituteTargeted News ServiceMarch 6, 2020 Friday 5:48 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 3831 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee issued the following testimony on March 5 by Michael O'Malley, president of the Railway Supply Institute, at a hearing entitled "Threats Posed by State-Owned and State-Supported Enterprises to Public Transportation ":Thank you for the opportunity to testify today on the threats facing public transportation systems from foreign state-owned and state-supported enterprises, an issue that is of critical importance to the railway supply industry and the Nation. My name is Mike O'Malley and I serve as president of the Railway Supply Institute (RSI), an international trade association representing more than 200 companies involved in the manufacture or delivery of goods and services in the locomotive, freight railcar, maintenance of way, communications and signaling, and passenger rail industries. RSI members provide critical products to Class I and short line railroads, shippers, Amtrak, and commuter and transit authorities nationwide. We work with these customers to create new products or services that drive enhancements in both safety and efficiency across their rail networks.IntroductionThe rail system of the United States is one of our country's greatest assets, covering more than 140,000 miles and carrying forty percent of America's intercity freight, including 111 million tons of hazardous materials. It also transports millions of passengers every day--from small transit systems to large commuter authorities to intercity service provided by Amtrak or other entities. These systems are supported by an extensive, domestic railway supply industry that has been a dynamic and vital part of the U.S. economy for over 200 years, encompassing 125,000 jobs across all 50 states and paying an average wage 40% higher than the national average./1Without this robust domestic rail supply industry, our nation's passenger and freight railroads simply could not meet their customers' needs.Unfortunately, over the past decade our industry has witnessed substantial intervention in the global rail marketplace from non-market economy foreign governments. Most notably, the People's Republic of China - working through state-owned enterprises (SOEs) like CRRC - has identified rail manufacturing as a strategic market sector and made clear their intention to "conquer" the global rolling stock market./2Backed by the full resources of the Chinese government, CRRC and its affiliates have leveraged direct subsidies, state-backed financing, and below-market loans to secure more than $2.6 billion in railcar contracts at far below market rate for transit agencies in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. These manipulative incursions into the U.S. market present both national and economic security risks. There is ample evidence illustrating the Chinese government's willingness to use industrial espionage, hacking, intellectual property theft, and more to achieve its global objectives, giving us every reason to be concerned about their involvement with critical rail infrastructure and the technology that supports it.Thankfully, Congress has recognized this threat and begun taking proactive efforts to address it. In a time when consensus on major issues facing the nation seems as difficult as ever, both houses of Congress and the President united on a bipartisan basis to take strong, proactive action last year to address this threat. But the threat remains, so it is critical that Congress and the Administration continue to scrutinize CRRC's unfair practices, ensure that the Transportation Infrastructure Vehicle Security Act (TIVSA) is implemented quickly as intended, and enact future policies that will discourage CRRC from further undermining the U.S. railcar manufacturing market. For example, this committee can help ensure that Congress approves a long-term infrastructure bill that gives passenger rail agencies - and the suppliers that support them - the resources they need to make sustainable investments right here in the United States. Members of this committee have undoubtedly been given a whole host of reasons why an infrastructure bill is important to our future, but I would like to offer one more - American rail supply manufacturers absolutely depend on it. The best way to encourage investment in American jobs and rolling stock manufacturing is to increase investments in passenger rail and provide the certainty associated with a long-term bill.My goal with this testimony is to provide a comprehensive picture of CRRC's targeting of the U.S. rail market, discuss the industry's outlook moving forward, and to offer policy recommendations that would further enhance the economic and national security of U.S. rail infrastructure against foreign government interests.Chinese SOEs Present an Imminent Threat to the Global Rail IndustryCRRC is the product of a state-directed merger in 2014 between China's two largest state-owned rail companies, China South Locomotive & Rolling Stock Corporation (CSR) and China North Locomotive & Rolling Stock Corporation (CNR). That merger, coupled with hundreds of millions of dollars in support from the Chinese government, has allowed CRRC to quickly establish itself as the largest producer of rail rolling stock in the world. In 2018, CRRC claimed to have over 180,000 employees with revenues exceeding $37 billion USD,/3 more than that of its three largest competitors combined. As an SOE, CRRC benefits from the full resources of the Chinese government and has been repeatedly used to spearhead political initiatives driven by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The 'Made in China 2025' plan explicitly lists rail as one of ten sectors that China is targeting for global domination over the next five years. Similarly, CRRC has been at the forefront of the Belt & Road Initiative, receiving virtually unlimited support from the Chinese government to finance strategic rail infrastructure projects across the globe.All evidence suggests that CRRC is driven by these national policy objectives, not market principles, making it impossible for other companies to compete on a level playing field. In fact, CRRC's own bylaws explicitly direct the company to seek guidance from the CCP on significant matters affecting the company's operations./4The company has also demonstrated a history of intellectual property theft and serious questions have been raised about its labor practices. As a 2017 U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission report noted, CRRC's predecessor companies forced technology transfer agreements on many of the world's leading rail companies, which Chinese engineers then adapted through a process China has termed "digestion and re-innovation."/5A recent NBC news report also linked CRRC to the use of child labor in Madagascar--producing component parts for the same railcars it is now assembling in the United States./6In recent years, CRRC's pattern of underbidding has become one of our industry's greatest challenges. Since 2014, CRRC and its affiliates have leveraged state-backed financing and below-market loan rates to secure more than $2.6 billion in railcar contracts for transit agencies in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. The company has won these contracts by as much as thirty percent below the next lowest bid, suggesting that these are hardly market-based offerings and that they would not be possible without the support of massive subsidies from the Chinese government.Emboldened by winning those contracts, CRRC moved on to target America's largest and most security-sensitive cities as well. In March 2018, the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) of New York announced that CRRC was among the winners of a "Genius Grant Transit Challenge," which challenged companies to develop innovative solutions to improve New York City's subway system. Despite the absence of any ongoing procurements, CRRC committed to invest $50 million of its own funds to develop the city's next generation subway car, prompting 15 bipartisan members of the New York congressional delegation to raise concerns with the MTA directly./7Here in Washington, D.C., CRRC announced its intent to bid on the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority (WMATA)'s ongoing rolling stock procurement, prompting members of Congress, including two who serve on this committee, to once again raise concerns directly with WMATA./8These concerns that were echoed again just last month by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in an address before the National Governors Association./9These concerns are certainly warranted. National security experts have consistently raised the alarm about the ability of CRRC to leverage the technologies on these railcars for espionage or other illicit activities./10Many of these trains will contain or interact with Wi-Fi systems, automatic train control, automatic passenger counters, surveillance cameras, and other Internet of Things (IoT) technology that are thoroughly integrated into the information and communications technology infrastructure of transit authorities, all designed and built by a company controlled by the CCP and the Government of China.CRRC a Threat to U.S. Jobs & Economic SecurityUnlike its competitors, CRRC has established assembly operations--not traditional manufacturing operations--to complete these contracts, hiring far fewer employees than comparable plants run by railcar manufacturers that have heavily invested here in America for decades. CRRC constructs the cars in China and then ships them to the U.S. for final assembly. As a result, U.S. components and labor are far more limited than those utilized by their competitors. By contrast, most of the other major rolling stock manufacturers here in the United States source the vast majority of their components domestically, often significantly exceeding minimum Buy America requirements.To date CRRC has established two assembly facilities in Springfield, MA and Chicago, IL, and based on media reports these facilities have just 200 employees in total./11This illustrates the clear distinction between the type of American manufacturing that federal and state passenger rail investments are designed to produce and assembly operations of the CRRC. To be clear, we do understand the value those jobs bring to their communities, but the fact is that they came at a cost. A study from Oxford Economics estimated that for every job CRRC creates here in the United States to assemble passenger railcars, between three and five jobs are eliminated elsewhere in the domestic supply chain./12Oxford estimated that this could result in the loss of as many as 5,100 U.S. jobs and $330 million in GDP in the passenger railcar market alone if action was not taken. It is not a coincidence that passenger railcar manufacturing plants near Chicago and in Philadelphia closed in recent years after their local authorities awarded contracts to CRRC.Evidence that CRRC Intends to Use Passenger Rail as a Foray into Freight ManufacturingEqually concerning is the prospect of CRRC utilizing its existing beachhead in passenger railcar assembly to move into the freight rail sector. There they could build freight railcars used to transport sensitive military equipment, hazardous materials, critical commodities, and more. As many former military and intelligence officials have repeatedly noted, there are substantial risks in allowing a Chinese SOE to build, operate, or otherwise involve itself in the manufacture or assembly of those freight railcars. During times of war, the U.S. rail network is critical to our military's ability to deploy assets quickly and decisively. Other witnesses for this hearing will provide more detail on this subject, but given these strategic threats and China's growing military capacity, we should take great care in deciding who we rely on for military readiness. As the Department of Defense Office of Industrial Policy noted in a 2018 report, "The decline in the U.S. manufacturing industry...creates a variety of risks for America's manufacturing and defense industrial base and, by extension, for DoD's ability to support national defense."/13Because freight rail is funded almost entirely with non-public funds, there are no federal content standards as we see in passenger rail, and thus nothing preventing CRRC from aggressively targeting domestic railcar and component manufacturers using non-market tactics. CRRC's penetration of the freight market could therefore happen very quickly and with virtually no transparency. This would have a devastating effect on our country's ability to manufacture and deliver freight railcars independently.The experience of the Australian market serves as perhaps the best example of what can happen in the freight rail sector. In a period of less than ten years, the Australia's freight railcar manufacturing was rapidly overtaken by CRRC and its predecessor companies as it systematically drove its competition out of the market. Today, there is no meaningful producer of freight rail rolling stock in Australia and thus - China is effectively the sole supplier. Independent research has suggested that similar actions in the United States could result in the loss of as many as 65,000 U.S. jobs and $6.5 billion in GDP./14While CRRC has recently claimed they have no interest in the freight segment of the market, their actions show otherwise. In 2014, CRRC entered into a now-defunct joint venture with a Chinese holding company and a U.S. firm to launch Vertex Rail Corporation, a freight railcar assembly facility located in Wilmington, North Carolina. Despite nearly 100 members of the House and Senate raising national security concerns with the investment, it was ultimately allowed to move forward./15While that venture closed in November 2018, there is little doubt that the U.S. market remains a prime target. In fact, there are indications that CRRC is already establishing a presence in Canada with the intent to import freight cars into the U.S. market.Current Actions & Policy RecommendationsRSI and our members are grateful for the actions policymakers have taken thus far to mitigate CRRC's threat. Beginning with successful efforts to reform the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), Congress passed the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) in 2018. This gives future Administrations the tools needed to thoroughly review transactions like those of CRRC and Vertex moving forward and take appropriate steps to block those transactions if they are deemed a threat to national security.The passage of the Transit Infrastructure Vehicle Security Act (TIVSA) is also an important step forward. This legislation will block any federal funds from being used to subsidize CRRC's activities in the future, ensuring that CRRC is unable to further leverage American taxpayer funds to underbid its competition. It also institutes much-needed cybersecurity standards that will help limit the national security risks associated with CRRC's existing or future contracts.These legislative achievements are important steps for the industry, but it is essential that we not get complacent in the wake of China's clear desire to overtake our industry. We offer the following recommendations for policymakers to continue to be proactive in countering this threat:1. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) should immediately communicate with its grantees on TIVSA to ensure compliance with this new law. We have heard some suggestion that there is confusion regarding what this bill does. To us, lawmakers were clear in passing this legislation that there are significant national and economic security risks associated with awarding a contract to CRRC and that federal funds should not be used to award a contract to a Chinese SOE. Yet CRRC has said that it will continue to aggressively bid on contracts./16As leaders of this committee have so clearly articulated, it is essential that the FTA communicate to transit agencies to ensure prompt compliance with Congress' intent in passing this legislation as part of the National Defense Authorization Act.2. Congress should pass a long-term infrastructure bill with robust passenger rail funding levels to ensure that states and localities can make smart, sustainable investments for the future.CRRC's success in winning federal and state transit contracts has been fueled by their ability to come in at below-market prices by leveraging government subsidies, under procurement rules that often require transit agencies to award contracts to the lowest bidder. People are increasingly recognizing the benefits of passenger rail and states and localities are making rolling stock investments to support it, but predictable, dedicated and sustainable sources of federal funding are needed.3. Pass legislation or direct the U.S. Department of Transportation to ensure strict Buy America compliance, spurring domestic jobs and limiting the ability of foreign SOEs to game the system. By design, Buy America laws were written to ensure that taxpayer dollars made available for constructing and sustaining our public transportation systems would flow back into the U.S. economy and discourage the outsourcing of these manufacturing jobs to other countries. Unfortunately, RSI believes that the U.S. Department of Transportation currently lacks adequate resources to ensure strict compliance with Buy America provisions across the country. Congress should direct USDOT to exercise stricter oversight to help keep grant funding in the United States and spur the domestic jobs critical to maintaining a strong American manufacturing base.4. Create additional safeguards for the freight industry. While TIVSA was a vital step forward that will help level the playing field in the domestic passenger railcar market, the freight sector remains at risk. RSI will be working this year with members of Congress to identify legislation that could help establish appropriate standards for freight railcar manufacturing so we can ensure that CRRC does not wipe out the market in the same way they did in Australia. Given actions already taken by CRRC and the criticality of freight rail networks for national security and military deployment capabilities, we must act quickly.I will make one final point. Given the global nature of this threat, many of our allies are now following the lead of U.S. policymakers to address the issue in other markets as well. In Europe, for example, the European Commission is actively exploring ways to address the threat. The Association of the European Rail Supply Industry (UNIFE) recently issued a call to action given the expansion of China's state-owned rail suppliers, citing "the threat to European rail suppliers and the 400,000 jobs they represent due to unequal competition and state subsidies to Chinese players."/17We encourage the U.S. Congress and Administration to work with our allies across the globe to unite in the effort to ensure a market-driven railway supply sector free from SOE interference.RSI members will continue investing and doing all we can to support our passenger agency customers in serving the mobility and economic development needs of communities across the country, but we cannot compete with an entire country in a marketplace distorted by Chinese government subsidies. We appreciate the opportunity to provide these recommendations on critical issues affecting our industry and will continue working with Members of Congress to formulate policies that enhance rail safety, security and efficiency. Thank you for the opportunity to testify and I would be happy to answer any questions that you may have.* * *Footnotes:1.

FACT CHECK: Did Greta Thunberg Ask The Chinese Government To Stop Using Chopsticks?; 'Cuz it is symbol of environmental destruction'The Daily CallerMay 22, 2020 Friday 02:38 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; politicsLength: 449 wordsByline: Brad Sylvester, Fact Check Reporter, brad@dailycallernewsfoundation.orgBrad is a Massachusetts native who joined Check Your Fact after graduating from Fordham University in 2018. He previously wrote for the New York political magazine City & State and The Fordham Ram. Outside of work, Brad is a die-hard New England Patriots fan and enjoys the outdoors.Author ImageBodyLink to ImageA viral Facebook post claims that Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg has “called on the Chinese to stop using their traditional chopsticks and thus save hundreds of trees.”Verdict: FalseThere is no evidence she has ever called for this action. Thunberg's team has confirmed she has never made such a statement.Fact Check:Thunberg, who addressed world leaders at a United Nations climate summit in New York City in 2019, first gained            global attention for skipping school to protest against inaction on climate change outside the Swedish parliament. She took all of 2019 off from school to continue her campaign, including attending key climate conferences and joining student protests around the world,            BBC News reported.The post alleges Thunberg asked the Chinese government to “stop using their traditional chopsticks” to save trees. It further claims that, in response, the Chinese government “advised Greta Thunberg to return to school, where she will learn that the sticks are made of bamboo, and that bamboo is a plant, not a tree.”However, the Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence in an internet search that Thunberg ever called on the Chinese government to stop using chopsticks, only            other           fact-checkers debunking the claim. The DCNF also searched Thunberg's            verified Twitter account but did not find comments to this effect. Her team confirmed to            Reuters that she made no such statement.It is unclear from where exactly the fake story originated, but Reuters traced an early iteration of the claim to a            Jan. 14 tweet.

Canada braces for consequences from China after Huawei exec loses bid to dismiss extradition to U.S.Politico.comMay 27, 2020 Wednesday 10:33 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 851 wordsHighlight: A British Columbia judge on Wednesday dismissed Meng Wanzhou's request to be discharged from the extradition process.BodyOTTAWA - A Canadian judge ruled Wednesday that the high-stakes extradition case of senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou will proceed, a decision poised to inflame Canada's already testy relationship with China.Canada-China ties plunged to a new low after Meng's December 2018 arrest in Vancouver on an extradition warrant from the United States on fraud charges connected to violating sanctions on Iran.A British Columbia judge dismissed Meng's request to be discharged from the extradition process after ruling the case against her satisfies the "double criminality" test, which states countries may only extradite someone on an allegation that is a criminal offense in their own jurisdiction.Meng's legal team had argued the alleged conduct could not have amounted to fraud in Canada because it's related to U.S. economic sanctions against Iran, which the Canadian government has not imposed.But B.C. Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes said Canada's laws determine whether the alleged conduct, in its "essence," amounts to fraud and said she could therefore not agree with Meng's argument."I conclude that, as a matter of law, the double criminality requirement for extradition is capable of being met in this case," Holmes said in her ruling. "Ms. Meng's application is therefore dismissed."Meng is expected to continue fighting extradition, and experts say the process could take years.Her case has wedged Canada into an uncomfortable spot between two feuding superpowers - China and the United States.The arrest of the Chinese tech giant's chief financial officer, who is also the daughter of the company's founder, has enraged Beijing.The Chinese Embassy in Ottawa tweeted a statement late Wednesday to express its "strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition" to the court's decision, calling the Meng case "a grave political incident.""The United States and Canada, by abusing their bilateral extradition treaty and arbitrarily taking forceful measures against Ms. Meng Wanzhou, gravely violated the lawful rights and interests of the said Chinese citizen," the embassy said. "The purpose of the United States is to bring down Huawei and other Chinese high-tech companies, and Canada has been acting in the process as an accomplice."The embassy called on Canada to immediately release Meng and warned it "not to go further down the wrong path."The dispute with China has already led to negative consequences for Canada.Days after Meng's arrest, Chinese authorities rounded up Canadians Michael Kovrig, a diplomat on leave, and businessman Michael Spavor on allegations of endangering China's national security. Both men are being held behind bars in China with limited access to consular services and almost no contact with their families.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called their detentions arbitrary and has pushed for their release. He's also sought help from the international community - including from the Trump administration - to put pressure on China.Since Meng's arrest, Trudeau has repeatedly insisted Canada's justice system will deal with her case fairly and transparently. He has said the Canadians' detentions are in "retaliation" for Canada's independent judicial system."One of the good things about having a truly independent justice system is that we don't need to apologize or explain for the decisions taken by our independent justice system," Trudeau told reporters Tuesday."We have confidence in that system, in its independence, and we of course will continue to abide and defend our system."The Trudeau government has also been working to get clemency for a third Canadian, Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, who is facing the death penalty in China for drug smuggling. Schellenberg's initial 15-month sentence was reconsidered last year by a Chinese court after Meng's arrest.A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry told reporters Tuesday that Chinese authorities are ensuring the legal rights of Kovrig and Spavor."China urges the Canadian side to respect the rule of law and China's judicial sovereignty and stop making irresponsible remarks," Zhao Lijian said in an apparent reference to Trudeau's criticisms.Shortly after Meng's arrest, President Donald Trump complicated matters by speculating in an interview with Reuters about interfering in Meng's case if it would help him strike a trade deal with China.The Chinese government's response to Meng's arrest has also delivered an economic blow for Canada. China halted its imports of key Canadian agricultural products, including canola seed.The backdrop to the Meng case also directly involves her company, Huawei.The Trudeau government still has yet to make its long-awaited decision whether to bar or limit the use of Huawei gear in its 5G wireless infrastructure. Canada is the sole member of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance that has yet to announce its position - and it has come under pressure from the Trump administration to block Huawei from 5G.Days after Meng's arrest, China's then-ambassador to Ottawa warned of "repercussions" if Canada were to exclude Huawei gear from its 5G network.Load-Date: May 28, 2020End of Document

Asked Whether China Censored Early Coronavirus Data, Senior WHO Official Said He 'Didn't Look'; He led a 'fact-finding' missionThe Daily CallerApril 16, 2020 Thursday 04:55 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: WORLDLength: 604 wordsByline: Anders Hagstrom, White House Correspondent, anders@dailycaller.comBodyLink to ImageSenior World Health Organization (WHO) Official Dr. Bruce Aylward was asked point blank on February 24 whether the Chinese government had censored early coronavirus data, to which he responded that he “didn't look.”Aylward is a senior advisor to the WHO director general and led a “fact finding” mission in China from Feb 9 to Feb 24 to study the coronavirus. He praised the the Chinese government's handling of the disease at great length at a Beijing press conference summarizing the mission's findings, until a BBC reporter pressed him on China's history of censorship, according to a transcript of the event.“My question to you is this: You obviously spoke to people in Wuhan, the doctors, the people on the front lines. What extent do you think cover up and censorship played a role in allowing the virus to accelerate at the rate it did?” the reporter asked during the Q&A segment.Aylward responded by saying his mission in China was focused on what worked, not what went wrong. (RELATED: US Ramps Up Crackdown On China's Spying Efforts During Coronavirus)“Whether other factors such as the one you mentioned, play a role, I don't know, frankly, didn't look at that. I'm just being completely honest,” he said.Link to ImageWHO Official Bruce Aylward. (Screenshot/Twitter)Aylward had boasted earlier on in the press conference that his team had “interrogated” hundreds of front-line workers across China to get a “coherent picture” of the epidemic.Aylward spoke of China's handling of the coronavirus in glowing terms throughout his presentation. He called China the “first line of defense” in preventing the international spread of the virus. Reports indicate that China cut off travel from the Hubei Province to the rest of China on January 23, but did not impede residents from traveling internationally until January 27, despite a peak in outbound traffic due to the Lunar New Year over those same days.The WHO has been widely criticized in recent weeks for parroting data from the Chinese Communist Party. The U.S. intelligence community had reportedly concluded by mid-March that China was falsifying its data on both COVID-19 cases and deaths.

The U.S. contributes up to $500 million annually to the organization's budget, compared to China's roughly $40 million.Aylward himself met controversy in early March when he cut off an online interview with a Hong Kong news outlet after the reporter implied Taiwan wasn't part of China. The Chinese government does not recognize Taiwan as an independent state.U.S. politicians have begun calling for punitive action against both the WHO and the CCP. The most aggressive of those calls has come from Republican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, who introduced a bill to allow U.S. citizens to sue China for coronavirus damages. It would also establish a State Department task force to lead an international investigation into China's handling of the virus and to explore way to “compel” restitution from Beijing.“There is overwhelming evidence that the Chinese Communist Party's lies, deceit, and incompetence caused COVID-19 to transform from a local disease outbreak into a global pandemic,” Hawley said in a statement.“We need an international investigation to learn the full extent of the damage the CCP has inflicted on the world and then we need to empower Americans and other victims around the world to recover damages. The CCP unleashed this pandemic. They must be held accountable to their victims.”Graphic Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organisation (WHO) attends a news conference of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Covid-19 about its investigation of the coronavirus outbreak in Beijing, China, February 24, 2020.

Not China's Cup of Tea: New Online Pan-Asia Alliance Emerges From Thai-Chinese Meme WarASEAN TribuneMay 7, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 ASEAN Tribune All Rights ReservedLength: 807 wordsBody 7 May 2020 (VOA) A Twitter war with Chinese nationalists has forged a new online alliance among social media users in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Thailand, highlighting public solidarity among some pro-democracy movements in Asia.The new 'Milk Tea Alliance' got its name from the similarities among Taiwanese bubble tea, Hong Kong milk tea and Thai iced tea.It all began on Twitter when popular Thailand actor Vachirawat 'Bright' Cheeva-aree shared a set of pictures, with some referring to Hong Kong as a country - considered blasphemous by China's communist government. The tweet triggered a strong response from Chinese nationalists.Twitter is banned in China and users in the country must turn to virtual private networks (VPNs ) to access the platform. Some nationalists are part of a cyber entity referred to as 'Wumao Dang' because they are paid to make comments. Wumao means 50 cents, because one comment is worth RMB 50 cents (or about a tenth of a U.S. dollar).To quell the online uproar, Bright, whose TV drama has been popular in China, quickly issued an apology, saying that he did not read the content clearly when he shared the post. 'Next time there will be no mistake like this again,' he wrote.But the Chinese nationalists did not accept it. They discovered a post by Bright's girlfriend Nnevvy, which talked about the possibility of the COVID-19 virus originating from a Wuhan lab.A meme war dubbed #Nnevvy began. Chinese nationalist 'netizens' criticized the online Thais, claiming that their alleged 'ignorance' of Chinese history led them to their views on Hong Kong and Taiwan independence. The Chinese also mocked Thailand as impoverished.Online commenters from Thailand quickly fought back. They cited the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre to challenge Beijing's authoritarianism. One post said 'my country is poor but your country is pooh.' It was referring to Winnie the Pooh, a character reference that has become a lighthearted way for people across the world to mock China's President Xi Jinping. The image remains banned in China.Netizens in Hong Kong and Taiwan soon joined the meme war, and the Milk Tea Alliance was born.A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Thailand issued a statement, calling Beijing's 'One China Principle' toward Hong Kong and Taiwan 'irrefutable' and saying 'the recent online noises only reflect bias and ignorance.'Nathan Law, a former Hong Kong Legislative Council member, tweeted: 'So funny watching the pro-CCP online army trying to attack Bright.' He added that the nationalists were attacking the wrong target, since 'Bright's fans are young and progressive.'Jason Y. Ng, a lawyer and a freelance writer based in Hong Kong, is a member of the Milk Tea Alliance. His Twitter posts are often the targets of Chinese nationalists because of his pro-democracy stance."Thai netizens adopt a unique self-mocking style to counter attacks on my Twitter posts. Now these Chinese nationalists have given up commenting on my posts.' He told VOA, 'The Alliance acts like some kind of pesticide or disinfectant-it's fascinating!'The Alliance also criticizes the Chinese government's aggressive action in the South China Sea.Thitinan Pongsudhirak, an international relations professor with Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, told VOA that the pan-Asia network reflects the difference between official opinion and public opinion in these countries when it comes to China.'There is divergent posture between Southeast Asian governments and their people,' he said. 'Their governments actually are pro-China, such as the Philippines and Thailand.'A Thai government spokeswoman said the government respected Thais' freedom of expression and the issue did not affect the nation's ties with China.Danny Marks, an assistant professor with the City University of Hong Kong, told VOA that the online discussion has evolved into a wider political protest, because the people from these countries are increasingly dissatisfied with China's unilateral actions in the area.'It also shows the limited ability of Chinese to wage internet warfare,' he said. 'They had previously been pampered by the one-sided Chinese internet.'Andrew Selepak, a media expert with University of Florida, said that by binding together, these voices could become a significant counter to China's strong cyber army.'It's interesting to see that countries that don't have the same political clout around the world and economic clout around the world individually, you are trying to act as a collective, as a counterbalance, to the influence of China on social media,' he told VOA.'China has been stepping up its influence in Asia. The threat is now on our doorstep. Therefore, I hope all Asian societies can build pan-Asian solidarity to fend off all forms of authoritarianism from China,' wrote Hong Kong pro-democracy leader Joshua Wong.Load-Date: May 8, 2020End of Document

Sens. Rubio, Waltz Lead Letter to State on Retirement Investments Funneling to ChinaTargeted News ServiceMay 21, 2020 Thursday 8:30 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 703 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, issued the following news release:U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Representative Michael Waltz (R-FL) wrote a letter to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Attorney General Ashley Moody, and Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis requesting the Florida State Board of Administration and the Board of Trustees revisit its policy to invest state employees' pensions in opaque Chinese firms engaged in human rights abuses and a wide range of military-related activities, effectively funding the Chinese government and Communist Party's efforts to undermine U.S. economic and national security. The Florida Retirement System (FRS) is the fourth-largest public retirement system in the country with over $200 billion in total funds under management."It is of great concern to us that Florida public employees are often unwittingly investing in funds that hold stock of Chinese companies with direct affiliation to the CCP and the PLA, and we anticipate that it will be to all Floridians," Rubio and Waltz wrote. "Increased scrutiny for Chinese securities falls right in line with SBA's current management of the FRS. The FRS currently has a number of legally required and laudable global governance mandates, including prohibitions on investing in companies that do business with Cuba, support the Maduro regime in Venezuela, or boycott our ally Israel."* * *Dear Governor DeSantis, Attorney General Moody, and Chief Financial Officer Patronis:We write to you in your capacities as members of the Board of Trustees governing the Florida State Board of Administration (SBA) to bring to your attention a matter of national security and investor protection. As you are aware, the Florida Retirement System (FRS) is the fourth largest public retirement system in the country with over $200 billion in assets under management as of February 29, 2020 across over 30 funds. Unfortunately, like many public systems, FRS maintains investments in problematic Chinese enterprises, including firms owned and controlled by the Chinese Government and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that actively participate in human rights abuse and support the People's Liberation Army (PLA).Florida's hardworking civil servants may not suspect that their publicly administered or managed retirement account invests in firms owned or controlled by the Government of China or the CCP. The reality is, however, that the FRS holds investments in a variety of such companies. One such example is Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co., Ltd., a manufacturer of surveillance equipment used by the CCP to suppress religious and national minorities in Xinjiang and Tibet. Another, China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd., is a subsidiary of state-owned telecommunications operator China United Network Communications (China Unicom), which contracts with the PLA.It is of great concern to us that Florida public employees are often unwittingly investing in funds that hold stock of Chinese companies with direct affiliation to the CCP and the PLA, and we anticipate that it will be to all Floridians. Increased scrutiny for Chinese securities falls right in line with SBA's current management of the FRS. The FRS currently has a number of legally required and laudable global governance mandates, including prohibitions on investing in companies that do business with Cuba, support the Maduro regime in Venezuela, or boycott our ally Israel.In addition to national security and human rights challenges, Chinese companies do not maintain reliable standards of financial transparency and investor protections. Even Chinese firms that have securities listed on American stock exchanges openly flaunt U.S. auditing oversight at great risk to American investors. April's scandal involving NASDAQ listed Luckin Coffee is only the latest incident to highlight this state of affairs.[5] Recently, the Trump Administration cited these risks in its order for the federal employees fund to abandon a move to invest in Chinese securities.It is our hope that the Board of Trustees and the SBA revisit the policy for FRS China investments for the interests and protection of Florida's public servants.Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7118493 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 21, 2020End of Document

In the tweets Trump claimed that mail-in votes in the 2020 presidential election would be subject to voter fraud.The Post says it pressed Twitter about a possible double standard in labelling Trump's tweets but not Zhao's. Initially Twitter said it wouldn't add the tag, but later said it would following a "further review," per The Post. Twitter did not directly respond when asked by Business Insider if this timeline is accurate."The Tweets in question contain potentially misleading content about COVID-19 and have been labeled to provide additional context to the public. These actions are in line with the approach we shared earlier this month," a Twitter spokeswoman said.Trump, enraged by Twitter's move, has subsequently threatened to shut down social media companies, and the White House said he is            due to sign an executive order "pertaining to social media" later on Thursday.NOW WATCH: What makes 'Parasite' so shocking is the twist that happens in a 10-minute sequenceSee Also:• An Amazon warehouse worker said engineer Tim Bray 'didn't take it far enough' when slamming the company for firing whistleblowers• These far-flung US regions could become the next big startup hubs as techies abandon Silicon Valley and embrace remote work• The UK is using this drone to deliver coronavirus tests and PPE to a Scottish islandLoad-Date: May 28, 2020End of Document

Chinese Communist Party is biggest threat to our world currentlyThe BG News: Bowling Green State UniversityApril 16, 2020 ThursdayUniversity WireCopyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1Length: 608 wordsByline: Nick BowersBodyAs the world struggles to deal with COVID-19, many people have been busy focusing on simply surviving to the next day (be that physically, mentally, or financially) while under intense lockdown. But I suggest we step back for a moment and ask ourselves "Why are we in this situation?" And the answer lies squarely at the feet of the ruling party of China, the Chinese Communist Party.China has been desperately trying to protect their image since January, even if it comes at the cost of scores of their own citizens, and a collapse of the world economy. According to USA Today, on Dec. 30, Dr. Li Wenliang, posted on social media that a new SARS-like illness was spreading throughout the city. Four days later he was detained by Chinese state security police and forced to recant his statements.. He later died of COVID-19 on Feb. 7.Stepping away from COVID-19, the CCP has a long history of repression and violence against its population. Violent reprisals against dissidents and protestors is exceptionally common for China. In May 1989, after weeks of student-led protests advocating less restrictions on speech and the end of political nepotism at Tiananmen Square in Beijing, the CCP decided to act. 30,000 troops, including tanks, were sent into Beijing. The end result was a massacre. Scholars estimate the number of dead between 500 over 3,000. According to the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, to this day, the massacre is officially denied by the Chinese government, and any mention of it within China is met with censorship.According to Reuters, United States Department of Defense assistant secretary Richard Shriver said China is illegally detaining about 2 million Uighur Muslims in secret detention centers throughout the Western Xinjiang region. The CCP officially denied the existence of the camps in previous years but has recently acknowledged them and described them as vocational educational centers meant to curb the threat of Islamic terrorism. However, the US Department of Defense describes them as closer to the concentration camps of Nazi Germany. It is claimed that Muslim prisoners are subjected to torture, round the clock political indoctrination, and forced violations of their religious principles, such as being forced to eat pork. A system of "social credit" has even been put in place by the CCP to ensure loyalty. According to Business Insider, citizens are given a credit score by local party officials, which changes based on their behavior. Examples of actions that will lower your score include bad driving, smoking in non-smoking zones, buying too many video games, posting fake news online, and of course, dissent against the government. A poor score could have severe repercussions, such as being barred from leaving the country, you or your kids not being allowed into the top universities and even public naming and shaming. I could easily continue describing the horrors the CCP has inflicted upon the citizens of China, but they are simply too numerous to describe in less than a multi-volume series. With its repression of information, and lack of regard for the rights or even lives of its citizens, coupled with its vast economic resources, population and military, it is clear to see that the CCP is the greatest threat the world has seen since 1945. The ones who will pay the ultimate price for this are the Chinese citizens suffering under an aggressive, authoritarian regime. If the world does not act united and decisively to force China to change its ways, the Red Dragon will continue to rise, and we could see a very different world order in only a few decades. Load-Date: April 16, 2020End of Document

Top GOP lawmaker disclosed holdings in Chinese company he criticizedPolitico.comMay 7, 2020 Thursday 10:04 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1167 wordsHighlight: Rep. Mike McCaul was tapped on to head a GOP House panel scrutinizing China. Disclosures show his family holds stock in a Chinese internet company.BodyA top GOP lawmaker tapped to lead a House panel scrutinizing China disclosed his family's investment in a major Chinese tech company linked to surveillance and censorship, according to a congressional form filed in his name.A periodic transaction report filed on April 20 in the name of Rep. Michael McCaul, who represents Texas' 10th district and serves as ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, lists the purchase of $50,000-$100,000 worth of shares in Chinese tech behemoth Tencent Holdings in late February.An attorney for McCaul, Elliot Berke, said that the lawmaker is not the owner of the shares. "Congressman McCaul did not purchase any shares in China's Tencent Holdings or any other Chinese company," Berke said. "Congressman McCaul's wife has assets she solely owns and a third party manager made the purchase without her direction." Members of the House are required to disclose certain information concerning spousal assets under congressional ethics rules.McCaul has disclosed family holdings in Tencent for years, even as he has described the company as a threat to U.S. national security and an integral part of the Chinese Communist Party's "dystopian" system of social control. McCaul's willingness to criticize China while his family holds stock in one of that country's biggest tech firms can also be perceived as principled, and it's common for investors to put money into funds without awareness of the companies involved.But the disclosures threaten to become yet another political weapon in the race between Democrats and Republicans to distance themselves from the Chinese government, which has become radioactive amid a global pandemic that began in China and has claimed more than 70,000 American lives: McCaul was selected on Thursday by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to chair a new China Task Force that will aim to "take bold action to address the [Chinese Communist Party's] malign agenda and better compete with China on the world stage." In a statement, McCaul described his mission as developing "new and enduring policy solutions that, among others, enhance our economic strength and create jobs, protect our national security, rethink our supply chains and grow our competitive edge in technology." McCaul is a consistent critic of the Chinese government. He signed on to a letter by House Republicans earlier this week calling for an investigation into China's alleged espionage and disinformation efforts at American universities. "For decades, technology and intellectual property has been a concern vis a vis the Chinese government," the letter reads. "Only under this Administration, has the federal government begun cracking down on this international crime and economic threat."Tencent Holdings, which owns Chinese social media platforms WeChat and QQ, signed a deal to set up a laboratory in March to develop a cloud gaming platform with Huawei, a Chinese tech firm that was essentially blacklisted by the U.S. Commerce Department last year following Trump's declaration of a national emergency over threats against U.S. technology. And Tencent itself is considered by many experts to be a surveillance arm of the Chinese Communist Party-the United Nations backed out of a partnership with Tencent last month, following a backlash from U.S. officials, and Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley called for a ban last week on federal employees' use of Tencent products because of the alleged national security risks."Companies like Tencent and Huawei are espionage operations for the Chinese Communist party, masquerading as telecom companies for the 21st century," Cruz said in a statement.The University of Toronto's security research group Citizen Lab concluded in a report released on Thursday that WeChat has been monitoring the activity of its international users as well as those inside mainland China. Citizen Lab also found in March that WeChat had been censoring keywords about the coronavirus outbreak and blocking related criticism of Chinese President Xi Jinping since January.Tencent did not respond to a request for comment, but has said in the past that "respecting user privacy has always been one of the most important principles of WeChat. We have neither the authority nor the motive to look into users' chat histories."McCaul disclosed his family holdings in Tencent in 2013, 2014, and 2017, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which estimated his net worth at over $96 million in 2017. The Tencent shares were not put into a blind trust, a person with knowledge of the congressman's financial arrangements said.Last year, Sarah Cook, a senior research analyst for China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan at Freedom House, outlined Tencent's "pattern of censorship and data sharing with China's repressive government," pointing to incidents of conversations on Tencent applications being relayed to police stations and authorities across China and Tencent CEO Pony Ma's seat in China's parliament."Regardless of whether Tencent is a reluctant or an eager accomplice to the Chinese government's repressive policies, the reality is that Tencent employees can be expected to censor, monitor, and report private communications and personal data, in many cases leading to innocent people's arrest and torture," Cook wrote. "This should be the starting point for anyone considering using, regulating, or investing in the company's services."McCaul characterized Tencent as a national security threat and "an integral part of the Chinese Communist Party's industrial policies" as recently as November 2019, just three months before the new purchase of shares in the company. In an op-ed for Government Executive published on November 18, McCaul criticized the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board's decision to use the MSCI All Country World ex.-U.S. Investable Market Index (IMI) for its International Fund, noting that the index includes "Chinese companies that threaten America's economic and national security.""For instance, Tencent Holdings, an integral part of the Chinese Communist Party's industrial policies and one of four national champions for artificial intelligence, accounts for a significant number of shares in the IMI," he wrote. "Tencent is also heavily involved in the development of the social credit system, a dystopian system China has implemented to score its citizens' behavior."McCaul has also called for an investigation into whether the government withheld information about the coronavirus outbreak from the world. Last month, he characterized China and the World Health Organization as "co-conspirators" in a coverup and called on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to probe the Chinese Communist Party's "various lies" and "disinformation campaign.""There is a case to be made here that this is the worst cover-up in human history," McCaul told Fox News on April 10. "This is a cover-up by the Chinese Communist Party, which has now led to one of the worst pandemics we've ever seen."Load-Date: May 8, 2020End of Document

Chinese diplomat promotes conspiracy theory that US military brought coronavirus to WuhanCNN.comMarch 12, 2020 Thursday 10:53 PM ESTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedSection: ASIALength: 789 wordsByline: By Ben Westcott and Steven Jiang, CNNDateline: Hong Kong BodyA prominent Chinese official has promoted a conspiracy theory that the United States military could have brought the novel coronavirus to China -- and it did not originate in the city of Wuhan, as thought.Posting to his more than 300,000 followers on Twitter, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian republished a video of Robert Redfield, the director for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, addressing a US Congressional committee on March 11.In the clip, Redfield said some influenza deaths in the US were later identified as cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.Redfield didn't say when those people had died or over what time period, but Zhao pointed to his remarks in support of a growing conspiracy theory that the coronavirus did not originate in Hubei province in central China. He did not offer any further evidence for the claim."CDC was caught on the spot. When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!" the Foreign Ministry official said.Hundreds of athletes from the US military were in Wuhan for the Military World Games in October 2019.The video of Redfield was also published to Twitter by other state media outlets, including national broadcaster CCTV and the popular Global Times tabloid.On Friday, Zhao's fellow Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said there were "varied opinions" on the origin of the virus in the international community."China always considers this a scientific question, which should be addressed in a scientific and professional manner," he said, avoiding questions on whether Zhao's tweet represented the Chinese government's official position.Origin theoriesParts of Chinese social media, and even the country's government, appear to have launched a concerted campaign to question the origin of the novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 125,000 people globally.The first reported cases of the virus were in Wuhan, and since then the city has had more infections and deaths than anywhere in the world.Speaking in his official capacity at a press conference in Beijing on March 4, Zhao told reporters that "no conclusion has been reached yet on the origin of the virus" -- and Chinese scientists were still tracing where it came from.On February 27, renowned Chinese infectious disease expert Zhong Nanshan also questioned where the coronavirus had come from."The infection was first spotted in China but the virus may not have originated in China," Zhong said at a press conference.On Thursday, Hua Chunying, Zhao's boss who heads the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Department of Information, tweeted a link to Redfield's testimony, saying it was "absolutely wrong and inappropriate to call this the Chinese coronavirus."China's ambassador to South Africa, Lin Songtian, took to Twitter on March 8 to say that although the first epidemic was recorded in China, it didn't mean the virus "originated from China."However, Zhao's colleague Geng cautioned Thursday that the origin of the virus could only be determined "by science.""We don't hope to see anyone making an issue out of this to stigmatize other countries," he said. "With COVID-19 developing into a pandemic, the world should come together to fight it instead of leveling accusations and attacks against each other, which is not constructive at all."Twitter diplomacyZhao's comments are another example of Chinese government figures using Twitter to defend China against criticism -- despite the platform being banned in the country, along with Facebook, Instagram and a number of other prominent Western social media sites.Prior to 2019, few Chinese officials had verified Twitter accounts. But since then, ambassadors, mission heads and Chinese foreign ministry spokespeople across the world have joined Twitter.In January, Chinese ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming weighed in on the UK's decision on whether or not to ban telecommunications giant Huawei from its 5G networks on Twitter.Cui Tiankai, the Chinese ambassador to the US, took to Twitter in December to deny accusations of human rights abuses against Muslim-majority Uyghurs in Xinjiang. "Ultimately, facts will always prevail over lies," he tweeted.Zhao was promoted in mid 2019 after building a reputation for himself on Twitter as a fierce advocate for Chinese interests -- arguing with western politicians and blocking Beijing's critics -- during his time as a senior diplomat at the Chinese embassy in Pakistan.The headline and first line of this story have been updated to better characterize the claim by China's Foreign Ministry spokesman.Load-Date: March 13, 2020End of Document

How China beat virus: Would it work here?USA TODAYApril 2, 2020 ThursdayFIRST EDITIONCopyright 2020 Gannett Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; Pg. 1ALength: 2037 wordsByline: Kim Hjelmgaard, Eric J. Lyman, and Deirdre Shesgreen, USA TODAYBodyIn late February as coronavirus infections mounted in Wuhan, China, authorities went door-to-door for health checks - forcibly isolating every resident in makeshift hospitals and temporary quarantine shelters, even separating parents from  children who displayed symptoms of COVID-19, no matter how seemingly mild.Caretakers at the city's ubiquitous large apartment buildings were pressed into service as ad hoc security guards, monitoring the temperatures of all residents, deciding who could come in and implementing inspections of delivered food and medicines.Outside, drones hovered above streets, yelling at people to get inside and scolding them for not wearing face masks. Elsewhere in China, facial-recognition software, linked to a mandatory phone app that color-coded people based on their contagion risk, decided who could enter shopping malls, subwaysand other public spaces."We couldn't go outside under any circumstances. Not even if you have a pet," said Wang Jingjun, 27, a graduate student who returned to Wuhan from the Chinese coastal province of Guangdong in mid-January to live with her elderly mother and grandparents. "Those with dogs had to play with them inside and teach them to use the bathroom in a certain spot."As the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic has moved to the USA, Chinese officials and public health experts insist that even if President Donald Trump were to immediately adopt all the strict testing and lockdown measures that Western scientific advisers advocate, these actions would still not be sufficient to stem the spread of a disease that is swiftly approaching a million worldwide cases.More severe steps are needed in the USA, these officials say, although they cast doubt on whether Americans could do what the Chinese did, for a mixture of reasons: political will and deep-rooted cultural inclinations among them.To help quell its outbreak, Beijing embarked on one of the largest mass mobilization efforts in history, closing all schools, forcing millions of people inside, quickly building more than a dozen vast temporary hospitals, deploying thousands of extra medical staff to Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province and meticulously testing and tracing anyone and everyone who may have encountered the virus.It did a lot more than that."Lockdowns, bans on gatherings, basic quarantines, testing, hand-washing, this is not enough," Huiyao Wang, a senior adviser to China's government, told USA TODAY in a phone interview from Beijing. "You need to isolate people on an enormous scale, in stadiums, big exhibition halls, wherever you can. It seems extreme. It works." 'No one left behind' was the slogan in Wuhan," he said. "No one."In the USA, Trump urged Americans to avoid gatherings of 10 or more people and suggested the worst-affected states should shutter schools, bars and restaurants.Overall, he has left it to individual states and cities to decide whether to close businesses or explicitly order people to stay at home, despite evidence from countries in Asia, such as China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan, that aggressively limiting public gatherings and social interactions can help stop transmission of COVID-19, when done in combination with extensive testing and tracing of the disease.Trump said he expects to see U.S. cases peak "around Easter," although his claims about how quickly the USA can overcome the outbreak and bounce back contradict assessments from top health officials, such as Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.After New York City became the new locus of the outbreak, Trump announced Sunday an extension of federal guidance on social distancing measures through April and issued a "strong travel advisory" urging residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to refrain from nonessential travel for 14 days to help limit the spread of the virus.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the new restrictions would help slow the spread of the respiratory illness, which has infected more than 209,000 Americans and killed more than 4,600.  The daily death toll in the USA may not dip below 100 per day before June, according to a study by the University of Washington.China's nationwide responseWang, the Chinese government adviser, said the example of Wuhan, where authorities have started lifting some of their stringent anti-virus controls that kept tens of millions of people at home for two months, illustrates that the USA and West more generally need to take far more radical virus-dampening actions that many people outside China might find culturally, logistically and emotionally unpalatable."It was not just families being isolated together in Wuhan but individuals being isolated away from their friends and families," said Andy Mok, a fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, a public policy think tank based in Beijing."China's response to the outbreak was truly a nationwide response: systematic, comprehensive and coordinated. This is why China was able to 'flatten the curve' so dramatically," he said, referring to social isolation measures aimed at keeping the number of coronavirus infections at a manageable level for hospitals and medical workers who would otherwise be overwhelmed with sick patients.Mok said that even in Beijing, about 750 miles north of Wuhan, coronavirus rules were established requiring residents to have a formal pass to get in and out of their apartment buildings and homes. At the outbreak's height in Wuhan, nobody was allowed in or out of the city, and access to food stores was limited to once every few days.Video footage published by the Australian Broadcasting Corp., the country's state-funded broadcaster, showed Chinese authorities in Wuhan welding doors to entire apartment buildings shut - with residents inside - to enforce quarantines. The footage, collected from Chinese social media users, could not be independently verified by USA TODAY.Mok questioned whether Americans, raised on a diet of individualism and civil liberties that has informed every aspect of life from travel to economic institutions, would be willing to abide by invasive virus detection and containment methods that require a strong commitment to "collectivism" and abridged freedoms.Europe has adopted some, but not all, of China's most restrictive steps. In France, residents must fill out of a signed attestation to justify leaving their homes or apartments. Police hand out large fines to anyone who doesn't follow the rules."It's a very clever form of social engineering for civic purposes: It forces you to think about and justify to yourself, as well as to the world, why you are leaving the house," said Sarah Maza, a French history professor and U.S. citizen living in France for the year.Yang Junchao, a member of a Chinese delegation of COVID-19 doctors and medical experts assisting Italy in halting its coronavirus infections - the worst in Europe - said its epidemic will be controlled "as long as the Italian public cooperates."Some American public health officials have acknowledged that to bring the virus under control - outside of a vaccine breakthrough - actions that overstep the bounds of what most Americans would be comfortable with, such as mass quarantines and other severe restrictions on movement, may be necessary."The approach we should be taking right now is one that most people would find to be too drastic because otherwise, it is not drastic enough," Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said in a USA TODAY interview."It may be a country like China has a more top-down ability to insist on certain behavior changes. But we ought to be able to do it in our way, in a bottom-up fashion," he said.'Widespread discontent'?Trump administration officials have repeatedly condemned China's initial suppression of warnings about the outbreak and questioned the accuracy of Beijing's infection figures.China's central government has dismissed persistent allegations that it tried to downplay the severity of infections, although it has not denied initially detaining whistleblowing doctors and citizen journalists in December who tried to speak out about the mysterious virus in Wuhan. China's National Health Commission said Tuesday it will start including asymptomatic coronavirus carriers in its daily figures.As of Wednesday, China recorded less than half - about 82,000 - the number of U.S. coronavirus cases. It may be bracing for a potential second wave of infections: Over the past few days, China has reclosed some public spaces and businesses, such as movie theaters, amid spiking clusters of cases, mostly imported."The Chinese are trying to paint the narrative that the model they have pursued has been a huge success and that we are failing" because of our mode of governance, J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Affairs (CSIS), a Washington think tank, said in a media briefing.Morrison said there's significant evidence that the Chinese government's handling of the crisis sparked "widespread discontent and dissatisfaction," pointing to the case of Dr. Li Wenliang, who was detained when he tried to alert other health care providers about the novel coronavirus. He died from the virus.Concern has grown over the whereabouts of Ai Fen, the head of Emergency at Wuhan Central Hospital. She is the doctor who first alerted Wenliang about the spread of the virus. An Australian investigation team that interviewed Fen last week said she has disappeared, possibly detained by the Chinese government.Heather Conley, the director of the Europe program at CSIS, said that although the response in democratic countries may look chaotic, there's strength in that approach. "You have neighbors helping neighbors, and you have states making decisions. Sometimes it's the federal level having to catch up with those decisions, and that's a much more dynamic, nimble and resilient response," she said.Jan Renders, 29, a graduate student who was studying Chinese politics at Central China Normal University in Wuhan and was airlifted out Feb. 1 to his home in Belgium, said the Chinese response was "too harsh" and lacked transparency."In Wuhan, when everything went into lockdown, nobody could come or go, and that included patients. The hospitals were overloaded, and I'm sure people died because they couldn't be transported to other hospitals, where there was room," he said, noting that German hospitals started taking coronavirus patients from overcrowded hospitals in Italy, where more than 13,000 people have died of COVID-19, the most anywhere.Edward Tse, the Hong Kong-based founder of the Gao Feng Advisory Co., a management consultancy with roots in mainland China, said his perception is that, on the whole, most people in China supported the government's tough measures."Isolation is the key," he said. "It just depends on how you do it. The Chinese government decided to do it in a certain way. It turned out to be quite effective."A British video blogger posted a video on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform last week that explained how China implemented the softer side of its policy of "ling jiechu," which translates as "zero contact." It allowed neighborhood committees to take charge of arrangements for shopping and deliveries. Highways were made toll-free, with no limits to the number of cars on a road. For those without a car, customized bus routes were set up and operated according to demand. Tickets could be purchased on a smartphone app, and capacity was set at 50%. Many restaurants installed basic but effective pulley systems to maintain employee-customer distance.Wang, the student who returned to Wuhan from Guangdong to live with her elderly relatives, said many people in China "have the idea, and maybe it's a stereotype, that medical care" in the USA and Europe is more advanced than in China."I am worried about places like New York City and Milan," she said. "I don't know why the deaths are so much higher there. I hope they will be strong and keep calm."Hjelmgaard reported from London, Lyman from Rome and Shesgreen from Washington. Load-Date: April 2, 2020End of Document

TIKTOK, NATIONAL SECURITY THREATS THE FOCUS OF HAWLEY'S 'DANGEROUS PARTNERS: BIG TECH AND BEIJING' HEARINGStates News ServiceMarch 4, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 438 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Missouri Senator Josh Hawley:In today's "Dangerous Partners: Big Tech and Beijing" hearing, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, announced he would introduce legislation to ban all federal employees from the use of TikTok on government devices."TikTok is owned by a Chinese company that includes Chinese Communist Party members in leadership, and it is requires by Chinese law to share user data with Beijing. TikTok has admitted that it has sent user data to China. To put it bluntly, this is a major security risk for the American people. . . This legislation is a necessary step to protect the security of the United States and the data security of every American."Senator HawleyIn the hearing, law enforcement and policy experts shed light onto the national security threats that companies like TikTok and Apple pose through their ties to Beijing. Both companies declined his invitation just as they did for the Subcommittee's hearing in November.In the hearing today, Mr. Derek Scissors Resident Scholar at American Enterprise Institute, said, "We have [American companies saying] 'we can't innovate nearly as well without China,' a Chinese government that really wants to acquire any innovation it can, and that'sto mewhy you don't have companies that want to come testify. Because they're telling you, 'we are transferring technology to China because we need China to innovate and they want the tech.'"Since the his first committee hearing as chair last year, the State Department, the Departments of Homeland Security and Defense, and TSA have banned TikTok on federal government devices due to cybersecurity concerns and possible spying by the Chinese government.Mr. Adam Hickey Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the DOJ National Security Division said, "In terms of leverage, I'm concerned about a company that does business here, but is ultimately accountable to a parent company in China and susceptible to leverage by the Chinese government. And so I think those who do business with those who do business with those companies may be exposing themselves to an actor who may be co-opted."At the end of year, FBI Director Christopher Wray told Senator Hawley that the FBI is"concerned" with companies like Apple who store their data in China because "Chinese law essentially compels Chinese companies and typically compels U.S. companies that are operating in China to have relationships with different kinds of Chinese companies to provide whatever information the government wants whenever it wants."Load-Date: March 5, 2020End of Document

Yang says Asian Americans being attacked over coronavirus is 'a heartbreaking phenomenon'CNN WireApril 2, 2020 Thursday 9:24 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 464 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON (CNN) BodyWASHINGTON (CNN) --  Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang said Thursday it is a "heartbreaking phenomenon" that Asian Americans have been the target of a growing number of racist and xenophobic attacks related to the coronavirus. Yang, a CNN political commentator, told CNN's Lisa Ling on a live episode of "Go There," CNN's show on Facebook Watch, "I've gotten the same messages you have, Lisa, about friends and Asian Americans who are being either spat on or attacked or assaulted around the country.""And it's just a heartbreaking phenomenon where, just like you, I mean, we're reacting to this the same way any other American does, which is with anxiety about the future and concern about what's going to happen with our families, our neighbors," Yang continued. "But then it's compounded by the fact that you know there's this massive increase in hostility and animosity towards Chinese Americans, Asian Americans, because so many Americans associate this virus with China."President Donald Trump said last week that the spread of the coronavirus in the US is not the fault of Asian Americans, and that it is important to protect the Asian American community in the US. Trump's tweet came less than a week after the President defended his use of the terms "China virus" and "Chinese virus" to describe the novel coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China. After consulting with medical experts and receiving guidance from the World Health Organization, CNN has determined that that name is both inaccurate and considered stigmatizing.Yang, who ended his presidential campaign in February, said he didn't see any "positive value to calling it the China virus, except to incite hostility." He said that "Chinese virus is definitely part of the lexicon at this point, and you know, I've heard of schoolchildren getting called the Chinese virus and being bullied mercilessly."The businessman said it was important to distinguish between the Chinese government and the Chinese people when talking about the coronavirus. He said the Chinese government "bears a lot of responsibility for the fact that it covered up the seriousness of the crisis early on" and added that China did not share accurate data with the rest of the world that could have helped other countries, including the US, prepare for the pandemic. "The seeds of this crisis certainly can be laid at the feet of the Chinese government, but then there's the Chinese people, who suffered some of the same things that we're suffering," Yang said. He added that Asian Americans were "a world away while some of these decisions were being made by Chinese government officials."CNN's Maegan Vazquez contributed to this report. TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Continue reading China could move against Apple and Qualcomm in defence of HuaweiHuawei has been caught in the ongoing US-China stalemate for over a year now. However, things heated up quite a bit last week as the US extended the ban against Huawei for another year. To add insult to injury, the US also green-lit measures to cut of Huawei s chip supply chain, targeting its acquisition of semiconductors from global chipmakers.Now, China is reportedly planning a potentially damaging retaliation action against US firms. According to the Global Times, citing a source close to the Chinese government, China might add certain US companies to an  unreliable entity list.  US companies under fire reportedly include Apple and Qualcomm from the smartphone space, alongside Cisco and Boeing.EDITOR S PICKHuawei s Play Store alternative has gotten better, but it s the apps that countNeedless to say, China is an important market for both Apple and Qualcomm. While iPhones accounted for only 7.3% of China s smartphone shipments in Q1 2020, the country accounts for a sixth of Apple s overall sales. 14.8% of Apple s total revenue in the first quarter of this year came from China. Additionally, it s also where most of Apple s contract factories are located.In the case of Qualcomm, it relies heavily on China as far as expanding its 5G business is concerned. Not to forget the numerous licensing deals it already has in place with Chinese OEMs.What could China do to US companies?Currently, it s unclear what kind of sanctions China could impose on American firms. However, a source told Global Times that  China will take forceful countermeasures to protect its own legitimate rights.  These measures could include  imposing restrictions on or launching investigations  against the likes of Apple and Qualcomm. China will launch rounds of endless investigations on those firms, just like swords hanging over their head. It will dampen investors  confidence and squeeze their income in the Chinese market,  an insider told the Global Times.Meanwhile, China s foreign ministry has also asked the Trump administration to stop its  unreasonable suppression  of Chinese companies like Huawei.  China will firmly defend its companies  legal rights,  China s foreign ministry told Reuters on Saturday.For now, China hasn t announced any countermeasures against the US. We ll have to wait and see how this whole murky scenario plays out. According to Nikkei Asian Review, TSMC has already stopped accepting orders from Huawei given Trump s latest restrictions, so a reaction from China could be expected soon.Increasing US-China trade tensions could further drag down the smartphone market which is already seeing a major decline owing to the coronavirus pandemic. Will the consumer be the ultimate loser in this trade war? Based on what s happening right now, it s very likely.See Campaign:https://www.androidauthority.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-soc-guide-908280/Contact Information:Adamya SharmaTags:, Wire, Artificial Intelligence Newswire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: May 18, 2020End of Document

Another commercial escalation between the US and China with $688 billion in danceCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 21, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 530 wordsBody       By Sergio CancecoThe bill called "Foreign Enterprise Responsibility" unanimously delivered a favorable opinion in the U.S. House of Senators. The main proponent of the initiative was Louisiana's Republican Sen. John Kennedy,who was sponsored by Maryland Democrat Chris, Van Hollen,and North Dakota Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer.The bill covers all foreign companies listed on Wall Street or conducting a capitalization operation on the U.S. stock exchange. The text must still be approved by the House of Representatives and signed into law by the Executive Branch by Donald Trump.Special mention for ChinaSenator Kennedy - of Democratic origin now a Republican libertarian - made strong public statements against the Chinese government. "China is on a path to dominance and cheating at every turn," he said. "It's stupid that we're giving Chinese companies the opportunity to exploit hard-working Americans, people who put their savings for their retirement and their children's college in our markets," Kennedy added.And there is a history of accounting fraud of Chinese companies listed on the US stock market, such as the last known case of the firm Luckin Coffe. Self-proclaimed Starbucksrival, it was valued at up to $12.7 trillion and had a brief glow with a crashing drop as it revealed in April this year that they had exaggerated sales between the second and fourth quarters of 2019 at u$s310 million.The main Chinese shares are listed on the US stock exchange under a certificate of deposit representing the stock of its home market, they are the so-called ADRs. They have their main activity in the technological sector, linked to trade and provision of services on the Internet.What measures does the bill include?Particularly at this last point is where discord arises, as China has refused to allow companies registered in China or Hong Kong to comply with US securities law. They argue that Chinese law prohibits the work of accounting auditors in their companies from being transferred out of the country.In this context, the bill requires a company to be banned from listing on Wall Street if it has not complied with the audits of the US accounting board for three consecutive years. It would be a major blow to the value of Chinese companies, which today accumulate a market capitalization for just over $688 billionWith the publication of the favourable opinion, China's main actions hit the coup with significant declines in their contributions, which they then partially recovered towards the close of wednesday's day.Alibaba Group (Online Retail Giant) fell to 5% and closed in-0.19%.  Baidu Inc, (Internet Search Engine) fell to 7% and closed by -1.12%.JD.com (Retail online) fell to 8% and closed at +0.09%.Coincidentally, the reaction by the White House occurs in the same week that the approval of the "Made in China 2025" planis voted at the Chinese National Congress, which comprises an investment plan for $1.4 billion. This plan seeks to dismiss the US as a global leader in key technologies such as artificial intelligence while reducing its dependence, hand in hand with its giants Alibaba, SenseTime Group and Huawei.(*) TradingView Analyst.Load-Date: May 22, 2020End of Document

China created a fail-safe system to track contagions but failedCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 29, 2020 SundayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 2852 wordsBodyThe alarm system was ready. Frightened by the SARS epidemic that erupted in 2002, China had created an infectious disease reporting system that officials say was world-class: fast, complete and, just as importantly, immune to meddling.Hospitals could enter patient data into a computer and instantly notify government health authorities in Beijing, where officials are trained to detect and quell contagious outbreaks before they are spread.It didn't work.After Wuhan doctors began treating groups of patients affected by mysterious pneumonia in December, the notification was supposed to be automatic. Instead, hospitals referred to local health authorities who, for a political aversion to sharing bad news, hid information about the cases from the national information system, keeping Beijing in the dark and delaying Response.Central health authorities learned of the outbreak not by the notification system, but after unknown informants leaked two internal documents online.Even after Beijing became involved, local officials established narrow criteria to confirm the cases, leaving out information that could have provided clues that the virus was spreading among humans.Hospitals were ordered to count only patients with a known connection to the source of the outbreak, the seafood market. Doctors also had to have their cases confirmed by bureaucrats before superiors were informed.As the United States, Europe and the rest of the world struggle to contain the coronavirus pandemic, China has emerged in model, bringing down a furious outbreak to the point that the country has begun to lift the types of onerous restrictions on life that are now imposed all over the world.This triumphant narrative obscures the early failures in case notification, the time lost that could have been used to curb infections in China before they exploded in a pandemic."According to the rules, this, of course, should have been reported," Yang Gonghuan, a retired health worker who was involved in establishing the direct notification system, said in an interview. "Of course they should have taken advantage of it, found it, gone to understand it."Aggressive action just a week earlier, in mid-January, could have reduced the number of infections by two-thirds, according to a recent study whose authors include an expert from the Wuhan Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Another study indicated that if China had acted to control the outbreak three weeks earlier, it could have prevented 95 percent of the country's cases.China has more than 82,000 cases of coronavirus, and more than 3,300 deaths (REUTERS/Aly Song) (ALY SONG/)"I'm sorry that I didn't keep screaming at the full throttle," said Ai Fen, one of the doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital who spotted cases in December, in an interview with a Chinese magazine. "I've often thought about what would have happened if I could go back in time."China's leader Xi Jinping has tried to quickly overcome early shortcomings and focus on the country's efforts to end the outbreak.The Chinese government has been widely punished for its initial mistakes, which have become a topic of conversation for President Trump.Central leadership has focused blame on local bureaucrats, including for censoring doctors who warned others about infections. He quickly fired two health officials and, later, party secretaries for Hubei Province and its capital, Wuhan.Now, interviews with doctors, experts and health officials, leaked government documents and Chinese media investigations reveal the depth of government failures: how political manipulation succumbed to a built-in system to protect medical knowledge and infection reports.Others tried to fill the information gap when the early warning system failed. The medical community found other informal ways to alert others, disclosing government directives and hospital reports on the Internet. During a rare flurry of relative transparency at the beginning of the epidemic, Chinese journalists did much to expose the problems, but the censors closed that window.The government has promised to fix the flaws exposed in the disease surveillance system, but similar promises were made after SARS. New efforts to repair the system could now also fail under a political hierarchy that leaves experts - doctors, even public health officials - unwilling to confront local leaders. In China, politics often ends up cancelling the same safeguards created to avoid interference in the flow of information.The failures of the first few weeks "greatly reduced the surveillance and self-protection of the public and even medical workers, which made it difficult to contain the epidemic," according to a study of the epidemic by 12 medical experts from the Jiao Tong University in Shanghai. "Only precautions in normal times can prevent major disasters from arising."Much of the international community accuses Chinese President Xi Jinping of having hidden valuable information about the spread of the virus (Xie Huanchi/Xinhua via AP) (Xie Huanchi/)Preparing for the worstLast year, health officials distilled confidence that China would never again suffer a crisis like SARS.In July, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention conducted what it called the nation's largest infectious outbreak training exercise since the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003, showing the progress the government had made since the virus killed hundreds of people and traumatized the nation.More than 8,200 officials took part in the online drill, focusing on a traveler arriving from abroad with a fever and launching temperature monitors, triggering a hunt for other passengers. Officials rushed to check how quickly and effectively they could track, identify and contain the virus, even notifying Beijing."Who knows what the next one will be?" said Feng Zijian, a senior disease control official who helped design the exercise, according to the center."The enemy is constantly evolving," Dr. Feng said, "and our responsiveness must also constantly improve."In thethe heart of China's defenses was the National Direct Information System for Contagious Diseases. Started in 2004, it was designed to prevent a repeat of the SARS epidemic, when slowness and irregularities of information, compounded by the reluctance of local leaders to share bad news, delayed the government's struggle.With this system, Beijing health officials could analyze screens showing reports from hospitals or local disease control centers, ready to detect warning signs within hours of a doctor diagnosing a problematic infection, such as cholera or tuberculosis, as well as difficult-to-diagnose cases of viral pneumonia."Virus like SARS could emerge at any time, but there will never be another SARS incident," Gao Fu, director of China's disease control center, said in a speech last year. "That's because of how well our national contagious disease surveillance system works."The flaunts were not empty.The system had helped when China and other countries experienced outbreaks of bird flu. In 2013, authorities filed cases of a life-threatening H7N9 avian influenza virus, with orders to submit them within two hours of their confirmation.Some doctors revealed that they were unsure how to report the first cases, as they did not fit the standard list of infections (China Daily via REUTERS) (CHINA DAILY/)Last November, the country's Disease Control Center alerted the public to an outbreak of pneumonic plague in the sparsely populated Inner Mongolia, after only two cases appeared.Since the outbreak in Wuhan, some doctors have said they were unsure how to report the first cases, which did not fit the standard list of infections. However, low-covered infections could still be recorded as "pneumonia of unknown etiology" - or of unknown cause - when patients did not respond to regular treatment.Year after year, Chinese health authorities warned hospitals to look at these outliers."In many infectious diseases, when the cause is not known, it can often present as pneumonia of unknown etiology," said Dr. Yang, the retired official. "This was a way to capture an outbreak while in an embryonic state."Health authorities held regular meetings to train disease control officials in the detection and investigation of unexplained and difficult-to-treat cases of pneumonia; the last one took place in Shanghai in October.They inspected local hospitals and disease control centers to try to make sure they were reporting all listed diseases, and the National Health Commission demanded compliance with 100 percent. Although the application was patchy, doctors reported a handful of unusual pneumonia infections, prompting researchers to look for the cause.In early December, the local Hubei Centers for Disease Control summoned officials from across the province to instill the importance of the system.Huang Xibao, a deputy director of the center, told them to ensure that in 2020 Hubei was "number one nationally in qualityinformation on contagious diseases."The epicenter of the virus occurred in China's Wuhan Province (REUTERS/Stringer) (STRINGER/)"Nice place to stay"Dr. Ai, head of the intensive care unit at Wuhan Central Hospital, was one of the first physicians to observe a disturbing pattern among patients who were staggering to the city's hospitals with dry coughs, high fevers and a lethargy Disabling. CT or CT scans often revealed extensive damage to his lungs."It was a bewildering high fever," Ai said of a patient who appeared on December 16, according to an interview in a Chinese magazine called People. "The medicines used didn't work and their temperature didn't drop."At the end of the month, local disease control centers in Wuhan received worried calls from doctors, telling the strange and tenacious cases of pneumonia that often seemed to emanate from Wuhan's seafood market. Seven in one hospital, three in another, three in another."These patients can be infectious. Caring for them in a general hospital is a safety risk," warned Huang Chaolin, senior physician at Jinyintan Hospital, the city's leading infectious disease center. He saw seven patients from another hospital on December 27, according to a report in health news, the official newspaper of the medical system.In theory, doctors could have reported these cases directly, but Chinese hospitals also respond to Communist Party bureaucracies. Over time, hospitals often came to defer to local health authorities about reporting problematic infections, apparently to avoid surprising and shaming local leaders.That deference may not have imported much most of the time. He now gave officials in Wuhan an opening to control and distort information about the virus.Local disease control offices in the city had counted 25 of these cases by December 30, an official internal report said that was leaked online last month by unknown whistleblowers. The brief document was one of Wuhan's first attempts to understand the extent of the cases, and the listed patients had fallen ill as of December 12."The local health administration clearly made the decision not to use the reporting system," said Dali Yang, a political science professor at the University of Chicago studying policy-making in China. "It is clear that they were trying to solve the problem within the province."The late information on the spread of the virus is largely due to Chinese hospitals also responding to communist party bureaucracies (China Daily via REUTERS) (CHINA DAILY/)Wuhan leaders appear to have assumed that the outbreak would be reduced as bursts of short-lived, localized avian influenza infection, Shao Yiming, virologist at the Centers for Disease Control, said in an interview with Caixin, a Chinese magazine."This presumption causederrors of judgment, so we missed the opportunity to adopt early lock-up tactics and tell the public how to self-protect," Shao said.News of the outbreak began to reach disease control officials in Beijing after rumors and leaked documents began to spread online. The National Disease Control Centre has deliberately avoided saying in advertisements that it had been notified by Wuhan, and instead noted that it had been "aware" of the outbreak. Local officials have avoided saying when and how they told Beijing.The leaked documents were two internal directives of the Wuhan government, which came online on 30 December, possibly published by concerned medical workers. The directives, marked as "urgent," ordered hospitals to send information to the city's health committee on cases of mysterious pneumonia, to improve patient treatment, and to prevent infection in hospitals. At the same time, doctors alerted their colleagues to the outbreak in talks by private groups on social media, prompting official reprimands.Gao Fu, the director of the Center for Disease Control, detected information circulating on the Internet and raised the alarm, according to a story by Hua Sheng, a prominent Chinese economist who has defended the center. Dr. Gao declined to answer questions. The center ordered the teams of experts to hurry to Wuhan, and the first group arrived the next morning."News that pneumonia of unknown cause had emerged in Wuhan shook the nerves of all the workers at the Chinese Center for Disease Control," according to a report released by the center.Officials from the National Health Commission have said they ordered Wuhan to issue his first official announcement on the outbreak on 31 December. That day the government also informed the Office of the World Health Organization in Beijing.Some of the first cases were eventually introduced into the system on 3 January, although by then it was too late to serve as the intended early warning system.Aerial photo taken on March 26, 2020 shows almost empty roads in Wuhan, central Hubei Province, China, where the coronavirus outbreak (Photo by STR / AFP) (STR/) originated (STR/)Limited criteriaWhen the central government became involved, local officials welcomed expert investigators sent by Beijing. Officials described the infections as nothing too serious."They said the disease was quite light, not unlike seasonal flu, and that there had been no disease among hundreds of people in close contact," said Zeng Guang, a Chinese epidemiologist who visited Wuhan on January 9, about his talks there, according to the China Youth Daily. "They sounded very relaxed."Behind the scenes, Wuhan officials made an effort to limit the number of infections counted as part of the outbreak, hindering the task of case doctors.A leaked report from Wuhan Central Hospital describes how in the first fortnight of January local officials told doctors that cases should be confirmed by bureaucratic supervisors, especially the city's health authorities andprovince.An official at The Wuhan District Disease Control Center told the hospital doctor who was in charge of infection reports on January 3 that "this was a special contagious disease and that we should report only after the superiors they would have notified," the leaked report said.As of January 3, the Wuhan Health Commission established strict criteria to confirm that a case was officially part of the outbreak, according to a copy of the diagnostic guide that was leaked to the Chinese media, possibly by a medical professional. The rules said patients could be counted if they had been on the market or had close contact with another patient who had done so. That excluded an increasing number of likely cases without a clear link to the market.For most of the first half of January, local officials argued that there had been no confirmed new infections, even when Wuhan doctors and visiting experts suspected that a dangerous contagion was spreading person by person."I lived the SARS, and for me the first period of this epidemic felt shockingly like SARS," Li Liming, a public health professor at The University of Beijing who was among the experts sent to Wuhan, told a Chinese newspaper. "In both cases, there was no rapid system response at first."Zhong Nanshan, a disease expert who helped identify SARS, was also skeptical of official optimism in Wuhan after visiting the city and listening to his alumni.He and other experts completed their assessment of Wuhan on 19 January, convinced that the virus had become threatening, and conveyed their alarm to senior officials at meetings in Beijing."All members of the team of experts reported that the situation was bleak," Caixin Yuen Kwok-yung, professor of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong who was part of the expert group, told Caixin Yuen Kwok-yung magazine. "Preventive measures had to be put in place immediately."After weeks without reporting new infections, the Wuhan government revealed four new cases on January 18, followed by 17 the next day and 136 the following.Four days later, Wuhan was closed to contain the spread.At that time, the coronavirus had killed 26 people and sickened more than 800. By Sunday, there were more than 670,000 cases worldwide; more than 31,000 people have died.Article published in The New York TimesLoad-Date: March 30, 2020End of Document

FBI Director Wray Issues Remarks at Boston Conference on Cyber SecurityTargeted News ServiceMarch 6, 2020 Friday 6:20 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 4712 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: BOSTON, Massachusetts BodyThe U.S. Department of Justice's Federal Bureau of Investigation issued the following remarks on March 4 by Director Christopher Wray at the Boston Conference on Cyber Security:It's an honor to be here today. This is the FBI's fourth year co-hosting this conference with Boston College. I couldn't be here last year, and it's great to be back. This has become one of the most unique gatherings of voices, thinkers, and policy makers in the cyber realm. And it's one we're really proud to be a part of at the FBI.In my first two years as FBI Director, I've traveled around to all 56 field offices, and I've met with folks from every division at Headquarters. I've met with scores of our foreign law enforcement and intelligence community partners, with leaders of small and large businesses and community leaders, with judges, law enforcement leaders from all 50 states, and with crime victims and their families.And while doing so, I've been taking stock of how things compare to my last tenure in government, when I was responsible for the DOJ Criminal Division's cyber program, overseeing, among other things, the Computer Crimes and Intellectual Property Section. In those days, before the creation of the National Security Division, I oversaw the counterterrorism and counterespionage programs as well. Coming back to government after 12 years away in 2017, to a Bureau responsible for combating a wide array of threats, it's fair to say that none has evolved as dramatically as the cyber threat. We all know about the data breaches, the theft of PII, online scams, and the like.But coming back to law enforcement, I saw how much the cyber threat had grown--in its complexity, its sophistication, and its scope. Cyber capabilities have become a more powerful weapon than ever for some pretty dangerous people--and dangerous nations, too. So we're working to make sure we're even more thoughtful, driven, and agile than they are when it comes to harnessing emerging technology and innovation--to keep our people, our intellectual property, and our data safe.Today I want to talk about the cyber threat writ large. I want to focus on what we're doing in the FBI to address that threat. I want to highlight the need for strong partnerships at every level. And I want to talk a bit about institutionalizing innovation--how we can take a more high-level and creative approach to this growing threat. Because we can't just fight this threat one by one: One bad guy at a time, one syndicate at a time, one victim company at a time. We've also got to tackle the cyber threat as a whole, applying our capabilities, our intelligence, and our partnerships to their full extent.The ThreatsSo let's start with the threats. In some ways, the nature of the cyber threat hasn't changed that much over the past few years, at least. But the scope has changed, the impact has deepened, and many of the players have become more dangerous. We're still seeing hack after hack and breach after breach. We hear about it daily in the news. The more we shift to the Internet as the conduit and the repository for everything we use and share and manage, the more danger we're in.Today we're worried about a wider-than-ever range of threat actors, from multi-national cyber syndicates to nation-state adversaries. And we're concerned about a wider-than-ever gamut of methods continually employed in new ways, like the targeting of managed service providers--MSPs--as a way to access scores of victims by hacking just one provider.China's MSS pioneered the technique--we indicted two MSS officers for hacking a slew of MSPs in December 2018. But now criminal hackers do the same. We're seeing them take advantage of the ability to hack a single managed service provider to steal--or in the case of ransomware, encrypt--data belonging to many of the provider's customers--in effect, grabbing the janitor's entire big key ring instead of a key to just one apartment.In addition, we face the increasingly blended threat of state-sponsored economic espionage facilitated by cyber intrusions. More than ever, our adversaries' targets are our nation's core economic assets--our information and ideas, our innovation, our research and development, our technology. No country poses a broader, more severe threat to those assets than China.As I know this audience is well aware, they're not just targeting companies related to our defense industry--they're targeting companies producing everything from proprietary rice seeds to software for wind turbines to high-end medical devices. And they're not just targeting innovation and R&D. They're going after cost and pricing information, internal strategy documents, bulk PII--anything that can give them a competitive advantage. Their intelligence services increasingly hire hacking contractors, who do the government's bidding, to try to obfuscate the connection between the Chinese government and the theft of our data.We see Chinese companies stealing American intellectual property to avoid the hard slog of innovation and then using it to compete against the very American companies they victimized--in effect, cheating twice over. To be clear: This threat is not about the Chinese people as a whole, and certainly not about Chinese-Americans as a group, but it is about the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party.China is by no means the only country stealing our intellectual property for their own advantage. But nor is that the only cyber threat presented by the PRC government. They're working to obtain controlled defense technology and developing the ability to use cyber means to complement any future real-world conflict. In those areas they have plenty of company as well. Russia, Iran, North Korea. All of them, and others, are working to simultaneously strengthen themselves, and weaken the United States. And we're taking all these nation state threats very seriously.But as dangerous as nation-states are, we don't have the luxury of focusing on them alone. We're also battling the increasing sophistication of criminal groups that places many hackers on a level we used to see only among hackers working for governments. The proliferation of malware as a service, where darkweb vendors sell sophistication in exchange for cryptocurrency, increases the difficulty of stopping what would once have been less-dangerous offenders. It can give a ring of unsophisticated criminals the tools to paralyze entire hospitals, police departments, and businesses with ransomware. Often the hackers themselves haven't actually gotten much more sophisticated--but they're renting sophisticated capabilities, requiring us to up our game as we work to defeat them, too.We're having to fight these increasingly-dangerous threats while contending with providers increasingly shielding indispensable information about those threats from any form of lawful access--through warrant-proof encryption. We are all for strong encryption--and contrary to what you might hear, we're not advocating for "back doors." We've been asking for providers to make sure that they themselves maintain some kind of access to the encrypted data we need, so they can still provide it in response to a court order. When they can't, they're often blinding us to vital evidence showing who's behind an intrusion, or what they're going to do next.Premiere Cyber Investigative AgencyThankfully we don't face this wide array of threats alone--far from it. Befitting the scope of the danger, America deploys a whole cyber ecosystem against it. And at the FBI, we play a central, core role in that ecosystem. Our shared goal is to ensure safety, security, and confidence in our increasingly connected world. That sounds good but it's a lot harder to actually do day after day.At the Bureau, we're particularly focused on imposing risk and consequences on cyber adversaries. And we're doing that by going after them using a blend of world-class capabilities and enduring partnerships--building on a century of innovation.Let me break that down a bit. First, our capabilities. Our unique authorities allow us to conduct investigations, collect and share intelligence, and engage domestic and international partners, as well as victims, enabling us to attribute cyber crimes and attacks, determining and showing who's responsible--often right down to knowing who's on the keyboard. That attribution allows us and our government partners to leverage the instruments of state power to bring pain and consequences to adversaries. And attribution, with the evidence we collect on those adversaries--what they're doing, where they are--also allows us to disrupt them in progress.As both a law enforcement and intelligence service, we're able to capitalize on a uniquely broad range of information sources. Here in the U.S., most of the evidence we need to further our investigations requires either an explicit order from, or supervision by, a court. We serve and execute criminal legal process like search warrants and subpoenas. We also work under the supervision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court--the FISC.FISA is one of the most important investigative tools we've got in preventing our adversaries from harming our country. We can't leverage our role in the intelligence community without it--FISA is what allows us to target nation-state threats that are close at hand, right here in America, that we learn of from U.S. and allied intel partners or other sensitive methods. Our Constitution in many situations rightly demands a warrant or order before we take investigative steps. And the FISC provides that vital, independent oversight. FISA is a powerful tool--and we've got to be sure we're using it properly, at every step in the process. But we couldn't do our jobs without it.We also leverage human sources where appropriate, who can provide key insights into our adversaries' actions, plans, and intentions. And, vitally, we maintain capabilities that come from partnerships in the U.S. government, across America, and around the world.We have a strong cyber presence both domestically and overseas. In each of our 56 field offices we've got cyber squads enhanced by interagency partners who collaborate with us on investigations. We can be quickly on site at dozens of locations at the same time, with agents and other technical experts trained to investigate cyber incidents. Having that presence all across the country means that businesses have local FBI points of contact close by in the event of an incident.And because the cyber threat has no borders, we've got to maintain a global reach. We now have FBI cyber assistant legal attaches stationed in many key embassies around the world. They've helped build coalitions of like-minded countries to stand with the U.S. against our adversaries. And they facilitate the law enforcement and intelligence sharing essential to countering actors who almost invariably employ foreign infrastructure--from servers to money mules and payment firms to darkweb hacking tool providers--in their attacks. Our overseas cyber ALATs are also central to the disruptions our investigations enable. When there's a botnet to be taken down, tackling just the domestic parts of it is typically not going to work.We need to coordinate closely with international partners, right down to tightly-coordinated execution of seizures, searches, and arrests, so that instead of capturing a single criminal, we're taking down an entire enterprise. And that takes people on the ground, people who increasingly have their own desk at our foreign partner agencies.We've also got a Cyber Action Team, an elite, rapid response force--the best of the best. They've deployed to more than 80 major incidents here and abroad over the past several years.But the cyber threats are invariably multi-disciplinary. So we're leveraging our decades of experience across the Bureau on lots of related fronts, for example, our Counterintelligence Division, the experts in combattng foreign intelligence threats on U.S. soil. We benefit greatly from our ability to look at nation-state cyber threats as part of a broader counterintelligence threat. Our Counterterrorism Division, helping us anticipate how terrorists might develop the skills and plans to harm us virtually--away from the battlefield. And our Criminal Investigative Division, working to stop massive online criminal schemes that threaten ordinary Americans' life savings, and our companies' success--and in some cases, those companies' very existence.Imposing CostsBut what does it really mean to impose risks and consequences, and how do we do it?For a long time, we've been focused on indicting and arresting cyber actors. And sometimes that's the best choice. Because we've got to hold criminals accountable, no matter where they are. There are those who say, well, you'll never get your hands on bad guys in China, Russia, or Iran, for example. To which I say, don't be so sure--maybe not today. But one day, they slip up, and we're there. We're not going anywhere--the FBI's got a broad reach and an even longer memory.The headlines speak for themselves. There are an awful lot of cyber criminals now in prison because of our work and that of our DOJ partners. And many of those criminals were confident they were safe - right up until the cuffs went on.There are also indicted cyber criminals who have so far avoided prison, but are now exposed, a lot less employable than they were when they were in the shadows, and now serving as living warnings to the next wave of hackers of the costs you risk when you violate our laws.But as powerful a tool as indictments are, we have many others in our arsenal. What if the hackers are in China or Russia, where they're not being arrested, but are trying to sell stolen data? Our Treasury Department may be able to sanction them, or the companies we find using the stolen IP, or the cryptocurrency exchanges moving their money. But first, we need to show who's actually responsible for the criminal conduct. FBI investigations inform the broader government's assessment of where sanctions can be effective, and provide a factual basis for leveling those sanctions.But we don't stop there, because the threat keeps growing. So we're continually asking ourselves what more we can do. Can we leverage the FBI's unique intelligence, along with our USIC partners, to go on offense? Can we provide the evidence we obtain through our investigations to our foreign partners to help them arrest those bad guys we might not be able to reach ourselves?To understand the FBI's role in the cyber ecosystem, you have to always keep partnership in the front of your mind. We sit operationally at the intersection of DHS and CISA, on the one hand, and our partners in the intelligence community and the DOD, on the other hand.To put it in simple terms, DHS and CISA focus on prevention and remediation. That often demands threat intelligence--to know what tools the bad guys are developing, what IP addresses and domains they're using, who else they've been targeting. The intelligence community and those in the military--including U.S. Cyber Command--focus on overseas angles. In that world we can take the insight of the U.S. intelligence community and our security partners abroad, and combine that with an ability to work with foreign law enforcement and prosecutors--the people who arrest hackers, seize criminal infrastructure, and provide evidence for our own prosecutionsWe sit right in the middle of this ecosystem, because of our cross-cutting law enforcement and national security authorities. And that gives us a deep knowledge of the threats, and, with our partners, a wide range of options to choose the best weapon available.The 2018 SamSam Ransomware indictment is a good example of how we do this. SamSam was sophisticated malicious software used to hack into the networks of hospitals, schools, companies, government agencies, and a number of other entities, and to encrypt their computers. There were more than 200 victims--including the City of Atlanta, the Port of San Diego, and MedStar Health.To identify the actors, we needed more than just our own intelligence. We needed information from victims across the country, and intelligence and investigative information from foreign partners and private sector entities who were also tracking SamSam. With all those pieces of the puzzle, we were able to attribute the attack to two Iranians.More puzzle pieces helped us determine the actors were working for personal profit, rather than on behalf of the Iranian government. DOJ unsealed an indictment in November 2018. And the investigation also enabled the Treasury Department to issue sanctions against two bitcoin exchangers, and for the first time warn the private sector about some of the criminals' virtual currency addresses.Since the indictment and sanctions, we haven't seen any SamSam activity. Partnerships are what made all of this possible.The head of our Cyber Division, Matt Gorham, likes to say that cyber is the ultimate team sport. Matt uses a great analogy to describe it. Cyber is like a tapestry. Each agency is an independent--but also interdependent--thread in that tapestry. Each thread is formidable on its own. But together, we make up a strong, interwoven fabric--far stronger than any single thread. And when you weave in the threads of our foreign partners, the private sector, and academia, that fabric becomes unbreakable.Working with VictimsGiven the esteemed private sector audience we have here today, I don't want to pass up the opportunity to say a few words about how we work with victims and potential victims. The recognition that we have to fight these problems as a team is central to how we work with the private sector--from companies of all sizes, to universities, to NGOs.Our folks are working their tails off every day to find and stop the criminals and nation-state adversaries targeting our companies and institutions. But we and our U.S. and foreign government partners can't do it on our own. This fight requires a whole-of-society approach--government and the private sector, working together. That's why agents in every single FBI field office spend a huge amount of time going out to companies and universities in their area, establishing relationships before there's a problem, and providing threat intelligence to help prepare defenses. That can be as specific as warning a company that we see hackers, right now, preparing to compromise their network, and letting our contacts at the company know that if they were trying to decide the best time to update their system patches, we would suggest "today."We get threat information to affected companies as fast as we possibly can. That includes information we've obtained from sensitive sources. We might not be able to tell you precisely how we knew you were in trouble--but we can usually find a way to tell you what you need to know to prepare for, or stop, an attack.We don't always get there as quickly as we'd like. The flood of cyber intrusions and attacks is unrelenting. But we're doing everything possible to get timely, actionable, and relevant information to you as fast as we can. And we find that having a pre-existing relationship with company or university leadership invariably helps us do that faster.For private sector leaders, talking with us before a problem strikes helps you understand how we operate--how we protect information provided by victims who are often embroiled in difficulties on many fronts in the wake of a major intrusion. And how we can help--regulators like the FTC, SEC, and state AGs often want to know whether a company is cooperating with law enforcement, and if a company asks us to, we're happy to flag its assistance in our efforts.Ideally, we can create a flow of information that runs both ways, so we can get helpful information, too. We may come to you knowing one IP address used to attack you, but not another; if you tell us about the second one, not only can we do more to help you, maybe we can stop the next attack, as well.Since coming back to government, I've been encouraged by how much more energy and enthusiasm today's FBI places on partnerships with other law enforcement agencies, here and abroad, and in particular with the business and academic communities.You may have heard what former Defense Secretary Mattis used to say about the Marines Corps--there's "no better friend, no worse enemy" than the U.S. Marines. We have that same mentality in the FBI--people should be able to say "there's no better partner" than the FBI. We want that to be the case for all our partners--especially those counting on us to help protect them.When thinking about cybersecurity, people often focus on tech fixes. But our experience shows that the human factor is equally important--and that trust built over time is key to effective information-sharing between government and industry. Let me give you an example of the good that can come from cooperating and building a relationship with the Bureau before the storm hits, and the good that comes from looping us in quickly.You're probably aware of the intrusion that Capital One suffered not long ago. No company wants to go through something like that. The good news is, Capital One had already built a strong relationship with the FBI over the course of several years. Because of that relationship, they promptly reported the intrusion to us. Their transparency and cooperation, along with our investigative work, led to the suspect being taken into custody and the stolen data being secured less than two weeks from the time Capital One became aware of the breach.Think about what would've happened if they hadn't reported it to us right away. The suspect could still be hacking into networks illegally. And terabytes of sensitive data belonging to the victims might never have been secured. Who knows where all that sensitive data would be now?I also want to make sure people understand that our work in the cyber realm is about more than just big, publicly-traded corporations. We're here to help the Capital Ones of the world, but we also want to help everyday citizens--and everyone in between.I'm really proud of the work of our Recovery Asset Team. As Joe mentioned a bit ago, it's now part of our Cyber Division's Internet Crime Complaint Center, or IC3, after being initially developed right here in Boston. A great example of the kind of innovation I want to turn to in a minute.The Recovery Asset Team--with the unfortunate acronym of RAT--helps victims of business email compromise or email account compromise who lose money due to fraudulent wire transfers. Since that team was created in February 2018, they've recovered more than $512 million--a 78% recovery rate. But those figures only tell part of the story about the actual impact. Let me give you a couple of examples.In 2019, a small city in Alaska made multiple vendor payments to fraudulent accounts over the course of a few months. Our Recovery Asset Team worked with the bank to recover $2.6 million. That loss, for a municipality that size, would have bankrupted it.On the other end of the spectrum, an individual who was closing on a house wired $56,000 to a fraudulent account, after receiving a spoofed e-mail from someone she thought was her lending agent. Our Recovery Asset Team worked with the bank's fraud department to freeze the funds--which were part of the victim's inheritance when her mother died. Our getting the money back for her is what made it possible for her to purchase her home.Those are just two cases out of hundreds, but they illustrate my point. Whether you're the corporate victim of a massive data breach or your personal life's been turned upside down by fraud, we're here for you. The reality is that the threats we face today are too diverse, too dangerous, and too all-encompassing for any of us to tackle alone. We've got to figure out how we can match strengths--so that our two plus your two equals not just four, but five or six or seven. That's the essence of the most effective partnerships.InnovationEarlier I mentioned that I've been on a pilgrimage to every FBI field office over the past two years, many of them now more than once. One of the main topics I've been talking about in those visits is innovation.An audience like this recognizes that the old approach of tackling the cyber threat one case at a time isn't going to work. As soon as we find and stop one cyber criminal, another one pops up. So with threats like ransomware and business email compromise increasingly rampant, we're taking an enterprise approach. We don't want to just keep the cyber criminals at bay, we want to burn down their infrastructure.Instead of Whack-a-Mole, think of it more like Carl the groundskeeper versus the gopher in the classic movie Caddyshack. I know I'm dating myself here. No, we're not going after cyber criminals with plastic explosives, like Carl. But we're working to get to the root of the operation, to take down their ability to act. And that requires creative thinking. For example, when we see criminals leasing malware as a service, we target the bottleneck-- the service providers, the darkwebsites that host malware and hacking support, the payment services that enable criminal customers and criminal service providers to make a deal.The urgency of our mission keeps us laser-focused on our day-to-day work of keeping people safe. After all, we're investigators, we're operational, we have to live in the world of today--for good reason. But we are also working hard to position the FBI to meet this threat five years down the road, 10 years, 20 years--long after I'm out of this role.We've got to keep finding new ways to be more efficient, more nimble, more agile, more resilient. We've got to keep making sure we're leaving the FBI even better, even more formidable than we found it. Not just technological innovation, but also things like process improvements, new strategies, and new ways to work together. Thinking outside of the box. Inside the rules, but outside of the box.Innovation has always been a big part of who we are at the FBI. Things like the FBI Lab, our cyber assistant legal attaches abroad, or our Joint Terrorism Task Forces--these may seem like old news to us now, but they were really innovative when they were created, and they set the gold standard for law enforcement. So we take a lot of inspiration from our history.Over 111 years, we've built a track record of pivoting to counter each new, dangerous threat to the American people, like when we changed gears in our fight against terrorism after 9/11. Among other benefits, that history helps us find and hire the kind of independent-thinking, hard-charging, creative people that keep pushing us forward. And it gives us an edge against our adversaries in the cyber worldI know I've talked for a long time, but I still only covered a fraction of what the FBI has to offer as we work to counter the cyber threat from both criminals and dangerous nation-states.I know there are some students in the audience, and I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't mention what an incredible place the FBI is to work. There's nothing more fulfilling than helping and protecting people.But don't take it from me at the podium--just look at our workforce. It's hard to get a job at the FBI--our application rates are through the roof these days. Last year, three times as many Americans applied for agent positions as in any of the several preceding years--and it's not just agents. Even our intern applications are surging, despite a strong economy.And when people succeed in joining, they stay. Last year our agent attrition rate was 0.5%--and it's down again this year. The people who join us become addicted to our mission.There aren't many places where you get to do work as important as what our people are doing, day in and day out. So if our mission to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution appeals to you, please consider joining us. You won't regret it.Thank you for being here; I hope you find the conference enlightening and useful.Copyright Targeted News ServicesT40-MgEditor-7041601 T40-MgEditorLoad-Date: March 10, 2020End of Document

Yes, China is probably watching us through our IoT devicesiCrowdNewswire (English)March 6, 2020 Friday 10:05 PM GMTCopyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 882 wordsBodyIs your phone/laptop/home security camera spying on you for the Chinese government?

Continue reading Yes, China is probably watching us through our IoT devicesIs your phone/laptop/home security camera spying on you for the Chinese government?Well, probably.Should you care?Eh...yes, but also, how much of a choice do we all have?IoT device security   particularly in home security camera systems like Wyze, Aqara, and Ring   has been a hot topic lately. The devices have repeatedly been shown to be leaky and insecure at best, with no two-factor authentication or encryption present. This has allowed for a multitude of incidents wherein hackers have gained control of people s digital lives and threatened them.But a wider problem still is the passive watching that might be happening. Many of the devices are assembled in China, using Chinese parts. Even if the companies are not explicitly Chinese, this presents a threat. So much so that the U.S. Department of Interior at the end of January instituted a ban on Chinese-made drones and drone parts over fears that the tech might be sending information back to the Chinese government. In general, IoT devices contain many third-party components and different communication stacks which provide many ways for malicious parties to hack into them,  said Natali Tshuva, CEO and co-founder of Sternum, an Israeli cybersecurity company that works on secure connectivity for IoT devices, in an email to Digital Trends.This is changing, somewhat, Tshuva said. Common vulnerabilities in IoT systems, like Elasticsearch databases   which store the devices  data   being left open for access without credentials are problematic, she said, emphasize the need for end-to-end encryption. Companies are taking steps to enhance the security of their devices, but they are lacking a holistic approach that covers all security aspects of their devices, leaving an opening for attackers to exploit them,  Tshuva wrote.  With billions of IoT devices coming to market now and over the next few years, it s critical that each device is embedded with security. Osiris: IoT water pipe monitorThe problem, said Jimmy Jones, telecoms cybersecurity expert at Positive Technologies, is that these companies care most about being first to market, and this means cutting costs.  Everything is driven by price point. People don t want to pay that extra dollar,  Jones told Digital Trends.  So they [the companies] end up using third party software and third party parts. The problem is, a lot of them [the devices] do come from China.  It s hard to tell what s malicious and what s just incompetent,  said Ron Gula, a former NSA white hat hacker and current investor in cybersecurity startups.  Let s say there are some companies that have perfect security on their devices, but they are still based in China,  he said.  All of that data they collect, the Chinese government can ask for access to it. Or it might even have implied access, and they don t have to tell us about it. Who is China spying on then, if they indeed are spying?  In a word, indirectly, probably everyone,  Jones said.  But it s not necessarily cause for alarm; it s a trust situation. So much of our lives are produced in China now. So, where do we draw the line as to what products we re willing to accept from there, Jones asked.  Is it a car? Is it a drone? Is it a lightbulb? Is it a central heating system?  Jones said, pointing to two stories, one about a DDOS attack in Finland that shut down a city s central heating system, another another about smart lightbulbs leaking WiFi credentials. We ve seen it with Huawei,  Jones said, referred to the Chinese phone manufacturing giant that has been the target of much ire from the Trump administration.  These companies, or their holding companies, are all owned by the trade unions. The Chinese Communist Party is essentially the head of the trade unions, so really everyone is just two steps away from being owned by the Chinese government.  There has to be a point where trust needs to take precedence,  Jones said.  Or, do we create a new superpower to manufacture our stuff, and then in ten years we decide we don t trust them either? Requiring everything to be made here in the U.S. isn t really that feasible, said Gula.  Our iPhones are built in China,  he said.  Like most Cisco routers and most laptops.  And honestly, he said, that isn t want matters here. The best antidote right now is just to educate the public. When your data s in the Cloud, you hope it s protected, but it s honestly subject to the laws of wherever it s hosted,  he said. And then there s a question of where the data that s transmitted through these devices is stored.  Data provenance, and where it s stored, and who has access is a big deal.  I don t want to see  Made in China  stickers,  Gula said.  I wanted to see  Data Hosted in China  stickers. See Campaign:https://metropolitan.fi/entry/ddos-attack-halts-heating-in-finland-amidst-winterContact Information:Maya ShwayderTags:, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: March 26, 2020End of Document

SASSE AND GALLAGHER URGE TWITTER TO BAN CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTYStates News ServiceMarch 20, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 816 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse:U.S. Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) and Congressman Mike Gallagher (R-WI) publicly urged Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to ban Chinese Communist Party accounts that spread propaganda and whitewash the history of China's coronavirus cover-up."It is clear that Chinese Communist Party officials are using Twitter to disseminate propaganda in the midst of a dangerous global crisis," write Sasse and Gallagher. "Even worse, this propaganda obscures and confuses users over the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and potentially undermines efforts to contain and control the outbreak. We believe this behavior more than warrants their removal from the platform. Additionally, given the humanitarian importance of free and open access to the internet, we believe that access to social media platforms should be denied to government officials from countries that prohibit their own populations from accessing this very content."The full letter is available here and found below.Dear Mr. Dorsey,While the coronavirus pandemic is afflicting families, governments, and markets around the world, the Chinese Communist Party is waging a massive propaganda campaign to rewrite the history of COVID-19 and whitewash the Party's lies to the Chinese people and the world. The widespread use of Twitter by communist officials of the People's Republic of China (PRC) during this crisis emphasizes the contradiction in officials from governments that deny their citizens access to social media platforms like Twitter having access to those same platforms, oftentimes to spread disinformation.By banning Twitter in China, the Chinese Communist Party is keeping its citizens in the dark. By putting propaganda on Twitter, the Chinese Communist Party is lying to the rest of the world. We believe that the propaganda campaign Chinese government officials are currently waging on Twitter especially during the current global crisis-- merits the removal of these individual accounts from the platform. We appreciate your efforts to address these concerns in writing.First, while the Chinese government is prolific at rewriting history through its state-run media outlets that also run their own Twitter accounts, PRC diplomats are increasingly taking to Twitter during this crisis. PRC diplomats have tweeted lies that the Chinese government has been completely transparent throughout the crisis and bought the world time to prepare for the outbreak; a theory largely discredited and debunked by a recent study. PRC diplomats have also shamelessly propagated conspiracy theories like the United States created the coronavirus for which the Chinese Communist Party itself bears responsibility. That PRC officials deliberately took to Twitter to push this propaganda raise the following questions:How does Twitter view tweets and statements like these by PRC officials?Does Twitter believe that the PRC officials are engaging in a free and open exchange of ideas about the virus on its platform?If PRC officials indeed have ulterior motives and are deliberately spreading misinformation on your platform, what does Twitter view as its responsibility to its users?The PRC is not the only totalitarian government that blocks public access to Twitter yet uses your service to promote its propaganda. Notably, many Iranian government officials enjoy verified Twitter accounts despite denying the Iranian public the opportunity to engage on your platform. We applaud your 2018 decision to suspend more than 280 Iranian Twitter accounts that engaged in "coordinated manipulation," but urge you to consider whether that standard also applies to government officials from other totalitarian regimes. Accordingly, we also request answers to the following:What is Twitter's rationale for granting platform access to representatives of a government that blocks its domestic population from accessing Twitter?What is Twitter's rationale for granting platform access to representatives of a government that helps organize the coordinated manipulation of content on your platform?It is clear that Chinese Communist Party officials are using Twitter to disseminate propaganda in the midst of a dangerous global crisis. Even worse, this propaganda obscures and confuses users over the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and potentially undermines efforts to contain and control the outbreak. We believe this behavior more than warrants their removal from the platform. Additionally, given the humanitarian importance of free and open access to the internet, we believe that access to social media platforms should be denied to government officials from countries that prohibit their own populations from accessing this very content.Thank you for your consideration and we look forward to engaging with you on these questions and more.Sincerely,Senator Ben SasseCongressman Mike GallagherLoad-Date: March 20, 2020End of Document

PEN America: China's Smear of Mario Vargas Llosa an Attempt to Silence CriticismTargeted News ServiceMarch 18, 2020 Wednesday 8:51 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 881 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: NEW YORK BodyPEN America issued the following news release:* * *- After comments in a Spanish newspaper, China's government lashed out at the former president of PEN International* * *The Chinese government's criticism and apparent censorship of celebrated Peruvian author and former president of PEN International Mario Vargas Llosa, in apparent retaliation for the writer's recent editorial on the coronavirus, is an unwarranted attempt to influence the conversation around the pandemic by retaliating against critics, PEN America said today.On Saturday, Vargas Llosa wrote a column for Spain's newspaper El Pais, in which the author shared his reflections on the coronavirus. Among other points, Vargas Llosa noted that the virus had originated in China, and went on to note that China had censored at least one of the doctors who had originally detected the virus. Vargas Llosa, who has previously received the Nobel Prize for Literature, concluded that China's censorship meant that "the presence of the plague was recognized only when the virus was already spreading... true progress is always crippled when it is not accompanied by freedom."In response, China's embassy to Peru released a statement accusing the author of "a series of absurd and baseless criticisms of China," and accused the author of "discriminatory and defamatory statements" as a result of his identifying the virus as originating from China. El Pais has since reported that, in the aftermath of Vargas Llosa's column, the author's books have "mysteriously disappeared" from major Chinese e-book platforms.Various observers--including PEN America's CEO Suzanne Nossel--have concluded that the Chinese government's efforts to tightly control the narrative around the virus has exacerbated the spread of the virus. In a column for Foreign Policy written earlier this month, Nossel wrote, "China and Iran stand out for muzzling doctors who tried to warn about the coronavirus, downplaying the number of cases and deaths as the epidemic progressed, and inflating the success of their containment efforts. The predictable result was that the virus spread more quickly and widely than if these governments had been forthright from the start.""The Chinese government's attacks on Mario Vargas Llosa should be seen for what they are: an attempt to dismiss valid criticism of their handling of the coronavirus by smearing the critic as defamatory," said Nossel today. "But now is a moment for truth telling, and that includes the fact that China's efforts to censor critics and whistleblowers--including their effort to silence whistleblowing doctor Li Wenliang, who later died from the virus--played a role in exacerbating the danger that the coronavirus has posed both to Chinese citizens and to the world at large. Chinese officials should recognize the public health consequences of their relentless censorship efforts, and stop attempting to smear or silence those who object to their narrative around the virus."COVID-19 is widely understood to have originated in Wuhan, China, and the first reported cases of the outbreak occurred there. Last week, however, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson tweeted--without evidence--that "it might be the US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan," raising concerns that the Chinese government may be seeking to misleadingly depict the virus as originating outside China, for political gain."We should all be vigilant against anti-Chinese bias in speaking about and reporting on COVID-19, but that is not what happened in this case," said PEN America's Nossel. "Merely noting that the coronavirus originated in China is neither controversial or defamatory. The Chinese government is attempting to smear Vargas Llosa with this accusation in order to delegitimize his valid political criticism, in yet another example of the government's many attempts to silence critics beyond its borders. And removing his books from online booksellers is a deplorable form of retaliatory censorship. Vargas Llosa has ever right to speak his mind, and the Chinese people have every right to read his words. Now more than ever we must guard against such attempts to silence those who speak out, wherever they may be."Last month, PEN America released a statement on the case of detained citizen journalist Chen Qiushi, indicating its concern that authorities had placed the reporter in "quarantine" as a pretext to silence his independent reporting. PEN America's previous advocacy on the issue of censorship within China includes its 2018 report Forbidden Feeds: Government Controls on Social Media in China, in which it noted 80 different cases of social media commentators who had been targeted for their free expression, including on health and public safety issues.* * *PEN America stands at the intersection of literature and human rights to protect open expression in the United States and worldwide. We champion the freedom to write, recognizing the power of the word to transform the world. Our mission is to unite writers and their allies to celebrate creative expression and defend the liberties that make it possible.[Category: Government/Public Administration]Contact: Stephen Fee, director of communications, 202/309-8892, sfee@pen.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7058843 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: March 18, 2020End of Document

Dorsey & Whitney Expands "China Initiative" Task Force; Multi-disciplinary team helps navigate enforcement environmentBusiness WireMarch 2, 2020 Monday 8:08 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Business Wire, Inc.Length: 742 wordsDateline: NEW YORK BodyInternational law firm Dorsey & Whitney LLP announced today that it has expanded its "China Initiative" Task Force to provide bilingual legal assistance to research institutions, their faculty members and other clients in navigating the U.S. government's enforcement actions under the "China Initiative."The Department of Justice's "China Initiative" prioritizes U.S. government enforcement actions against Chinese companies and persons doing business in the U.S. or partnering with U.S. companies and universities, as well as individual researchers and scientists with ties to China. The focus of this DOJ initiative includes:• Investigate and prosecute Chinese persons for trade secret theft cases.• Target individuals, universities, and companies for transferring technology to the Chinese government and institutions.• Engage U.S. colleges and universities in identifying and monitoring persons and companies with ties to Chinese companies and the Chinese government.• Aggressively use existing authorities, including the False Claims Act, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Foreign Agent Registration Act, Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, NIH and DOD grant rules, university ethics rules and conflicts of interest policy, and export control laws, to target companies and persons seeking to obtain U.S. companies' intellectual property and technology.Dorsey's U.S.-China Practice Group has deep experience and longstanding involvement with China-related legal issues. The expanded "China Initiative" Task Force at Dorsey is a bilingual, multi-disciplinary team of highly-skilled attorneys from the U.S.-China Practice Group and attorneys who formerly worked at U.S. government enforcement agencies. Our representations include U.S. academic research institutions and organizations, individual faculty members, and corporations. Dorsey's "China Initiative" Task Force will help organizations and individuals successfully navigate the increased risks posed by the DOJ's China Initiative.Dorsey Partner Catherine Pan, who co-chairs the Firm's U.S.-China Practice Group and is a leading member of the "China Initiative" Task Force, stated, "We help clients with four key components of the 'China Initiative': (1) internal investigations; (2) government enforcement actions; (3) federal grant regulations and related disclosure requirements; and (4) conflicts interest disclosure and compliance. Our Task Force is able to deliver around-the-clock, seamless legal services to our clients with cross-border legal needs.""Recent charges against university researchers who were involved in the Chinese 'Thousand Talents' (????) and 'Chang Jiang Scholar' (????) programs signal the further escalation of the China Initiative by the DOJ and FBI. Research institutions and faculty members who have received federal grants (including NIH, DOD and other grants) need to carefully review the bio sketches and 'other support' information they provided to the grant making agencies to check whether the disclosure guidelines are strictly complied with," added Catherine Pan.Partner Alex Hontos, another key member of the Dorsey "China Initiative" Task Force and a former DOJ trial attorney, said, "Whether you agree with the policy arguments behind the 'China Initiative' or not, this is the reality we live in."Dorsey's China Initiative Task Force has been handling "China Initiative" cases on behalf of universities, hospitals, scientists and faculty members, including some of the high profile cases reported in the media. Dorsey's deep understanding of China and the Chinese language capability of the expanded task force is critical to properly handling these cases.To learn more about Dorsey's "China Initiative" Task Force click here .About Dorsey & Whitney LLPClients have relied on Dorsey since 1912 as a valued business partner.

Despite COVID-19 and Financial Hits, Survey of US Companies Finds China Remains a Key PriorityPR NewswireMarch 11, 2020 Wednesday 10:59 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1336 wordsDateline: BEIJING, March 11, 2020 BodyPR NewswireInvestment environment improves, amid slowing growth, and epidemic upheaval Profitability drops to lowest level in two decades China remains a top long-term priority for most US companies, according to a new survey released today by the American Chamber of Commerce in China ("AmCham China"), despite slowing growth, wider US-China tensions, longstanding business challenges in the country, and the COVID-19 outbreak. Subsequent to the annual survey, the COVID-19 outbreak has recently been reflected in an AmCham China Flash Survey, and near-term additional Flash Surveys on the subject will continue to track member sentiment on this important challenge to both human health and commerce.  The Chamber's annual Business Climate Survey (BCS) Report said that many American companies in China continue to be profitable, although China's slowing GDP is reflected by the fact that 21% of surveyed members saw a drop in revenue in 2019, compared with only 7% in 2017. Additionally, the proportion of members describing their financial performance as "profitable" has dropped from 73% in 2017 to 61% in 2019 - the lowest percentage to report profitability in almost two decades.This is the 22nd consecutive year that AmCham China has surveyed its members on China's business climate, with the results providing invaluable insight into the longer-term trajectory of China's corporate environment. The uncertain and developing nature of the COVID-19 epidemic is causing member companies to reassess their outlook and priorities for the year, as detailed in the Chamber's flash survey from last month. The BCS results contain input from roughly half the Chamber's members and further elaborate on the progress of regulatory developments, such as intellectual property and cybersecurity, while continuing to track how nearly two years of US-China trade tensions have impacted member companies.Although improvements have been made to wrestle with longstanding operational and regulatory challenges, a growing number of companies expressed a pessimistic outlook, as bilateral US-China tensions remained a major source of uncertainty, despite the enactment of China's Foreign Investment Law and before the signing of the Phase One trade deal earlier this year. Furthermore, the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak remains unknown and is not reflected in these results."The fight against COVID-19, ongoing bilateral negotiations, and a slowing Chinese economy make for challenging business conditions," said AmCham China Chairman Greg Gilligan. "Foreign businesses will have to be versatile and resilient, and keep long-term plans in mind. But the market panic of COVID-19 will eventually subside, and 2020 will be a critical year for businesses and policy makers with significant impact on the trajectory of US-China relations. It is our hope that our survey's results will spark open and candid dialogue between both countries as we continue to advocate for a fair and open business environment and new momentum to drive economic reform measures that will benefit American company investments here as well as the broader Chinese economy."Stagnating economic growth and continued uncertainty in US-China relations were also cited as key reasons behind a growing number of companies saying they have a pessimistic outlook toward their industries' market growth and China investment plans. Nearly one-in-four companies - and over 40% in the R&I sector - do not expect their markets to grow in 2020. In contrast, the Consumer and Services sectors displayed greater optimism in their outlook on market growth, due to anticipated growth in the number of middle-income households. Some 37% of members, the largest proportion since 2013, say they are delaying additional investments in 2020, or are even looking to reduce their investment footprint. Nearly one-third of members report bilateral uncertainties as a key reason for doing so.But despite financial setbacks and growing caution when it comes to investment, China remains a top priority for most member companies. A combination of concrete actions taken in 2019 coupled with reforms in the financial services sector have boosted members' confidence in the Chinese government's commitment to further open its market to foreign investment. Furthermore, a higher proportion of foreign businesses say they felt more welcome in China in 2019, despite ongoing turbulence in the bilateral relationship. Some 63% of members believe that foreign companies in their industry are treated equally or preferentially in comparison with local companies. However, more than half of the respondents from the Technology sector, a sector in which American companies should be highly competitive, say they are treated unfairly. Despite efforts by the Chinese government in 2019 to open its markets, market access barriers remain in particular industries. More than half of our members say they would increase investment in China if markets were to open on a par with the US.The Phase One trade deal had not yet been signed at the time of the survey and none of our members reported that they were anticipating the need to cope with the impact of a major epidemic like COVID-19. Businesses will likely experience a significant shock from the impact of COVID-19, but early communications indicate that member companies remain committed to the China market. However, the challenges and hopes reflected in the survey remain salient for both policymakers and business executives as they adjust their 2020 strategies.Members emphasize that the US government can be most supportive of American business in China by continuing to advocate for a level playing field, prioritizing a "results-oriented framework for regularized government-to-government communication" and reducing tariffs on goods exported from China. Meanwhile, members said they would be most likely to increase investment in China if the Chinese government were to increase the transparency, predictability and fairness of the regulatory environment; ensure greater protection of IP; and limit the use of industrial policies that tilt the playing field in favor of domestic companies, especially state-owned enterprises.The survey was conducted in late 2019. It was sent to 771 AmCham China member company representatives, of which 372 completed the majority of the questions. The survey also found:69% of members agree that China's enforcement of IPR has improved in the last five years, an increase of 10 percentage points from 2018. Over half of respondents say they have been required to establish Party cells within their company, although only 7% report a negative impact from having to do so. 50% of members said that the investment environment in China had improved in 2019, compared with 38% in 2018. Only 14% of respondents had an optimistic attitude for 2020 in light of US-China relations, up slightly from 11% the year before. Nearly one-fifth of respondents have moved, or are considering moving, their capacity outside of China, a proportion which has slowly decreased over the past three years.About AmCham ChinaThe American Chamber of Commerce in the People's Republic of China (AmCham China) is a non-profit, non-governmental organization whose membership comprises 4,000 individuals from 900 companies operating across China. The Chamber's nationwide mission is to help American companies succeed in China through advocacy, information, networking, and business support services.

YouTube has been auto-deleting comments about China's government-sponsored hacker army, but says it is 'an error in our enforcement systems' (GOOGL, GOOG)Business Insider USMay 26, 2020 Tuesday 04:36 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Insider Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 503 wordsByline: feedback@businessinsider.com,  (Ben Gilbert)Highlight: YouTube reps acknowledged the deletions and said it was due to an error in the automated systems it uses to moderate the video service.BodyStephane Cardinale - Corbis/Corbis via Getty• YouTube has been deleting comments on videos with the phrases "共匪" ("Communist Bandit") or "五毛" ("50 Cent Party") - terms that are associated with criticism of the Chinese government.• The phrases are derogatory in nature, and the latter is a more recent invention that specifically refers to internet users who are paid by the Chinese government to spread propaganda. • Comments that contain either, or both, phrases on YouTube videos are deleted nearly instantly. Business Insider was able to replicate it, with our comments deleted in less than 25 seconds.• YouTube acknowledged the deletions on Tuesday, and said it was a mistake. "This appears to be an error in our enforcement systems and we are investigating," YouTube spokesperson Ivy Choi said in an email response.• Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.YouTube has been deleting comments that contain two phrases that are directly tied to criticism of the Chinese government.Using the phrases "共匪" ("Communist Bandit") or "五毛" ("50 Cent Party") triggers comments to be automatically deleted, regardless of the words around them, in under 30 seconds. The former is a term that goes back decades, while the latter is a more recent creation that's used pejoratively to refer to people who are paid by the Chinese government to spread propaganda online.If either phrase appears in a YouTube comment with Simplified Chinese characters, the comment is swiftly deleted - we were able to replicate as much repeatedly.YouTubeThese deletions were a mistake, YouTube representative Ivy Choi said in a statement to Business Insider. "This appears to be an error in our enforcement systems and we are investigating," she said. Specifically, the error is said to be related to YouTube's greater than usual reliance on automated moderation systems as employees work from home during the ongoing pandemic.Senator Ted Cruz highlighted the issue in tweet on Tuesday morning. "This is very disturbing. Why is Google/YouTube censoring Americans on behalf of the CCP?" he said, a reference to the Chinese Communist Party. "DOJ needs to stop this NOW."Notably, comments with either phrase transliterated into English characters don't get flagged for moderation. Similarly, there are plenty of videos on YouTube with the English version of "五毛" - "wu mao" - as the video title.YouTube isn't available in China, and both Google and YouTube have a long history of attempting - and failing - to bring their services to the region. NOW WATCH: What makes 'Parasite' so shocking is the twist that happens in a 10-minute sequenceSee Also:• Google is launching a new app that lets you do almost anything on your Android phone with just the press of a button• Google is making it easier to see wheelchair accessible places in Google Maps• How to change your business address on Google Maps using Google My BusinessSEE ALSO: YouTube warns more videos than usual could be removed as content moderation is automated amid coronavirus outbreakLoad-Date: May 26, 2020End of Document

Trump says blame China. His supporters are listening.Politico.comMay 3, 2020 Sunday 11:00 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1551 wordsHighlight: At rallies, one protester yelled, "Go to China." In state legislatures, anti-China bills are being proposed. On conservative radio, callers want to punish China over the coronavirus.BodyThe strategy to blame China for the coronavirus outbreak began weeks ago in Washington, D.C. Now it's spread to the rest of the country.In Wisconsin, a state senator introduced a bill criticizing "the negligence and hostile actions" of the Chinese government. In Virginia, a conservative talk radio host debated ways the Trump administration could punish China for inflicting a pandemic on the world. And in Colorado, an activist protesting stay-at-home orders confronted a health care worker on a busy street. "Go to China if you want communism!" she yelled. "Go to China."President Donald Trump's decision to focus his coronavirus anger on China, America's top economic rival, is part of a pivot for Trump's reelection team as it scrambles to revise a campaign message that had been focused on financial prosperity. Now, with the economy in a coronavirus-induced coma, Trump's team is working to instead make the 2020 race a referendum on who will be tougher on China - Trump or Joe Biden. In recent days, Trump's campaign has even dubbed the president's likely Democrat opponent "Beijing Biden."The message appears to be resonating. John Fredericks, the Virginia talk radio host and Trump supporter, said his callers, many out of work in rural areas, trust Trump to retaliate against China."My callers know what China has done," he said. "There's blood on their hands."But while Republican pollster Frank Luntz predicted China will be the biggest issue in the presidential campaign, second only to the coronavirus itself, he said it's not clear the issue will benefit Trump."The question pollsters can't answer right now is whether this helps Trump or Biden," Luntz said "More precisely, both candidates will be criticized for past and current comments they've made. It's not clear which candidate will be hurt more by China."Indeed, both the Trump and Biden camps seem to think they have a winning hand on China.Polls conducted for the Trump campaign and Republican senators show China will be an effective issue for Republicans in November, according to three people who have seen the numbers, leading the GOP to buy a flurry of TV and Facebook ads, dash off emails to supporters and increase their tough rhetoric."Unlike Sleepy Joe Biden and the rest of the Crooked Democrats, President Trump keeps his promises, which is why we're not letting China get away with using America as a scapegoat," one Trump campaign Facebook ad read.But Biden and the Democrats, too, think focusing on China will lift their chances in November. They're criticizing Trump for initially praising the country's response to the pandemic and accusing him of caring more about his trade deal with China than American lives. The Democratic group American Bridge just launched an ad accusing Trump of trusting China.Both candidates also have perceived weaknesses on the issue.Biden last year appeared to downplay China as a geopolitical competitor and is fighting claims that the business partners of his son, Hunter, landed a $1.5 billion deal days after they traveled to China on official business when he was vice president, even though there's no direct evidence of impropriety.For his part, Trump has wavered repeatedly on China's culpability for the pandemic. He initially praised the country and its leader, President Xi Jinping, more than a dozen times in the early days of the outbreak, often stressing the recent trade deal the two countries had signed. Trump later reversed course, though, and started excoriating the country for its handling of the virus. The pivot came as Trump faced criticism that he initially downplayed the outbreak and failed to quickly produce and ship tests and medical supplies to states. America has now passed 1 million coronavirus cases, with more than 60,000 people dying from the disease."He understands his presidency rises and falls on the very pandemic he denied was a pandemic and he is desperate to try to counteract the narrative that has set in that he wasn't up to the job," said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), who cited coronavirus when he endorsed Biden last month. "That's a devastating critique. You don't get re-elected with that narrative."In response, Trump has touted the narrative that China, not him, is at fault. It's a message that plays into American's current feelings about China. About two-thirds of the country has an unfavorable view of China, the highest number in 15 years, according to a poll by Pew Research Center. That figure is also up nearly 20 percentage points since Trump was inaugurated in 2017."The desire for China to be held accountable for the spread of Covid-19 is no longer limited to Trump supporters," said Brian Swenson, a Republican strategist in Florida who worked for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), referencing the disease that results from the coronavirus. "There is a growing bipartisan call at the local level for China to be held accountable for their lack of transparency with the world community, their spreading of propaganda and misinformation and for failing to diminish the spread of Covid-19."Kyle Hupfer, chairman of the Republican party in the red state of Indiana, said residents expect Trump to get to the bottom of the pandemic. "There's certainly a level of distrust related to what China has done and how they're approached this," he said.In recent weeks, Trump has tried to take advantage of those growing feelings of animosity - nicknaming the virus the "Chinese virus," accusing China of lying about its number of cases and boasting he contained the outbreak by restricting travel from China in January, even though many public health experts say the ban merely bought the U.S. time that Trump did not use to prepare adequately.This week, Trump said his administration was investigating whether China covered up what it knew about the early spread of coronavirus. His aides are discussing ways to penalize the country."We are not happy with China," Trump told reporters Monday. "We are not happy with that whole situation because we believe it could have been stopped at the source, it could have been stopped quickly, and it wouldn't have spread all over the world. And we think that should have happened."Peter Navarro, Trump's economic adviser, has pushed the president to reduce the government's dependency on imports from China when it comes to medical supplies and drugs. Trump supporters around the country have latched onto Navarro's efforts."To make America great again, we need to be dependent on ourselves," said Ralph King, a Trump supporter in Bedford, Ohio, who co-founded the conservative group Main Street Patriots. "We should not be dependent on other countries."Trump's allies say going after China is a particularly compelling issue for the president because he constantly criticized Beijing while on the campaign trail in 2016, accusing the country of taking U.S. jobs, spying on U.S. businesses and stealing U.S. technology. "He should stay on the message he has had for many years," said a Republican who speaks to Trump.So far, Trump's surrogates and aides have stayed on that message, talking about China daily in online campaign events. America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC, released a new TV ad attacking Biden on China Friday in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. In the coming weeks, Trump's campaign is expected to launch a similar ad blitz."Our internal data shows that Joe Biden's softness on China is a major vulnerability, among many," said Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh, though he declined to release the polling numbers.There are growing signs Trump's strategy is working.Last week, Missouri became the first state to sue the Chinese government for its role in the pandemic, accusing it of failing to warn other nations of the virus and allowing people to travel outside the country, among other things. Mississippi followed with its own suit.Legislators in other states are considering their own actions while some conservative activists protesting stay-at-home orders are mentioning China. Some Republican senators, including Rubio, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, have pushed for additional actions to hit China. Rubio wants to halt China's hold on the pharmaceutical supply chain. Hawley wants to prove the virus started in Wuhan, China. And Cotton wants to ensure Americans can sue Chinese officials for the pandemic.Senate Republican strategists also recently distributed a memo advising GOP candidates to focus on China and blame the country for covering up the virus, accuse Democrats of being "soft on China" and stress that Republicans will push to sanction Beijing. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis is encouraging medical companies to stop doing business with China and has explored divesting the state's interests out of China. He wants everyone to know he's tough on China - just like Trump."I have not forgotten about China," DeSantis told reporters recently. "In fact, some of you guys may want to look this up, but there was a Chinese Communist Party think tank that did a report in February, and they analyzed the governors in the United States - who was hardline, who was friendly and who was unknown. There were five governors that were hardline against China. Where do you think I was?"Arek Sarkissian contributed to this report.Load-Date: May 5, 2020End of Document

EU Let China Censor Ambassador's Op-Ed By Removing Reference To Coronavirus Originating In ChinaThe Daily CallerMay 6, 2020 Wednesday 11:17 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Daily Caller, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: DAILY-CALLER-NEWS-FOUNDATION; politicsLength: 588 wordsByline: Peter Hasson, Editor, phasson@dailycallernewsfoundation.orgPeter Hasson is the investigative editor at the Daily Caller News Foundation and the author of "The Manipulators: Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Big Tech's War on Conservatives"Author ImageBodyLink to ImageThe European Union allowed the Chinese government to censor part of an op-ed by the EU ambassador to China that was published in a state newspaper, China Daily.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) insisted on censoring an op-ed by the EU ambassador to China to remove a reference to COVID-19 originating in China, an EU spokesman said Wednesday, adding that the EU acquiesced to the censorship rather than withdrawing the op-ed.The EU's ambassador to China and the ambassadors of the 27 EU member states co-authored a China Daily op-ed touting the EU's relationship to China.The original version of the op-ed, which was published on the EU's website, shows that the offending passage read “the outbreak of the coronavirus in China, and its subsequent spread to the rest of the world,” before it was removed.“The EU Delegation to China was informed that the publication could only take place with the agreement of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs,” an EU spokesman told BuzzFeed. (RELATED: Elite American Institutions Keep Bowing To Communist China... Over And Over Again)The EU delegation “made known its concerns” but still proceeded with the op-ed because they “considered it important to communicate very important messages on EU policy priorities, notably on climate change and sustainability, human rights, multilateralism and the global response to Coronavirus,” the spokesman added. Confirmed - EU/EU27 op-ed in China Daily had references to the origins of the coronavirus removed by China's MFA. EU/27 knew ahead of publication. Unedited copy has been published on EU and some member states' websites - EU Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy: pic.twitter.com/VMVUn7qgAY - Alberto Nardelli (@AlbertoNardelli)            May 6, 2020 What's amazing about this statement is the EU is confirming they were told to censor their op-ed by the Chinese government, they objected, but then folded and let the censorship go ahead anyway. Horrendous. https://t.co/dZxL6LPBEc - Josh Rogin (@joshrogin)            May 6, 2020The censorship of the China Daily op-ed isn't the first time that the EU has apparently let China control the coronavirus narrative.The EU reportedly watered down a report on coronavirus disinformation following pressure from China last month. The EU reportedly nixed a reference to China's “global disinformation campaign” from the report following the pressure from Chinese authorities.China has waged an aggressive propaganda campaign meant to            absolve itself from blame for the coronavirus pandemic.A majority of the 17 agencies that make up the U.S. intelligence community believe that the novel coronavirus accidentally leaked from laboratory in Wuhan, China, a senior intelligence official previously told the Daily Caller News Foundation.China meanwhile has shut out other countries and the China-aligned World Health Organization from its investigation into coronavirus's origins. China's stonewalling on the investigation appears likely to continue.China's ambassador to the United Nations said the communist nation won't allow international experts to investigate the virus's origins until after China has secured the “final victory” over COVID-19, the South China Morning Post reported Wednesday.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

China to Expel Reporters from The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington PostTheStreet.comMarch 17, 2020 Tuesday 2:45 PM EDTCopyright 2020 TheStreet.com, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 392 wordsByline: Rob LenihanHighlight: China says it will expel reporters from three major American newspapers.BodyChina said Tuesday it will expel reporters from three major American newspapers in retaliation for the U.S. slashing the staff size of Chinese media outlets, The Wall Street Journal reported.Reporters for The New York Times, the Journal and The Washington Post, whose press credentials expire in 2020, will have 10 days to surrender their press cards. They will no longer be allowed to work in mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau.The government statement referred to the U.S. slashing the staff size of Chinese media outlets in the U.S., "which is expulsion in all but name."In addition, Voice of America, the Times, the Journal, the Post and Time Magazine must provide information about "their staff, finance, operation and real estate in China." This was in response to the U.S. designation of five Chinese media agencies as "foreign missions" the statement said."In response to the discriminatory restrictions the U.S. has imposed on Chinese journalists with regard to visa, administrative review and reporting, China will take reciprocal measures against American journalists," China's Ministry of Affairs said in a statement.In February, the U.S. State Department told China that five news agencies - Xinhua, CGTN, China Radio, China Daily and The People's Daily - would be officially treated as foreign government functionaries, subject to similar rules as diplomats stationed in the United States. Administration officials charged the reporters at these agencies were really government operatives.The State Department also announced that it would limit to 100 the number of Chinese citizens working for the five state-controlled Chinese news organizations.China demanded that the Journal apologize for a Feb. 3 opinion article headlined "China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia," which criticized the Chinese government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. A short time later, China said it would expel three of the Journal's staff members."The Chinese government's decision is particularly regrettable because it comes in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis, when clear and reliable information about the international response to Covid-19 is essential," Martin Baron, the executive editor of The Washington Post said in a statement. "Severely limiting the flow of that information, which China now seeks to do, only aggravates the situation."Load-Date: March 17, 2020End of Document

Coronavirus unites a divided China in fear, grief and anger at governmentThe Conversation - United StatesMarch 2, 2020 Monday 12:21 PM ESTCopyright 2020 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights ReservedLength: 1223 wordsByline: Yuqi Na, Course Instructor , Fordham UniversityHighlight: Public criticism of the Chinese government's handling of coronavirus shows that the Chinese people can overcome both strict censorship and a gaping class divide when they get angry enough.BodyThe coronavirus known as COVID-19 has killed more than 3,000 people and spread into Europe and Latin America, raising fears of a global pandemic. But in China, where the outbreak began, it took just one death to unleash the grief and fury of a nation. On Feb. 7, 34-year-old Dr. Li Wenliang - one of eight whistle-blowers who first sounded alarms about the new coronavirus in Hubei Province back in December - died from coronavirus. Public vigils were held across the country. Chinese people angry over the government's handling of the public health emergency also went online en masse and placed blame for Li's death squarely at the government's feet. Using text, songs, pictures and symbolic imagery to evade censors, they asserted that the Chinese government had both covered up the coronavirus outbreak and downplayed the seriousness of the disease, causing avoidable deaths. A song from the musical "Les Misérables," "Do you hear the people sing?," made the rounds on social media. One lyric celebrates "the music of the people/Who will not be slaves again!" - a refrain of resistance that recalls the Chinese national anthem, "Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves!"  One civil rights activist even published an open letter asking President Xi Jinping to resign. This brief blossoming of free speech ended quickly. Within several days of Li's death, the hashtag #IWantFreedomOfSpeech - which had gone viral on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter - was deleted. Zhiyong Xu, the activist who demanded Xi's resignation, was arrested.   State control versus popular angerWhile short-lived, the popular anger over coronavirus was a significant development in China. Such open dissent would have been unimaginable just a few months ago. Chinese media and the internet have developed along two separate but ultimately repressive paths, my doctoral research on the political economy of the Chinese internet shows. But the government normally maintains strong authority over both. Online news media, which emerged in the 1990s in China, was immediately integrated into the traditional state media system and strictly controlled. According to Reporters Without Borders,            China ranks 177 out of 180 countries in press freedom. For-profit businesses have more freedom to operate on the internet as a means to boost China's economy - as long as their business operations don't challenge authority. As a result, Chinese social media platforms like WeChat and Weibo are vibrant and well used, but they are dominated by entertainment, gossip and other sensational content - not political speech. During the height of coronavirus fury, the government lost control of both realms of the Chinese internet. On social media, celebrity gossip gave way to discussions of public affairs, social issues and politics. Comments critical of the government, normally deleted quickly, were widely circulated.China's most daring investigative journalists joined the fray. The day after Dr. Li's death, on Feb. 8, Yicai Magazine published a timeline showing the spread of the coronavirus in an article titled, "If there was a possibility to sound the alarm on Wuhan, which day would it be?" Other            outlets published investigative stories about government disinformation, corruption within aid groups and the scarcity of medical supplies.A gaping class divideThe public outcry over coronavirus was also unprecedented because in a society that has long been deeply divided, it united Chinese across classes and geography.Ever since China "opened up" its socialist economy in 1978, partially liberalizing markets and reducing the state's oversight over all economic activity, gross domestic product            has grown by around 10% annually. More than 850 million Chinese people were lifted out of poverty.But surging growth has brought roaring income inequality - among the world's worst. Chinese society is hugely divided between            rural and urban areas, with urban households earning on average more than three times as much as rural households,            according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. China's inequality is geographic, too. While privileged elite and middle classes in coastal cities have access to top-notch education systems, health care and infrastructure, inland residents frequently lack access to these services. Rural unemployment is high. Internet access is among China's unevenly distributed services. According to the 2019 report from the China Internet Network Information Center, 61% of Chinese people can get online at home or on a mobile device, whereas            Northern Europe has the highest online penetration rate of 95% and Western Europe 92%. The internet has proven to be a powerful tool for China's "have-less" and "have-nots" to connect with each other and with job opportunities. Unlike in other countries where online activism has triggered mass protests, the internet has not historically enabled Chinese people to come together across economic and social divides to protest their government. Most social movements in China - both online and offline - gain traction only within similar groups whose interests are clearly aligned. Environmental protests against the construction of chemical plants in the cities of Xiamen and            Dalian in 2007 and 2011, for example, drew students and urbanites. Labor protests for better pay, working conditions and the            right to unionize in 2018 were confined to China's working classes. Class solidarityCoronavirus is different: The threat is universal.The outbreak affects Chinese across classes and threatens different interest groups within classes. Quarantines of entire villages and communities, sealed off as the government tries to control the outbreak of the virus, impact the lives of every single resident. Nor are rural areas exempt from coronavirus. The Chinese migrant workers who live in the outskirts of cities were headed back to their rural hometowns en masse when the virus hit during the Chinese New Year - the largest annual human migration in the world, called "Chunyun." Some of them brought coronavirus with them to places where the            lack of medical resources is            severe. Economically, coronavirus hurts a wide swath of Chinese society, too. With factories and offices shuttered, both white-collar and blue-collar workers are facing            potential layoffs or delayed return to work, depriving them of income. Street vendors, shops and            service industries are all hit hard. Between the seriousness of the virus and the mass pause of all Chinese society, everyone seems to be questioning systemic problems long disguised or ignored in the Communist Party's discourse of stability, nationalism and economic development. The lack of government transparency, a censored press, inequality and the shortage of medical resources are longstanding problems in China. Coronavirus brought them to the fore, and, if only for a brief moment, the Chinese people demanded better. [Deep knowledge, daily.Sign up for The Conversation's newsletter.]Yuqi Na does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.Load-Date: March 2, 2020End of Document

The letter was addressed to deputies of China's National People's Congress and called out the country for its lack of a modern constitution and for its stifling of social freedoms, highlighted by the pandemic.In his letter, seen by SCMP, Zhang said that the handling of the coronavirus pandemic was emblematic of deep-rooted issues within the country's leadership. "The outbreak and spread of the Covid-19 epidemic is a good illustration of the problem," he wrote. "Since January 3, 2020, the [Chinese] foreign ministry had been regularly notifying the US government about the epidemic, but the disease control department was not notifying the people of [China] at the same time. Such an irresponsible attitude towards their people's safety is rare," he continued.Xinhua/Shen Bohan via Getty Images"There were few independent professional media to investigate and report on the outbreak, nor did medical professionals provide independent advice to the public ... It only shows that the government's long-term tight control of society and people has almost completely destroyed the organization and self-help capabilities of Chinese society."Zhang also admonished China's treatment of Li Wenliang, a doctor and coronavirus whistleblower who tried to warn his colleagues about a potential coronavirus outbreak in December. Li was forced by Chinese authorities to sign a letter acknowledging that he was "making false comments"; he later died from the coronavirus."Twenty-two days before [the country's first major lockdown] in the city, Wuhan was still investigating and punishing citizens who had disclosed the epidemic, including Dr. Li Wenliang ... showing how tight and arbitrary the government's suppression of society is," Zhang said. Zhang acknowledged that his letter would spark controversy, but encouraged others to speak out. "The best way to fight for freedom of expression is for everyone to speak as if we already have freedom of speech," he wrote in his WeChat post alongside his letter. According to SCMP, Zhang was removed from his teaching position at East China University of Political Science and Law in 2013 because of critical statements he made about the Chinese constitution. SCMP said calls to Zhang's mobile phone and messages sent to his WeChat account went unanswered on Monday.China is known for censoring criticism of its policies, and dissenters have            been jailed or disappeared after making complaints. Chinese government censors            are working in overdrive to protect the party narrative its been drilling down on the country's response to the novel coronavirus, which originated in the city of Wuhan before spreading worldwide. Last week, The New York Times reported that the Chinese government was silencing coronavirus survivors who want answers on what went wrong with the country's early coronavirus response.The international community has also increased pressure on China for an independent investigation into the origins of the virus, as well as the country's response to the outbreak early on. The European Commission,            Sweden,            Australia, and others have been calling on China for more transparency in recent weeks. NOW WATCH: Inside London during COVID-19 lockdownSee Also:• Pennsylvania governor warns liquor licenses could be taken away from restaurants that open up early in defiance of his stay-at-home order• Avianca, one of Latin America's largest airlines, files for bankruptcy• Wuhan reported its first new coronavirus case in more than a monthLoad-Date: May 12, 2020End of Document

Trump's Social Media Order Accuses Companies of Partnering With ChinaNewsweek.comMay 28, 2020 Thursday 1:37 PM ESTCopyright © 2020 Newsweek Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 606 wordsByline: Elizabeth CrispHighlight: President Donald Trump cided work with the Chinese government in justifying his new executive order on social media platforms, according to a draft.BodyPresident Donald Trump's executive order on social media platforms accuses the tech giants of working too closely with the Chinese government as part of the administration's justification for new restrictions, according to a reported leaked draft copy of the order."At the same time social media platforms are invoking inconsistent, irrational and groundless justifications to censor or otherwise punish Americans' speech here at home, several online platforms are profiting from and promoting the aggression and disinformation spread by foreign governments like China," according to the draft order, first posted by conservative news outlet The National Post ahead of the White House release of the order Thursday.The White House didn't immediately provide more information and could not confirm the authenticity of the document in response to a request from Newsweek.Trump has taken aim at social media giants this week after Twitter, his favored mode of direct communciation to the masses, attached a "fact check" link to two of his tweets alleging vote-by-mail plans would lead to voter fraud in this fall's election. Historically, there has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud from mail-in ballots."Twitter has now shown that everything we have been saying about them (and their other compatriots) is correct. Big action to follow!" Trump tweeted Wednesday.The executive order, based on the draft version posted by The National Pulse and subject to change until it is signed, specifically calls out Google for working with the Chinese Communist Party to create a search engine and tracking users for surveillance."Google has also established research partnerships in China that provide direct benefits to the Chinese military," the draft order reads.It also accuses Facebook and Twitter of "accepting advertisements paid for by the Chinese government that spread false information about China's mass imprisonment of religious minorities.""Twitter has also amplified China's propaganda abroad, by allowing Chinese government officials to use its platform to undermine pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong," it said.Google, Twitter and Facebook didn't immediately respond to requests from Newsweek for comment.Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, posting to the social media site Wednesday night, defended the site's decision to label Trump's tweets."We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make," he wrote. "This does not make us an 'arbiter of truth.' Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves."The order's inclusion of activities with China comes amid escalating tensions between the United States and Beijing, in particular over the handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak and China's treatment of Hong Kong.The Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment from Newsweek about the inclusion of China as a justification behind the executive order.Based on the draft copy, the order in effect directs the Secretary of Commerce to launch an effort through the Federal Communications Commission to craft new rules clarifying when platforms violate the immunity protections they receive under the Communications Decency Act—crossing the line from platform to the publisher.Further, it seeks to ban federal spending on advertising with platforms that violate the "free speech principles" outlined in the order. It also outlines an effort to review "unfair or deceptive practices" by platforms and track bad actors.Link to ImageGraphic Chinese Communist PartyAFP Contributor/GettyThis picture taken on October 10, 2017 shows a party flag of the Chinese Communist Party displayed at an exhibition showcasing China's progress in the past five years at the Beijing Exhibition Center.Load-Date: May 29, 2020End of Document

"Noodles" and "Pandas": the secret code the Chinese use to talk about coronavirus on social mediaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMarch 7, 2020 SaturdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 710 wordsBodyChinese citizens, obfuscated by their government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, have devised some ingenious ways to express their outrage and avoid the extreme censorship measures imposed by Beijing. In an attempt to control the narrative, the authorities have censored sensitive issues, silenced WeChat's stories, located to those who share criticism of the government and disappeared journalists.It's just that China's government has been using the Internet to control history for its own benefit. According to a report released this week by researchers from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab entitled "Censored contagion: how coronavirus information is handled on Chinese social media," the Beijing government manipulates messages through censorship of keywords related to the topic on Chinese social media and platforms.The Livestreaming YY platform and the WeChat messaging service have been imposing pro-government censorship for months. And, he chose a set of keywords that could not be mentioned in his messages and stored them within the application itself. Canadian researchers reverse-engineered the application and found the full list, which includes Chinese characters for phrases such as "Wuhan's Unknown Pneumonia" and "Wuhan Seafood Market". As early as December 31, weeks before the Chinese government revealed the existence of the epidemic, censorship was underway.But all those efforts have not yet silenced people online, and angry citizens now rely on coded words and phrases to express their dissatisfaction, according to Amnesty International's research disseminated by VICE News.The research - conducted by Amnesty's Chinese publisher, who uses a pseudonym for fear of reprisals - shows that the most common example is "zf" which is short for the Chinese word "government." To refer to the police, the letters "jc" are used, while "guobao" (meaning "national treasure") or panda images are used to represent the national security office.Citizens of the Communist Party's Advertising Department instead use the "Ministry of Truth" from George Orwell's novel "1984."A man in a face mask cycles through tents blocked by barricades in Wuhan, the epicentre of the new coronavirus outbreak, Hubei Province, China, on March 5, 2020. (REUTERS) (STRINGER/)One of the ways Beijing has tried to stop the flow of information outside China is by cracking down on the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) as a way to circumvent its censorship system, known as the Great Firewall. So discussing this technology online has also become taboo. Instead, citizens have been talking about how to use technology by referring to "Vietnamese pho noodles" or "ladders."China's President Xi Jinping is one of the most censored issues on Chinese social media. A citizen Lab report this week showed that WeChat has increased censorship efforts in recent weeks by adding a series of words and phrases related to Xi Jinping to its blacklist.In an attempt to circumvent these restrictions, Chinese citizens have begun to refer to theirpresident as a "narrow-necked bottle" because the Chinese pronunciation of the phrase is similar to that of "Xi Jinping."But despite the dark nature of this reference, China's censors managed to pick it up when they deleted a question posted on Zhihu (the Chinese version of Quora) that asked "how to wash a narrow-necked bottle?"Consulted by Vice, researcher Mayda Cho explained that "to combat systematic censorship on the Internet, internet users in China have created a new vocabulary to discuss 'sensitive issues'. This language continues to evolve as the government constantly expands its list of banned terms online. Those who do not follow the trend could easily be confused."China's strict censorship of coronavirus-related content is primarily aimed at its own population, preventing panic and preventing citizens from pointing authorities at responsible.MORE ON THIS THEME:Russia and China are manipulating information about coronavirus on social media around the worldAs the coronavirus spread silently, a nursing home became the deadliest point in the USChina: a hotel collapsed where dozens of people were quarantined by coronavirusIn 2015, Bill Gates was already alerted to the risk of a global virusLoad-Date: March 8, 2020End of Document

China hits back at so-called coronavirus 'lies' by US politicians as war of words escalatesCNN WireMay 11, 2020 Monday 7:48 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 847 wordsDateline: (CNN) Body (CNN) --  China has struck back at what it calls "24 lies" by US politicians in the most sweeping and detailed rebuke yet of accusations over its handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak. An 11,000-word article posted on the Chinese Foreign Ministry's website on Saturday gave a point-by-point rebuttal of the 24 "preposterous allegations and lies" that it said were fabricated by US politicians and media outlets to "shift the blame to China for their inadequate response to Covid-19."The article was also carried Sunday by Xinhua, China's government-run news agency, and shared by its official account on Twitter.The lengthy refutation is the latest attempt by Beijing to defend its handling of the outbreak, as it comes under international scrutiny over its handling of the virus and faces mounting calls for an independent inquiry.In recent weeks, the US has doubled down on blaming China for the spread of the virus, accusing it of withholding important information -- especially in the critical early stages of the outbreak -- and questioning its death toll. US President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have also claimed, without providing evidence, that the virus originated from a lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak was first reported last December.Beijing has pushed back at the claims, accusing the Trump administration of deflecting blame for its own failure to contain the virus within the US and smearing China to bolster Trump's reelection chances.The article released over the weekend began with a prologue that invoked Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States."As Lincoln said, you can fool some of the people all the time and fool all the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time," it said.It then gave a breakdown of each claim, and cited a variety of media reports, scientific studies and World Health Organization statements to support its counterarguments.The article lashed out at claims tying the origin of the virus to China. "Being the first to report the virus does not mean that Wuhan is its origin. In fact, the origin is still not identified," it said, echoing a point that has been repeatedly stressed by Chinese officials and government-controlled media. It also refuted theories that the virus was created by a lab at the Wuhan Institute of Virology or was leaked from the lab in an accident. As the virus spreads across the world, Beijing has come under mounting international criticism for allegedly suppressing vital early information about the outbreak and downplaying its severity.The article attempted to deny accusations of China's initial cover-up and delayed release of information about the virus, offering a timeline to show the Chinese government's apparent "open, transparent and responsible" manner in providing "timely information" to the world.But the article did not mention the admission by the Wuhan mayor that his government did not disclose information on the coronavirus "in a timely fashion" during an interview with CCTV on January 27.The mayor, Zhou Xianwang, said at the time that under Chinese law on infectious diseases, the local government first needed to report the outbreak to national health authorities, and then get approval from the State Council before making an announcement.The article also rejected Western criticism against Beijing over the case of Li Wenliang, a Wuhan doctor who tried to sound the alarm on the outbreak in late December but was reprimanded and silenced by police for "spreading rumors." He died of the coronavirus in early February after contracting it from a patient, sparking a nationwide outpouring of grief and anger.The article said Li was not a "whistleblower," as he was widely referred to in Western media. Instead, it highlighted the fact that Li was a member of the Chinese Communist Party, and had received posthumous honors as a "national model healthcare worker in fighting Covid-19" and a "martyr.""Labeling Dr. Li Wenliang as an 'anti-establishment hero' or 'awakener' is very disrespectful to Dr. Li and his family. It is purely political manipulation with no sense of decency," the article said.To pacify public outrage following Li's death, the Chinese government has sought to paint Li as a model party member and doctor who dedicated his life to the fight of the coronavirus. It launched a weeks-long investigation into Li's case, which withdrew the reprimand against Li and blamed a local police officer for mishandling his case -- a result that drew criticism on Chinese social media.The article also hit back at criticism that Beijing has been spreading disinformation about Covid-19, saying China is "a victim of disinformation" from "US politicians, scholars and media outlets that are hostile to China."It did not mention Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian had publicly promoted an unfounded conspiracy theory in March that the virus might have been brought to China by the US military.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

CHINA INFLICTS EVER TIGHTER INFORMATION CONTROLS OVER TIBET, LONG OFF-LIMITS TO FOREIGN PRESSStates News ServiceMay 1, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 770 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:Chinese authorities in Tibet have further tightened controls over information flows in the region, arresting Tibetans last year for sharing news and opinions on social media and for contacting relatives living in exile, according to rights groups and other experts.Particular targets of censors and police were images of exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama shared on mobile phones and calls for the preservation of the Tibetan language, now under threat from government orders to establish Chinese as the main language of instruction in Tibetan schools.Cedric AlvianiEast Asia Bureau Chief of Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF) told RFA's Tibetan Service that freedom of expression in Tibetan areas of China, already heavily restricted, "has not improved due to the censorship and surveillance set up by the [ruling] Chinese Communist Party.""It is still extremely difficult and dangerous for Tibetans to investigate and smuggle information outside Tibet," he said, adding that Beijing's refusal to allow foreign journalists free access to Tibet has made it even harder for the outside world to assess conditions there.RSF ranked China 177th out of 180 countries in an annual global press freedom index earlier this month."It's much more dangerous [for Tibetans] to speak to foreign journalists or to overseas media like Radio Free Asia than it is for other Chinese people," said Sarah Cook, Senior Research Analyst for China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan for New York-based Human Rights Watch."People there are subject to heavier reprisals than in other parts of China," Cook said.Increasingly tight curbsInternational press freedom groups have highlighted China's increasingly tight curbs on media workers across the country ahead of World Press Freedom Day Sunday.Some of those sentenced to long prison terms last year in Tibetan areas had sought to draw attention to corrupt officials or environmental concerns, while others had simply voiced support for use of the Tibetan language or had shared images of the Dalai Lama, regarded by Chinese leaders as a dangerous separatist.On Dec. 6, 2019, Anya Sengdra, a resident of Kyangche township in Qinghai's Gade (in Chinese, Gande) county, was given a seven-year term after being arrested on charges of disturbing social order after he complained online about corrupt officials, illegal mining, and the hunting of protected wildlife.Meanwhile, Sonam Palden, a 22-year-old Tibetan monk, disappeared after being arrested on Sept. 19 in Sichuan's Ngaba (Aba) county after posting online comments criticizing Beijing's policies in the region, and a Tibetan man named Lhadar, 36, was detained in October in Tibet's Nagchu (Naqu) county and also vanished in custody."It is assumed he was arrested for 'leaking state secrets,'" a local source told RFA in an earlier report, citing a charge often used to stop the spread of news of protests against Beijing's rule in Tibetan areas or other information considered politically sensitive by authorities.And on Feb. 20, 2019, Tsering Dorje, a 45-year-old resident of Peleb village in the Tashi Dzom township of Shigatse's Dingri (Tingri) county in Tibet, was taken into custody only hours after speaking with his brother in exile about the importance of teaching the Tibetan language to their children.'Suspicious conversations'"In the free world, people exchange information [like this] on a routine daily basis," Karma ChoyingSecretary to the International Relations Department of Tibet's India-based exile government, the Central Tibetan Administrationtold RFA in a recent interview."[But] these types of conversations are observed suspiciously by the Chinese government," he said.China's restrictions on free speech and the sharing of information in Tibet violate China's own laws, said James Tager, Director for Free Expression Research and Policy for the writers' group PEN America."We should recall that China's own constitutional system guarantees freedom of speech and the press, and that the Constitution as well as the Regional Ethnic Autonomy Law contains significant protections for the rights of ethnic minorities within China," Tager said."So when the international community asks the Chinese government to guarantee press freedom and free speech, including for those who speak or write or report in the Tibetan language and on Tibetan concerns, we are not making a radical demand," he said."Instead, we are holding the Chinese government to its own words."Reported by RFA's Tibetan Service.

Chinese misinformation focuses on COVID-19, research saysCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 13, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 599 wordsBody(Bloomberg) -- An army of bot accounts linked to an alleged Chinese government-backed propaganda campaign is spreading social media misinformation about coronavirus and other issues, including an exiled businessman, according to a London-based researcher.The accounts have been used to promote content that attacks critics of the Chinese government and to spread conspiracy theories that blame the United States for the origin of the virus, according to Benjamin Strick, who specializes in analyzing information operations on social media websites.Between April 25 and May 3, Strick says he identified more than 1,000 Twitter accounts that were associated with China's disinformation effort, as well as more than 50 different pages on Facebook. He estimated that 300 or 400 new Twitter accounts joined the network every day, as part of the Chinese campaign."The network has evolved and continues to grow," Strick said, in an interview. "I think it's a state-backed Chinese campaign."Strick's work is the latest research suggesting that China has intensified the misinformation around coronavirus, to dilute its own guilt and blame others, although some have cast doubt on certain findings or suggested that they could warrant further investigation.In research published last week on the Bellingcat research website, Strick described the operation as a "well-structured information campaign" that worked in a coordinated manner "to skew the narrative around various topics and to drive established agendas."The operation has some of the same features as a network of 900 accounts that Twitter discovered in August last year and which the company identified as "a major state-backed information operation focused on the situation in Hong Kong", and operated from mainland China.Ben Nimmo, director of research at Graphika Inc., said the accounts identified by Strick appeared to be linked to a network known as "Spamouflage Dragon", which had been detected promoting attacks against Hong Kong protesters by using fake and hijacked accounts on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.In September 2019, a Graphika report described Spamouflague Dragon as "an active and prolific network of cross-platform political spam, but ultimately low-impact," whose actions "seemed designed to support the Chinese government and discredit its critics, both at home and abroad."'Completely unfounded'China's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that reports on a Chinese disinformation campaign were "completely unfounded.""China opposes misinformation," Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters at a regular briefing in Beijing. "As for Chinese officials who open accounts on Twitter and other social media platforms, the purpose is to communicate better with the world and introduce China's situation and policies. We want to strengthen communication and exchange with the outside world to improve our mutual understanding."A spokesperson for Twitter Inc. said in a statement that they were working to "proactively monitor" the platform to "identify attempts to manipulate the platform and mitigate them.""If we identify information campaigns in our service that we can reliably attribute to state-backed activity, whether domestic or foreign, we will disclose them," the spokesperson said.Facebook Inc. did not respond to a request for comment.Strick said that many of thethe accounts attacked Guo Wengui, an exiled Chinese businessman, now based in the United States, and a fierce critic of the Communist party government.Original Note:China's Disinformation Campaign Targets Virus, Researcher Says©2020 Bloomberg L.P.Load-Date: May 14, 2020End of Document

US RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS PANEL URGES SANCTIONS ON CHINA OVER VIOLATIONS IN XINJIANGStates News ServiceApril 28, 2020 TuesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1226 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:A U.S. bipartisan commission called on Tuesday for sanctions against entities deemed responsible for the persecution of Muslims in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) and for the country to be placed on a State Department blacklist of the world's worst abusers of religious freedoms.U.S. President Donald Trump's administration should "impose targeted sanctions on Chinese government agencies and officials responsible for severe violations of religious freedomparticularly Xinjiang Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo and former Political and Legal Affairs Commission Chief Zhu Hailun," the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) said in an annual report.Specifically, the report called for a freeze on the officials' assets and a bar on their entry into the United States "under human rights related financial and visa authorities, citing specific religious freedom violations."Additionally, the USCIRF recommended that Washington redesignate China as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) "for engaging in systematic, ongoing, and egregious religious freedom violations."USCIRF said China had created a "high-tech surveillance state" using facial recognition and artificial intelligence to monitor religious minorities, including in the XUAR, where authorities are believed to have detained up to 1.8 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in more than 1,300 internment camps since April 2017numbers it noted had been revised upward since the previous reporting period.On April 1, a new regulation requiring religious venues to have legal representatives and professional accountants went into effect, it said, noting that some smaller religious venues, especially in rural areas, found these requirements impossible to fulfill.USCIRF said behavior deemed to be signs of "religious extremism," such as wearing long beards and refusing alcohol, regularly lead to detention in the XUAR's camps, where former detainees have reported being subjected to torture, rape, sterilization, and other abuses. It also noted that nearly half a million Muslim children have been separated from their families and placed in boarding schools in the region.In 2019, internment camps in the XUAR "increasingly transitioned from reeducation to forced labor as detainees were forced to work in cotton and textile factories," the report said, while the government continued to deploy officials to live with Muslim families and report any signs of "extremist" behavior.Additionally, authorities in the region, and throughout China, have destroyed or damaged thousands of mosques and torn down Arabic-language signs from Muslim businesses, it said.USCIRF called on the U.S. Congress to support the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which would prohibit the importation to the United States of textiles, cotton, and other goods from the XUAR.Tibet and elsewhereThe commission noted that in 2019, the Chinese government also "continued to pursue a strategy of forced assimilation and suppression of Tibetan Buddhism," in particular through laws designed to control the next reincarnation of exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama and those of other Tibetan eminent lamas.During the summer of 2019, authorities demolished thousands of residences at the Yachen Gar Tibetan Buddhist center in Sichuan province, it said, while in April last year, authorities closed the Larung Gar Buddhist Academy in Sichuan to new enrollment.In protest of repressive government policies, at least 156 Tibetans have self-immolated since February 2009.USCIRF urged Congress to support the Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2019 which would promote religious freedom in Tibet and penalize the Chinese government for interfering in the Dalai Lama's succession.Tuesday's report also noted that Chinese authorities raided or shut down hundreds of Protestant house churches in 2019 and arrested thousands of Falun Gong practitioners for practicing the movement's meditation exercises or distributing literature about their beliefs.In a statement, USCIRF commissioner Tenzin Dorjee called China "the classic example of a 'country of particular concern,' or CPC, when it comes to religious freedom violations.""Millions of Uighurs are kept in concentration camps and according to the latest Freedom House Report, Tibet is second only to Syria in terms of religious freedom and human rights violations," he said."The time is now for serious multilateral government and global policy actions to end 'systematic, ongoing, and egregious' religious freedom and human rights violations in China, including in Tibet and Xinjiang."'At war with faith'Speaking to RFA's Tibetan Service on Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback called for an end to "these systematic violations of religious freedom in Xinjiang, in Tibet, to the house church, to Falun Gong members, that are taking place throughout China.""This surveillance state has been growingthis is a feature of Chen Quanguo, the Communist Party chairman in Xinjiang who previously was in Tibet," he said."He's done it in Tibet, he's doing it in Xinjiang, and it needs to stop ... China's been at war with faith now and certainly in recent years that war has intensified. They will not win this war against their own people's faith."The U.S. State Department also issued a statement Tuesday calling on Beijing to release those "arbitrarily detained" in the XUAR and to "end its draconian policies" in the region."During this month-long observance of Ramadanand at all times, we call on the PRC (People's Republic of China) government to ensure that all Muslims and all religious believers can practice their faith in accordance with their beliefs," the statement said."Contrary to Beijing's narrative, those detained in internment camps are being held against their will, often times for simply exercising their right to freedom of religion or belief, including praying or wearing religious attire."Dolkun Isa, president of the Munich-based World Uyghur Congress (WUC) exile group, welcomed USCIRF's report, which he said, "clearly highlighted the horrific treatment of the Uyghur Muslims under China's brutal rule.""Without question, the Uyghur Muslims' religious freedom has faced eradication by China while more than a billion Muslims around the world are celebrating Ramadan fasting and praying," he told RFA's Uyghur Service."I call on China to release the 3 million Uyghur and Kazakh Muslims detained in concentration camps, [as well as] Tibetan Buddhists and Chinese Christians from prison," he added, using his organization's estimate of the number of people held in the XUAR's detention centers.Matteo Mecacci, president of Washington-based International Campaign for Tibet ICT), applauded USCIRF's call for the passage of the Tibetan Policy and Support Act in a statement Tuesday.He urged Congress and the White House to adopt the act, which he said would "send a strong message to the communist government in Beijing that its attempts to control and dominate the lives of Tibetan Buddhists and other people of faith will face serious consequences from the United States and its allies."Reported by RFA's Uyghur and Tibetan Services.

MCSALLY INTRODUCES BILL TO PROHIBIT USE OF TAXPAYER FUNDS FOR CHINESE DRONESStates News ServiceMay 21, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 368 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by Arizona Senator Martha McSally:U.S. SENATE U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) on Thursday introduced legislation to prohibit the use of federal funding to purchase drones manufactured in communist China or by Chinese state-owned companies. The bill, Securing Our Skies Against Chinese Technology Act 2020, would require U.S. private entities and state and local governments to certify they are not using Chinese drones in order to receive federal funds."At a time when federal agencies are banning or grounding Chinese drones base on cybersecurity concerns, China is now donating them to state and local law enforcement across the United States," McSally said. "This is just another part of China's ongoing effort to exploit the global pandemic and it is unacceptable. We should not risk giving China the chance to spy on Americans amid our efforts to combat the coronavirus. My legislation is a commonsense step toward exposing communist China's real intentions and shoring up our national security."Background:On May 13, 2020, members of the House Judiciary Committee announced an inquiry into the use of Chinese-made drones by local U.S. law enforcement agencies.In April 2020, news reports showed that Chinese-based company Da Jiang Innovations (DJI) donated drones to dozens of local and state law enforcement agencies in the U.S.In January 2020, the Department of the Interior grounded all of its Chinese-made drones.In September 2019, members of the U.S. Senate introduced the American Security Drone Act, which would prohibit the U.S. government from purchasing drones from adversaries.In June 2019, members of the House Oversight Committee sent a letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kevin McAleenan asking for more information on DHS's warning about Chinese-made drones.In May 2019, DHS warned U.S. companies about the data security risks posed by Chinese-made drones, including those made by DJI.In 2017, the DHS's investigation unit warned that DJI was "likely providing U.S. critical infrastructure and law enforcement data to the Chinese government." The U.S. Army ended the use of DJI equipment, and the U.S. Navy sent out a warning.Load-Date: May 25, 2020End of Document

INTERVIEW OF AMBASSADOR HUANG XINGYUAN (V)States News ServiceMarch 30, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1003 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BEIJING, China BodyThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:From Chinese Embassy in CyprusQ: Recently, many U.S. politicians have labeled the COVID-19 "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus." What would you say to that?A: The origin of coronavirus is a matter of science and we should follow scientific and professional advice. The World Health Organization and the international community are clearly opposed to linking the virus to a specific country, area or race. So any attempt to stigmatize the virus should be rejected. Even if the origin is found to come from the US, I believe China will not call it the "American virus". It's like we did not call the pandemic a hundred years ago "American flu" or AIDS as "American AIDS", although they were first found in the United States. We believe that constant stigmatization, disrespect for science, and disregard for WHO rules is a naked propaganda of racism and xenophobia, which is both ignorant and shameful. With the accelerating spread of the global epidemic, countries in the world should work together to overcome difficulties. Finding a scapegoat and engaging in political manipulation will not help the US to overcome the epidemic, nor will it contribute to the international cooperation in fighting the epidemic.Q: In combating the epidemic, China has achieved remarkable results and is now fully engaging in international cooperation. How can China help Cyprus?A: Cyprus has given firm support when China went all-out fighting the epidemic, and China has taken it to heart and is ready to provide assistance to Cyprus with all efforts. State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi has sent a letter of condolences to Foreign Minister Nikos Christodoulides, expressing his willingness to share information and experience with Cyprus for prevention and control of the virus, and provide Cyprus with any assistance that China can offer. The Chinese Embassy has been sharing protocols for diagnosis and treatment with the Cypriot government. My Twitter account and the Embassy's Facebook account have been sharing know-how linked to China's anti-epidemic information platform. On March 19, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Health Commission shared China's experience through a video conference in terms of epidemiological characteristics, prevention and control strategies, and clinical diagnosis and treatment with government officials and medical and epidemic prevention experts from 18 European countries including Cyprus, and also took more than 80 questions. President Anastasiades retweeted my comments on the conference and thanked China for extending a helping hand to Cyprus.More importantly, China has been working around the clock to overcome the difficulties such as insufficient domestic production capacity and insufficient international transport capacity, to collect special protective masks, medical masks, protective uniforms, goggles and other medical supplies that are in short supply in Cyprus. All these are coming to Cyprus in one batch after another through multiple channels. Not only does the Chinese government care about Cyprus, but the local governments and enterprises of China as well as the Chinese community in Cyprus try to donate medical supplies to Cyprus. I believe that under the strong leadership of the Cypriot government, with the active cooperation of the Cypriot people, and with the full support of the Chinese government, the island will eventually win the battle against the epidemic.Q: Against the backdrop of a global fight against COVID-19, there are still hypes around Xinjiang's vocational education and training centers and so-called human rights issues by a few countries and forces. Do you have any comments?A: Xinjiang is one of the few provinces and regions which have seen small number of confirmed cases. It indicates that the situation there may be better than many other provinces and regions. Every country and region has law breakers or those affected by terrorism, who are subject to law enforcement. This has nothing to do with nationality or religious belief given that everybody is equal before the law. China had its own way to prevent people affected by terrorism from becoming victims of terrorism. These training centers were targeted at those who had been or might be affected by terrorism, so the Chinese government provided them with training to acquire law awareness and professional skills. At present, all trainees have graduated and are having good jobs and better lives. Such measures of addressing both symptoms and root causes are the key reason for Xinjiang to achieve "zero terrorist violence" in the past three years. Against the global context of combating COVID-19, some countries and forces are still reluctant to abandon ideological prejudice about Xinjiang-related issue, and even playing the old tricks of finding criminal offenders to tell "human rights stories" on TV shows, which is really an insult to people's IQ.Q: Recently, there have been reports in the international media that China and the United States have expelled resident journalists from each other. Can you tell us what is happening?A: The Chinese side has made necessary countermeasures against the US' groundless and non-stop suppression of Chinese media agencies in the US. It is a reasonable and justifiable defense. For a long time, the US has adopted discriminatory restrictions on visa application, administrative review and daily interviews of Chinese journalists. For example, the visa applications from 30 Chinese journalists have been shelved or even refused by the US since 2018. Not long ago, the US expelled 60 Chinese journalists unjustifiably. The Chinese people believe that one should return as good as one receives. The measures China has taken are to save China-US relations in the midst of fire and water, and remind the US what is the principle of reciprocity, what is fair and just, and what is freedom of the press.Load-Date: April 2, 2020End of Document

But with the rise of the coronavirus, the negotiation was paused and the confrontation moved to the computer plane.Donald Trump called COVID 19 the "Chinese virus, " because he was born there. In response, the Chinese authorities have even come to accuse him of xenophobia and racism.China silenced and pursued doctors who warned of coronavirus risksWhile White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien overroosed the bet and publicly said that "this outbreak in Wuhan was covered up." He said doctors who warned about the danger of the virus in its early time were imprisoned or silenced."It probably took the global community two months to respond, and in those two months ... could have drastically reduced what happened in China and what is now happening around the world," he added.The most prominent case was ophthalmologist Li Wenliang, one of eight people arrested for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak of the deadly disease.Li went on to have 1.5 billion readers on his blog about coronavirus. He was censored in December and died of coronavirus in February.How The COVID-19 #Pandemic Started:???????? The first doctor to warn of the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 (#COVID19 outbreak)????????

With most dating back to March 2020, Kassam accuses the time that bots have been created to promote Chinese propaganda.China claims to have defeated the coronavirus, the people shout "False, all false!"Even the Ministry of Propaganda published a manual in six languages, as an action program for the rest of the world, entitled "A Battle against the Epidemic: China's Fight against COVID-19 in 2020."It is available in English, French, Spanish, Russian and Arabic, as well as Chinese. But from the civilian population they shout in Chinese: "False, all false!" Thus shouted from the windows of their departments the inhabitants of a residential complex, during the visit of Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chunlan, one of the highest-ranking officials of the party.According to the local press, the screams were motivated by a false delivery of groceries to enclosed departments, when in fact residents were being confined and neglected and also denounced the inhabitants that a fair impromptu cleaning was done before the official's visit.In defense of the regime, state-owned channels People's Daily and China Central Television (CCTV) released videos of the incident alleging that the central government was against such staged inspections and criticized the cover-up of the real problems local officials.Since the Chinese communist regime controls what is said in the country that the coronavirus pandemic was born, its greatest defense is now to impart to the world the narrative it holds at home.The cries that the regime said are false in China have already begun, now that role remains for the rest of the world.When we started the PanAm Post to try to bring the truth about Latin America to the rest of the world, we knew it would be a big challenge.

Josh Hawley called for an international investigation into China Tuesday over the nation's alleged cover-up of the coronavirus pandemic that has spread rapidly into the U.S. and Europe.Hawley introduced a resolution calling for the investigation, alongside Republican New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who is introducing a companion resolution in the House of Representatives. (RELATED: Sen. Josh Hawley: Big Tech Has Too Much Power To Control Information)“Since day one, the Chinese Communist Party intentionally lied to the world about the origin of this pandemic. The CCP was aware of the reality of the virus as early as December but ordered laboratories to destroy samples and forced doctors to keep silent,” Hawley said in a press release. “It is time for an international investigation into the role their cover-up played in the spread of this devastating pandemic. The CCP must be held to account for what the world is now suffering.”Link to ImageCongresswoman Elise Stefanik speaks onstage during Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit - Day 1 at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel on October 12, 2015 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Fortune/Time Inc)“The Communist government of China knowingly withheld critical information needed to combat the spread of the Chinese-born COVID-19 and to this day continues to spread lies and disinformation on the origin of the deadly virus,” Stefanik said. ” “There is no doubt that China's unconscionable decision to orchestrate an elaborate coverup of the wide-ranging and deadly implications of coronavirus led to the death of thousands of people, including hundreds of Americans and climbing.”Earlier this week, Hawley took the World Health Organization (WHO) to task for their response to the pandemic, accusing them of siding with China, and demanding “consequences” for their actions. The senator's tweet was a response to a Sunday report from Daily Caller News Foundation editor Peter Hasson,            which found that World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus benefited from the backing of the Chinese government in his success 2017 election.“There need to be consequences here,” Hawley tweeted Sunday night. “WHO has sided w/ #China Communist Party against the world in this pandemic.”Graphic Sen.

Ann Wagner, R-Missouri, issued the following statement on legislation to hold China accountable for its actions during the COVID-19 outbreak:"It is undeniable that China intentionally misrepresented and suppressed vital information that could have mitigated the spread of the coronavirus. Instead of acting in the global interest, the Chinese government took deliberate action that created the worldwide crisis we find ourselves in today."These reckless acts directly contributed to the deadly pandemic that has killed nearly 100,000 Americans and unleashed an economic tragedy that has impacted communities in every corner of the United States."It is not enough to just publicly rebuke the Chinese Communist Party, they must pay for the loss of life and economic injury they caused."My legislation instructs the President to reach a Bilateral Agreement on Compensation with China, freezing Chinese assets and imposing sanctions and other penalties to bring China to the negotiating table."This is an extraordinary step that is necessary to provide justice for all Americans, ensure that the Communist Party stops violating international law, and help China be a better partner in the world community."The Compensation for Americans Act directs the President to employ a series of tools, including the following:- Freeze any necessary Chinese assets in the United States in order to reach a bilateral agreement with China- Create a public repository of Chinese assets and holdings in the United States- Impose sanctions and/or travel restrictions on:- CCP officials, associates, and family members- Chinese medical equipment and pharmaceutical suppliers that have profited from the pandemic- Chinese companies in the high-tech sector- Chinese entities involved in the theft of U.S. intellectual property- Chinese entities that participate in internet surveillance, filtration, and censorship- Establish a fund to compensate Americans for damages caused by COVID-19- Require U.S. representatives at international institutions to work to:- Remove China's "developing nation" nation status at the WTO- Remove China's eligibility for World Bank development loans- Prevent China from obtaining special treatment at the United Nations- Prohibit investment of the Thrift Savings Plan I Fund in China, ensuring that federal retirement savings are not being used to support the CCP regime- Require greater transparency from Chinese companies listed on U.S. exchanges- Instruct the President to seek a Bilateral Agreement on Compensation with ChinaCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7121234 MSTRUCKLoad-Date: May 27, 2020End of Document

TOP HOUSE REPUBLICANS ANNOUNCE PROBE INTO CHINESE EFFORTS TO INFILTRATE U.S. COLLEGESStates News ServiceMay 4, 2020 MondayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1222 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Republicans:Today, the top Republicans from seven different House committees led by Oversight Ranking Member Jim Jordan (R-OH) sent a letter to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos asking for information about the Chinese Communist Partys investment in American colleges and universities to further its strategic and propaganda goals.What the letter says:China has strategically invested in U.S. academia to attempt to steal confidential information and technology from U.S. companies, and even the U.S. government. Besides China peddling money for influence in U.S. institutions of higher education (IHE), China is restricting any research regarding the origins of COVID-19 that does not comport with CCP propaganda. To nations battling peak pandemic outbreaks, the CCPs machinations undoubtably hamper the global response to the pandemic.For some time, we have been concerned about the potential for the Chinese government to use its strategic investments to turn American college campuses into indoctrination platforms for American students. For example, a 2018 Hoover Institution report notes the presence of some 110 Confucius Institutes on college campuses as well as over 500 Confucius Classrooms in secondary schools. While the stated mission of such institutes and classrooms is to teach Chinese language and culture, the report notes, faculty and other watchdogs have warned that they may present risks to intellectual freedom by using American universities as vehicles through which to advance Chinese Communist Party propaganda.These actions all bring into question whether U.S. IHEs receiving federal taxpayer dollars should be allowed to accept funds from China, the CCP, or other affiliated organizations. The interests of the two nations appear to have diverged.Read the full text of the letter here.House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan was joined on the letter by the following top House Committee Republicans:Virginia Foxx, ranking member of the House Committee on Education and LaborMac Thornberry, ranking member of the House Armed Services CommitteeMike Rogers, ranking member of the House Committee on Homeland SecurityFrank Lucas, ranking member of the House Committee on Science, Space, and TechnologyDevin Nunes, ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on IntelligenceMichael McCaul, ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs CommitteeWhat the signers are saying:Ranking Member Jim Jordan: We cannot allow a dangerous communist regime to buy access to our institutions of higher education, plain and simple. The Chinese Communist Partys coverup of the early outbreak of the coronavirus immeasurably worsened this diseases impact on the United States and the world. We owe it to the American people to hold China accountable and to prevent them from doing further harm to our country.Ranking member Virginia Foxx: Chinas lack of transparency and accountability for the global spread of the novel coronavirus has devastated communities, businesses, and schools across the world, including our institutions of higher education. Unsurprisingly, China is now attempting to suppress academic research into the origins of the pandemic. This is unacceptable. These strategic and disreputable acts from the Chinese Communist Party have proven to be commonplace and it is time for institutions of higher education to acknowledge how much money they accept from foreign actors. We must work together to protect our national interests by significantly reducing our universities reliance on investments from adversarial foreign entities.Ranking Member Mac Thornberry: Chinas strategic investment in our institutions of higher learning has long been a concern. This is especially true where China appears to be targeting institutions doing research with the Department of Defense in an effort to obtain sensitive information.Ranking Member Mike Rogers: Im grateful for the leadership of Ranking Member Jordan on this issue, Rogers said. Its imperative we get a complete understanding of the depth of foreign influence in our higher education institutions. China has shown they will stop at nothing to push their narratives and silence those who speak out against them. They are not good faith partners with the U.S., and we cannot allow them to influence or have access to our higher education.Ranking Member Frank Lucas: If China surpasses us in critical innovations like quantum information science, artificial intelligence, and advanced manufacturing it will have significant implications for our national security, for our economic competitiveness, and for our way of life. Were working with universities and federal agencies to protect our academic research enterprise so we can continue to maintain Americas scientific and technological leadership.Ranking Member Michael McCaul: I have long been concerned about Chinese Communist Party efforts to infiltrate and influence American academia for malign purposes, including stealing technology and controlling academic research. While this Administration has brought this longstanding problem to light, the CCPs ongoing coronavirus coverup is yet another wake up call to the threat posed by the CCPs undisclosed financial ties to U.S. universities. It is imperative that U.S. higher education institutions comply with federal disclosure requirements and remain transparent about their relationships with the CCP so that we can fully understand the extent of this threat, and I look forward to continued work with the Administration to address this important issue.Background:The FBI has warned that some adversarial countries such as China strategically invest in IHEs and researchers that also receive Defense Department grants in an attempt to steal sensitive U.S. military secrets and technology.The Justice Department recently announced the arrest of a Harvard University professor who specialized in nanoscience along with two Chinese nationals in connection with aiding the Peoples Republic of China.The Higher Education Act of 1965 requires U.S. IHEs to disclose gifts from foreign sources. Specifically, section 117 of the Act requires that whenever any institution . . . receives a gift from or enters into a contract with a foreign source, the value of which is $250,000 or more, the institution shall file a disclosure report. As the letter details, the Department of Education has opened investigations into multiple universities for potentially improperly reporting foreign gifts or for failing to report altogether.Liu Yunshan, the former Head of Central Propaganda Department of China, pointed to the proliferation of Confucius Institutes and Classrooms in 2010 as part of a plan to coordinate the efforts of overseas and domestic propaganda, [and] further create a favorable international environment for [China].House Oversight Committee have already taken steps to investigate Chinas role in exacerbating the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and its impact United States. Last week, Ranking Member Jordan and along with 5 subcommittee ranking members called on Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney to join Republicans efforts to hold the World Health Organization accountable for parroting the regimes propaganda.Load-Date: May 4, 2020End of Document

The Head of U.S. Counterintelligence Hoists the Red FlagSecurityInfoWatch.comMarch 1, 2020 Sunday 12:00 AM ESTCopyright 2020 Cygnus Business Media All Rights ReservedLength: 2212 wordsHighlight: William Evanina warns the nation's CSOs and technology vendors that China's plan of global domination is real and the security threats constantBodyDuring the Opening Session at the November 2019 Executive Summit Series forum in Washington D.C., one of the government officials I interviewed was William Evanina, Director of the National  Counterintelligence and Security Center. The focus of the interview was on the threat landscape facing companies operating around the world. No one was surprised that a significant portion of the time was spent on the threat posed by China. A portion of the interview focused on the aggressive nature China has taken in its stated goal in its Made in China 2025 doctrine of global domination in virtually every category of products and services. It also touched upon the other stated goal of the Made in China 2025 doctrine of supplying domestic markets predominately from local Chinese suppliers.         Warning  to Security System End Users       Evanina made a point of highlighting an area that should be of significant concern to  Chief Security Officers (CSOs) and other end-users of all types of security systems. The majority of security devices today and in the future are IP-based and typically sit on an enterprise's network. Evanina stated that the intelligence community has identified Chinese manufactured physical security devices as well as those containing Chinese manufactured electronic components and software as a high risk for cyber intrusion and data exfiltration from those enterprises deploying them.  I asked Evanina if the risk was sufficient to suggest that enterprises replace security devices, video cameras, and software of Chinese origin or containing software or electronic components originating in China. He agreed and urged everyone to proceed rapidly in replacing the types of devices we discussed. The intelligence community has found security hardware and software of Chinese origin transmitting data and video images back to China. These devices also pose a high risk of exposing your enterprise's network to hacking and loss of critical data due to inherent vulnerabilities that exist in Chinese security hardware, software, and video cameras. Based on  China's stated goal of market domination, these vulnerabilities or portals have more than likely been purposefully designed into them. Don't think for a minute,  though, that private entities are the only ones that have this problem. Several  U.S. Government facilities and military installations have been found to have these devices installed at many of their sites. The same goes for state and local government facilities as well as school and university campuses.Evanina also explained that drones produced by Chinese companies and those containing electronic components and software developed in China have also been found to be transmitting data and video images back to China. The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the  Department of Interior have grounded their entire fleet of drones as a result of these revelations and are in the process of replacing their drones with ones that are secure.         Mitigating  This Clear and Present Danger       So,  what are some of the steps enterprises should seriously consider adopting to mitigate these significant risks identified by the Intelligence Community?• The first steps to consider is to determine if your enterprise has any security devices or video cameras installed in your security system that are Chinese products, have Chinese produced electronic components or software contained in them.• Check with your security integrator /installer to provide the provenance on all security devices, video cameras and security software they have installed. If you do not feel that your current integrator/installer will be able to provide full and accurate details, then find an independent security integrator/installer to conduct the assessment for you.• Once the assessment has been completed, determine what security devices and/or video cameras need to be replaced.• Develop a new specification that either directly specifies that only the exact security devices and video cameras listed in the bid specification can be proposed/installed. There are a few independent security consulting firms that are experts in assisting enterprises in developing specifications for clients to utilize in the bidding process. The other approach is to require that the bidding firms certify that no Chinese produced devices or video cameras and no security devices or video cameras containing Chinese produced electronic components or software are being bid or will be installed. Once installed, make sure the firm provides a complete inventory with the provenance of all components, devices, cameras, and software.• As a final step to mitigate future vulnerabilities, seriously consider removing all your security devices, video cameras, and software from your enterprise's computer network and placing them on a standalone fiber optic-based network dedicated exclusively for security. This will virtually eliminate the risk of the security system being the attack vector responsible for a major data breach of the enterprise's network. If you decide not to take this step and a devastating data breach is traced back to a security device, video camera or security software as being the portal from which the hackers gained access to your enterprise's network, perhaps your successor will be able to get the segregated security network authorized and installed.Another vital step an end-user should take is to gain control over the bidding and contract process for all security-related products and services. In many enterprises, the procurement organization has taken over these processes in their effort to produce the lowest costs to the enterprise for any products or services purchased. At the end of the day, the procurement department is not held accountable for the service level of the guard force or the functioning of security systems; that falls on the shoulders of the CSO who is stuck with what they have been handed by procurement. Procurement organizations are even utilizing online auction-type bidding for security guard services and other human-based services.  This online bidding process is fine for commodities and office supplies, but when human services like security forces and cleaning crews are involved, on-line bidding of these services should be banned due to the optics alone, if for no other reason, but likely are in direct conflict with the stated values of the enterprise. Even if you can't control the bidding process, make sure that you develop detailed specifications, as previously mentioned, and work closely with your legal department in drafting contractual protections. You will want to ensure that bidders are required to provide detailed provenance on all security devices, video cameras and security software that is being bid and installed. Some savvy enterprises are not only requiring these certifications but are also demanding a performance bond, which can be utilized to replace elements of the security system should it be determined that the installed devices, cameras and/or software did not meet specifications.         Increasing  Threat Environment Requires Diligence       Evanina also highlighted several other concerns during the Executive Summit Series forum.  He told the audience of 150 senior risk, security and resiliency executives that he had briefed more than 1,000 Chief Executive Officers of corporations across virtually all industry sectors. He was quite surprised at their naivet\x83© when it came to the risks faced by their respective enterprises relative to nation-state sponsored electronic intrusions and intelligence gathering. Additionally, he said that most of the CEO's seemed surprised that the warnings about taking a  cellphone or laptop into China were based on a real and not imaginary threat. The ability of the intelligence organizations of countries like China to download software onto cellphones and laptops as soon as they connect with the local in-country network is something they considered an urban myth. The CEOs were generally unaware of the ability of the Chinese (and other nation-state actors) to remotely turn on the camera and microphone of a cellphone or laptop once it had been in-country and connected to the local network. He explained to them that this was a real threat to documented cases. They seemed shocked to find out that once the software had been installed, it could be activated on their phone or laptop anywhere the device was in the world. Evanina went on to discuss another area that should be of great concern to any company working with the research arms of universities. He provided detailed briefings to the presidents of over 100 major universities housing large research centers on the threat posed by Chinese students working in their labs. He explained that the Chinese government has been systematically siphoning off leading-edge scientific research and industrial advancements being developed at these key universities. Examples of individuals stealing leading-edge research and returning to China with it to support Chinese advancements in areas of critical technology have become commonplace. Recently,  one of the Chinese students here on an education visa and working in a  prestigious university's lab was found to be a Lieutenant in the Peoples  Liberation Army and was receiving direction from her superiors in China on specific technologies they wanted her to focus on appropriating.In another twist, Dr. Charles  Lieber, Chair of the Department of  Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University, was recently arrested and charged with making a materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statement. The professor is noted for his research and development of advanced nana technology. A quote from the government's  complaint stated: "Unbeknownst to  Harvard University beginning in 2011, Lieber became a 'Strategic Scientist' at  Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) in China and was a contractual participant  in China's Thousand Talents Plan from in or about 2012 to 2017." Another portion of the charging document stated "China's Thousand Talents Plan is one of the most prominent Chinese Talent recruit plans that are designed to attract, recruit, and cultivate high-level scientific talent in furtherance of  China's scientific development, economic prosperity, and national security.  These talent programs seek to lure Chinese overseas talent and foreign experts  to bring their knowledge and experience to China and reward individuals for  stealing proprietary information."The Chinese Government utilizes stolen advanced scientific research and technology to support its stated goal of Chinese dominance in virtually every major sector globally and to support its Made in China 2025 doctrine.  Made in China 2025 involves government subsidies, heavy investments in research and innovation and targets for local manufacturing content. It also builds on earlier government policies encouraging or requiring foreign companies seeking to access the Chinese market to enter joint ventures with and transfer technology to domestic firms. Another of China's long-term goals with Made in China 2025 is to domestically produce everything needed to support their domestic markets serving over 1.4 billion people.Evanina urged the attendees at the summit to double their efforts on increasing awareness relative to the significant threats to their enterprises.  He recommended that they conduct an assessment to identify the most important technology and trade secrets that their enterprise has as its Crown Jewels. He further recommended that once the assessment has been conducted, they should deploy significant measures to segregate those Crown Jewels and protect them like the future of their enterprise depends on it.

CHINA TARGETS THOUSANDS WHO SPOKE OUT ABOUT THE CORONAVIRUS EPIDEMICStates News ServiceApril 3, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 745 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON, DC BodyThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:The ruling Chinese Communist Party has targeted thousands of people for speaking out about the coronavirus epidemic in the country since it began in late December in the central city of Wuhan, an overseas-based rights group has said. "Human rights violations surged in China since the Chinese government began implementing draconian measures in response to COVID-19," the Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) network said in a report this week. "These include deleting critical information online, censoring the media, punishing whistleblowing doctors, detaining and disappearing independent journalists and government critics, and kicking out foreign reporters," it said. Since state news agency Xinhua first reported that President Xi Jinping would lead "a people's war" on the epidemic on Jan. 20, police had handled 5,111 cases of "fabricating and deliberately disseminating false and harmful information," according to a Feb. 21 statement from the ministry of public security. CHRD said it has documented 897 cases between Jan. 1 and March 26 involving Chinese internet users penalized by police for their online speech or info-sharing about the coronavirus epidemic, based on official information in the public domain. The cases were spread across almost every province, region and municipality in China, CHRD said, adding that 467 people were sanctioned in February alone. "The punishments handed out by police fall largely into several types: administrative detention, criminal detention, enforced disappearance, fines, warnings/interrogations, forced confessions and 'educational reprimand'," the CHRD report said. Some 18.5 percent of people were placed in administrative detention, which can be handed down to a maximum of 15 days without trial, while 17.8 received an "education reprimand," it said. Charges used to question, detain and arrest people included "rumor-mongering," "fabricating false information," "sowing panic," "disturbing public order," and "breach of privacy." Cases in which people were accused of "spreading misinformation" or "disrupting public order" accounted for more than 96 percent of cases, the group said. "Under the guise of fighting the novel coronavirus, authorities in China have escalated suppression online by blocking independent reporting, information sharing, and critical comments on government responses."CHRD said. "The Chinese government must release detained citizen journalists and outspoken critics, and end the new crackdown on free expression online since the start of COVID-19 outbreak." Among those targeted were whistleblowing Wuhan doctors Ai Fen and Li Wenliang, who died of the coronavirus on Feb. 6. Seven other medical workers in the city were also held, questioned and warned off saying anything in public. "The state censorship and cyber surveillance apparatus have been operating in overdrive to suppress free expression and press online," CHRD said. It said Chinese social media companies such as YY and WeChat have reportedly been censoring information related to the coronavirus outbreak since late December or early January, likely under pressures from the government. "Censors quickly deleted or blocked online posts ... [including] stories of family members falling sick and dying without being tested, desperate calls for help and donations, eyewitness accounts of overwhelmed hospitals, expressions of sympathy for the devastated families and loss of life, or offering support and respect for medical workers making horrific sacrifices," it said. Citizen journalist and lawyer Chen Qiushi is still incommunicado since being taken away by police on Feb. 6 after he started livestreaming from hospitals in Wuhan. Similar treatment was meted out to rights activist and citizen journalist Fang Bin, who was detained on Feb. 9, and to former anchor with state broadcaster CCTV, Li Zehua, who was detained on Feb. 26. Authorities in the eastern city of Nanjing detained dissident intellectual Guo Quan on charges of "incitement to subvert state power" on Jan. 31 and then formally arrested him in February after he spoke out online about the coronavirus outbreak. He is currently being held at the Nanjing No. 2 Detention Center, CHRD said. Property tycoon Ren Zhiqiang was placed under party investigation on March 12 after writing an essay critical of President Xi. Reported by RFA's Mandarin and Cantonese Services.

Apple can t break up with China, Wall Street Journal report arguesiCrowdNewswire (English)March 4, 2020 Wednesday 12:30 PM GMTCopyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1025 wordsBodySources say it s not possible to replicate Chinese supply lines elsewhere.

Continue reading Apple can t break up with China, Wall Street Journal report arguesSources say it s not possible to replicate Chinese supply lines elsewhere.A report in The Wall Street Journal published today provided new insights and analysis on Apple s heavy reliance on partners in China to manufacture its products.The piece is timed with fluctuating stock for Apple and serious concerns about its ability to meet its goals and ship products to its millions of customers as efforts to contain the coronavirus debilitate the company s supply lines. Twice in about a year, Apple s profits and market value have suffered because of problems faced in China. First, it was the United States  trade war with the country. Now it s the health crisis.Some Apple staffers, executives, and investors have in the past expressed concerns about the company s reliance on the region; generally, it s ideal business practice for a large multinational corporation to diversify and not become overly dependent on one market, region, or partner.Citing people familiar with the discussions, the WSJ story claims some Apple executives floated the idea in 2015 to assemble at least one product in Vietnam instead of China as a first step toward building out the needed infrastructure and base of workers to make a bigger transition over time. However,  senior managers rebuffed the idea. Apple has made some attempts to make products outside of China, though. It has tried making AirPods in Vietnam to skirt US-China tariffs, iPhones in India to avoid an Indian tax an imports for iPhones sold in India, and Macs in the United States in limited ways. But the report says these trial runs have  laid bare a number of difficulties. Speaking with experts such as researchers and former Foxconn executives, the article argues what others have previously argued: it s simply not possible for Apple to make the change frustrated investors and employees want it to make. For one example why, the article says:The population in China has allowed suppliers to build factories with a capacity for more than 250,000 people. The number of migrant workers in China, who do much of Apple s production, exceed Vietnam s total population of 100 million. India is the closest comparison, but its roads, ports, and infrastructure lag far behind those in China.Additionally, the Chinese consumer market accounts for a significant portion of Apple s product sales, and a dramatic move to cut ties could jeopardize that market for the company. Paraphrasing Strategy Analytics technology researcher Neil Mawston, the article goes on to say that  employing so many local workers helped the company gain access to the market and any reduction might weaken its standing with the government, which wields tremendous influence over how global brands are perceived. That said, Apple is already facing fierce competition in the region from local rivals like Huawei in some cases because of an Apple boycott movement by Chinese consumers in response to rhetoric around the trade tensions between the US and China.When asked about the possibility of making big changes to the company s supply base in a recent Fox Business interview, Apple CEO Tim Cook responded:My perspective sitting here today is that if there are changes, you re talking about adjusting some knobs, not some sort of wholesale fundamental change.There are more details worth reading in the Wall Street Journal story, such as the history of Samsung s move out of China, more specific reasons it s so difficult to manufacture iPhones elsewhere, Apple s response to US President Donald Trump s combative trade policies with China, and Apple executives  and employees  concerns about labor practices in the country.Some of the Journal s sources are part of a chorus of analyst and researcher voices that generally agree that the symbiotic relationship between Apple, Foxconn, China, and the United States is vital and inescapable for a company in Apple s position. But that hasn t stopped investors from being worried about profits. Neither has it prevented watchdogs, consumers, and Apple employees from confronting complicated questions about labor rights in developing economies.To make matters worse, there has been a growing trend of anti-China sentiment or even outright Sinophobia in Western nations in reaction to relentless onslaughts of news stories in Western press outlets some responsibly reported, some not about labor crisis, the coronavirus, Hong Kong protests, controversial treatment by the Chinese government of indigenous Muslim populations, and US-China trade policies, among other concerns.Just as many economists argue that the economic futures of the United States, Europe, and many other regions are inextricably tied to China, analysts, researchers, and Apple leadership argue that Apple s future is inextricably tied to partners like Foxconn that have built operations in China that may be impossible to replicate elsewhere.Like many other US companies, the question for Apple can t possibly be whether or not to engage with China at all. Rather, it must be how to best weather the storms that inevitably come with that engagement. And it s a question that sits at the very heart of much of the world s current debates and upheaval about globalization, openness, trade, labor, the environment, and multiculturalism.According to The Wall Street Journal, there s no easy answer to the China question on the horizon for US tech giants, so grappling with these issues is going to be an existential challenge for Apple for a long time to come.See Campaign:https://www.wsj.com/articles/tim-cook-and-apple-bet-everything-on-china-then-coronavirus-hit-11583172087Contact Information:SAMUEL AXONTags:, Artificial Intelligence Newswire, Wire, United States, EnglishLoad-Date: March 4, 2020End of Document

Trump says he's pulling back from calling novel coronavirus the 'China virus'CNN WireMarch 24, 2020 Tuesday 8:40 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 364 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON (CNN) BodyWASHINGTON (CNN) --  President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he has decided to pull back from associating the novel coronavirus with China, which he had previously done by calling it the "China virus" or the "Chinese virus."After consulting with medical experts, and receiving guidance from the World Health Organization, CNN has determined that that name is both inaccurate and is considered stigmatizing. "Look, everyone knows it came out of China, but I decided we shouldn't make any more of a big deal out of it," Trump told Fox News. "I think I've made a big deal. I think people understand it." The President said he didn't regret using the terms to describe the virus and defended his past adoption of the terms by referencing other infectious diseases that are named after where they originate."It came from China," he said. The President also reiterated that he began using the term after Chinese media accused American soldiers of spreading the virus. He called the media organization which spread the information "a paper that's an organ for pretty much the top people" in the Chinese government. CNN previously reported that a prominent Chinese official has promoted a conspiracy theory that the US military could have brought the novel coronavirus to China -- and it did not originate in the Chinese city of Wuhan.Parts of Chinese social media, and even the country's government, appear to have launched a concerted campaign to question the origin of the novel coronavirus.Trump's change comes a day after he tweeted that the spread of the novel coronavirus in the US is not the fault of Asian-Americans, a group that has been the target of a growing number of racist and xenophobic attacks related to the virus.He also denied last week that "Chinese virus" or "China virus" was a racist term to use."It's not racist at all, no, not at all. It comes from China, that's why. I want to be accurate," Trump said at the time.A photograph taken last week of Trump's notes during a press briefing showed someone crossed out the word "Corona" in coronavirus and replaced it with the word "Chinese." TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Sentenced to 15 years in prison a journalist who "denigrated" the Communist Party of ChinaCE Noticias Financieras EnglishMay 1, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.All Rights ReservedCopyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights ReservedLength: 534 wordsBodyA Chinese journalist accused of "denigrating" the Ruling Communist Party and the government was sentenced to 15 years in prison, announ in a statement posted online.It is one of the harshest sentences against a person critical of President Xi Jinping's government, the target of accusations for weeks over his management of the COVID-19 epidemic.Blogger Chen Jieren, a former officer of the People's Daily, was convicted Thursday by the Guiyang County People's Court in central Hunan Province.He was sentenced "for causing riots, extortion, illegal trade and corruption," according to the court, which also fined him 7 million yuan (almost one million euros, $1.09 million).In its findings, the court states that since 2015, the convicted person has spread "false information" on social media with the aim of blackmailing funds from the people questioned in his articles.He also "attacked and denigrated the Party and the government, the judiciary and its staff," according to the court.The blogger was convicted along with two other people. The widespread photographs showed the three of them in protective clothing and gloves, as well as the policemen around them.- Record condemnation -In a statement, the Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) called on Beijing to immediately release the journalist.This association considers the conviction to be unprecedented. It is more severe, for example, than the 12 years in prison that fell on Huang Oi, founder of a human rights website.According to CHRD, Chen Jieren was arrested in mid-2018 shortly after posting articles on his website accusing senior local officials of corruption.According to the same source, the journalist previously worked for the Youth Journal, the Beijing Journal and the People's Daily, the party organ in power. Of all of them he was fired for articles critical of the regime."The heavy punishment imposed on Chen conveys a clear warning to independent bloggers and citizen journalists," CHRD said.According to Reporters Without Borders (RSF), China ranks 177th out of 180 in the world rankings of press freedom.The Chinese government has been receiving a barrage of criticism on social media since Dr. Li Wenliang, an Wuhan doctor who warned in late December of the emergence of the new coronavirus in this central city of the country, died in early February.The doctor was summoned by police, who accused him of spreading rumors. Since then, three bloggers have been arrested in Beijing.In March, the Chinese government also ordered the expulsion of 13 journalists from the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal, in response, according to Chinese diplomacy, to Washington's "outrageous" decision to drastically reduce the number of Chinese citizens authorized to work for five Beijing media outlets.According to the affected and responsible US media, these expulsions were intended to "prevent the world from knowing what is really happening within the country."The harshest sentence ever handed out in China against a political opponent since Xi Jinping came to power in late 2012 was against writer and activist Qin Yongmin, sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2018 for "subversion."bar/plh/erl-bl/pcLoad-Date: May 2, 2020End of Document

Tillis Releases Plan to Hold China Accountable for COVID-19, Protect America's Economy, Public Health, National SecurityTargeted News ServiceMay 15, 2020 Friday 7:50 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 542 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodySen.

WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE NAME "CHINESE VIRUS"?States News ServiceMarch 20, 2020 FridayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 691 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the Center for the National Interest (former the Nixon Center):This week, President Donald Trump came under fire for his use of the phrase "Chinese virus" to describe the coronavirus, the source of the new pandemic that has led to a global economic shutdown as well as lockdowns of citizens in every major Western country.That media have somehow found time to hone in on the one issue that matters leastthe labeling of a Chinese virus as suchin the middle of an unprecedented planet-wide freeze demonstrates the utter unseriousness of those objecting.That the term should be controversial at all is nearly beyond belief. The virus did indeed originate in China. Most of all, that the Chinese government should be shielded in any way from the results of its own pathological and tyrannical misgovernment is perverse beyond measure.Make no mistake: The Chinese government is chiefly responsible for the explosion of this pandemic of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.The so-called wet markets of Chinathe meat markets that often include wild animals ranging from snakes to pangolinsexist for a variety of reasons, ranging from price to superstitious belief in medicinal properties of exotic animals.According to Zhenzhong Si, research associate at the University of Waterloo, "Eating wild animal is considered a symbol of wealth because they are more rare and expensive."Whatever the rationale, the communist Chinese government has been exceedingly tolerant of such markets, even though they have now been responsible for the spread of the coronavirus, SARS, bird flu, Asian flu, and swine fever.The Chinese government has been similarly tolerant of treatment via traditional Chinese medicine rather than evidence-based medicine, which has increased the risk of such diseases.The same Chinese government now being praised for its extraordinary crackdown on its own citizensthe same government that is said to be imprisoning up to a million Uighurs for no specific crimeshas been unwilling for decades to stop the selling of exotic animals.Authoritarianism obviously doesn't apply to the most obvious solution to a bevy of possible epidemics.Meanwhile, the Chinese government acted early to shut down the spread of information about the coronavirus, which paved the way for freedom of travel by carriers of the disease.When ophthalmologist Li Wenliang told fellow doctors about the coronavirus in an online chat room in December, he was forced to swear by the Chinese government that he had been making "untrue statements." He ended up dying of the disease.When further information began to emerge about the coronavirus, the communist government simply lied about it, suggesting that case numbers were not risinga lie bought by the World Health Organization.Even now the Chinese government continues to spread propaganda suggesting that the coronavirus originated in the United States.Lijian Zhao, deputy director-general of the Information Department of China's Foreign Ministry, tweeted a link to an article he claimed had "Evidence that the Virus Originated in the US."And is it truly believable that China had just 127 diagnosed cases of the coronavirus between March 9 and March 16, even as the Chinese government expels American journalists en masse from both China and Hong Kong?Once this is all over, it's far past time for Americans to have a serious discussion about the extent to which openness to China ought to be curbed. The Trump administration should consider a travel ban on China until China has verifiably shut down its exotic animals markets, at the very least.The current crisis will cost millions of American jobs, millions more of Americans' savings, and thousands of American lives. To trust the Chinese government after a global betrayal of this magnitude would not only be foolish; it would be immoral.This article by Ben Shaprio first appeared at The Daily Signal on March 18.Image: Paramilitary officers wearing face masks to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) walk along a street in Beijing, China March 18, 2020.

Another view: China's response comes with human rights abuseUSA TODAYMarch 12, 2020 ThursdayFIRST EDITIONCopyright 2020 Gannett Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedSection: OPINION; Pg. 7ALength: 367 wordsByline: Yaqiu WangBodyIn recent interviews, Dr. Bruce Aylward, the leader of the World Health Organization team that visited China, lavishly praised the Chinese government's speedy response to the coronavirus outbreak.Aylward was referring to Chinese authorities' building a makeshift emergency hospital in 10 days, and placing close to 60 million people under quarantine, among other things. He didn't mention their swiftness in silencing doctors who warned about the virus, shutting down online discussion about it and detaining people who criticize the government's handling of it.Even if the draconian containment measures that the Chinese authorities later adopted -- after they delayed and bungled the early response -- were helpful, we should ask: At what and whose expenses?If free speech existed in China, global media sites such as Facebook and Twitter as well as Chinese internet platforms would be inundated with desperate calls for help and harrowing stories of deaths and illnesses posted by people living under quarantine. And when you see on your own social media feed the massive sufferings as a result of these "speedy" measures, you may think differently of them.But most Chinese people can't get on Twitter or Facebook to tell their COVID-19 stories, as these and many other global platforms are blocked in China, and government censors speedily scrub away the posts describing virus-related events on Chinese social media platforms.Yet, despite the censorship, many chilling stories still emerged: A boy with cerebral palsy died because no one took care of him after his father was taken to be quarantined. A woman with leukemia died after being turned away by several hospitals because of concerns about cross-infection. A mother desperately pleaded to the police to let her leukemia-stricken daughter through a checkpoint at a bridge to get chemotherapy.The WHO shouldn't be cheering on the Chinese government's response without grappling with the human toll authorities have tried to sweep under the rug. People across China won't soon forget the human rights abuses associated with the coronavirus response that Dr. Aylward so lightly dismisses.Yaqiu Wang is a China researcher at Human Rights Watch. Load-Date: March 12, 2020End of Document

US officially warns China is launching cyberattacks to steal coronavirus researchCNN WireMay 13, 2020 Wednesday 3:52 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 805 wordsDateline: WASHINGTON (CNN) BodyWASHINGTON (CNN) --  The US Department of Homeland Security and the FBI issued a "public service announcement" Wednesday warning that China is likely launching cyberattacks to steal coronavirus data related to vaccines and treatments from US research institutions and pharmaceutical companies, calling it a "significant threat."The joint warning from the FBI and DHS's cyber arm, CISA, warns "organizations researching COVID-19 of likely targeting and network compromise by the People's Republic of China (PRC). Healthcare, pharmaceutical and research sectors working on COVID-19 response should all be aware they are the prime targets of this activity and take the necessary steps to protect their systems."The notification elevates the accusation by the US government that China is taking advantage of the pandemic to carry out significant cyber espionage on critical institutions fighting the virus.The statement did not provide any evidence of China's involvement.Wednesday's warning comes as tensions continue to escalate between Washington and Beijing with the two sides issuing verbal jabs over how each country is handling the pandemic. The Trump administration has also continued to attack the Chinese government for failing to be transparent about the origins of the outbreak.CNN has previously reported that the administration has pointed the finger at China for attempting to steal coronavirus research as officials are warning they have seen a growing wave of cyberattacks on US government agencies and medical institutions leading the pandemic response by nation states and criminal groups.Hospitals, research laboratories, health care providers and pharmaceutical companies have all been hit, officials say, and the Department of Health and Human Services -- which oversees the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- has been struck by a surge of daily strikes, an official with direct knowledge of the attacks previously told CNN."We have to be the first ones through the door if we want any of our allies to follow us," a national security official told CNN earlier Wednesday, explaining the thinking behind the warning. "If this pandemic can't get our allies in the right place, what's going to?"The New York Times first reported that the announcement was expected and CNN confirmed the news earlier Wednesday.The Department of Justice has said they are particularly concerned about attacks by Chinese hackers targeting US hospitals and labs.On Monday, the head of the Justice Department's National Security Division appearing on CNBC said, "it would be crazy to think that right now the Chinese were not behind some of the cyber activity that we're seeing targeting US pharmaceutical companies and targeting research institutes" doing coronavirus research. "This is the holy grail of biomedical research right now" and it has "tremendous value both commercially and geopolitically," he added.Demers also said that US companies will ultimately want to sell their product.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo -- who has been consistently attacking China over the pandemic -- told Fox News last month, "The biggest threat isn't our ability to work with China on cyber, it's to make sure we have the resources available to protect ourselves from Chinese cyberattacks."Cyber espionage from China against the United States has spiked in the months since the outbreak of the virus according to the leading cybersecurity group FireEye. The group reported that Chinese group APT41 has carried out "one of the broadest campaigns by a Chinese cyber espionage actor we have observed in recent years."Last week, the US and United Kingdom issued a new advisory warning of ongoing cyberattacks against organizations involved in the coronavirus response, including health care bodies, pharmaceutical companies, academics, medical research organizations and local government.These malicious actors "frequently target organizations in order to collect bulk personal information, intellectual property and intelligence that aligns with national priorities," according to the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)."The pandemic has likely raised additional requirements for APT actors to gather information related to COVID-19. For example, actors may seek to obtain intelligence on national and international healthcare policy or acquire sensitive data on COVID-19 related research," the advisory said.APTs are generally hacking groups sponsored by foreign governments and last week's alert suggests that supply chains may be especially vulnerable.This story has been updated with a statement from the FBI and DHS and additional background.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

China is mobilizing its global media machine in the coronavirus war of wordsCNN WireMay 15, 2020 Friday 4:58 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights ReservedLength: 2148 wordsDateline: LONDON (CNN Business) BodyLONDON (CNN Business) --  The story of the coronavirus pandemic can be complicated and hard to follow, from how it started to the measures countries have taken to tackle its spread.But the picture has become even more confused by a torrent of propaganda, unreliable theories and deliberate misinformation being pushed for a variety of reasons. Increasingly, experts and government officials in the United States and Europe are accusing China --- the country first hit by the virus --- of stoking that confusion and trying to shape the narrative through its state-run broadcasters and publications, and on social media.China is trying to push three main messages about the outbreak, according to Rod Wye, an associate fellow at the Chatham House think tank in London and former head of Asia research at the UK Foreign Office. First, Beijing wants to spread its claims of being successful at controlling the virus, and show off the supplies and medical experts it is sending around the world. Second, it seeks to obscure the origins of the virus. According to Wye, the timeline of the "Chinese narrative begins with the lockdown in Wuhan and the resolute action of the party to control it," not before."They are not at all keen on exploring the origins because that shows up real weaknesses in what they did," he told CNN Business. Third, Wye said, there is an attempt by Chinese officials to "sow confusion" about the way other countries have responded. That's part of an effort, "to undermine the credibility of those who are critiquing China and to strengthen the credibility of the Chinese narrative," he added.Of course, China is not alone in spreading confusing and conflicting information about the virus. US President Donald Trump has shared dubious medical claims, unverified origin theories, and attacked state governors over coronavirus testing capabilities, comments that have been amplified by the megaphone of sympathetic media outlets such as Fox News. But Beijing's push on the coronavirus appears to be part of a broader effort in recent years to become more aggressive with its messaging abroad, both through traditional channels such as television networks, and through more targeted use of social media --- even on platforms banned in China itself.The effort has been heightened during a war of words between China and some Western governments over the coronavirus. Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have said China could have done more to prevent the pandemic and suggested, without providing evidence, that the virus may have originated in a Wuhan laboratory. In an interview with Fox Business on Thursday, Trump threatened to cut off relations with China over its handling of the virus. In Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has called for an "independent assessment of how this all occurred, so we can learn the lessons and prevent it from happening again."Chinese officials have lambasted "lies" that it said were fabricated by US politicians and media outlets to "shift the blame to China for their inadequate response to Covid-19." One Chinese state media editor called Australia "chewing gum stuck to the sole of China's shoes." China has also pushed back firmly against allegations that it is spreading misinformation. In an 11,000-word rebuke of US claims carried by state media over the weekend, the Chinese foreign ministry said "China has all along been open and transparent in information release.""Some US politicians, scholars and media outlets that are hostile to China have kept slandering and attacking China. China is a victim of disinformation," the ministry said. China: The hero in state mediaOne of the ways China spreads its message is through foreign language state-funded media outlets around the world, including newspapers such as the China Daily and Global Times, and television networks like China Global Television Network (CGTN).The network, which says it has staff in more than 70 countries and in 2019 expanded in Europe by opening a 30,000 square foot London bureau, employs a mix of local and Chinese staff in all its offices. Like other state-owned outlets, CGTN broadcasts a mix of news about the pandemic, alongside content even some of its own staffers call "pure propaganda." A current employee and a former staffer at CGTN, who spoke to CNN Business on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said that while they generally have freedom to report on some topics, others are considered off limits. And sometimes, the former staffer said, arguments between Western employees and their Chinese superiors would break out over segments about the Hong Kong protests or Uyghur detention camps in Xinjiang. (CGTN has been forced to register as a foreign agent in the United States and is currently under investigation by the UK media regulator for fairness and impartiality in its coverage of the Hong Kong protests). "Their argument on coronavirus is they say China has been open and transparent. It's the same political bullsh*t Donald Trump or [UK Prime Minister] Boris Johnson has done. Everyone lost the first month on this," the current staffer, a journalist based in the United States, told CNN Business. "Of course the Chinese are more capable of covering stuff up and dripping out new details ... but they're so ham fisted when they do that they're just awful."CGTN did not respond to requests for comment. Straightforward reports about the number of cases or new treatments for the virus appear alongside glowing TV segments on China's successful response to the virus and the aid it is sending around the world. Much of the recent coverage about any supposed Chinese failures has focused on criticism from other countries and how Chinese officials are pushing back. Wye said Chinese state media doesn't just push "simple propaganda" but instead mixes what Western audiences would consider normal reports with more biased segments, to make it more palatable to the outside world. For example, straight reporting on President Xi Jinping's remarks about fighting the coronavirus will be carried as well as glowing pieces about his mother and childhood. "If [the Chinese media] is going to be at all influential it has to be tailored to the society they are trying to get the message to," Wye said. "What they want to do is increasingly both put a strong positive narrative for China and also to reduce or weaken the credibility of reports that are less than complimentary about what is happening in China."Questioning the origins on social mediaOn social media, a more sinister approach to news about China and the coronavirus has been underway for weeks. Messages questioning the origins of the virus, some even suggesting it was created by the United States, have been pushed online by some Chinese officials, and then repeated by Chinese state media. A tweet from the Chinese embassy in South Africa cast doubt on the notion that the virus started in China.And Zhao Lijian, a senior spokesperson in China's ministry of foreign affairs, has become infamous for his aggressive comments on Twitter, which is banned in China.In a March tweet, he suggested that the US army may have brought the virus to Wuhan, a conspiracy theory that has caused an army reservist from Virginia to become the target of online smear campaigns and attacks. The reservist was in Wuhan last October as part of a US military athletics team.Zhao's tweet caused US officials to summon China's ambassador to the State Department. The Chinese foreign ministry has defended Zhao's tweets."If you keep picking on him just for citing this word 'might,' then how about the US President, Vice President, Secretary of State, the State Department spokesperson and some lawmakers, who falsely accused that the virus came from lab in Wuhan, saying the virus was man-made or leaked? Have you ever questioned them?," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying asked reporters at a press briefing last week. US reporters have challenged the Trump administration about that claim and have been given no evidence to support it. But it's not just the US administration that's pointing fingers.A report by the European Union's External Action Service released last month found that China and Russia "have continued to widely target conspiracy narratives and disinformation both at public audiences in the EU and the wider neighborhood." The report also found "evidence of a coordinated push by official Chinese sources to deflect any blame for the outbreak of the pandemic."EU officials had to deny reports by several outlets that the wording of its investigation had been softened after pressure from China. A few days later, EU officials admitted that they allowed the Chinese government to censor an opinion piece by EU ambassadors to China published in the China Daily, removing a reference to the origin of the coronavirus outbreak and its subsequent spread worldwide."The whole point of this kind of disinformation is it's not just the credibility, it's everybody's credibility that is undermined by all this so that it is very difficult then to establish a clear exposition of how this all started," said Chatham House's Wye.Muddying the waters The US State Department said it has found evidence that a network of Chinese operatives have spread coronavirus misinformation online about the origins of the virus and the United States' response. Last month, US intelligence agencies assessed that Chinese operatives helped push inaccurate messages about the US response to the pandemic across social media and text platforms, including one that said President Trump was issuing a nationwide lockdown. Lea Gabrielle, head of the State Department's Global Engagement Center --- which coordinates efforts to expose foreign disinformation and propaganda --- told reporters last week that Chinese government-linked social media accounts have spread questionable "concerns" about US-funded bio safety labs in the former Soviet Union, "mainly to try to take attention away from concerns about the labs in Wuhan." Other Chinese government-linked accounts have pushed "positive messages" on Beijing's coronavirus response, she said, "to convey that only the [People's Republic of China's] handling of the crisis is a model for others and that the PRC is superior." Gabrielle said her team has found evidence that these efforts are supported by a network of inauthentic coordinated accounts on Twitter.The social media platform told CNN last week its initial review of a portion of the accounts flagged by the State Department does not support such claims. According to Twitter, numerous accounts belong instead to government entities, nongovernmental organizations, and journalists. In response to the State Department's allegations, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao highlighted Twitter's response and told reporters on Wednesday that "China is always opposed to creating and disseminating false information. Reports that claim China has been spreading disinformation on Twitter are groundless." Questionable successChina's coronavirus campaign appears to have had mixed success so far. A poll in Italy released last month found that for the first time Italians are looking more to China than to the United States as a potential international partner. But Chinese state media have had paid-content insert deals canceled by influential papers. A spokesperson for The New York Times told CNN Business it has stopped running the advertisements that are meant to look like news articles. The UK's Telegraph has also stopped taking such pieces and has deleted them from its website, according to The Guardian, including a piece headlined "Why are some framing China's heroic efforts to stop coronavirus as inhumane?" The Telegraph did not respond to a request for comment.A survey conducted by Pew in March and published last month found that about two-thirds of Americans now have a negative opinion of China, the highest percentage recorded since the research center began asking the question in 2005.A think tank affiliated with China's Ministry of State Security issued a report last month saying anti-China sentiment around the world is at its highest since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, according to Reuters.Bill Bishop, the publisher of the Sinocism newsletter and a longtime observer of Chinese diplomacy, told CNN Business the Chinese have angered many western countries like Australia, France and the United States with the disinformation campaigns and the questionable theories floated by their diplomats. "In some ways we should just let [the Chinese] talk and let the facts speak for themselves," he said. "Right now China is really digging its own hole in many ways. Sometimes it's better to just let people dig."Steven Jiang contributed reporting.TM & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

His involvement with the Chinese government included recruiting skilled individuals to the Thousand Talent Program, which in some cases has resulted in violations of U.S. law, such as espionage, theft of trade secrets, and grant fraud.Link to ImageStudents walk through Harvard Yard on the campus of Harvard University on March 12, 2020 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

China's Evolving Coronavirus Criteria Could Have Led to Massive Undercount of Cases, Study FindsUSNEWS.comApril 23, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 U.S. News & World Report All Rights ReservedSection: NEWS; World Report; Vol.; No.Length: 444 wordsByline: Alexa LardieriHighlight: A study found that changes in how the coronavirus was defined in China 'had a clear effect on the proportion of infections that were identified and counted.'BodyThe actual number of COVID-19 cases in China could be as much as four times higher than what officials have reported. A study published in the Lancet by researchers from Hong Kong estimates that China might have had tens of thousands more coronavirus cases than officials have disclosed. The researchers attribute the undercount to China's changing definition of what qualifies as a confirmed coronavirus case. The study examined changes in the case definition for coronavirus in mainland China during the first wave of the outbreak. While the definition for COVID-19 was initially narrow, it gradually expanded as knowledge increased. "When a new infectious disease emerges, appropriate case definitions are important for clinical diagnosis and for public health surveillance," the study states. "From Jan. 15 to March 3, 2020, seven versions of the case definition for COVID-19 were issued by the National Health Commission in China. We estimated that when the case definitions were changed, the proportion of infections being detected as cases increased." The researchers found that the changes in how the coronavirus was defined "had a clear effect on the proportion of infections that were identified and counted as confirmed cases." Health officials report more than 83,875 cases of COVID-19 in China and 4,636 deaths. However, researchers in the Hong Kong study estimate that the actual number of cases could top 250,000. The way coronavirus cases have been counted in China has changed several times, and officials have had to revise the case count and death toll. Experts have raised concerns over how the country counts asymptomatic cases, and Beijing has been criticized over how it handled the pandemic, which originated in Wuhan, China. The Chinese government has repeatedly denied accusations that it purposefully withheld and covered up information or was too slow responding to the outbreak, but the country's numbers have been met with widespread skepticism.Alexa Lardieri is a reporter and digital producer for the Civic section of U.S. News & World Report, where she writes about breaking news.

Lawsuit: China hid virus information, should pay billionsAssociated Press State & LocalMarch 24, 2020 Tuesday 10:24 PM GMTCopyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights ReservedSection: BUSINESS NEWSLength: 794 wordsByline: By KEN RITTER, Associated PressDateline: LAS VEGAS BodyLAS VEGAS (AP) - An attorney who represented victims of the Las Vegas shooting massacre has filed a federal lawsuit against China's government over the new coronavirus, saying Tuesday that officials hid information about the outbreak and that U.S. small businesses should receive billions of dollars in damages. The case seeks class-action status for 32 million businesses for lost income and profits.The lawsuit, filed on behalf of five Law Vegas businesses, claims that China's government should have shared more information about the virus but intimidated doctors, scientists, journalists and lawyers while allowing the COVID-19 respiratory illness to spread, attorney Robert Eglet told reporters."They engaged in falsehoods, misinformation, cover-ups and destruction of evidence," the attorney said.Eglet represented about 2,500 people last year in an $800 million settlement with Mandalay Bay casino-hotel owner MGM Resorts International stemming from the deadliest mass killing in modern American history - the October 2017 shooting that left 58 people dead and more than 850 injured at an open-air concert on the Las Vegas Strip.Eglet also won hundreds of millions of dollars in verdicts and settlements against pharmaceutical firms and healthcare companies after a Las Vegas hepatitis C outbreak and is handling Nevada's largest lawsuits against drug manufacturers accused of fueling the nation's opioid addiction crisis.His plaintiffs in the coronavirus case filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Nevada are owners of a restaurant, a flower seller, two real estate businesses and a CPR training firm. Eglet said the five are representative of tens of millions of other businesses that could become plaintiffs because they have also suffered economically whose damages could end up in the trillions of dollars.China's government was reckless and negligent as the virus spread, the attorney said."If they had been transparent with the world this could have been stopped in Wuhan," Eglet said, referring to the Chinese city identified as the original epicenter of the outbreak. "The world could have come together and gotten the right scientists to Wuhan and stopped it right there."Chinese Embassy officials in the U.S. did not immediately respond to email messages seeking comment. Court records did not say whether the lawsuit has been served to Chinese officials or their representatives and no defense attorney was identified.But in comments Tuesday before Eglet announced the lawsuit, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said there is "great anger and strong opposition from the Chinese people" on use of the terms "Chinese virus" and "Wuhan virus" to describe the coronavirus. President Donald Trump is among those who have called it the "Chinese virus" and defended that term."I want to point out that it was the U.S. side that started this argument," the foreign ministry spokesman said. "I wish certain people in the U.S. could heed the reasonable voice at home and from the international community and stop making wrongful remarks that stigmatize China."More than 400,000 people worldwide have been diagnosed with COVID-19, including more than 51,000 in the U.S. More than 18,000 people have died, including more than 600 Americans. In Nevada, 278 people have tested positive for the virus. Four have died, all in the Las Vegas area.Health officials have said most patients exhibit mild or moderate fever and cough. The vast majority recover. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, severe symptoms including pneumonia can occur.The lawsuit points to trillions of dollars in trade between the U.S. and China, and says small U.S. businesses deserve compensation from China, its ministries including health and emergency affairs and Hubei provincial and Wuhan city authorities for negligence, creating a public nuisance and "liability for conducting ultrahazardous activity."Eglet said he knew of two other lawsuits filed in Florida and Texas against China stemming from the outbreak. He said he believed those cases are overly broad in classes of plaintiffs and will be unwieldy. The Las Vegas case focuses on businesses with 500 or less employees, he said."This class-action is just laser-focused on small businesses," he said. "This lawsuit is not directed at the people of China. No one is blaming the people of China and no one is blaming Chinese-Americans. They are as much a victim of the Chinese government's actions and inactions as the rest of the world."Eglet said the case is based on the U.S. Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act of 1976 and U.S. federal law "for acts outside the territory of the U.S. that have a direct effect on the United States." It could take years to resolve, he said.Load-Date: March 25, 2020End of Document

Reps. Walden, Rodgers Demand Answers From ByteDance on TikTok Data Privacy Concerns, Ties to Chinese Communist PartyTargeted News ServiceMay 22, 2020 Friday 11:47 PM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 1914 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyRep. Greg Walden, R-Oregon, ranking Republican member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, issued the following news release:Energy and Commerce Committee Republican Leader Greg Walden (R-OR) and Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee Republican Leader Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) penned a letter to ByteDance Founder and CEO Mr. Yiming Zhang regarding data privacy concerns with TikTok.The letter asks 22 questions related to TikTok's potential violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA); TikTok's collection and use of American's information and whether such information is being shared with the Chinese Communist Party; TikTok's corporate governance; and issues related to the COVID-19 crisis."We are living through an unprecedented time due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. As a result of this pandemic, millions of our citizens, through no fault of their own, have no choice but to stay home.

As a result of this pandemic, millions of our citizens, through no fault of their own, have no choice but to stay home. In doing so, they rely on the Internet to connect them to families, friends, and vital services. As a result, mobile application downloads have increased dramatically, especially TikTok. In fact, there has been a spike in both unique users and time spent on TikTok in recent months.1 Congress has significant concerns over TikTok's data practices, including whether TikTok continues to violate the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and whether TikTok shares American user's information with the Chinese Communist Party.First, issues regarding TikTok's compliance with COPPA are not new. On February 27, 2019, TikTok agreed to pay $5.7 million to settle with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for violations of COPPA.2 Specifically, TikTok failed to notify parents about the collection and use of personal information from users under 13, obtain parental consent before such collection and use, and delete personal information as requested by parents.3 Last week, a group of child privacy advocates filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission claiming TikTok is violating its COPPA order with the FTC.4 Among other issues, the groups claim that TikTok has not removed videos previously uploaded by children under 13 and that TikTok has no means for obtaining verifiable parental consent.5 We share similar concerns.Second, ByteDance's rumored close ties to the Chinese Communist Party raise serious concerns about whether information collected by TikTok on American users is being shared with the Chinese government. Previous reports suggest that ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, coordinates with the Chinese government to facilitate human rights abuses against Uighur Muslims and to spread the communist party's propaganda.6 Further, TikTok has been accused of pressuring U.S.-based employees to censor videos that the Chinese government finds objectionable and culturally problematic.7 Moreover, TikTok reportedly censors sensitive political content and videos critical of the communist party.8 TikTok's seemingly close ties to the Chinese government raise serious concerns about your data practices, including what information your company collects on Americans and what you do with it.Accordingly, please provide written answers and any related documentation to the following questions no later than June 5, 2020:Questions Related to COPPA Compliance:1. Pursuant to the February 27, 2019, FTC order, for users of accounts existing at the time of the order who identified as under age 13, has TikTok destroyed such users' personal information?a. If yes, please provide documentary evidence to support your answer. If no, please explain why.2. Please explain how TikTok ensures a parent of a user under age 13 receives direct notice of TikTok's data practices, including how information on the user is collected, why such information is collected, and if such information is shared or otherwise disclosed with third parties.3. Please explain when and how a parent receives a request for consent to collect and use personal information of a user under age 13.4. Please explain how TikTok obtains verifiable parental consent, including in the event of any material change to how TikTok collects, uses, or discloses information about a user to which a parent has previously consented.5. Please explain how TikTok verifies a parent is who they claim to be when making requests on behalf of a user under age 13.6. Please explain how TikTok fulfills verifiable parental requests for a description of the specific types or categories of personal information collected from a user under age 13.7. Please explain how TikTok fulfills verifiable parental requests to refuse to allow TikTok to further use or collect personal information from a user under age 13.8. Please explain how TikTok fulfills verifiable parental requests to delete the personal information of a user under age 13.9. Please explain TikTok's retention policy for information collected and used about a user under age 13, including why retaining such information is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which the information was collected.10. Please explain what additional safety and privacy protections are included and implemented on *TikTok for Younger Users* and how you monitor such application to ensure compliance with COPPA.11. Please explain what steps TikTok takes to ensure a user on *TikTok for Younger Users* does not also have an account on TikTok.12. Please explain what steps TikTok takes to ensure personal information collected on *TikTok for Younger Users* is not comingled or otherwise used in conjunction with personal information collected on TikTok.Questions Related to TikTok's Data Practices:13. Please explain how TikTok collects information on Americans and what specific categories of information are collected.14. Please explain why TikTok collects the specific categories of information it collects on Americans and for what purposes such information is collected.15. Please identify the categories of third parties TikTok shares information it collects on Americans and explain for what purpose such information is shared to those third parties.16. For any information TikTok collects on Americans, please answer the following: a. Does TikTok share such information with the Chinese Communist Party? If yes, please explain what information is shared, why such information is shared, and under what circumstances such information is shared.b. Does the Chinese Communist Party have access, either directly or indirectly, to such information? If yes, please explain.c. Does TikTok share such information with any Chinese state-owned entity? If yes, please identify the categories of such entities.d. Do any Chinese state-owned entities have access, either directly or indirectly, to such information?e. Does TikTok maintain and store such information in China?17. Does TikTok have a data sharing agreement with the Chinese Communist Party or any Chinese state-owned entity? If yes, please explain what the agreement covers and why.18. Please identify each country TikTok sends, maintains, or stores information collected on Americans.a. For each country, please identify whether the government or an entity on behalf of such government has access to such information.Questions Related to Corporate Governance:19. News organizations have previously reported that Chinese Communist Party committees exist within Chinese technology companies. Can you assure us that no presence exists within your corporate architecture?20. News reports indicate that ByteDance will have a new Corporate Operating Officer (COO), who will also serve as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of TikTok.a. If the individual is both CEO of TikTok and COO of ByteDance, what power will this person have over the privacy policy of the two companies?b. Will this individual have the power to prevent the sharing of Americans' information with Chinese Authorities?c. Will this individual have the power to prevent the censorship of political content on TikTok?d. Will this individual have the power to prevent Chinese Communist Party propaganda on TikTok?e. Will this individual have the power to prevent the use of TikTok to surveil minorities, such as Uighur Muslims, and political dissidents on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party?Questions Related to COVID-19 crisis:21. In light of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, please answer the following: a. Due to the increase in users and user traffic in recent months, has TikTok implemented any additional safeguards to protect information it collects on American users? If yes, please explain.b. Due to the increase in users and user traffic in recent months, has TikTok changed how it processes information collected on American users, including any changes to where such information is transferred and stored? If yes, please explain what changes have been made and why.c. Does TikTok collect any health information about American users? If yes, please explain why and for what purposes.22. Has ByteDance and/or TikTok received any requests to alter, delete, or block content that runs counter to the official line of the Chinese government in response to its handling of the COVID-19 crisis?If you have any questions, please contact Tim Kurth and Bijan Koohmaraie at (202) 2253641. Thank you for your prompt attention to this request.Sincerely,Greg Walden, Republican LeaderCathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican Leader, Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, and Commerce* * *Footnotes:1 https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-consumers-are-flocking-to-tiktok2 https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/02/video-social-networking-app-musically-agrees-settle-ftc3 Id.4 https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258502/tiktok-complaint-child-privacy-ftc5 https://commercialfreechildhood.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tik_tok_complaint.pdf6 https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-parent-company-bytedance-spreads-chinese-propaganda-report-2019-117 https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-china-censorship-employees-restrict-content-dancing-vaping-2019-118 https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-apology-china-muslims-viral-video-feroza-aziz-suspend-politics-2019-11Copyright Targeted News Servicesnull-7119417 T40-MgEditorLoad-Date: May 23, 2020End of Document

COVID-19: THE IMPACT ON U.S.-CHINA RELATIONSStates News ServiceMay 20, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 687 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: BETHLEHEM, PA BodyThe following information was released by Lehigh University:A: There will be some choppy seas ahead in U.S.-China relations, worse than any previous troubles since 1979. History does not repeat itself with identical scenes, but similar patterns and themes may recur. The U.S. and China are not yet heading toward exactly the same kind of cold war between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. where they led opposing alliance systems and separate economic blocs to wage a global ideological struggle, strategic rivalry and economic warfare. But a similar, competitive relationship may be already developing at a regional scale, sending profound ripple effects around the world, at least in the areas of public health, supply chains and Information Technology (IT) standard-setting, etc.If the current downward spiral continues, I will not be surprised if this regional competition spills into strategic and military issue areas and expands to a global scale.Q: How should the U.S. respond to the way China handled COVID-19?A: In my view, the U.S. should respond to China in this pandemic with a multi-pronged approach. The priority ought to be to encourage and engage in biomedical cooperation with Chinese scientists and doctors, as much as the U.S. should be doing so with other affected countries, to work toward a fast, effective solution to curb the pandemic, save lives and revitalize the global economy. This is the best way that the U.S. can demonstrate and enhance its world leadership when the world needs it the most. Whether such collaborative work should be done through W.H.O. (World Health Organization) or alternative international institutions is a matter that can be discussed, but isolating and demonizing China at this point would be counterproductive (since, after all, China is where the first outbreak occurred, and Chinese scientists likely have better information and data on the virus), and would be punishing American people and people of the rest of the world rather than punishing China, especially the Chinese government.At the same time, the U.S. can make a principled statement for now on its deep concerns about the origins of the virus and China's initial cover-up, but then leave the matter as it is until the pandemic is under control. Again, it hurts the U.S. image if Washington gives out the impression that it cares about knocking down China more than saving human lives. Finally, any efforts to compel China and/or the W.H.O. to come to terms with their mishandling of the pandemic should be done in close consultation and collaboration with other governments, especially U.S. allies, partners and friends. Even a hegemon in an unipolar world has to back up its actions with wide international legitimacy. As the U.S. power experiences a relative decline in an increasingly multipolar world, it more than ever needs to work with others rather than going it alone.Q: Do you agree with the way President [Donald] Trump talks about China? Why?A: Trump has said various things about China since he's been in office, some of which contradict others. I take his administration's position that U.S. policy to China needs a fundamental rethinking since the line of engagement from [President Bill] Clinton to [President Barack] Obama has proven ineffective in coping with Xi Jinping's China. But having been in power for nearly four years, he still has not formed a coherent overall grand strategy, of which a strategy toward China is an integral part. His policies toward China tend to be ad hoc, piecemeal and frequently vacillating. In other words, he has no shortage of clever tactics but lacks well-thought-out strategies vis-a-vis China. As a result, his way of talking about China is unpredictable and frequently misleading. It's like writing a paper without first drawing up an outline. His praises can be just lip service, his attacks may just be posturing and his threats lack credibility. These are some examples of his problems. China needs to first take the U.S. president seriously before they will take the U.S.' words and actions seriously. Trump can use some wisdom and help in that regard.Load-Date: May 21, 2020End of Document

Center for Strategic and International Studies: Managing Semiconductor Exports to ChinaTargeted News ServiceMay 6, 2020 Wednesday 10:17 AM  ESTCopyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 2793 wordsByline: Targeted News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe Center for Strategic and International Studies issued the following commentary by James Andrew Lewis, senior vice president and director of Technology Policy Program:It may seem counterintuitive to say that the United States should continue to allow semiconductor exports to China, but this is because the goal may be misstated. The goal is not to prevent China from building its own semiconductor industry. The United States can slow this, but it cannot stop it. The goal is to keep the U.S. semiconductor industry strong.As the Trump administration moves forward with expanded restrictions on semiconductor exports to China, it should base decisions on two general criteria: (1) the measures should not harm U.S. companies more than China, and (2) the measures should not be symbolic, attempting to restrict sales or transfers of commodity technologies or technologies available from foreign sources.These points may seem obvious, but there are important examples where attempts to block technology transfer did major harm to U.S. companies while only accelerating the growth of suppliers outside the United States. These include satellites, machine tools, and encryption (for a time). When the United States banned the export of satellite components to China, all that foreign companies did was design U.S. components out of their products and build alternate sources of supply.We risk making the same error with semiconductors. The desire to restrict exports is understandable. China is still dependent on the West for advanced technology, although this dependence is shrinking. But overly broad restrictions will harm the United States more than China. Here are seven conclusions that can help guide U.S. policy on semiconductors and China.1. The United States is not going to stop China from making basic semiconductors any more than it stopped Japan or Korea. China's decades of investment and strong science and technology workforce mean that it will eventually be a chip producer. The United States is also not going to put Huawei out of business. Huawei has been harmed by the U.S. effort to call attention to its years of untrustworthy behavior, but the Chinese government will not allow it to collapse--Huawei is too important. U.S. restrictions on exports to Huawei of commodity end-items such as chips and operating systems have only accelerated the company's efforts to develop alternative sources of supply. Its subsidiary's (HiSilicon) strong chip design capabilities and access to fabless production services have allowed Huawei to begin to design out some U.S. chips.China has always wanted a strong semiconductor industry. It began its efforts to develop an indigenous industry more than 30 years ago. Progress has been uneven, but the Chinese commitment has remained steady. China hopes to make all categories of chips and displace Western suppliers. To do this, China has used massive investments in semiconductor production and commercial espionage to steal semiconductor technology. Its efforts have not paid off, but that is beginning to change for some categories of chips, most notably in memory chips, where China is becoming competitive in producing "NAND" chips ("NAND" refers to the operation the chip performs). However, China cannot yet make more advanced categories of chips.2. China is not going to play by the rules in the competition over semiconductors. Some years ago, an internal policy debate between those in China who wanted a more internationalist approach to trade versus those who wanted a unilateral approach was settled in favor of the latter. Under Xi Jinping, this tendency has grown even more pronounced. The United States would need an astute diplomatic strategy to change this, but this would take years and will not happen while Xi is in power. This means we can expect to see increased pressure from China on Taiwanese and Japanese suppliers, more Chinese acquisition efforts and other financial dealings in Europe, and increased espionage against the United States in the battle over semiconductors.3. Fujian Jinhua is a good precedent for U.S. policy. This Chinese chip company stole memory chip technology from an U.S. firm and was placed under sanction by the United States as a result, ultimately forcing the company to stop production. If Chinese companies are allowed to sell products made using stolen technology--and there are examples in the aircraft, railcar, automotive, battery, and green energy industries (to name a few)--there is no penalty for intellectual property (IP) theft. Traditional remedies using World Trade Organization processes are inadequate for holding Chinese companies accountable, as they are slow and were designed to deal with individual cases, not a major national program of IP theft. Promises in the trade deal are viewed skeptically.U.S. export controls were not designed for a hostile power with which the United States has an exceptionally close economic relationship. Cold War controls were developed at a time when the interconnections between Western and communist economies were almost non-existent. In contrast, China encouraged foreign investment and was a lucrative market for Western companies. The result was a deeply interconnected supply chain.The 2016 decision to allow the U.S. chipmaker AMD to enter a joint venture with a Chinese firm and supply it with technology for logic chips is a good example of the problems with outmoded controls. It gave China access to a chip technology it had long sought unsuccessfully. The AMD transfer was allowed to go forward because it was legitimate under existing export control rules. While approval has since been reversed, it is clear these rules were designed for the Cold War, not for competition with China.The AMD case points to the need to accelerate export control modernization. Recently announced Commerce Department regulatory changes could be a good first step if they are implemented in ways that allow continued exports of commodity chips to China or the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME) to U.S. firms operating in China. If the goal of new controls is to acquire knowledge of PLA supply chains and front companies, earlier rules on encryption where companies were required to notify an export but did not need a license unless otherwise informed by the Commerce Department might be a good precedent.4. Semiconductor manufacturing equipment is a chokepoint, but the United States does not want to accidentally choke U.S. or allied companies. The United States produces about half of SME, and Japan makes another third. The most advanced equipment comes from these two countries (and one Dutch supplier, ASML). Restrictions on SME exports to China, if used carefully, would slow China's semiconductor growth. A straightforward approach would block export to Chinese companies while allowing sales to U.S. and Japanese firms, even if they are located in China. Complex and expensive, SME is impossible to divert from one company to another, and in more than 20 years of SME exports to U.S firms in China, there have been no cases of diversion.5. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is a problem. It is the primary source of indigenously designed, advanced Chinese semiconductors. If the United States blocks exports of commodity chips, China (and Huawei) will design replacements and look to TSMC to make them. This is not an easy problem to resolve since U.S. companies also depend on TSMC for "fabless" production (where a company designs a chip but has a contractor make it). Apple's announcement that it would make chips of its own design at TSMC is an example of this.Semiconductors are not easy to make. This has been the primary obstacle to China's progress in developing an indigenous industry. Chip making requires advanced manufacturing equipment, complex IP, chip design capabilities, lithography "masks," and software design tools, many of which are proprietary. The manufacturing process has become progressively more complex as the chips' feature size has become microscopically small, making semiconductor manufacturing a question of working at the cutting edge of physics and materials science. It is not enough to buy production equipment and steal IP and technology. You need "know-how," the skill sets developed through years of experience.China tried to overcome the "know-how problem" in several ways. A few years ago, instead of buying semiconductor technology, it attempted to acquire entire companies to gain know-how. Decisions by CFIUS to block sales and changes in U.S. foreign investment regulation closed off this avenue. A second approach is to encourage individuals who have acquired know-how by working for a foreign chip company to return to China and start a business there. SMIC, for example, was founded by a long-time employee of Texas Instruments. This approach has had some success, but it is difficult to scale, as you need more than a few individuals to make semiconductor manufacturing work. The most successful solution has been for China to develop semiconductor design capabilities and then contract out manufacturing to companies such as TSMC.TSMC and other foreign producers create a "threshold" above which any U.S. restrictions will be ineffective. A solution to TSMC will require a combination of product retransfer controls for SME, which would stop TSMC from supporting Chinese companies, but this could be politically difficult for Taiwan and very damaging for TSMC. It is unusual to impose export restrictions on the products of transferred technology, but there are precedents from the world on nonproliferation and munitions.6. Increased counterintelligence efforts are essential. To be fully effective in stopping illicit technology transfer, restrictions on exports and Chinese investment are essential but must be accompanied by more aggressive efforts to stop the illicit acquisition of U.S. technology. This does not require banning all Chinese students, researchers, or tech workers, but it does require greater efforts at denying access to identified Chinese technological intelligence collectors. The FBI and the Department of Justice have made good strides in this direction, but the United States may underestimate the scope of the problem and how much it is likely to grow as new restrictions take effect. This means the United States must devote more resources to counterintelligence.7. The United States should not impose new restrictions on commodity chips. All chips are not created equal. Most chips fall into three broad categories: (1) memory, (2) logic, and (3) specialized chips, such as FGPA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) or chips for telecommunications or AI. Chips come in generations, determined in part by Moore's law, which accurately predicted a doubling in performance every two years, driven by improvement in manufacturing technology and materials. The chips vary in complexity of design and production. Memory and logic chips are essentially commodities, manufactured in the millions at relatively low cost and are widely available from manufactures and resellers around the world.What kind of chips is China able to make? China's decades of investment and strong STEM workforce mean that it will eventually be a significant chip producer, but some chips, even if they are commodities, are still beyond China's ability to produce. China has had the most success in memory chips, and China is only a few years away from being competitive in other categories. Though China cannot yet make the most advanced chips, it aims to eventually produce all categories.Memory chips are semiconductors used to store data. Most digital devices require several kinds of memory chips. China now buys most of these form Western companies (although their fab may be located in China). NAND is one of the most common forms of memory chips, and since their introduction in 1987, they have found their way into a wide variety of consumer devices. Currently, six companies--Samsung Electronics, Toshiba, Western Digital, SK Hynix, Micron Technology, and Intel--dominate the memory chip market (valued at an estimated $58 billion). A new Chinese entrant, Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp (YMTC) is supported directly by the Chinese government from one of its multi-billion-dollar semiconductor investment funds and is gearing up to produce NAND chips.The arrival of a disruptive new entrant has been the norm in the memory chip market for many years, but YMTC's connection to the larger Chinese government strategy of displacement makes it an unusual case. The question is how best to position Western companies to compete with YMTC. Restricting chip exports to give it a protected market is not the answer. New U.S. rules should not restrict exports of memory chips to China unless the United States wants to accelerate YMTC's growth and, ultimately, the growth of the Chinese chip industry.What does this mean for the memory market? If YMTC or other Chinese companies succeed in making commercially viable memory chips, a new source of supply will be introduced and shrink market share and revenue for the other producers. However, if YMTC no longer had access to Western SME or materials, this would slow the company's competitiveness, growth, and its ability to produce more advanced chips.To compete with YMTC, the United States should allow U.S. and Western companies to continue to export to ensure they retain market share and watch the Chinese government closely for illicit behavior promoting YMTC. Even if YMTC can make NAND chips, this is a highly competitive market that requires the ability to coordinate complex research and industrial processes and a global supply and marketing chain. China may be tempted to help YMTC by pressuring memory chip customers to relocate to China for preferential treatment.Export Controls Must Be Part of a Larger StrategyThe best outcome would let U.S. companies continue to sell to China to protect market share and revenue in ways that do not give China strategic advantage. This can be done by permitting exports of commodity chips even to companies such as Huawei. It can also be done by permitting exports of SME to America and firms with facilities in China but not to Chinese firms.The United States needs to strengthen its semiconductor industry. Export regulation is essential but not sufficient. The United States does not need to copy China's top-down industrial policy for semiconductors, but there are areas where federal investment is necessary. First, the United States needs to increase the supply of STEM labor through support for students and research. Second, if the goal is to encourage companies such as TSMC to move semiconductor production facilities from China to the United States, the United States will need to provide subsidies. In both cases, this will entail billion-dollar or larger investment programs. This sounds expensive but is appropriate and necessary for a strategic industry. Third, there are complex IP and trade disputes in semiconductors where the United States should intervene to support U.S. companies.Working with allies--Japan, South Korea, and the European Union--is also essential. These partners are increasingly concerned by China's efforts to manipulate the market and are prepared to cooperate to minimize market disruption and restrict access to SME. U.S. policy is more likely to succeed if done cooperatively as part of a larger strategy to reinforce the U.S. semiconductor industry, but this strategy has yet to be fully defined.Semiconductors are the backbone of the digital economy. Their primary use is commercial, but there are also important military applications. The ability to manufacture chips plays a leading role in the growing technological competition between the United States and China, not just in semiconductors but in other important areas such as AI. There are deep interconnections between the two economies, and China is committed to restructuring those connections to favor its interests. But this is a winnable fight. The United States needs to pull back from its close economic integration with China, but this will need to be done carefully and in ways that best support the continued strength of the U.S. semiconductor industry.James Andrew Lewis is a senior vice president and director of the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.[Category: Political]Contact: H.

BANKS CALLS FOR INVESTIGATION INTO THREE MISSING CHINESE JOURNALISTSStates News ServiceApril 1, 2020 WednesdayCopyright 2020 States News ServiceLength: 1085 wordsByline: States News ServiceDateline: WASHINGTON BodyThe following information was released by the office of Indiana Rep. Jim Banks:Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN), member of the House Armed Services Committee, sent a letter to the State Department to request the U.S. investigate the disappearances of three Chinese journalists critical to the world learning about the #COVID19 outbreak in Wuhan and prompting the Chinese government to acknowledge the crisis."We owe these journalists a debt of gratitude for their sacrifice. As part of our investigation into the origins of this outbreak and the subsequent cover-up by the Chinese Communist Party, the United States should apply diplomatic pressure on the Chinese government to learn these journalists' whereabouts and ensure their safety," said Banks.Please find a copy of that letter sent today below. Let me know if you would like to obtain a .pdf copy.---Nathan A. SalesActing Undersecretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human RightsU.S. Department of State 2201 C St NWWashington, DC 20520Dear Undersecretary Sales,I'm writing you out of concern over the separate disappearances of three Chinese citizen-journalist, each of whom had been independently reporting on the outbreak of COVID-19 in the People's Republic of China's Hubei province.Mr. Fang Bin is a clothing salesman in the city of Wuhan. In late January, as coronavirus became an increasing public health problem in Wuhan, Mr. Fang began to upload footage to YouTube of a city stricken by coronavirus; including hectic hospitals, empty streets, health workers in hazmat suits, and a viral video of eight body bags stacked inside of a bus. According to Mr. Fang, he began sharing footage because he "wanted to go and see what's actually happening. It's what any normal citizen should do." On February 2, Mr. Fang reported that he had been questioned by Chinese Communist Party Officials and had his video equipment confiscated. He uploaded his last YouTube video on February 9 and hasn't been seen since.Chen Quishi is a Chinese citizen journalist who first rose to public attention for his coverage of the pro-democracy Hong Kong protests. Mr. Chen traveled to Wuhan in late January where he began shooting videos of hospitals and interviews with local residents. He was last seen on February 6, and on February 7 his family reported that Chinese Communist Party authorities had informed them that Chen was being detained. In an interview with Jonathan Swan of Axios, China's Ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, claimed he, "had not heard of" Chen Quishi, despite being asked about him during a CBS Face the Nation interview a month earlier.Li Zehua was an anchor for the state-run channel, China Central Television (CCTV). He resigned in February to independently report on the coronavirus outbreak. On February 26, Li livestreamed his chase and subsequent arrest by Chinese authorities. Li has not been seen since.All three of these men understood the personal risk associated with independently reporting on coronavirus in China, but they did it anyway. They decided that they had an obligation to do what the Chinese Communist Party would notprovide useful and accurate information to the Chinese public about the risks and potential consequences of coronavirus. For their service, the Chinese government imprisoned themor worse.The State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor's mission statement is to "champion American values... we stand for the freedoms of religion, speech, and the press." Historically, the State Department has acted against foreigners who egregiously violate journalists' rights. After the killing of Saudi Arabian journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo publicly designated seventeen people for their role in the killing of Khashoggi. Under Section 7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 2019 (Section 7031(c)), the individuals and their immediate family members are barred from entering the United States.To properly respond to the disappearances of Li, Fang, and Chen, the State Department needs to understand the circumstances around their detention. To that end, I would ask the State Department to officially call on the government of the People's Republic of China to open an investigation into the three citizen journalists' whereabouts. For obvious reasons, it's my opinion that the State Department should then open its own concurrent investigation using diplomatic and civilian channels.When the State Department is able to identify the individuals responsible for Li, Chen and Fang's mistreatment, I would request Secretary Pompeo to publicly designate them for their role in the detainment of citizen-journalists under Section 7031(C). That statute allows the Secretary of State to block "officials of foreign governments... involved in gross violations of human rights," from entering the United States. If any of the three citizen journalists were murdered, I would urge Secretary of State Pompeo and Secretary of Treasury Mnuchin to respectively administer visa and financial sanctions under section 1263 of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act to the responsible individuals.Fang Bin, Chen Quishi and Li Zehua sought to protect their countrymen. The Chinese government claims to share their goal, but it persecuted them for providing useful and necessary information to the people it supposedly serves. And these three men are not alone. As of early February, the Chinese government had punished 300 of its citizens for "spreading rumors" about coronavirus. While it censors information at home, the Chinese Communist Party is simultaneously engaged in a global propaganda blitz downplaying its culpability for the coronavirus pandemic. Ironically, part of China's responsibility for the spread of coronavirus arises from its early censorship of doctors, like the deceased Li Wenliang, who tried to share information about the virus in late December. Of course, censorship of any kind is immoral, but during a global pandemic it threatens the public's healthin China and abroad. For the sake of justice and the health and safety of the United States, the Chinese people and the rest of the world, I urge you to open an investigation into the disappearance of these three citizen-journalists.Sincerely,JIM BANKSMember of CongressCC:The Honorable Steven T.

However, the company's three mines are located in municipalities with low or no transmission of the SARS-CoV2 virus. Therefore, Endeavour now anticipates reopening its mines around May 18, pursuant to the government decree. The company has also filed applications for exemptions to reopen earlier if feasible and permitted.Endeavour also announces the filing of a final short form base shelf prospectus to provide the company with the flexibility to take advantage of debt, convertible debt, equity, and other financing opportunities that may arise during the 25-month effective period of the Prospectus.17:17CONE CyrusOne beats by $0.03, misses on revs; reaffirms FY20 FFO guidance, slightly adjusts FY20 revenue guidance (71.64 -2.96)Reports Q1 (Mar) funds from operations of $0.97 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.94; revenues rose 8.9% year/year to $245.1 mln vs the $249.49 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The original suspension period has been extended to May 31, 2020; however, the government is reviewing the possibility of lifting restrictions in certain regions on May 18, 2020, provided those regions remain without positive cases.To date, operating activities at Young-Davidson have not been significantly impacted with mining and processing activities and work on the lower mine expansion ongoing. However, as a result of labour and productivity constraints resulting from the above noted health and safety measures, the lower mine expansion project is now expected to be completed in July 2020, a slight delay from previous guidance of June 2020.Given the downtime at both Island Gold and Mulatos, and the potential for further voluntary or government-mandated business interruptions, the Company withdrew its 2020 production, cost and capital guidance on April 2, 2020.17:04TFX Teleflex expands production of ISO-Gard Masks (353.13 +12.86)ISO-Gard Mask is a product that supports patients and clinicians when oxygen assistance is required.17:04AWK American Water Works's Indiana American Water acquires Town of Riley's wastewater system in western Indiana (125.72 -0.80)The purchase of the system adds approx. 460 wastewater customers to the company's customer base, which represents a population of more than 1,240 residents.16:49XOM Exxon Mobil declares cash dividend of $0.87/share for Q2, maintaining the dividend level paid in Q1 (47.46 +2.49)16:48ALGN Align Tech announces that two million teenaged patients have now started orthodontic treatment with the Invisalign system (220.58 +17.07)The two-millionth teen patient is one of more than eight million Invisalign patients of all ages worldwide.

The demand deterioration that we started to see in March has increased through the month of April with POS levels in the North American imprintables channel down approximately 75%. Sell-through trends in retail, including with global lifestyle brand customers, have also deteriorated, with overall retailer POS for our products in April down approximately 45%. Based on this situation and the expectation that COVID-19 social distancing measures and related economic impacts will have a significant impact on demand during the quarter, we are planning for a significant decline in point of sale (POS) and shipments for the second quarter of 2020. Accordingly, this sales outlook combined with the impact of fixed cost absorption, while our manufacturing facilities remain idle, will likely result in a significant earnings loss in the second quarter of 2020."16:26HIG Hartford Financial beats by $0.01, misses on revs (41.15 +1.81)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $1.34 per share, $0.01 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.33; revenues rose 0.3% year/year to $4.96 bln vs the $5.24 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Book value per diluted share was $41.42, down 6% from December 31, 2019; book value per diluted share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income rose 1% to $44.07.Commentary: "In the quarter, pricing momentum in middle market remained strong.

The Nasdaq Composite rose 3.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.2%, and the Russell 2000 rose 4.8%.The day started with Gilead Sciences (GILD 83.14, +4.47, +5.7%) affirming that remdesivir, an antiviral treatment for COVID-19, met its primary endpoint in an NIAID placebo-controlled study. The news helped the market open noticeably higher, as it fueled reopening hopes and overshadowed data depicting Q1 GDP contracting at a 4.8% annualized rate (Briefing.com consensus -4.3%).The ensuing advance in stocks was paced by the S&P 500 energy (+7.4%), communication services (+5.1%), and information technology (+4.2%) sectors, while the defensive-oriented consumer staples (-0.4%) and utilities (-0.9%) sectors were left out of the rally.Alphabet (GOOG 1341.48, +107.81, +8.7%), MasterCard (MA 283.69, +19.09, +7.2%), and Boeing (BA 139.00, +7.70, +5.9%) contributed to the bullish price action following their earnings reports. Energy stocks received an added boost from the 22% spike in oil prices ($15.13/bbl, +2.76, +22.3%).Later in the day, the Fed unanimously voted to maintain the target range for the fed funds rate at 0.00-0.25%, as was expected, and said rates will remain there until the economy is on track to achieve the Fed's goals of full employment and price stability. The inference is that rates will stay there for much longer, as the record unemployment isn't expected to return to normal anytime soon.Fed Chair Powell acknowledged that low rates alone won't revive economic activity and reiterated the Fed's commitment to using its full range of policy tools. Mr. Powell also said legislators should embrace policies that protect against avoidable insolvencies. Market reaction was relatively muted to the policy directive and the Fed Chair's comments.While most stocks finished the day higher, notable holdouts included Starbucks (SBUX 76.86, -1.83, -2.3%), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 53.66, -1.85, -3.3%), and General Electric (GE 6.58, -0.22, -3.2%) following their earnings reports.Small-cap companies Hertz Global (HTZ 4.00, -1.00, -20.0%) and Chesapeake Energy (CHK 26.85, -2.33, -8.0%) sold off on news of potential bankruptcy filings.U.S. Treasuries were relatively unchanged throughout the session, as bond investors were unfazed by the equity rally given the weak GDP data and precarious economic environment. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.19%, while the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 0.63%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 99.53.Reviewing Wednesday's economic data:First quarter GDP declined at an annualized rate of 4.8% (Briefing.com consensus -4.3%) while the GDP Price Deflator was 1.3% (Briefing.com consensus 1.1%). This was the largest decline in GDP since the fourth quarter of 2008.The key takeaway from the report is that it hints at how ugly the Advance Q2 GDP report will be given that shutdown measures in the U.S. didn't start to gain steam until the latter half of March.Pending Home Sales dropped 20.8% in March after increasing a revised 2.3% in February (from +2.4%).The weekly Mortgage Applications Index declined 3.3% following a 0.3% decline in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, Personal Income and Spending for March, the Q1 Employment Cost Index and the Chicago PMI for April on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite -0.7% YTDS&P 500 -9.0% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -13.7% YTDRussell 2000 -18.4% YTD16:23TYL Tyler Tech reports EPS in-line, misses on revs; comments on outlook (320.99 +8.98)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $1.25 per share, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.25; revenues rose 11.3% year/year to $276.78 mln vs the $279.85 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus."We anticipate a greater impact from COVID-19 in the second and third quarters.

Our financial position is strong with very robust liquidity. We continue to expect a significant amount of positive operating cash flow during 2020. Additionally, we have no meaningful debt maturities until May 2024. Out of an abundance of caution, we have implemented appropriate financial measures, which should allow us to safe-guard the employment of our associates. In order to fund these employment safe-guards, we have deferred certain cash expenditures for corporate and field maintenance, cemetery development, and growth capital expenditures, and we believe we have the flexibility to adjust further.""Due to the uncertainty of current economic conditions, in early April, we withdrew our full year 2020 guidance. We will continue to closely assess this situation, and will provide further updates when the effects of the pandemic are more predictable. As we look forward in 2020, we anticipate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on both our funeral and cemetery segments will result in a decline of our adjusted earnings per share, which we hope to minimize as we continue to be vigilant with our costs and expenses."16:23URI United Rentals beats by $0.82, beats on revs; withdraws FY20 guidance (127.98 +11.43)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $3.35 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.82 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.53; revenues rose 0.4% year/year to $2.13 bln vs the $2.08 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus."Our business tracked as we expected through early March, when the outlook for 2020 became far more uncertain due to the pandemic.

Due to the increasing uncertainty in our business outlook, we are not providing specific revenue guidance for the second quarter or full-year 2020, but rather a snapshot on revenue performance in the second quarter thus far. After the initial steep decrease in advertising revenue in March, we have seen signs of stability reflected in the first three weeks of April, where advertising revenue has been approximately flat compared to the same period a year ago, down from the 17% year-over-year growth in the first quarter of 2020. The April trends reflect weakness across all of our user geographies as most of our major countries have had some sort of shelter-in-place guidelines in effect.We expect total expenses in 2020 to be between $52-56 billion, down from the prior range of $54-59 billion. While this reflects a moderate reduction in the planned growth rate of total expenses, our overall expense growth in the face of expected revenue weakness will have a negative impact on 2020 operating margins.16:11AVTR Avantor beats by $0.03, beats on revs; withdraws guidance (14.70 +0.89)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.17 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.14; revenues rose 2.6% year/year to $1.52 bln vs the $1.45 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.The Company is withdrawing previously issued guidance due to COVID-19.16:11ADM Archer-Daniels beats by $0.08, misses on revs (38.41 +1.24)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.64 per share, $0.08 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.56; revenues fell 2.2% year/year to $14.97 bln vs the $15.71 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Co remains confident in its ability to continue operating well.16:11MRKR Marker International granted FDA Orphan Drug designation to MT-401 (2.27 +0.29)MT-401 is a multi-tumor-associated antigen (MultiTAA)-specific T cell product for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, following allogeneic stem cell transplant."We are pleased that the FDA has granted orphan designation to MT-401, our novel MultiTAA-specific T cell product candidate and believe it is supportive of its potential to treat post allogeneic stem cell transplant patients with AML-a devastating and pervasive blood disease with a high medical need for a treatment. In investigator-sponsored trials, our MultiTAA-specific T cell product candidate was well-tolerated and we have observed clinical benefit across various liquid and solid tumors, suggesting the product candidate's ability to induce a patient's own T cells to expand for a more durable anti-tumor effect.

Enrollment in the study was stopped early based on the recommendation from an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), which concluded it would be highly unlikely to reach statistical significance for the primary endpoint of VOD-free survival at Day +30 post-HSCT in the final analysis if the study were to complete enrollment. The IDMC recommendation was made after completion of a pre-planned interim analysis of the first 280 patients and where the study met the protocol-specified futility criteria. The study was conducted as part of a post-marketing requirement related to safety. The IDMC conducted multiple periodic safety analyses during the study and reported no new safety concerns.While enrollment has been discontinued, the trial will run to completion through the follow-up of the more than 370 patients enrolled. This Phase 3 trial was not designed to further evaluate defibrotide for the treatment of VOD and does not impact the approved indication or other ongoing clinical studies.16:09MANT ManTech beats by $0.12, beats on revs; guides FY20 EPS in-line, revs in-line (86.34 +4.10)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.81 per share, $0.12 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.69; revenues rose 21.7% year/year to $611 mln vs the $572.29 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

A conference call to review those results will begin at 6 p.m. ET.Currently, S&P Capital IQ Consensus expects the company to report Q1 EPS of $0.72, up from $0.67 in the prior year quarter, and revenues of $2.32 bln, which would represent a decline of approx. 12% yr/yr.An upside earnings result from eBay would continue a seven-quarter streak of beats on the bottom line for the company. The company reported revenues in-line with or above consensus in each of the last four quarters. The company's recent $4.05 bln divestiture of ticket exchange unit StubHub to viagogo is reflected in the company's anticipated results. After completing the divestiture in mid-February, eBay guided for Q1 revenues of $2.31-2.36 bln, factoring in the StubHub transaction, and for non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $0.72-0.75. For FY20, the company then expected revenues of $9.56-9.76 bln and non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $3.00-3.10. S&P Capital IQ Consensus currently estimates that the company will achieve FY20 EPS of $2.89 and revenues of $9.51 bln. Since eBay's last earnings report, the company has provided several updates of note. Back in February, the company indicated that it continued to be involved in discussions with multiple parties regarding a potential transaction for its Classifieds Group as part of a strategic review process; further updates are expected by mid-year. In more recent news, eBay has appointed a new CEO: Jamie Iannone, most recently COO of Walmart (WMT) eCommerce, took the helm as eBay's CEO effective April 27. The company has also continued to expand its payment managing services internationally, last week announcing plans to expand to Australia and Canada later this year. eBay has yet to offer formal commentary on any impact dealt by the COVID-19 pandemic to its operations.EBAY has a market valuation of circa $31.3 bln and trades at roughly 14x forward earnings estimates. The stock on Monday recorded its highest levels since September.15:20BONDX Treasury Market SummaryTreasuries End Mixed as Fed HoldsU.S. Treasuries ended Wednesday on a mixed note after backing off their morning highs. Treasuries started the cash session with solid gains, but the first 30 minutes of action saw a pullback, which took place after the release of a Q1 GDP report, which pointed to the sharpest contraction since the financial crisis. However, the early pullback found support near yesterday's closing levels, allowing Treasuries to bounce to fresh highs. The market remained near its best levels of the day into mid-morning action, but an aggressive upward charge in stocks invited some selling in Treasuries. The afternoon release of the latest FOMC Statement was met with a muted initial reaction, but Treasuries slipped to lows into the close. The FOMC repeated its promise to support the flow of credit through asset purchases and Fed Chairman, Jay Powell, reiterated that the central bank remains ready to act aggressively. The U.S. Dollar Index slid 0.3% to 99.57, pausing just above yesterday's low. Yield Check: 2-yr: -1 bp to 0.19% 3-yr: -1 bp to 0.25% 5-yr: -1 bp to 0.36% 10-yr: +2 bps to 0.63% 30-yr: +4 bps to 1.25%News: Australia's Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, said that Australia will relax its lockdown measures soon.

Eurozone's April Business and Consumer Survey fell to 67.0 from 94.2 (expected 74.7). March M3 Money Supply increased 7.5% yr/yr (expected 5.5%; last 5.5%). Germany's March Import Price Index fell 3.5% m/m (expected -2.5%; last -0.9%), decreasing 5.5% yr/yr (expected -4.0%; last -2.0%).

Today's Data: First quarter GDP declined at an annualized rate of 4.8% (Briefing.com consensus -4.3%) while the GDP Price Deflator was 1.3% (Briefing.com consensus 1.1%). This was the largest decline in GDP since the fourth quarter of 2008. The key takeaway from the report is that it hints at how ugly the Advance Q2 GDP report will be given that shutdown measures in the U.S. didn't start to gain steam until the latter half of March. Pending Home Sales tumbled 20.8% in March after a revised 2.3% increase (from 2.4%) in February. The weekly MBA Mortgage Index fell 3.3% to follow last week's 0.3% downtick.

The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for non-GAAP EPS is $1.27 and for revenue it's $33.70 bln. It's important to note that MSFT typically guides on the call, although with the pandemic, MSFT may not provide guidance this time. Last time, MSFT guided to MarQ revs of $34.1-34.9 bln.Microsoft operates in several areas and it's important to know the breakdown by segment: Productivity and Business Processes (Office 365, LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, which are cloud-based ERP and CRM apps), Intelligent Cloud (Azure, SQL Server, Windows Server), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Surface, Xbox).In January, MSFT's guidance by segment was: PBP: $11.5-11.7 bln IC: $11.85-12.05 bln and MPC: $10.75-11.15 bln. In February, Microsoft said it was seeing strong Windows demand as expected. However, the supply chain was returning to normal operations at a slower pace than anticipated. As a result, Q3 (Mar) revenue for its MPC segment would come up short of prior guidance. The silver lining is that all other components of Q3 guidance remain unchanged. Microsoft's crown jewel has been its Azure cloud computing business which primarily competes Amazon's (AMZN) AWS service. In Q2 (Dec), Azure revenue jumped 62%, an acceleration from 59% in Q1 (Sep). Another bright spot has been Dynamics 365, which is a suite of ERP and CRM applications for businesses. It grew by 42% yr/yr in DecQ. MSFT tends to be very consistent in terms of beating consensus estimates with 14 EPS beats in a row, including double digit EPS beats in each of the past four quarters. Something we have a concern about is how the quarter ended. When IBM reported results last week, it said it saw a noticeable change in client priorities towards cash preservation in mid-March. There was effectively a pause, especially in IBM's software business, where the vast majority of transactions typically close in the last two weeks of the quarter. With MSFT's heavy exposure to software and enterprise customers generally, we'll be watching for any late-quarter deals getting pushed into JunQ. On a final note, MSFT's Azure rival Amazon is set to report tomorrow after the close. Azure's performance, especially late in the quarter, should give us a window into what to expect for AWS tomorrow.15:08ECONX Fed Chair Powell says unemployment rate to be a high number in Q2 (uncertain what that will be)When consumer spending starts to pick up again, people will start getting rehired.Thinks it will be "some time" before we get back to anything that resembles maximum employment.15:04ECONX Fed Chair Powell says he has been advocate for getting back on sustainable fiscal path, but this is not the time to act on those concernsNeed to use the resources of the government to guard against long-term damage from this COVID-19 experience.14:59ECONX Fed Chair Powell: Q3 could see fairly large GDP increase given size of the fall, but unlikely the increase would bring us back to pre-virus levelsConsumers and businesses likely to still show some caution even after some of the social distancing guidelines are relaxed; sooner the virus can be brought under control, the sooner everyone will regain confidence.14:54ECONX Fed Chair Powell says corporate credit facility is near being finalized and should be operating fairly soonClose to announcing new term sheet for Main Street lending Facility; thinks there will be a couple different types of lending going on here and that the facility is likely to expand for some time, so will see a start to facility for some of it soon but doesn't expect full operations to happen fairly quickly.In characterizing what Fed means by saying there are considerable risks to the economic outlook over the "medium term," he says medium term means next year or so. Some possible recovery impediments include: 1) the path the virus takes 2) the possibility of damage to the productive capacity of the economy (i.e. workers facing long-term unemployment and unnecessary insolvencies for businesses) and 3) the global dimension of the COVID-19 impact.14:43ECONX Fed Chair Powell says legislators should embrace policies that protect against avoidable insolvenciesAdds such policies will have a hefty price tag but that they would help ensure we come out of this situation with less long term damage.Notes monetary policy position is right where it should be for now to help avoid deflationary spiral.14:39SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Saia (SAIA) gains following upside first quarter results -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersNCLH (15.59 +19.1%): Rises to its highest levels in a month on close to 2x average volume. Stocks representing industries that have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, including co and various cruise line peers, rise amid a rebound in the broader market bolstered by hopes for further economic reopening and the latest results from Gilead Sciences' (GILD) trial of antiviral remdesivir in treating COVID-19.SAIA (101.77 +19.07%): Posted upside Q1 EPS and revs (+8.7% yr/yr to $446.4 mln).

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, co experienced a downturn in volumes across its network in March following a "strong" start to the month; co responded with cost adjustments. Rises to two-month highs. LSCC (22.29 +14.02%): Topped consensus for Q1 EPS while missing on revs. Gross margin expanded to 59.8% from 58.6% in the prior year quarter, benefiting from actions taken to expand gross margin and profitability; cash flow from operations was $21 mln.

The FOMC news didn't change much, partly because the FOMC view didn't change.In a unanimous vote, the target range for the fed funds rate was maintained at 0.00-0.25%. It was noted that the target range is expected to remain there "until [the Fed] is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals."In other words, the target range is going to remain where it is for a long time considering where the unemployment rate is headed with 26 million+ unemployment claims in the last five weeks and assuming it is unlikely to return to its current level (4.4%) anytime soon.The muted response to the directive isn't surprising. Market participants are focused on what Fed Chair Powell says at his press conference, which begins at 2:30 p.m. ET. Most are hoping for additional context on what would motivate the Fed to do more (such as maybe buying stocks?) or encourage it to do less.The Russell 2000 is up 4.9%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 3.3%; the S&P 500 is up 2.6%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 2.3%.14:14MCD McDonald's: Earnings Preview -- We get our first look at how MCD is adapting to the pandemic (188.43 +2.47)McDonald's (MCD) is set to report Q1 results tomorrow before the open with a call to follow at 8:30am ET. The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q1 non-GAAP EPS is $1.55 and for revenue it's $4.66 bln. The company has already withdrawn 2020 guidance.MCD breaks down its sales into several segments: US (its largest segment), International Operated Markets (IOM) which is comprised of wholly-owned markets, or countries in which MCD operates restaurants, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Russia, Spain and the UK, and International Developmental Licensed Markets (IDL) which is comprised of the remaining markets in the McDonald's system.Global comps are always a key metric for MCD, although MCD has already disclosed Q1 comps, so this will not be new information. Global comps in Q1 were -3.4%. US comps were +0.1%, IOM comps were -6.9%, IDL comps were -4.3%.This will be our first look at how MCD is adapting to the pandemic as substantially all its US restaurants are operating Drive-thru, Delivery, & Take-away only. However, China has resumed operations in 98% of its restaurants. The good news is that the stock has bounced nicely off its mid-March lows as it's clear investors feel MCD will be able to adapt. It makes sense as most of MCD's restaurants already have drive-thru capabilities which is kind of tailor-made for off-premise dining. Also, a chain like Chipotle (CMG) has been able to do well and it has only a limited number of drive-thru locations. It's focusing more on free delivery. We think with comps already having been reported for Q1, investors will be focusing on the Q2 outlook. We are unlikely to get specific guidance, but it would help to see how comps are performing in April.14:07KPTI Karyopharm Therapeutics presents results from Phase 3 BOSTON study (23.72 -0.38)In addition to the BOSTON abstract, four additional abstracts were selected for presentation during the virtual program, including two poster presentations highlighting updated results from Darzalex (daratumumab) and Kyprolis (carfilzomib) arms of the ongoing Phase 1b/2 STOMP study evaluating XPOVIO in combination with backbone therapies in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The two remaining selected abstracts include a trial-in-progress (TIP) poster describing the ongoing Phase 3 SIENDO study evaluating XPOVIO as a maintenance therapy in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer following one prior platinum-based treatment, and a poster describing molecular predictors of selinexor response in recurrent glioblastoma.14:03MDT Medtronic: FDA grants marketing authorization to CARPEDIEM device for continuous dialysis therapy for use in pediatric patients with certain kidney conditions (100.37 +2.33)The FDA today granted marketing authorization for a new device indicated to provide continuous hemodialysis or hemofiltration therapy to critically ill pediatric patients weighing between 5.5 to 22 pounds. Continuous hemodialysis or hemofiltration therapy -- known as continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) -- involves using a dialysis machine and a special filter, or dialyzer, to continuously clean a patient's blood for an extended period of time, without stopping, instead of the more traditional three times a week therapy session. CRRT is typically performed in intensive care unit settings. The CARPEDIEM System is the first CRRT device intended for a lower weight-specific pediatric patient population 5.5 to 22 pounds who have a sudden or temporary loss of kidney function (acute kidney injury) or have too much water in their bodies because their kidneys are not functioning properly (fluid overload). The FDA granted marketing authorization of the CARPEDIEM System to Medtronic.14:00ECONX Fed statement from April meetingThe Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals.The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The virus and the measures taken to protect public health are inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation. The disruptions to economic activity here and abroad have significantly affected financial conditions and have impaired the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, the Federal Reserve will continue to purchase Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, the Open Market Desk will continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repurchase agreement operations. The Committee will closely monitor market conditions and is prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate.Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H. Clarida; Patrick Harker; Robert S. Kaplan; Neel Kashkari; Loretta J. Mester; and Randal K.

The Nasdaq Composite (+3.6%) and Russell 2000 (+4.9%) pull ahead of the benchmark index, while Dow Jones Industrial Average (+2.6%) follows behind.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading higher, led by the energy (+5.9%), communication services (+5.2%), and information technology (+3.9%) sectors. The consumer staples sector is up just 0.3% and is the only sector up less than 1.0%.Gilead Sciences (GILD 83.90, +5.25, +6.7%) provided sentiment a boost this morning when it affirmed that its remdesivir drug met its primary endpoint in an NIAID placebo-controlled study. The official statement has put to rest prior conflicting reports on the potential therapeutic and has supported the market's reopening optimism.Throw in a 30% spike in WTI crude futures ($15.95, +3.60, +29.3%) and bullish reactions to earnings reports from Alphabet (GOOG 1343.92, +110.25, +8.9%), MasterCard (MA 282.13, +17.52, +6.6%), and Boeing (BA 143.68, +12.38, +9.4%), and the market has now nearly forgotten the GDP data.Briefly, the advance estimate for Q1 GDP declined at an annualized rate of 4.8% (Briefing.com consensus -4.3%). Most expect Q2 to be worse, but the market is thinking a revival in economic activity will buoy the Q3 figure. Of course, there's no telling what Q4 would look like, but the market is leaning on the side of optimism.Separately, Starbucks (SBUX 77.64, -1.05, -1.3%), General Electric (GE 6.72, -0.08, -1.1%), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 54.09, -1.42, -2.5%) are bucking the broader trend following their earnings reports.Coming up next in this busy news day is the Fed's policy directive at 2:00 p.m. ET and Fed Chair Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET. U.S. Treasuries are holding steady in the meantime, ignoring the enthusiasm in the stock market. The 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 0.60%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 99.72.Reviewing today's economic data:First quarter GDP declined at an annualized rate of 4.8% (Briefing.com consensus -4.3%) while the GDP Price Deflator was 1.3% (Briefing.com consensus 1.1%).

Revs increased +4% sequentially, driven by a +$21 mln increase in the US gas utilities sector. Sales were negatively impacted by decreasing demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Co is taking steps to reduce its operating costs by $80 mln and to reduce its inventory by $140 mln or more relative to 2019 amid demand weakness. Co expects to generate over $200 mln in cash flow from operations in 2020. Energy sector stocks generally outperform amid improvement in oil prices.EAT (24.45 +27.72%): Topped consensus for Q3 EPS and revs. Co commented that its decision in recent years to enhance its off-premise business, including through online ordering and third-party delivery services, has enabled it to conveniently serve a "significantly higher" volume of off-premise customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Comp sales trends for the quarter were generally positive as of March 8, prior to the impact of COVID-19. Commenting on the weeks subsequent to the end of Q3, co noted that off-premise sales have grown each week since the pandemic began and have captured 57% of prior year total restaurant sales during the week ended April 22, adjusted to exclude an acquisition. SAH (23.84 +27.28%): Reported upside Q1 EPS and revs. EchoPark revs increased +33% yr/yr to $331.7 mln. Co's stores, deemed essential, have remained open during the pandemic, but since mid-March, co has experienced a significant decrease yr/yr in overall vehicle sales volumes and service department revs due principally to demand softness connected to COVID-19. Co recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $268.0 mln in the quarter related to its franchised dealerships reporting unit as a result of a decrease in co's market value due to the pandemic. Total liquidity was approx. $418.4 mln as of April 28.Small Cap LosersFDP (29.47 -16.11%): Missed estimates for Q1 EPS. Co's global operations were challenged by COVID-19 in Q1; beginning in January in Asia and ramping further in March, sales were impacted across all of co's markets; near-term demand and sales in co's foodservice distribution channel for higher price point products like pineapples, avocados, and fresh-cut vegetables and fruits, said co, remains "challenging." Adj. gross profit declined yr/yr to $76.5 mln from $95.1 mln, impacted by lower gross profit in co's fresh and value-added and banana business segments. Co expects Q2's results to continue to be pressured. Co also declared an interim cash dividend of $0.05/share, halved from co's prior dividend. The stock drops away from one-month highs.NAT (6.39 -13.01%): Pulls back after spiking yesterday to new three-year highs; at yesterday's close, the stock had netted an advance of circa +82% since mid-April. Today's decline takes place amid a general pullback in tanker and shipping stocks and a spike in oil prices; weekly petroleum data showed an increase in US commercial crude oil inventories of 9 mln barrels from the previous week.

The WTI contract for June delivery is up 32% to $16.26/bbl.One missing, and notable, element is a sell-off in the Treasury market. Despite the rally in stocks, the 10-yr note yield is down one basis point at 0.60% ahead of today's FOMC announcement at 2:00 p.m. ET.The Russell 2000 is up 3.7%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 3.1%; the S&P 500 is up 2.5%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 2.2%.11:05SOXX Industry Briefing: Chipmakers (239.62 +7.02)The PHLX Semiconductor Index (+3.2%) represents a pocket of relative strength in the early going of today's session. The high-beta group is now up 3.9% for the week versus a 3.2% week-to-date gain in the S&P 500 (+2.3%) and a 2.6% week-to-date gain in the Nasdaq Composite (+2.9%).Almost every component of the SOX index trades ahead of the broader market, reflecting a belief that chipmakers are well positioned for a recovery from coronavirus-related shutdowns.

The study demonstrated that patients receiving a 10-day treatment course of remdesivir achieved similar improvement in clinical status compared with those taking a 5-day treatment course (Odds Ratio: 0.75 [95% CI 0.51 - 1.12] on Day 14). No new safety signals were identified with remdesivir across either treatment group. Gilead plans to submit the full data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks.This study sought to determine whether a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir would achieve similar efficacy results as the 10-day treatment regimen used in multiple ongoing studies of remdesivir. Secondary objectives included rates of adverse events and additional measures of clinical response in both treatment groups. Patients were required to have evidence of pneumonia and reduced oxygen levels that did not require mechanical ventilation at the time of study entry. Clinical improvement was defined as an improvement of two or more points from baseline on a predefined seven-point scale, ranging from hospital discharge to increasing levels of oxygen support to death. Patients achieved clinical recovery if they no longer required oxygen support and medical care or were discharged from the hospital.In this study, the time to clinical improvement for 50% of patients was 10 days in the 5-day treatment group and 11 days in the 10-day treatment group. More than half of patients in both treatment groups were discharged from the hospital by Day 14 (5-day: 60.0%, n=120/200 vs.10-day: 52.3% n=103/197; p=0.14). At Day 14, 64.5% (n=129/200) of patients in the 5-day treatment group and 53.8% (n=106/197) of patients in the 10-day treatment group achieved clinical recovery. Clinical outcomes varied by geography. Outside of Italy, the overall mortality rate at Day 14 was 7% (n=23/320) across both treatment groups, with 64% (n=205/320) of patients experiencing clinical improvement at Day 14 and 61% (n=196/320) of patients discharged from the hospital.In an exploratory analysis, patients in the study who received remdesivir within 10 days of symptom onset had improved outcomes compared with those treated after more than 10 days of symptoms. Pooling data across treatment arms, by Day 14, 62% of patients treated early were able to be discharged from the hospital compared with 49% of patients who were treated late. Remdesivir was generally well-tolerated in both the 5-day and 10-day treatment groups. The most common adverse events occurring in more than 10% of patients in either group were nausea (5-day: 10.0%, n=20/200 vs. 10-day: 8.6%, n=17/197) and acute respiratory failure (5-day: 6.0%, n=12/200 vs. 10-day: 10.7%, n= 21/197). Grade 3 or higher liver enzyme (ALT) elevations occurred in 7.3% (n=28/385) of patients, with 3.0% (n=12/397) of patients discontinuing remdesivir treatment due to elevated liver tests.A second SIMPLE trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir administered intravenously in patients with moderate manifestations of COVID-19, compared with standard of care. The results from the first 600 patients of this study are expected at the end of May.08:35WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +58.40.

The company states, "We understand that the trial has met its primary endpoint and that NIAID will provide detailed information at an upcoming briefing.""Remdesivir is not yet licensed or approved anywhere globally and has not yet been demonstrated to be safe or effective for the treatment of COVID-19. Gilead will share additional remdesivir data from the company's open-label Phase 3 SIMPLE trial in patients with severe COVID-19 disease shortly. This study will provide information on whether a shorter, 5-day duration of therapy may have similar efficacy and safety as the 10-day treatment course evaluated in the NIAID trial and other ongoing trials. Gilead expects data at the end of May from the second SIMPLE study evaluating the 5- and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir in patients with moderate COVID-19 disease.""Gilead will continue to discuss with regulatory authorities the growing data set regarding remdesivir as a potential treatment for COVID-19."08:22BYSI BeyondSpring changes primary endpoint for its Study 106 Phase 3 superiority clinical trial with first-in-class lead asset, Plinabulin, for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia prevention (12.64 )For more than 20 years, the standard primary endpoint for CIN trials has been the duration of severe (Grade 4) neutropenia (DSN). The new primary endpoint will be the rate of the prevention of Grade 4 neutropenia -- a more clinically meaningful and trial-sensitive endpoint -- and will be used to establish superiority of the Plinabulin-G-CSF combination over G-CSF alone.A robust plan will be submitted to the FDA to prospectively validate this new primary endpoint against clinical outcome measures. If successful, Plinabulin could provide clinicians and cancer patients with powerful tools to fight cancer.08:22LM Legg Mason beats by $0.17, beats on revs (49.69 )Reports Q4 (Mar) earnings of $1.02 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.17 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.85; revenues rose 3.9% year/year to $719.6 mln vs the $702.81 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Assets Under Management were $730.8 billion at March 31, 2020 compared with $803.5 billion at December 31, 2019, reflecting $64.2 billion in negative market performance and other, long-term outflows of $12.1 billion, negative foreign exchange of $7.8 billion and realizations of $0.2 billion, partially offset by liquidity inflows of $11.6 billion.08:20SKT Tanger Factory finalizes extension of contract for Steven B.

The patent is directed to methods for inhibiting the enzyme Sphingosine kinase 1 in patients using the company's proprietary compound SK1-I and related Sphingosine kinase 1 inhibitors.In February, Enzo reported the publication of work demonstrating that drug candidate SK1-I decreased Interferon (IFN) signature, pDC activation, and glomerulonephritis, the inflammation of the filtration units of the kidney, in a chemically induced mouse model of lupus. In more detail, that work demonstrated that SK1-I reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines including Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and Interferon-alpha and -beta in the animal model. Significantly, elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, are reported to be associated with the development of respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. Based on the results obtained in the lupus model and prior work demonstrating the anti-inflammatory activity of SK1-I in animal models of other immune disorders and on isolated human blood cells, the company is exploring avenues for the development of SK1-I as a potential treatment for COVID-19.08:13CMPR Cimpress reports prelim Q3 results; Apollo Global Management (APO) confirms agreement to provide a $300 million secured note to Cimpress (63.20 )Co reports prelim Q3 revs of ~$598 mln vs $608.9 mln S&P Capital IQ two analyst estimate; Adjusted EBITDA of ~$71 mln, a year-over-year decline of 20%.

The overall action was muted, however with trader trepidation taking the lead with the FOMC set to release its latest statement today. The S&P is back up to the 2895 area, slightly off the session high of 2905.00. The low resides down at 2860.75.In Asia, the major markets were quiet with Japan closed for public holiday. The limited participation seemed to expand into the Chinese markets which saw small net changes to the upside with the Hang Seng closing 0.3% higher, while the Shanghai gained 0.4%.In Europe, the major bourses are trading higher, but the FTSE is outperforming its peers. Much of this can be attributed to the bounce in crude oil, which is up 14% and trading over the $14 area. This has helped index heavyweights BP and Shell to gain over 4% each.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: +32.010 yr Note: 0.599%USD/JPY: 106.48 -0.39EUR/USD: 1.0863 +0.0044Europe: FTSE +1.0% DAX +0.5% CAC +0.2%Asia: Hang Seng +0.3% Shanghai +0.4% Nikkei CLOSEDGold (1719.30 -2.90) Silver (15.48 +0.31) Crude (14.33 +1.99)05:54EADSY Airbus reports Q1 results; co withdraws 2019 dividend proposal and suspending the voluntary top up in pension funding; withdraws 2020 guidance (14.26 )Co reports Q1 EPS of (EUR 0.65) vs EUR 0.05 last year; revs -15% yr/yr to EUR 10.6 bln.Given the current COVID-19 environment, various measures were announced in late March 2020 to protect the Company's financial liquidity and continue to fund its operations.

AMC's remarks include the following: "Universal stated it only pursued a direct-to-home entertainment release for 'Trolls World Tour' because theaters were closed and Universal was committed to a lucrative toy licensing deal. We had our doubts that this was wholly Universal's motivations [...]. Nonetheless, we accepted this action as an exception to our longstanding business practices in these unprecedented times.""In [the] Wall Street Journal, Jeff Shell is quoted as saying that: 'The results for 'Trolls World Tour' have exceeded our expectations and demonstrated the viability of PVOD [...]. As soon as theaters reopen, we expect to release movies on both formats.' This radical change by Universal to the business model that currently exists between our two companies represents nothing but downside for us and is categorically unacceptable to AMC Entertainment.""Going forward, AMC will not license any Universal movies in any of our 1,000 theatres globally on these terms.""Accordingly, we want to be absolutely clear, so that there is no ambiguity of any kind. AMC believes that with this proposed action to go to the home and theatres simultaneously, Universal is breaking the business model and dealings between our two companies. It assumes that we will meekly accept a reshaped view of how studios and exhibitors should interact, with zero concern on Universal's part as to how its actions affect us. It also presumes that Universal in fact can have its cake and eat it too, that Universal film product can be released to the home and theatres at the same time, without modification to the current economic arrangements between us." "It is disappointing to us, but Jeff's comments as to Universal's unilateral actions and intentions have left us with no choice. Therefore, effectively immediately AMC will no longer play any Universal movies in any of our theatres in the United States, Europe or the Middle East. This policy affects any and all Universal movies per se, goes into effect today and as our theatres reopen, and is not some hollow or ill-considered threat. Incidentally, this policy is not aimed solely at Universal out of pique or to be punitive in any way, it also extends to any movie maker who unilaterally abandons current windowing practices absent good faith negotiations between us, so that they as distributor and we as exhibitor both benefit and neither are hurt from such changes. Currently, with the press comment today, Universal is the only studio contemplating a wholesale change to the status quo. Hence, this immediate communication in response."18:27ERYP ERYTECH Pharma receives FDA Fast Track Designation for eryaspase in second-line pancreatic cancer (8.29 +0.79)The FDA has granted eryaspase Fast Track Designation for the development of a second-line treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

However, given the worldwide constrained availability of many of these products, our backlog has also increased substantially as we were unable to fulfill many of these orders which would have mitigated other softness in the market. As a result, we recorded low double-digit revenue declines during the closing weeks of the quarter which now appear to have stabilized at approximately 20% in April. We anticipate that we will be able to ship a portion of this backlog in the second quarter as visibility into our supply chain and product lead times has improved."17:05SUPN Supernus Pharma to acquire central nervous system portfolio from US WorldMeds for total consideration of $530 mln (19.49 -0.09)Supernus Pharmaceuticals announced that the company entered into a definitive agreement under which Supernus will acquire the central nervous system (CNS) portfolio of US WorldMeds, a privately-held biopharmaceutical company.

Hilton, chairman and chief executive officer of Meritage Homes. "Though our net earnings for the first quarter more than doubled and every key operating metric showed significant year-over-year growth, we are expecting much weaker results for at least the next couple of quarters due to large parts of the economy being shut down, causing record job losses, fear and uncertainty about the future. Our hearts go out to all those impacted directly and indirectly."...He explained, "With shelter-in-place orders in effect across most of our markets, we are seeing customers either virtually or by appointment in our sales offices and Studio M design centers. Those we see tend to be serious buyers ready to commit to a new home purchase, so while our traffic has understandably decreased, our conversion rates on the traffic we do see have increased."16:33MKSI MKS Instruments beats by $0.30, beats on revs; guides Q2 EPS in-line, revs in-line (97.75 +1.67)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $1.54 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.30 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.24; revenues rose 15.6% year/year to $535.7 mln vs the $508.65 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Vaccine recipients demonstrated strong antibody and T cell immune responses after 2 or 3 doses with 0.6 mg of INO-4700, a DNA vaccine that targets the MERS-CoV Spike (S) glycoprotein, delivered with intradermal CELLECTRA device. The vaccination regimen was well-tolerated with no vaccine-associated severe adverse events.Overall, for those receiving 0.6 mg of INO-4700, 88% demonstrated seroconversion after a 2 dose regimen at 0 and 8 weeks, while for those receiving a 3 dose regimen given at 0, 4 and 12 weeks, 84% seroverted after 2 doses and 100% after 3 doses, as measured by a binding antibody assay against the full-length S protein. Additionally, 92% of the vaccine recipients in both groups displayed the ability to neutralize the virus using a neutralization assay. Robust T cell responses were observed in 60% of vaccine recipients after the 2 dose regimen and 84% of those in the 3 dose group. A single dose of 0.6 mg of INO-4700 intradermal vaccination resulted in 74% binding antibody response rate and 48% neutralization antibody response rate. These results were selected for an oral presentation at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ASGCT) Conference, to be held virtually from May 12-15.INOVIO is planning to advance INO-4700 into a Phase 2 clinical trial in the Middle East with a previously announced funding of $56 mln by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.16:31AMD Advanced Micro reports EPS in-line, revs in-line; guides Q2 revs in-line; guides FY20 revs in-line (55.51 -0.98)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.18 per share, excluding non-recurring items, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.18; revenues rose 40.4% year/year to $1.79 bln vs the $1.79 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus and company guidance of $1.75-1.85 bln.Gross margin 46% versus 41% in prior-year period.

Oil demand has significantly deteriorated as a result. The unparalleled demand destruction has resulted in lower spending by customers and reduced demand for the company's products and services. There is significant uncertainty as to the duration of this disruption.As a critical supplier to the global energy infrastructure and an essential business, the company has remained operational with no closures to any facilities. MRC has had four confirmed illnesses reported, and all have recovered.

Large-cap technology and health care stocks lagged, while reopening enthusiasm continued to flow into the small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%) and S&P MidCap 400 (+1.0%). The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4%.The day started with broad gains that lifted the S&P 500 as much as 1.5% shortly after the open, as part of the reopening momentum from Monday. That broad momentum quickly dissipated, presumably due to valuation concerns, but lingered in areas of the market that had underperformed when the shutdown angst was rampant.Some of those included the small-cap and mid-cap stocks, as previously noted, but also the cyclical S&P 500 energy (+2.2%), materials (+2.0%), industrials (+1.8%), and financials (+0.9%) sectors.Conversely, the large-cap stocks that were deemed as relatively safe, and thus outperformed over the past few months, lost some of their appeal today and heavily dragged on the broader market. Those were found in the health care (-2.1%), communication services (-1.9%), and information technology (-1.4%) sectors.The health care space also had some negative catalysts despite the reported progress on the coronavirus front. For instance, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 151.39, -2.90, -1.9%) was downgraded to Neutral from Buy at UBS, while Pfizer (PFE 37.91, -0.42, -1.1%) and Merck (MRK 81.18, -2.80, -3.3%) declined after reporting earnings.In other earnings news, shares of Caterpillar (CAT 115.46, +0.26, +0.2%), 3M (MMM 157.61, +3.96, +2.6%), and PepsiCo (PEP 136.32, +1.4%) finished higher, even after the companies withdrew full-year guidance, while shares of UPS (UPS 96.43, -6.12, -6.0%) faltered after the company missed profit estimates.U.S. Treasuries reclaimed most of yesterday's losses, driving yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined three basis points to 0.20%, and the 10-yr yield declined five basis points to 0.61%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 99.88. WTI crude declined 4.6%, or $0.60, to $12.37/bbl, although it was down as much as 22% at one point during the session.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data:The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for April plunged to 86.9 (Briefing.com consensus 86.5) from a downwardly revised 118.8 (from 120.0) for March. The April reading is the lowest since June 2014.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers, while thinking positively about things reopening again, are still less optimistic about their financial prospects, which could be a headwind for spending activity during the recovery phase.The advance goods trade deficit totaled $64.2 bln in March after a $59.9 bln deficit in February. Advance retail inventories declined 1.3% in March after decreasing 0.3% in February. Advance wholesale inventories decreased 1.0% in March after decreasing 0.7% in February.The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for February increased 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.7%).Looking ahead, investors will receive the advance estimate for Q1 GDP, Pending Home Sales for March, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite -4.1% YTDS&P 500 -11.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -15.6% YTDRussell 2000 -22.0% YTD16:20CHRW C.H.

Our Braun, Vicks, PUR and Honeywell products are supporting consumer health at a time of extreme need, and our OXO products are providing convenience, comfort and solutions as families spend unprecedented amounts of time at home. We are working around the clock to meet as much of the ongoing demand for thermometers, humidifiers, air purifiers and water purifiers as possible. We are also working with suppliers and retailers to provide consumers with OXO kitchen, cleaning and storage products, as well as volumizers in Beauty, where demand is high in channels that are open. While encouraging, we do expect to see a net adverse impact to our results for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2021. Although still very early, we are making plans to continue selectively investing in the key Phase II initiatives once the economic situation allows. With our diversified portfolio of leading, trusted brands, a strong balance sheet with low net leverage, and a corporate culture driven to rise to the challenge, we believe Helen of Troy is well positioned to navigate the current unprecedented situation and emerge strong."Due to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and the related business uncertainty, the Company is not providing an Outlook for fiscal 2021 at this time. In order to reduce costs and preserve cash flow, the Company has implemented a number of measures that will remain in place until there is greater certainty, a reopening of retail customer brick and mortar stores and improved consumer demand, which include the following: A graduated salary reduction for all associates, including named executive officers and the other members of the Company's executive leadership team; A reduction in the cash compensation of the Company's Board of Directors; Suspension of merit increases, promotions and new associate hiring until further notice; The furlough of associates in specific areas directly tied to sales volume, with assistance to maintain health insurance coverage, as well as a reduction of external temporary labor and reduced work hours; Reduction or deferral of marketing expense. The Company will lean into brands with strong current demand and reduce investment in other key brands without sacrificing brand awareness; Limited reduction of investment in new product development and launches, in anticipation of more normalized economic activity; Elimination of travel expense in the short term, with a significant reduction planned for the second half of fiscal 2021; and Reduction of consulting fees and capital expenditures for projects that are not critical.16:17MET MetLife increases quarterly common stock dividend to $0.46/share from $0.44/share (35.18 +0.76)16:15TENB Tenable beats by $0.10, beats on revs; guides Q2 EPS above consensus, revs below consensus (24.70 -0.12)Reports Q1 (Mar) loss of $0.09 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.10 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.19); revenues rose 27.8% year/year to $102.6 mln vs the $100.07 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The Nasdaq Composite rose 3.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.2%, and the Russell 2000 rose 4.8%.The day started with Gilead Sciences (GILD 83.14, +4.47, +5.7%) affirming that remdesivir, an antiviral treatment for COVID-19, met its primary endpoint in an NIAID placebo-controlled study. The news helped the market open noticeably higher, as it fueled reopening hopes and overshadowed data depicting Q1 GDP contracting at a 4.8% annualized rate (Briefing.com consensus -4.3%).The ensuing advance in stocks was paced by the S&P 500 energy (+7.4%), communication services (+5.1%), and information technology (+4.2%) sectors, while the defensive-oriented consumer staples (-0.4%) and utilities (-0.9%) sectors were left out of the rally.Alphabet (GOOG 1341.48, +107.81, +8.7%), MasterCard (MA 283.69, +19.09, +7.2%), and Boeing (BA 139.00, +7.70, +5.9%) contributed to the bullish price action following their earnings reports. Energy stocks received an added boost from the 22% spike in oil prices ($15.13/bbl, +2.76, +22.3%).Later in the day, the Fed unanimously voted to maintain the target range for the fed funds rate at 0.00-0.25%, as was expected, and said rates will remain there until the economy is on track to achieve the Fed's goals of full employment and price stability. The inference is that rates will stay there for much longer, as the record unemployment isn't expected to return to normal anytime soon.Fed Chair Powell acknowledged that low rates alone won't revive economic activity and reiterated the Fed's commitment to using its full range of policy tools. Mr. Powell also said legislators should embrace policies that protect against avoidable insolvencies. Market reaction was relatively muted to the policy directive and the Fed Chair's comments.While most stocks finished the day higher, notable holdouts included Starbucks (SBUX 76.86, -1.83, -2.3%), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 53.66, -1.85, -3.3%), and General Electric (GE 6.58, -0.22, -3.2%) following their earnings reports.Small-cap companies Hertz Global (HTZ 4.00, -1.00, -20.0%) and Chesapeake Energy (CHK 26.85, -2.33, -8.0%) sold off on news of potential bankruptcy filings.U.S. Treasuries were relatively unchanged throughout the session, as bond investors were unfazed by the equity rally given the weak GDP data and precarious economic environment. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.19%, while the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 0.63%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 99.53.Reviewing Wednesday's economic data:First quarter GDP declined at an annualized rate of 4.8% (Briefing.com consensus -4.3%) while the GDP Price Deflator was 1.3% (Briefing.com consensus 1.1%). This was the largest decline in GDP since the fourth quarter of 2008.The key takeaway from the report is that it hints at how ugly the Advance Q2 GDP report will be given that shutdown measures in the U.S. didn't start to gain steam until the latter half of March.Pending Home Sales dropped 20.8% in March after increasing a revised 2.3% in February (from +2.4%).The weekly Mortgage Applications Index declined 3.3% following a 0.3% decline in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, Personal Income and Spending for March, the Q1 Employment Cost Index and the Chicago PMI for April on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite -0.7% YTDS&P 500 -9.0% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -13.7% YTDRussell 2000 -18.4% YTD16:23TYL Tyler Tech reports EPS in-line, misses on revs; comments on outlook (320.99 +8.98)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $1.25 per share, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.25; revenues rose 11.3% year/year to $276.78 mln vs the $279.85 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus."We anticipate a greater impact from COVID-19 in the second and third quarters.

Our financial position is strong with very robust liquidity. We continue to expect a significant amount of positive operating cash flow during 2020. Additionally, we have no meaningful debt maturities until May 2024. Out of an abundance of caution, we have implemented appropriate financial measures, which should allow us to safe-guard the employment of our associates. In order to fund these employment safe-guards, we have deferred certain cash expenditures for corporate and field maintenance, cemetery development, and growth capital expenditures, and we believe we have the flexibility to adjust further.""Due to the uncertainty of current economic conditions, in early April, we withdrew our full year 2020 guidance. We will continue to closely assess this situation, and will provide further updates when the effects of the pandemic are more predictable. As we look forward in 2020, we anticipate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on both our funeral and cemetery segments will result in a decline of our adjusted earnings per share, which we hope to minimize as we continue to be vigilant with our costs and expenses."16:23URI United Rentals beats by $0.82, beats on revs; withdraws FY20 guidance (127.98 +11.43)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $3.35 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.82 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.53; revenues rose 0.4% year/year to $2.13 bln vs the $2.08 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus."Our business tracked as we expected through early March, when the outlook for 2020 became far more uncertain due to the pandemic.

Due to the increasing uncertainty in our business outlook, we are not providing specific revenue guidance for the second quarter or full-year 2020, but rather a snapshot on revenue performance in the second quarter thus far. After the initial steep decrease in advertising revenue in March, we have seen signs of stability reflected in the first three weeks of April, where advertising revenue has been approximately flat compared to the same period a year ago, down from the 17% year-over-year growth in the first quarter of 2020. The April trends reflect weakness across all of our user geographies as most of our major countries have had some sort of shelter-in-place guidelines in effect.We expect total expenses in 2020 to be between $52-56 billion, down from the prior range of $54-59 billion. While this reflects a moderate reduction in the planned growth rate of total expenses, our overall expense growth in the face of expected revenue weakness will have a negative impact on 2020 operating margins.16:11AVTR Avantor beats by $0.03, beats on revs; withdraws guidance (14.70 +0.89)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.17 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.03 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.14; revenues rose 2.6% year/year to $1.52 bln vs the $1.45 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.The Company is withdrawing previously issued guidance due to COVID-19.16:11ADM Archer-Daniels beats by $0.08, misses on revs (38.41 +1.24)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.64 per share, $0.08 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.56; revenues fell 2.2% year/year to $14.97 bln vs the $15.71 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Co remains confident in its ability to continue operating well.16:11MRKR Marker International granted FDA Orphan Drug designation to MT-401 (2.27 +0.29)MT-401 is a multi-tumor-associated antigen (MultiTAA)-specific T cell product for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, following allogeneic stem cell transplant."We are pleased that the FDA has granted orphan designation to MT-401, our novel MultiTAA-specific T cell product candidate and believe it is supportive of its potential to treat post allogeneic stem cell transplant patients with AML-a devastating and pervasive blood disease with a high medical need for a treatment. In investigator-sponsored trials, our MultiTAA-specific T cell product candidate was well-tolerated and we have observed clinical benefit across various liquid and solid tumors, suggesting the product candidate's ability to induce a patient's own T cells to expand for a more durable anti-tumor effect.

Enrollment in the study was stopped early based on the recommendation from an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), which concluded it would be highly unlikely to reach statistical significance for the primary endpoint of VOD-free survival at Day +30 post-HSCT in the final analysis if the study were to complete enrollment. The IDMC recommendation was made after completion of a pre-planned interim analysis of the first 280 patients and where the study met the protocol-specified futility criteria. The study was conducted as part of a post-marketing requirement related to safety. The IDMC conducted multiple periodic safety analyses during the study and reported no new safety concerns.While enrollment has been discontinued, the trial will run to completion through the follow-up of the more than 370 patients enrolled. This Phase 3 trial was not designed to further evaluate defibrotide for the treatment of VOD and does not impact the approved indication or other ongoing clinical studies.16:09MANT ManTech beats by $0.12, beats on revs; guides FY20 EPS in-line, revs in-line (86.34 +4.10)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.81 per share, $0.12 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.69; revenues rose 21.7% year/year to $611 mln vs the $572.29 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

A conference call to review those results will begin at 6 p.m. ET.Currently, S&P Capital IQ Consensus expects the company to report Q1 EPS of $0.72, up from $0.67 in the prior year quarter, and revenues of $2.32 bln, which would represent a decline of approx. 12% yr/yr.An upside earnings result from eBay would continue a seven-quarter streak of beats on the bottom line for the company. The company reported revenues in-line with or above consensus in each of the last four quarters. The company's recent $4.05 bln divestiture of ticket exchange unit StubHub to viagogo is reflected in the company's anticipated results. After completing the divestiture in mid-February, eBay guided for Q1 revenues of $2.31-2.36 bln, factoring in the StubHub transaction, and for non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $0.72-0.75. For FY20, the company then expected revenues of $9.56-9.76 bln and non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $3.00-3.10. S&P Capital IQ Consensus currently estimates that the company will achieve FY20 EPS of $2.89 and revenues of $9.51 bln. Since eBay's last earnings report, the company has provided several updates of note. Back in February, the company indicated that it continued to be involved in discussions with multiple parties regarding a potential transaction for its Classifieds Group as part of a strategic review process; further updates are expected by mid-year. In more recent news, eBay has appointed a new CEO: Jamie Iannone, most recently COO of Walmart (WMT) eCommerce, took the helm as eBay's CEO effective April 27. The company has also continued to expand its payment managing services internationally, last week announcing plans to expand to Australia and Canada later this year. eBay has yet to offer formal commentary on any impact dealt by the COVID-19 pandemic to its operations.EBAY has a market valuation of circa $31.3 bln and trades at roughly 14x forward earnings estimates. The stock on Monday recorded its highest levels since September.15:20BONDX Treasury Market SummaryTreasuries End Mixed as Fed HoldsU.S. Treasuries ended Wednesday on a mixed note after backing off their morning highs. Treasuries started the cash session with solid gains, but the first 30 minutes of action saw a pullback, which took place after the release of a Q1 GDP report, which pointed to the sharpest contraction since the financial crisis. However, the early pullback found support near yesterday's closing levels, allowing Treasuries to bounce to fresh highs. The market remained near its best levels of the day into mid-morning action, but an aggressive upward charge in stocks invited some selling in Treasuries. The afternoon release of the latest FOMC Statement was met with a muted initial reaction, but Treasuries slipped to lows into the close. The FOMC repeated its promise to support the flow of credit through asset purchases and Fed Chairman, Jay Powell, reiterated that the central bank remains ready to act aggressively. The U.S. Dollar Index slid 0.3% to 99.57, pausing just above yesterday's low. Yield Check: 2-yr: -1 bp to 0.19% 3-yr: -1 bp to 0.25% 5-yr: -1 bp to 0.36% 10-yr: +2 bps to 0.63% 30-yr: +4 bps to 1.25%News: Australia's Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, said that Australia will relax its lockdown measures soon.

Eurozone's April Business and Consumer Survey fell to 67.0 from 94.2 (expected 74.7). March M3 Money Supply increased 7.5% yr/yr (expected 5.5%; last 5.5%). Germany's March Import Price Index fell 3.5% m/m (expected -2.5%; last -0.9%), decreasing 5.5% yr/yr (expected -4.0%; last -2.0%).

Today's Data: First quarter GDP declined at an annualized rate of 4.8% (Briefing.com consensus -4.3%) while the GDP Price Deflator was 1.3% (Briefing.com consensus 1.1%). This was the largest decline in GDP since the fourth quarter of 2008. The key takeaway from the report is that it hints at how ugly the Advance Q2 GDP report will be given that shutdown measures in the U.S. didn't start to gain steam until the latter half of March. Pending Home Sales tumbled 20.8% in March after a revised 2.3% increase (from 2.4%) in February. The weekly MBA Mortgage Index fell 3.3% to follow last week's 0.3% downtick.

The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for non-GAAP EPS is $1.27 and for revenue it's $33.70 bln. It's important to note that MSFT typically guides on the call, although with the pandemic, MSFT may not provide guidance this time. Last time, MSFT guided to MarQ revs of $34.1-34.9 bln.Microsoft operates in several areas and it's important to know the breakdown by segment: Productivity and Business Processes (Office 365, LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, which are cloud-based ERP and CRM apps), Intelligent Cloud (Azure, SQL Server, Windows Server), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Surface, Xbox).In January, MSFT's guidance by segment was: PBP: $11.5-11.7 bln IC: $11.85-12.05 bln and MPC: $10.75-11.15 bln. In February, Microsoft said it was seeing strong Windows demand as expected. However, the supply chain was returning to normal operations at a slower pace than anticipated. As a result, Q3 (Mar) revenue for its MPC segment would come up short of prior guidance. The silver lining is that all other components of Q3 guidance remain unchanged. Microsoft's crown jewel has been its Azure cloud computing business which primarily competes Amazon's (AMZN) AWS service. In Q2 (Dec), Azure revenue jumped 62%, an acceleration from 59% in Q1 (Sep). Another bright spot has been Dynamics 365, which is a suite of ERP and CRM applications for businesses. It grew by 42% yr/yr in DecQ. MSFT tends to be very consistent in terms of beating consensus estimates with 14 EPS beats in a row, including double digit EPS beats in each of the past four quarters. Something we have a concern about is how the quarter ended. When IBM reported results last week, it said it saw a noticeable change in client priorities towards cash preservation in mid-March. There was effectively a pause, especially in IBM's software business, where the vast majority of transactions typically close in the last two weeks of the quarter. With MSFT's heavy exposure to software and enterprise customers generally, we'll be watching for any late-quarter deals getting pushed into JunQ. On a final note, MSFT's Azure rival Amazon is set to report tomorrow after the close. Azure's performance, especially late in the quarter, should give us a window into what to expect for AWS tomorrow.15:08ECONX Fed Chair Powell says unemployment rate to be a high number in Q2 (uncertain what that will be)When consumer spending starts to pick up again, people will start getting rehired.Thinks it will be "some time" before we get back to anything that resembles maximum employment.15:04ECONX Fed Chair Powell says he has been advocate for getting back on sustainable fiscal path, but this is not the time to act on those concernsNeed to use the resources of the government to guard against long-term damage from this COVID-19 experience.14:59ECONX Fed Chair Powell: Q3 could see fairly large GDP increase given size of the fall, but unlikely the increase would bring us back to pre-virus levelsConsumers and businesses likely to still show some caution even after some of the social distancing guidelines are relaxed; sooner the virus can be brought under control, the sooner everyone will regain confidence.14:54ECONX Fed Chair Powell says corporate credit facility is near being finalized and should be operating fairly soonClose to announcing new term sheet for Main Street lending Facility; thinks there will be a couple different types of lending going on here and that the facility is likely to expand for some time, so will see a start to facility for some of it soon but doesn't expect full operations to happen fairly quickly.In characterizing what Fed means by saying there are considerable risks to the economic outlook over the "medium term," he says medium term means next year or so. Some possible recovery impediments include: 1) the path the virus takes 2) the possibility of damage to the productive capacity of the economy (i.e. workers facing long-term unemployment and unnecessary insolvencies for businesses) and 3) the global dimension of the COVID-19 impact.14:43ECONX Fed Chair Powell says legislators should embrace policies that protect against avoidable insolvenciesAdds such policies will have a hefty price tag but that they would help ensure we come out of this situation with less long term damage.Notes monetary policy position is right where it should be for now to help avoid deflationary spiral.14:39SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Saia (SAIA) gains following upside first quarter results -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersNCLH (15.59 +19.1%): Rises to its highest levels in a month on close to 2x average volume. Stocks representing industries that have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, including co and various cruise line peers, rise amid a rebound in the broader market bolstered by hopes for further economic reopening and the latest results from Gilead Sciences' (GILD) trial of antiviral remdesivir in treating COVID-19.SAIA (101.77 +19.07%): Posted upside Q1 EPS and revs (+8.7% yr/yr to $446.4 mln).

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, co experienced a downturn in volumes across its network in March following a "strong" start to the month; co responded with cost adjustments. Rises to two-month highs. LSCC (22.29 +14.02%): Topped consensus for Q1 EPS while missing on revs. Gross margin expanded to 59.8% from 58.6% in the prior year quarter, benefiting from actions taken to expand gross margin and profitability; cash flow from operations was $21 mln.

The FOMC news didn't change much, partly because the FOMC view didn't change.In a unanimous vote, the target range for the fed funds rate was maintained at 0.00-0.25%. It was noted that the target range is expected to remain there "until [the Fed] is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals."In other words, the target range is going to remain where it is for a long time considering where the unemployment rate is headed with 26 million+ unemployment claims in the last five weeks and assuming it is unlikely to return to its current level (4.4%) anytime soon.The muted response to the directive isn't surprising. Market participants are focused on what Fed Chair Powell says at his press conference, which begins at 2:30 p.m. ET. Most are hoping for additional context on what would motivate the Fed to do more (such as maybe buying stocks?) or encourage it to do less.The Russell 2000 is up 4.9%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 3.3%; the S&P 500 is up 2.6%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 2.3%.14:14MCD McDonald's: Earnings Preview -- We get our first look at how MCD is adapting to the pandemic (188.43 +2.47)McDonald's (MCD) is set to report Q1 results tomorrow before the open with a call to follow at 8:30am ET. The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q1 non-GAAP EPS is $1.55 and for revenue it's $4.66 bln. The company has already withdrawn 2020 guidance.MCD breaks down its sales into several segments: US (its largest segment), International Operated Markets (IOM) which is comprised of wholly-owned markets, or countries in which MCD operates restaurants, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Russia, Spain and the UK, and International Developmental Licensed Markets (IDL) which is comprised of the remaining markets in the McDonald's system.Global comps are always a key metric for MCD, although MCD has already disclosed Q1 comps, so this will not be new information. Global comps in Q1 were -3.4%. US comps were +0.1%, IOM comps were -6.9%, IDL comps were -4.3%.This will be our first look at how MCD is adapting to the pandemic as substantially all its US restaurants are operating Drive-thru, Delivery, & Take-away only. However, China has resumed operations in 98% of its restaurants. The good news is that the stock has bounced nicely off its mid-March lows as it's clear investors feel MCD will be able to adapt. It makes sense as most of MCD's restaurants already have drive-thru capabilities which is kind of tailor-made for off-premise dining. Also, a chain like Chipotle (CMG) has been able to do well and it has only a limited number of drive-thru locations. It's focusing more on free delivery. We think with comps already having been reported for Q1, investors will be focusing on the Q2 outlook. We are unlikely to get specific guidance, but it would help to see how comps are performing in April.14:07KPTI Karyopharm Therapeutics presents results from Phase 3 BOSTON study (23.72 -0.38)In addition to the BOSTON abstract, four additional abstracts were selected for presentation during the virtual program, including two poster presentations highlighting updated results from Darzalex (daratumumab) and Kyprolis (carfilzomib) arms of the ongoing Phase 1b/2 STOMP study evaluating XPOVIO in combination with backbone therapies in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The two remaining selected abstracts include a trial-in-progress (TIP) poster describing the ongoing Phase 3 SIENDO study evaluating XPOVIO as a maintenance therapy in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer following one prior platinum-based treatment, and a poster describing molecular predictors of selinexor response in recurrent glioblastoma.14:03MDT Medtronic: FDA grants marketing authorization to CARPEDIEM device for continuous dialysis therapy for use in pediatric patients with certain kidney conditions (100.37 +2.33)The FDA today granted marketing authorization for a new device indicated to provide continuous hemodialysis or hemofiltration therapy to critically ill pediatric patients weighing between 5.5 to 22 pounds. Continuous hemodialysis or hemofiltration therapy -- known as continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) -- involves using a dialysis machine and a special filter, or dialyzer, to continuously clean a patient's blood for an extended period of time, without stopping, instead of the more traditional three times a week therapy session. CRRT is typically performed in intensive care unit settings. The CARPEDIEM System is the first CRRT device intended for a lower weight-specific pediatric patient population 5.5 to 22 pounds who have a sudden or temporary loss of kidney function (acute kidney injury) or have too much water in their bodies because their kidneys are not functioning properly (fluid overload). The FDA granted marketing authorization of the CARPEDIEM System to Medtronic.14:00ECONX Fed statement from April meetingThe Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals.The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The virus and the measures taken to protect public health are inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation. The disruptions to economic activity here and abroad have significantly affected financial conditions and have impaired the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, the Federal Reserve will continue to purchase Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, the Open Market Desk will continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repurchase agreement operations. The Committee will closely monitor market conditions and is prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate.Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H. Clarida; Patrick Harker; Robert S. Kaplan; Neel Kashkari; Loretta J. Mester; and Randal K.

The Nasdaq Composite (+3.6%) and Russell 2000 (+4.9%) pull ahead of the benchmark index, while Dow Jones Industrial Average (+2.6%) follows behind.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading higher, led by the energy (+5.9%), communication services (+5.2%), and information technology (+3.9%) sectors. The consumer staples sector is up just 0.3% and is the only sector up less than 1.0%.Gilead Sciences (GILD 83.90, +5.25, +6.7%) provided sentiment a boost this morning when it affirmed that its remdesivir drug met its primary endpoint in an NIAID placebo-controlled study. The official statement has put to rest prior conflicting reports on the potential therapeutic and has supported the market's reopening optimism.Throw in a 30% spike in WTI crude futures ($15.95, +3.60, +29.3%) and bullish reactions to earnings reports from Alphabet (GOOG 1343.92, +110.25, +8.9%), MasterCard (MA 282.13, +17.52, +6.6%), and Boeing (BA 143.68, +12.38, +9.4%), and the market has now nearly forgotten the GDP data.Briefly, the advance estimate for Q1 GDP declined at an annualized rate of 4.8% (Briefing.com consensus -4.3%). Most expect Q2 to be worse, but the market is thinking a revival in economic activity will buoy the Q3 figure. Of course, there's no telling what Q4 would look like, but the market is leaning on the side of optimism.Separately, Starbucks (SBUX 77.64, -1.05, -1.3%), General Electric (GE 6.72, -0.08, -1.1%), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 54.09, -1.42, -2.5%) are bucking the broader trend following their earnings reports.Coming up next in this busy news day is the Fed's policy directive at 2:00 p.m. ET and Fed Chair Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET. U.S. Treasuries are holding steady in the meantime, ignoring the enthusiasm in the stock market. The 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 0.60%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 99.72.Reviewing today's economic data:First quarter GDP declined at an annualized rate of 4.8% (Briefing.com consensus -4.3%) while the GDP Price Deflator was 1.3% (Briefing.com consensus 1.1%).

Revs increased +4% sequentially, driven by a +$21 mln increase in the US gas utilities sector. Sales were negatively impacted by decreasing demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Co is taking steps to reduce its operating costs by $80 mln and to reduce its inventory by $140 mln or more relative to 2019 amid demand weakness. Co expects to generate over $200 mln in cash flow from operations in 2020. Energy sector stocks generally outperform amid improvement in oil prices.EAT (24.45 +27.72%): Topped consensus for Q3 EPS and revs. Co commented that its decision in recent years to enhance its off-premise business, including through online ordering and third-party delivery services, has enabled it to conveniently serve a "significantly higher" volume of off-premise customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Comp sales trends for the quarter were generally positive as of March 8, prior to the impact of COVID-19. Commenting on the weeks subsequent to the end of Q3, co noted that off-premise sales have grown each week since the pandemic began and have captured 57% of prior year total restaurant sales during the week ended April 22, adjusted to exclude an acquisition. SAH (23.84 +27.28%): Reported upside Q1 EPS and revs. EchoPark revs increased +33% yr/yr to $331.7 mln. Co's stores, deemed essential, have remained open during the pandemic, but since mid-March, co has experienced a significant decrease yr/yr in overall vehicle sales volumes and service department revs due principally to demand softness connected to COVID-19. Co recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $268.0 mln in the quarter related to its franchised dealerships reporting unit as a result of a decrease in co's market value due to the pandemic. Total liquidity was approx. $418.4 mln as of April 28.Small Cap LosersFDP (29.47 -16.11%): Missed estimates for Q1 EPS. Co's global operations were challenged by COVID-19 in Q1; beginning in January in Asia and ramping further in March, sales were impacted across all of co's markets; near-term demand and sales in co's foodservice distribution channel for higher price point products like pineapples, avocados, and fresh-cut vegetables and fruits, said co, remains "challenging." Adj. gross profit declined yr/yr to $76.5 mln from $95.1 mln, impacted by lower gross profit in co's fresh and value-added and banana business segments. Co expects Q2's results to continue to be pressured. Co also declared an interim cash dividend of $0.05/share, halved from co's prior dividend. The stock drops away from one-month highs.NAT (6.39 -13.01%): Pulls back after spiking yesterday to new three-year highs; at yesterday's close, the stock had netted an advance of circa +82% since mid-April. Today's decline takes place amid a general pullback in tanker and shipping stocks and a spike in oil prices; weekly petroleum data showed an increase in US commercial crude oil inventories of 9 mln barrels from the previous week.

The WTI contract for June delivery is up 32% to $16.26/bbl.One missing, and notable, element is a sell-off in the Treasury market. Despite the rally in stocks, the 10-yr note yield is down one basis point at 0.60% ahead of today's FOMC announcement at 2:00 p.m. ET.The Russell 2000 is up 3.7%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 3.1%; the S&P 500 is up 2.5%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 2.2%.11:05SOXX Industry Briefing: Chipmakers (239.62 +7.02)The PHLX Semiconductor Index (+3.2%) represents a pocket of relative strength in the early going of today's session. The high-beta group is now up 3.9% for the week versus a 3.2% week-to-date gain in the S&P 500 (+2.3%) and a 2.6% week-to-date gain in the Nasdaq Composite (+2.9%).Almost every component of the SOX index trades ahead of the broader market, reflecting a belief that chipmakers are well positioned for a recovery from coronavirus-related shutdowns.

The study demonstrated that patients receiving a 10-day treatment course of remdesivir achieved similar improvement in clinical status compared with those taking a 5-day treatment course (Odds Ratio: 0.75 [95% CI 0.51 - 1.12] on Day 14). No new safety signals were identified with remdesivir across either treatment group. Gilead plans to submit the full data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks.This study sought to determine whether a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir would achieve similar efficacy results as the 10-day treatment regimen used in multiple ongoing studies of remdesivir. Secondary objectives included rates of adverse events and additional measures of clinical response in both treatment groups. Patients were required to have evidence of pneumonia and reduced oxygen levels that did not require mechanical ventilation at the time of study entry. Clinical improvement was defined as an improvement of two or more points from baseline on a predefined seven-point scale, ranging from hospital discharge to increasing levels of oxygen support to death. Patients achieved clinical recovery if they no longer required oxygen support and medical care or were discharged from the hospital.In this study, the time to clinical improvement for 50% of patients was 10 days in the 5-day treatment group and 11 days in the 10-day treatment group. More than half of patients in both treatment groups were discharged from the hospital by Day 14 (5-day: 60.0%, n=120/200 vs.10-day: 52.3% n=103/197; p=0.14). At Day 14, 64.5% (n=129/200) of patients in the 5-day treatment group and 53.8% (n=106/197) of patients in the 10-day treatment group achieved clinical recovery. Clinical outcomes varied by geography. Outside of Italy, the overall mortality rate at Day 14 was 7% (n=23/320) across both treatment groups, with 64% (n=205/320) of patients experiencing clinical improvement at Day 14 and 61% (n=196/320) of patients discharged from the hospital.In an exploratory analysis, patients in the study who received remdesivir within 10 days of symptom onset had improved outcomes compared with those treated after more than 10 days of symptoms. Pooling data across treatment arms, by Day 14, 62% of patients treated early were able to be discharged from the hospital compared with 49% of patients who were treated late. Remdesivir was generally well-tolerated in both the 5-day and 10-day treatment groups. The most common adverse events occurring in more than 10% of patients in either group were nausea (5-day: 10.0%, n=20/200 vs. 10-day: 8.6%, n=17/197) and acute respiratory failure (5-day: 6.0%, n=12/200 vs. 10-day: 10.7%, n= 21/197). Grade 3 or higher liver enzyme (ALT) elevations occurred in 7.3% (n=28/385) of patients, with 3.0% (n=12/397) of patients discontinuing remdesivir treatment due to elevated liver tests.A second SIMPLE trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir administered intravenously in patients with moderate manifestations of COVID-19, compared with standard of care. The results from the first 600 patients of this study are expected at the end of May.08:35WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +58.40.

The company states, "We understand that the trial has met its primary endpoint and that NIAID will provide detailed information at an upcoming briefing.""Remdesivir is not yet licensed or approved anywhere globally and has not yet been demonstrated to be safe or effective for the treatment of COVID-19. Gilead will share additional remdesivir data from the company's open-label Phase 3 SIMPLE trial in patients with severe COVID-19 disease shortly. This study will provide information on whether a shorter, 5-day duration of therapy may have similar efficacy and safety as the 10-day treatment course evaluated in the NIAID trial and other ongoing trials. Gilead expects data at the end of May from the second SIMPLE study evaluating the 5- and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir in patients with moderate COVID-19 disease.""Gilead will continue to discuss with regulatory authorities the growing data set regarding remdesivir as a potential treatment for COVID-19."08:22BYSI BeyondSpring changes primary endpoint for its Study 106 Phase 3 superiority clinical trial with first-in-class lead asset, Plinabulin, for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia prevention (12.64 )For more than 20 years, the standard primary endpoint for CIN trials has been the duration of severe (Grade 4) neutropenia (DSN). The new primary endpoint will be the rate of the prevention of Grade 4 neutropenia -- a more clinically meaningful and trial-sensitive endpoint -- and will be used to establish superiority of the Plinabulin-G-CSF combination over G-CSF alone.A robust plan will be submitted to the FDA to prospectively validate this new primary endpoint against clinical outcome measures. If successful, Plinabulin could provide clinicians and cancer patients with powerful tools to fight cancer.08:22LM Legg Mason beats by $0.17, beats on revs (49.69 )Reports Q4 (Mar) earnings of $1.02 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.17 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.85; revenues rose 3.9% year/year to $719.6 mln vs the $702.81 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Assets Under Management were $730.8 billion at March 31, 2020 compared with $803.5 billion at December 31, 2019, reflecting $64.2 billion in negative market performance and other, long-term outflows of $12.1 billion, negative foreign exchange of $7.8 billion and realizations of $0.2 billion, partially offset by liquidity inflows of $11.6 billion.08:20SKT Tanger Factory finalizes extension of contract for Steven B.

The patent is directed to methods for inhibiting the enzyme Sphingosine kinase 1 in patients using the company's proprietary compound SK1-I and related Sphingosine kinase 1 inhibitors.In February, Enzo reported the publication of work demonstrating that drug candidate SK1-I decreased Interferon (IFN) signature, pDC activation, and glomerulonephritis, the inflammation of the filtration units of the kidney, in a chemically induced mouse model of lupus. In more detail, that work demonstrated that SK1-I reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines including Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and Interferon-alpha and -beta in the animal model. Significantly, elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, are reported to be associated with the development of respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. Based on the results obtained in the lupus model and prior work demonstrating the anti-inflammatory activity of SK1-I in animal models of other immune disorders and on isolated human blood cells, the company is exploring avenues for the development of SK1-I as a potential treatment for COVID-19.08:13CMPR Cimpress reports prelim Q3 results; Apollo Global Management (APO) confirms agreement to provide a $300 million secured note to Cimpress (63.20 )Co reports prelim Q3 revs of ~$598 mln vs $608.9 mln S&P Capital IQ two analyst estimate; Adjusted EBITDA of ~$71 mln, a year-over-year decline of 20%.

The overall action was muted, however with trader trepidation taking the lead with the FOMC set to release its latest statement today. The S&P is back up to the 2895 area, slightly off the session high of 2905.00. The low resides down at 2860.75.In Asia, the major markets were quiet with Japan closed for public holiday. The limited participation seemed to expand into the Chinese markets which saw small net changes to the upside with the Hang Seng closing 0.3% higher, while the Shanghai gained 0.4%.In Europe, the major bourses are trading higher, but the FTSE is outperforming its peers. Much of this can be attributed to the bounce in crude oil, which is up 14% and trading over the $14 area. This has helped index heavyweights BP and Shell to gain over 4% each.Market UpdatesS&P Futures vs Fair Value: +32.010 yr Note: 0.599%USD/JPY: 106.48 -0.39EUR/USD: 1.0863 +0.0044Europe: FTSE +1.0% DAX +0.5% CAC +0.2%Asia: Hang Seng +0.3% Shanghai +0.4% Nikkei CLOSEDGold (1719.30 -2.90) Silver (15.48 +0.31) Crude (14.33 +1.99)05:54EADSY Airbus reports Q1 results; co withdraws 2019 dividend proposal and suspending the voluntary top up in pension funding; withdraws 2020 guidance (14.26 )Co reports Q1 EPS of (EUR 0.65) vs EUR 0.05 last year; revs -15% yr/yr to EUR 10.6 bln.Given the current COVID-19 environment, various measures were announced in late March 2020 to protect the Company's financial liquidity and continue to fund its operations.

AMC's remarks include the following: "Universal stated it only pursued a direct-to-home entertainment release for 'Trolls World Tour' because theaters were closed and Universal was committed to a lucrative toy licensing deal. We had our doubts that this was wholly Universal's motivations [...]. Nonetheless, we accepted this action as an exception to our longstanding business practices in these unprecedented times.""In [the] Wall Street Journal, Jeff Shell is quoted as saying that: 'The results for 'Trolls World Tour' have exceeded our expectations and demonstrated the viability of PVOD [...]. As soon as theaters reopen, we expect to release movies on both formats.' This radical change by Universal to the business model that currently exists between our two companies represents nothing but downside for us and is categorically unacceptable to AMC Entertainment.""Going forward, AMC will not license any Universal movies in any of our 1,000 theatres globally on these terms.""Accordingly, we want to be absolutely clear, so that there is no ambiguity of any kind. AMC believes that with this proposed action to go to the home and theatres simultaneously, Universal is breaking the business model and dealings between our two companies. It assumes that we will meekly accept a reshaped view of how studios and exhibitors should interact, with zero concern on Universal's part as to how its actions affect us. It also presumes that Universal in fact can have its cake and eat it too, that Universal film product can be released to the home and theatres at the same time, without modification to the current economic arrangements between us." "It is disappointing to us, but Jeff's comments as to Universal's unilateral actions and intentions have left us with no choice. Therefore, effectively immediately AMC will no longer play any Universal movies in any of our theatres in the United States, Europe or the Middle East. This policy affects any and all Universal movies per se, goes into effect today and as our theatres reopen, and is not some hollow or ill-considered threat. Incidentally, this policy is not aimed solely at Universal out of pique or to be punitive in any way, it also extends to any movie maker who unilaterally abandons current windowing practices absent good faith negotiations between us, so that they as distributor and we as exhibitor both benefit and neither are hurt from such changes. Currently, with the press comment today, Universal is the only studio contemplating a wholesale change to the status quo. Hence, this immediate communication in response."18:27ERYP ERYTECH Pharma receives FDA Fast Track Designation for eryaspase in second-line pancreatic cancer (8.29 +0.79)The FDA has granted eryaspase Fast Track Designation for the development of a second-line treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

However, given the worldwide constrained availability of many of these products, our backlog has also increased substantially as we were unable to fulfill many of these orders which would have mitigated other softness in the market. As a result, we recorded low double-digit revenue declines during the closing weeks of the quarter which now appear to have stabilized at approximately 20% in April. We anticipate that we will be able to ship a portion of this backlog in the second quarter as visibility into our supply chain and product lead times has improved."17:05SUPN Supernus Pharma to acquire central nervous system portfolio from US WorldMeds for total consideration of $530 mln (19.49 -0.09)Supernus Pharmaceuticals announced that the company entered into a definitive agreement under which Supernus will acquire the central nervous system (CNS) portfolio of US WorldMeds, a privately-held biopharmaceutical company.

Hilton, chairman and chief executive officer of Meritage Homes. "Though our net earnings for the first quarter more than doubled and every key operating metric showed significant year-over-year growth, we are expecting much weaker results for at least the next couple of quarters due to large parts of the economy being shut down, causing record job losses, fear and uncertainty about the future. Our hearts go out to all those impacted directly and indirectly."...He explained, "With shelter-in-place orders in effect across most of our markets, we are seeing customers either virtually or by appointment in our sales offices and Studio M design centers. Those we see tend to be serious buyers ready to commit to a new home purchase, so while our traffic has understandably decreased, our conversion rates on the traffic we do see have increased."16:33MKSI MKS Instruments beats by $0.30, beats on revs; guides Q2 EPS in-line, revs in-line (97.75 +1.67)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $1.54 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.30 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.24; revenues rose 15.6% year/year to $535.7 mln vs the $508.65 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Vaccine recipients demonstrated strong antibody and T cell immune responses after 2 or 3 doses with 0.6 mg of INO-4700, a DNA vaccine that targets the MERS-CoV Spike (S) glycoprotein, delivered with intradermal CELLECTRA device. The vaccination regimen was well-tolerated with no vaccine-associated severe adverse events.Overall, for those receiving 0.6 mg of INO-4700, 88% demonstrated seroconversion after a 2 dose regimen at 0 and 8 weeks, while for those receiving a 3 dose regimen given at 0, 4 and 12 weeks, 84% seroverted after 2 doses and 100% after 3 doses, as measured by a binding antibody assay against the full-length S protein. Additionally, 92% of the vaccine recipients in both groups displayed the ability to neutralize the virus using a neutralization assay. Robust T cell responses were observed in 60% of vaccine recipients after the 2 dose regimen and 84% of those in the 3 dose group. A single dose of 0.6 mg of INO-4700 intradermal vaccination resulted in 74% binding antibody response rate and 48% neutralization antibody response rate. These results were selected for an oral presentation at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ASGCT) Conference, to be held virtually from May 12-15.INOVIO is planning to advance INO-4700 into a Phase 2 clinical trial in the Middle East with a previously announced funding of $56 mln by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.16:31AMD Advanced Micro reports EPS in-line, revs in-line; guides Q2 revs in-line; guides FY20 revs in-line (55.51 -0.98)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.18 per share, excluding non-recurring items, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.18; revenues rose 40.4% year/year to $1.79 bln vs the $1.79 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus and company guidance of $1.75-1.85 bln.Gross margin 46% versus 41% in prior-year period.

Oil demand has significantly deteriorated as a result. The unparalleled demand destruction has resulted in lower spending by customers and reduced demand for the company's products and services. There is significant uncertainty as to the duration of this disruption.As a critical supplier to the global energy infrastructure and an essential business, the company has remained operational with no closures to any facilities. MRC has had four confirmed illnesses reported, and all have recovered.

Large-cap technology and health care stocks lagged, while reopening enthusiasm continued to flow into the small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%) and S&P MidCap 400 (+1.0%). The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4%.The day started with broad gains that lifted the S&P 500 as much as 1.5% shortly after the open, as part of the reopening momentum from Monday. That broad momentum quickly dissipated, presumably due to valuation concerns, but lingered in areas of the market that had underperformed when the shutdown angst was rampant.Some of those included the small-cap and mid-cap stocks, as previously noted, but also the cyclical S&P 500 energy (+2.2%), materials (+2.0%), industrials (+1.8%), and financials (+0.9%) sectors.Conversely, the large-cap stocks that were deemed as relatively safe, and thus outperformed over the past few months, lost some of their appeal today and heavily dragged on the broader market. Those were found in the health care (-2.1%), communication services (-1.9%), and information technology (-1.4%) sectors.The health care space also had some negative catalysts despite the reported progress on the coronavirus front. For instance, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 151.39, -2.90, -1.9%) was downgraded to Neutral from Buy at UBS, while Pfizer (PFE 37.91, -0.42, -1.1%) and Merck (MRK 81.18, -2.80, -3.3%) declined after reporting earnings.In other earnings news, shares of Caterpillar (CAT 115.46, +0.26, +0.2%), 3M (MMM 157.61, +3.96, +2.6%), and PepsiCo (PEP 136.32, +1.4%) finished higher, even after the companies withdrew full-year guidance, while shares of UPS (UPS 96.43, -6.12, -6.0%) faltered after the company missed profit estimates.U.S. Treasuries reclaimed most of yesterday's losses, driving yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined three basis points to 0.20%, and the 10-yr yield declined five basis points to 0.61%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 99.88. WTI crude declined 4.6%, or $0.60, to $12.37/bbl, although it was down as much as 22% at one point during the session.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data:The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for April plunged to 86.9 (Briefing.com consensus 86.5) from a downwardly revised 118.8 (from 120.0) for March. The April reading is the lowest since June 2014.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers, while thinking positively about things reopening again, are still less optimistic about their financial prospects, which could be a headwind for spending activity during the recovery phase.The advance goods trade deficit totaled $64.2 bln in March after a $59.9 bln deficit in February. Advance retail inventories declined 1.3% in March after decreasing 0.3% in February. Advance wholesale inventories decreased 1.0% in March after decreasing 0.7% in February.The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for February increased 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.7%).Looking ahead, investors will receive the advance estimate for Q1 GDP, Pending Home Sales for March, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite -4.1% YTDS&P 500 -11.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -15.6% YTDRussell 2000 -22.0% YTD16:20CHRW C.H.

Our Braun, Vicks, PUR and Honeywell products are supporting consumer health at a time of extreme need, and our OXO products are providing convenience, comfort and solutions as families spend unprecedented amounts of time at home. We are working around the clock to meet as much of the ongoing demand for thermometers, humidifiers, air purifiers and water purifiers as possible. We are also working with suppliers and retailers to provide consumers with OXO kitchen, cleaning and storage products, as well as volumizers in Beauty, where demand is high in channels that are open. While encouraging, we do expect to see a net adverse impact to our results for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2021. Although still very early, we are making plans to continue selectively investing in the key Phase II initiatives once the economic situation allows. With our diversified portfolio of leading, trusted brands, a strong balance sheet with low net leverage, and a corporate culture driven to rise to the challenge, we believe Helen of Troy is well positioned to navigate the current unprecedented situation and emerge strong."Due to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and the related business uncertainty, the Company is not providing an Outlook for fiscal 2021 at this time. In order to reduce costs and preserve cash flow, the Company has implemented a number of measures that will remain in place until there is greater certainty, a reopening of retail customer brick and mortar stores and improved consumer demand, which include the following: A graduated salary reduction for all associates, including named executive officers and the other members of the Company's executive leadership team; A reduction in the cash compensation of the Company's Board of Directors; Suspension of merit increases, promotions and new associate hiring until further notice; The furlough of associates in specific areas directly tied to sales volume, with assistance to maintain health insurance coverage, as well as a reduction of external temporary labor and reduced work hours; Reduction or deferral of marketing expense. The Company will lean into brands with strong current demand and reduce investment in other key brands without sacrificing brand awareness; Limited reduction of investment in new product development and launches, in anticipation of more normalized economic activity; Elimination of travel expense in the short term, with a significant reduction planned for the second half of fiscal 2021; and Reduction of consulting fees and capital expenditures for projects that are not critical.16:17MET MetLife increases quarterly common stock dividend to $0.46/share from $0.44/share (35.18 +0.76)16:15TENB Tenable beats by $0.10, beats on revs; guides Q2 EPS above consensus, revs below consensus (24.70 -0.12)Reports Q1 (Mar) loss of $0.09 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.10 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.19); revenues rose 27.8% year/year to $102.6 mln vs the $100.07 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

That outlook excluded possible implications of the coronavirus, which at the time had not yet reached pandemic stage.

Besides China peddling money for influence in U.S. institutions of higher education (IHE), China is restricting any research regarding the origins of COVID-19 that does not comport with CCP propaganda. To nations battling peak pandemic outbreaks, the CCP's machinations undoubtedly hamper the global response to the pandemic,” the letter, which was sent to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, stated.The letter was organized by the committee's ranking member Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan who was joined by a number of Republicans, including Rep. Virginia Foxx, ranking member of the House Committee on Education and Labor Rep.

How China Is Planning to Win Back the WorldAtlantic OnlineMay 28, 2020 ThursdayCopyright 2020 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc. All Rights ReservedLength: 3561 wordsByline: Kathy GilsinanBodyIt was posed as an innocent question, not an accusation. If the U.S. was so concerned about transparency, China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying wondered aloud to nearly half a million followers on Twitter earlier this month, why not open its own biodefense lab in Maryland's Fort Detrick to international inspectors?Hua's tweet was also an invitation to a conspiracy theory, and a message that, if President Donald Trump was determined to speculate about the virus first appearing in a Chinese lab-a notion that scientists have dismissed and that allied intelligence agencies            find"highly unlikely"-then China was going to give as good as it got. Beijing            does not accept that the virus originated in China at all, insisting that just because the country first reported the virus, and traced many of the first cases to an outdoor market in Wuhan, doesn't mean it came from there. What if, Hua intimated without quite saying, it came from a U.S. lab instead?After that May 8 tweet, Chinese state media outlets picked up the question and started pushing it in multiple languages: Spanish and Arabic as well as English. On May 12, the state-run China Global Television Network            offered a story on the Fort Detrick lab's "purely freakish history," including the            very real CIA experiments on humans that began there in the 1950s. The hawkish Communist Party newspaper Global Times ran a            piece on May 14 declaring, "The US can't just claim all reasonable inquiries to its bio-labs as 'conspiracy theories.'" This followed the paper's earlier            speculation, citing a            mysterious anonymous petition on the White House website, that the base may have been the source of a virus leak.  This was a bizarre salvo in China's propaganda war with the United States over the coronavirus, and it showcased Beijing's latest information weaponry. Misleading spin, obfuscation, concealment, and hyperbole have been hallmarks of the Chinese Communist Party's propaganda campaign, before and during the coronavirus era. But the pandemic appears to have given rise to more forceful attacks on foreign governments, as well as a new level of flirtation with outright disinformation.[           Thomas Wright: How should Biden handle China?]The party has never waged a global struggle quite like this one-and its battle with the U.S. over where the virus came from and whose failures made the pandemic worse have marked a serious deterioration in the two countries' ties. Just months ago, Trump was praising Xi Jinping for how he handled the outbreak; now Trump is            toying with cutting off relations with the Chinese government altogether.Seven decades ago, Mao Zedong publicly embraced a benevolent view of propaganda, as if he were a latter-day prophet spreading the communist gospel: "We should carry on constant propaganda among the people on the facts of world progress and the bright future ahead so that they will build their confidence in victory," he            mused in 1945. Just a few months ago, Xi Jinping            urged state journalists to spread "positive propaganda" for the "correct guidance of public opinion." Indeed, Beijing's global propaganda efforts in recent years have been more about promoting China's virtues than about spreading acrimony and confusion, Ã  la Russian information ops and election meddling. Moscow wants a weakened and divided West, one that leaves Russia free to dominate its self-appointed sphere of influence-but Russia in 2016 was also an economically sluggish, oil-dependent nation with an economy a tenth the size of America's, and lacked the resources to remake the world in its image.Beijing has a much bigger prize in mind and a much longer-term plan to get it: The contest isn't about who gets to run the U.S. It's about who deserves to run the world. And China, with its economy poised to overtake that of the United States, has already            plowed billions into crafting an image as a responsible global leader, and billions more into cultivating global dependence on Chinese investments and Chinese markets."While the [Chinese Communist Party] has long sought to be a global influencer, their efforts today are aggressive and sophisticated," Bill Evanina, the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, wrote in an email. "In short, they're looking to reshape the history of coronavirus and protect their reputation at home and around the world."[           Read: The end of Hong Kong]Before the coronavirus hit, the party was becoming bolder in its propaganda efforts overseas as China grew richer and more powerful, trying to promote around the world the orthodoxy it enforced at home, about the beneficence and goodness of the CCP. This involved publicizing Chinese investments in the developing world, arm-twisting diplomats to toe a pro-China line, ruthlessly trying to stifle even other countries' freedom to dissent-to the point of            sanctioning Norway in 2010 when the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded its peace prize to the imprisoned democracy activist Liu Xiaobo, who died in 2017. Xi has elevated the role of propaganda even further as he has vowed to build China's power and prosperity,            declaring, "The superiority of our system will be fully demonstrated through a brighter future."The coronavirus outbreak and the global outcry against China's failures of transparency and containment were not part of the plan. They sparked an international backlash that, by Beijing's            reported reckoning, was worse than anything it had faced since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. So Beijing leaped to seize, or at least confuse, the global story of the virus and its cast of heroes and villains.This has involved unleashing techniques Russia perfected during the U.S. presidential election in 2016. "We've seen China adopt Russian-style social media manipulation tactics like using bots and trolls to amplify disinformation on COVID-19," Lea Gabrielle, the special envoy and coordinator for the State Department's Global Engagement Center, wrote to me in an email. "Both countries repress information within their countries while taking advantage of the open and free information environments in democracies to push conspiracy theories that seek to undermine those environments."As the world realized the virus was spreading out of control, Chinese diplomats, official media, and Twitter influencers launched an aggressive frenzy of defense, scrambling to preserve the Chinese Communist Party's cratering reputation at home and overseas. And then they went on offense, with an assist from            perhaps thousands of fake or hacked Twitter accounts, according to the investigative site ProPublica. The result was a coordinated campaign of attacks on the United States, and the spread of disinformation and confusion about where the virus really came from and whose screwup it was, really, that led to so much death.[           Read: America's patchwork pandemic is fraying even further]Other countries' faltering responses to the virus have only bolstered this narrative, and the CCP has gleefully trumpeted America's failures in particular. "Loose political system in the US allows more than 4000 people to die of pandemic every day," Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of the Global Times newspaper,            tweeted in April. "Americans are so good tempered." Beyond the immediate crisis, this kind of narrative also serves the longer-term goal. In the words of Matt Schrader, a former China analyst with the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund: "Ultimately it's about the [Chinese Communist Party] being the most powerful political entity on the planet."The CCP has evolved in its themes and tactics over the course of the coronavirus information war so far, as it battles to bolster its own reputation and degrade that of the United States. The campaign has been widespread and highly focused at the same time. And the party has grown even more emboldened in the belief that it's too big to fail, and that the reeling world may condemn it but still depends on it.Suppression and celebrationEven more important than what the Chinese Communist Party says is what it doesn't say. The party is such an aggressive suppressor of negative news that at one point government censors            tried to block social-media references to Winnie the Pooh-because whimsical Chinese netizens had seized on the pudgy cartoon bear's purported resemblance to Xi. The Central Propaganda Department            distributes guidelines to media organizations and scrubs microblogging platforms for references to the widespread abuses of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang and to hopes for autonomy in Tibet.So "relatively open" online discussions of the virus in late January, according            to a report by the Freedom House China analyst Sarah Cook, seemed almost out of character. "Professional journalists took advantage of the government's slow response to publish reports on the early days of the outbreak and life under the dramatic lockdown of numerous cities in China." The party's flagship paper, the People's Daily, however, had largely ignored the gathering virus up until that point, Cook notes; back then it was covering the U.S. House and Senate impeachment votes on Trump and the U.S. strike against the Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. And China had already waged perhaps the most dangerous information-suppression campaign of the entire crisis-           reprimanding doctors who tried to warn one another about the disease, blocking reports about sickened health-care workers, and ordering labs to destroy samples.The coronavirus killed one of those doctors, Li Wenliang, in early February, prompting an outpouring of grief and outrage on Chinese social media. What openness there had been was over. "Less than 90 minutes after his            death on Friday morning, the hashtag 'I want freedom of speech' was            trending on Weibo, a popular Chinese blogging site, with nearly 2 million posts,"            wrote NPR's Emily Feng and Amy Cheng. "The posts were gone by sunrise."At the same time that Chinese authorities were pulling down criticism, they were pushing out praise for first responders. State media published stories about robots delivering food, factory employees giving up their holidays to make masks, a nurse shaving her head to speed up the process of putting on protective gear. The People's Daily ran a love letter to the city of Wuhan, titled "Heroic City, Heroic People": "Our hospitals have become the battlefield!,"            reads a partial translation by the China Media Project. Of the medical workers who had rushed to Wuhan from around the country, it noted: "In order to not impact the flow of their work, some doctors and nurses wore adult diapers ... Their white outfits are war fatigues, and they are the most beautiful resisters, the most adorable people of the New Era!"Cook traces how the narrative began to shift into February, accruing credit to the Communist Party's own actions and then, ultimately, turning attention to the rest of the world as the coronavirus slammed into other countries. Xiao Qiang, a research scientist at the School of Information at UC Berkeley, told me that the party's line about other countries' response was essentially: "They couldn't handle it either." The government version of events became that China had handled the outbreak well by comparison, and had a lot to teach the world about it. In March, the government            dispatched aid to virus-ravaged Italy at a time when the European Union            would notstep in, and state-run papers published pictures of the team arriving along with quotes of gratitude from Italian officials.Before the month was out, Chinese state media            was suggesting that the virus may have originated in Italy instead-an early effort to flood the world with confusion about where the virus came from.The counterpunch As the message was shifting, one tactic remained consistent: Pump up the seeming good news about the party and suppress the bad. In March            came the expulsion of American journalists working for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post, which China's Foreign Ministry characterized as a response to U.S. restrictions on Chinese media acting on behalf of a foreign government. (One senior State Department official            told reporters, while announcing the new restrictions in February: "We think it's altogether appropriate that we basically call these entities what they are, which are organs of the Chinese one-party state propaganda apparatus.")By mid-April, diplomats and state media were focused on rising infection rates in the United States and the United Kingdom. Hua, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman,            pointed out on April 12 that the U.S. then led the world in infections and deaths, despite having been warned in early January about the situation in Wuhan. State broadcasters highlighted praise for China's early response from the World Health Organization, right as Trump was swiping at the agency for its criticism of the U.S. and            complaining that the organization seemed "to always err on the side of China."[           Read: How China]           deceived           the WHOThe most aggressive trolling came in video form. The state-run news agency Xinhua's "Once Upon a Virus"            featured animated Legos-a set of responsible, masked Chinese ones trying to warn a recalcitrant Lego Statue of Liberty that people needed to take the virus seriously and wear masks. After dismissing the warnings, the Lego Liberty turns red with rage and ends up on an intravenous drip, whining, "Why didn't you warn us?" The Chinese embassy in France            tweeted the video, which racked up more than 15,000 retweets. Graham Brookie, the director and managing editor of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, wrote to me in an email that it was fair to say the tweet was "targeted towards the Western world," and specifically Europe. Brookie noted that a small portion of the video's Twitter spread was aided by accounts with Western-sounding names, such as "           Emily Clark," and "bot-like indicators"-ones that were recently created, or had handles involving a first name and a scramble of numbers, or lacked profile pictures, or whose sole tweet was the Lego video. "All retweeted the China Xinhua News' tweet with the same copy-and-pasted text," he wrote.Another video put the narrative in even more explicit terms, presenting America as not merely hapless but in outright decline. The United States has now seen 100,000 deaths attributable to the virus, while China has claimed only about 5,000, though U.S. intelligence officials            believe China is far underreporting its numbers. The state-owned China Global Television network            pronounced the virus "Waterloo for America's leadership," as a British-accented announcer intoned, over shots of the Capitol building and homeless people gathered in a parking lot: "An increasing number of observers are beginning to see that the health emergency is signaling the end of the American century ... There is growing evidence that Washington is tumbling to rock bottom over its coronavirus response."The conspiracyPerhaps the most surprising new feature of China's coronavirus propaganda effort has been the dabbling in Russian-style disinformation. Nowhere has this been clearer than in prominent government officials' efforts to obscure the origins of the virus, floating the baseless theories that the U.S. Army            might have brought the disease to Wuhan, or that            maybe it started in Italy. Sometimes these weren't so much pure "fake news" plants as they were the "people are saying" variety of misdirection that has become a hallmark of how Trump's White House deals with criticism.Some of these types of attacks appeared to be experiments and have since faded. Gabrielle, the State Department special envoy, said at a press conference in March that Chinese officials in Africa briefly pushed a U.S.-origin theory of the virus, but then "abandoned that disinformation campaign" after receiving mostly negative online reactions. Elsewhere, Gabrielle wrote to me, Beijing backed off from directly attributing the virus to the U.S. "But we continue to see CCP propaganda like CGTN push content that suggests the U.S. is the origin of the virus. The [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] is still citing conspiracy websites in its messaging."Hence the Fort Detrick tweets from the foreign ministry, which never directly say the U.S. bio lab cooked up the virus, but darkly hint that there may be something there to investigate.Economic coercion and diplomatic arm-twistingWhen all else fails-when hints on Twitter just don't seem to cut it-Beijing can rely on its economic power to try to coerce kindness from foreign officials or stifle their criticism. This has two benefits relative to China's domestic audience: Praise can be trumpeted as evidence that China is respected around the world, while criticism can be used to stoke nationalist defensiveness in the face of politicians seen as unfairly targeting China.When Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison            called for an independent investigation into the origins of the virus, China's ambassador to Australia            lashed out, pronouncing the Chinese public to be "frustrated, dismayed, and disappointed" and launching into some hypotheticals in the vein of nice trading relationship-would be a shame if anything happened to it. "The tourists," said Ambassador Cheng Jingye in            an interview with the Australian Financial Review, "may have second thoughts." (More than 1 million people visit Australia from China every year, more tourists than visit from any other country.) "Maybe the parents of the students would also think whether this place, which they find is not so friendly, even hostile, is the best place to send their kids to ... And also, maybe the ordinary people will think why they should drink Australian wine or eat Australian beef." The implications for a country that relies on trade with China were hard to miss. Australia has continued to push for the inquiry.China then started restricting some Australian meat imports, imposed tariffs on barley, and, according to Bloomberg,            is considering targeting wine and dairy.Beijing has even reportedly pressured foreign officials not to criticize its own use of disinformation. The Financial Times reported that Chinese officials complained to the European Union            three times right before the bloc released a report on disinformation in the pandemic-and the published report            removed a sentence in an earlier draft saying that China was running a "global disinformation campaign to deflect blame." The EU's top diplomat denied having bowed to any pressure, but one EU disinformation analyst aware of the changes            accused EU diplomats of "self-censoring to appease the Chinese Communist Party." It's unclear what specific threats, if any, Chinese officials made, though China and the European Union are among each other's largest trading partners.[           Read: China's bargain on global influence is paying off]But the biggest battle is between the United States and China, particularly as the U.S. struggles to stabilize its death toll and has appeared disinterested in leading a global response-for example sitting out an EU-led fundraising conference for a vaccine to which China sent a low-level representative. China has made ostentatious pledges of cash to the WHO as the U.S. has paused its funding, and Beijing has vowed to offer any vaccine discoveries from Chinese scientists as a global public good.In Washington, officials and lawmakers are demanding some unspecified form of accountability from China and concocting ways to pull some manufacturing back to the United States, while demanding investigations into the virus's origins. Chinese state media outlets characterize Trump's blaming China as a deflection of responsibility for his own government's failures-but just because it's propaganda doesn't mean it's false. "What I see is a race to the bottom with China," Susan Shirk, the chair of the 21st-Century China Center at UC San Diego, told me. "The cost of this is more people are going to die. More people are going to die because the two biggest economies in the world are not going to put their disputes aside to get the world to work together to confront this pandemic."The longer-term implications stretch far beyond the immediate crisis, however. When it's all over, China will have gained experience pushing its propaganda overseas at a volume and intensity it never had before. The CCP has succeeded at home, through rigorous information management, in controlling what Schrader, the former German Marshall Fund scholar, calls the "means of perception." And the party is having some success extending those tools beyond its borders. "Controlling the means of perception is fundamental to power," Schrader said. And the better China's propaganda works, the more power it will have to shape the rest of the world.Load-Date: June 3, 2020End of Document

Our second quarter of 2020 financial results will be materially impacted by the rescheduling of the Kentucky Oaks and Derby from the second quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2020, by the continued closure and suspended operations of our wholly-owned gaming properties and certain wholly-owned racing operations, and by the continued closure of the casino properties related to our two equity investments.

The charge was primarily attributable to write-downs related to our corporate headquarters and employee transition costs, partially offset by a gain on the disposition of a non-operating facility. In the first quarter of 2020, the Leasing Group increased its revenues and operating profit to $236.3 million and $92.9 million, respectively, compared with $200.4 million and $85.8 million, respectively, in the same quarter of 2019. The increase in the Leasing Group's revenues was primarily due to a higher volume of railcars sold from the lease fleet, growth in the lease fleet, and higher average lease rates, partially offset by lower utilization when compared to the first quarter of 2019.16:27ALSN Allison Transmission awarded $162 mln contract by the U.S. Army to provide the X1100-3B1 propulsion solution for the M1A2 Abrams Main Battle Tank (37.78 2.03)The contract, valued at approximately $162M, includes transmission production, upgrades, sustainment kits and service support.

The demand deterioration that we started to see in March has increased through the month of April with POS levels in the North American imprintables channel down approximately 75%. Sell-through trends in retail, including with global lifestyle brand customers, have also deteriorated, with overall retailer POS for our products in April down approximately 45%. Based on this situation and the expectation that COVID-19 social distancing measures and related economic impacts will have a significant impact on demand during the quarter, we are planning for a significant decline in point of sale (POS) and shipments for the second quarter of 2020. Accordingly, this sales outlook combined with the impact of fixed cost absorption, while our manufacturing facilities remain idle, will likely result in a significant earnings loss in the second quarter of 2020."16:26HIG Hartford Financial beats by $0.01, misses on revs (41.15 +1.81)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $1.34 per share, $0.01 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.33; revenues rose 0.3% year/year to $4.96 bln vs the $5.24 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Book value per diluted share was $41.42, down 6% from December 31, 2019; book value per diluted share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income rose 1% to $44.07.Commentary: "In the quarter, pricing momentum in middle market remained strong.

The Nasdaq Composite rose 3.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.2%, and the Russell 2000 rose 4.8%.The day started with Gilead Sciences (GILD 83.14, +4.47, +5.7%) affirming that remdesivir, an antiviral treatment for COVID-19, met its primary endpoint in an NIAID placebo-controlled study. The news helped the market open noticeably higher, as it fueled reopening hopes and overshadowed data depicting Q1 GDP contracting at a 4.8% annualized rate (Briefing.com consensus -4.3%).The ensuing advance in stocks was paced by the S&P 500 energy (+7.4%), communication services (+5.1%), and information technology (+4.2%) sectors, while the defensive-oriented consumer staples (-0.4%) and utilities (-0.9%) sectors were left out of the rally.Alphabet (GOOG 1341.48, +107.81, +8.7%), MasterCard (MA 283.69, +19.09, +7.2%), and Boeing (BA 139.00, +7.70, +5.9%) contributed to the bullish price action following their earnings reports. Energy stocks received an added boost from the 22% spike in oil prices ($15.13/bbl, +2.76, +22.3%).Later in the day, the Fed unanimously voted to maintain the target range for the fed funds rate at 0.00-0.25%, as was expected, and said rates will remain there until the economy is on track to achieve the Fed's goals of full employment and price stability. The inference is that rates will stay there for much longer, as the record unemployment isn't expected to return to normal anytime soon.Fed Chair Powell acknowledged that low rates alone won't revive economic activity and reiterated the Fed's commitment to using its full range of policy tools. Mr. Powell also said legislators should embrace policies that protect against avoidable insolvencies. Market reaction was relatively muted to the policy directive and the Fed Chair's comments.While most stocks finished the day higher, notable holdouts included Starbucks (SBUX 76.86, -1.83, -2.3%), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 53.66, -1.85, -3.3%), and General Electric (GE 6.58, -0.22, -3.2%) following their earnings reports.Small-cap companies Hertz Global (HTZ 4.00, -1.00, -20.0%) and Chesapeake Energy (CHK 26.85, -2.33, -8.0%) sold off on news of potential bankruptcy filings.U.S. Treasuries were relatively unchanged throughout the session, as bond investors were unfazed by the equity rally given the weak GDP data and precarious economic environment. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.19%, while the 10-yr yield increased two basis points to 0.63%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 99.53.Reviewing Wednesday's economic data:First quarter GDP declined at an annualized rate of 4.8% (Briefing.com consensus -4.3%) while the GDP Price Deflator was 1.3% (Briefing.com consensus 1.1%). This was the largest decline in GDP since the fourth quarter of 2008.The key takeaway from the report is that it hints at how ugly the Advance Q2 GDP report will be given that shutdown measures in the U.S. didn't start to gain steam until the latter half of March.Pending Home Sales dropped 20.8% in March after increasing a revised 2.3% in February (from +2.4%).The weekly Mortgage Applications Index declined 3.3% following a 0.3% decline in the prior week.Looking ahead, investors will receive the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, Personal Income and Spending for March, the Q1 Employment Cost Index and the Chicago PMI for April on Thursday.Nasdaq Composite -0.7% YTDS&P 500 -9.0% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -13.7% YTDRussell 2000 -18.4% YTD16:23TYL Tyler Tech reports EPS in-line, misses on revs; comments on outlook (320.99 +8.98)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $1.25 per share, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.25; revenues rose 11.3% year/year to $276.78 mln vs the $279.85 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus."We anticipate a greater impact from COVID-19 in the second and third quarters.

Our financial position is strong with very robust liquidity. We continue to expect a significant amount of positive operating cash flow during 2020. Additionally, we have no meaningful debt maturities until May 2024. Out of an abundance of caution, we have implemented appropriate financial measures, which should allow us to safe-guard the employment of our associates. In order to fund these employment safe-guards, we have deferred certain cash expenditures for corporate and field maintenance, cemetery development, and growth capital expenditures, and we believe we have the flexibility to adjust further.""Due to the uncertainty of current economic conditions, in early April, we withdrew our full year 2020 guidance. We will continue to closely assess this situation, and will provide further updates when the effects of the pandemic are more predictable. As we look forward in 2020, we anticipate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on both our funeral and cemetery segments will result in a decline of our adjusted earnings per share, which we hope to minimize as we continue to be vigilant with our costs and expenses."16:23URI United Rentals beats by $0.82, beats on revs; withdraws FY20 guidance (127.98 +11.43)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $3.35 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.82 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.53; revenues rose 0.4% year/year to $2.13 bln vs the $2.08 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus."Our business tracked as we expected through early March, when the outlook for 2020 became far more uncertain due to the pandemic.

As expected, our average selling price (ASP) declined further as our mix continues to shift from Model S and Model X to the more affordable Model 3 and Model Y.Our automotive gross margin of 25.5% as well as total gross margin of 20.6% both reached their highest levels in 18 months.Quarter-end cash and cash equivalents increased by $1.8B QoQ to $8.1B, driven mainly by our recent $2.3B capital raise and offset by negative quarterly free cash flow of $895M.Model Y production also exceeded the first quarter of production of Model 3 in Shanghai, demonstrating continued improvements in program execution. Additionally, we achieved positive gross margin for Model Y in its first production quarter.Our Gigafactory Shanghai ramp is progressing according to plan. Due to better than expected progress, we believe Model 3 will achieve a production rate of ~4,000/week (or ~200k/year extrapolated run rate) by mid-2020.Based on the current progress, we are on track to start the first Model Y deliveries from Gigafactory Berlin in 2021.Due to the wide range of potential outcomes, near-term guidance of net income and free cash flow would likely be inaccurate. We will again revisit our 2020 guidance in our Q2 update.While near-term profit guidance is currently on hold, we believe we will achieve industry leading operating margins and profitability with capacity expansion and localization plans underway.We expect that production of both Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai will continue to ramp gradually through Q2. We are continuing to build capacity for Model Y at Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Shanghai and remain on track to start deliveries from both locations in 2021. Lastly, we are shifting our first Tesla Semi deliveries to 2021.16:18FIVE Five Below announces initial store re-openings and other COVID-19 updates (92.66 +2.63)The company plans to open additional stores over the coming weeks, as local conditions permit, with a goal of having the majority of Five Below stores open to the public by early June.

The IDMC recommendation was made after completion of a pre-planned interim analysis of the first 280 patients and where the study met the protocol-specified futility criteria. The study was conducted as part of a post-marketing requirement related to safety. The IDMC conducted multiple periodic safety analyses during the study and reported no new safety concerns.While enrollment has been discontinued, the trial will run to completion through the follow-up of the more than 370 patients enrolled.

The company has also continued to expand its payment managing services internationally, last week announcing plans to expand to Australia and Canada later this year. eBay has yet to offer formal commentary on any impact dealt by the COVID-19 pandemic to its operations.EBAY has a market valuation of circa $31.3 bln and trades at roughly 14x forward earnings estimates. The stock on Monday recorded its highest levels since September.15:20BONDX Treasury Market SummaryTreasuries End Mixed as Fed HoldsU.S. Treasuries ended Wednesday on a mixed note after backing off their morning highs. Treasuries started the cash session with solid gains, but the first 30 minutes of action saw a pullback, which took place after the release of a Q1 GDP report, which pointed to the sharpest contraction since the financial crisis. However, the early pullback found support near yesterday's closing levels, allowing Treasuries to bounce to fresh highs. The market remained near its best levels of the day into mid-morning action, but an aggressive upward charge in stocks invited some selling in Treasuries. The afternoon release of the latest FOMC Statement was met with a muted initial reaction, but Treasuries slipped to lows into the close. The FOMC repeated its promise to support the flow of credit through asset purchases and Fed Chairman, Jay Powell, reiterated that the central bank remains ready to act aggressively. The U.S. Dollar Index slid 0.3% to 99.57, pausing just above yesterday's low. Yield Check: 2-yr: -1 bp to 0.19% 3-yr: -1 bp to 0.25% 5-yr: -1 bp to 0.36% 10-yr: +2 bps to 0.63% 30-yr: +4 bps to 1.25%News: Australia's Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, said that Australia will relax its lockdown measures soon. Tokyo will extend its state of emergency past May 6. Yonhap reported that the Bank of Korea has expanded its digital currency pilot program with major retailers. Fitch lowered Italy's rating to BBB- from BBB with a Stable outlook. South Korea's March Retail Sales fell 1.0% m/m (last -6.0%) while March Industrial Production increased 4.6% m/m (expected -1.3%; last -3.8%), rising 7.1% yr/yr (expected -1.9%; last 11.3%). May Manufacturing BSI Index fell to 45 from 52. Australia's Q1 CPI increased 0.3% qtr/qtr (expected 0.2%; last 0.7%), rising 2.2% yr/yr (expected 2.0%; last 1.8%). Eurozone's April Business and Consumer Survey fell to 67.0 from 94.2 (expected 74.7). March M3 Money Supply increased 7.5% yr/yr (expected 5.5%; last 5.5%). Germany's March Import Price Index fell 3.5% m/m (expected -2.5%; last -0.9%), decreasing 5.5% yr/yr (expected -4.0%; last -2.0%). Spain's March Retail Sales fell 14.1% yr/yr (last 1.8%) while April Business Confidence fell to -35.1 from -7.1. Swiss April ZEW Expectations increased to 12.7 from -45.8. Today's Data: First quarter GDP declined at an annualized rate of 4.8% (Briefing.com consensus -4.3%) while the GDP Price Deflator was 1.3% (Briefing.com consensus 1.1%). This was the largest decline in GDP since the fourth quarter of 2008. The key takeaway from the report is that it hints at how ugly the Advance Q2 GDP report will be given that shutdown measures in the U.S. didn't start to gain steam until the latter half of March. Pending Home Sales tumbled 20.8% in March after a revised 2.3% increase (from 2.4%) in February. The weekly MBA Mortgage Index fell 3.3% to follow last week's 0.3% downtick. The Purchase Index rose 11.6% while the Refinance Index fell 7.3%. Weekly crude oil inventories increased by 8.99 mln barrels after increasing by 15.0 mln barrels during the previous week.

The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for non-GAAP EPS is $1.27 and for revenue it's $33.70 bln. It's important to note that MSFT typically guides on the call, although with the pandemic, MSFT may not provide guidance this time. Last time, MSFT guided to MarQ revs of $34.1-34.9 bln.Microsoft operates in several areas and it's important to know the breakdown by segment: Productivity and Business Processes (Office 365, LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, which are cloud-based ERP and CRM apps), Intelligent Cloud (Azure, SQL Server, Windows Server), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Surface, Xbox).In January, MSFT's guidance by segment was: PBP: $11.5-11.7 bln IC: $11.85-12.05 bln and MPC: $10.75-11.15 bln. In February, Microsoft said it was seeing strong Windows demand as expected. However, the supply chain was returning to normal operations at a slower pace than anticipated. As a result, Q3 (Mar) revenue for its MPC segment would come up short of prior guidance. The silver lining is that all other components of Q3 guidance remain unchanged. Microsoft's crown jewel has been its Azure cloud computing business which primarily competes Amazon's (AMZN) AWS service. In Q2 (Dec), Azure revenue jumped 62%, an acceleration from 59% in Q1 (Sep). Another bright spot has been Dynamics 365, which is a suite of ERP and CRM applications for businesses. It grew by 42% yr/yr in DecQ. MSFT tends to be very consistent in terms of beating consensus estimates with 14 EPS beats in a row, including double digit EPS beats in each of the past four quarters. Something we have a concern about is how the quarter ended. When IBM reported results last week, it said it saw a noticeable change in client priorities towards cash preservation in mid-March. There was effectively a pause, especially in IBM's software business, where the vast majority of transactions typically close in the last two weeks of the quarter. With MSFT's heavy exposure to software and enterprise customers generally, we'll be watching for any late-quarter deals getting pushed into JunQ. On a final note, MSFT's Azure rival Amazon is set to report tomorrow after the close. Azure's performance, especially late in the quarter, should give us a window into what to expect for AWS tomorrow.15:08ECONX Fed Chair Powell says unemployment rate to be a high number in Q2 (uncertain what that will be)When consumer spending starts to pick up again, people will start getting rehired.Thinks it will be "some time" before we get back to anything that resembles maximum employment.15:04ECONX Fed Chair Powell says he has been advocate for getting back on sustainable fiscal path, but this is not the time to act on those concernsNeed to use the resources of the government to guard against long-term damage from this COVID-19 experience.14:59ECONX Fed Chair Powell: Q3 could see fairly large GDP increase given size of the fall, but unlikely the increase would bring us back to pre-virus levelsConsumers and businesses likely to still show some caution even after some of the social distancing guidelines are relaxed; sooner the virus can be brought under control, the sooner everyone will regain confidence.14:54ECONX Fed Chair Powell says corporate credit facility is near being finalized and should be operating fairly soonClose to announcing new term sheet for Main Street lending Facility; thinks there will be a couple different types of lending going on here and that the facility is likely to expand for some time, so will see a start to facility for some of it soon but doesn't expect full operations to happen fairly quickly.In characterizing what Fed means by saying there are considerable risks to the economic outlook over the "medium term," he says medium term means next year or so. Some possible recovery impediments include: 1) the path the virus takes 2) the possibility of damage to the productive capacity of the economy (i.e. workers facing long-term unemployment and unnecessary insolvencies for businesses) and 3) the global dimension of the COVID-19 impact.14:43ECONX Fed Chair Powell says legislators should embrace policies that protect against avoidable insolvenciesAdds such policies will have a hefty price tag but that they would help ensure we come out of this situation with less long term damage.Notes monetary policy position is right where it should be for now to help avoid deflationary spiral.14:39SCANX Mid cap notable movers of interest -- Saia (SAIA) gains following upside first quarter results -Technical-The following are some of today's most notable mid cap movers of interest ($2 bln - $10 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).Mid Cap GainersNCLH (15.59 +19.1%): Rises to its highest levels in a month on close to 2x average volume. Stocks representing industries that have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, including co and various cruise line peers, rise amid a rebound in the broader market bolstered by hopes for further economic reopening and the latest results from Gilead Sciences' (GILD) trial of antiviral remdesivir in treating COVID-19.SAIA (101.77 +19.07%): Posted upside Q1 EPS and revs (+8.7% yr/yr to $446.4 mln). Co's operating ratio improved by 170 bps yr/yr; co reported that it saw improved productivity across its operations derived from focus on pricing and mix management. LTL shipments per workday rose +2.3% yr/yr. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, co experienced a downturn in volumes across its network in March following a "strong" start to the month; co responded with cost adjustments. Rises to two-month highs. LSCC (22.29 +14.02%): Topped consensus for Q1 EPS while missing on revs. Gross margin expanded to 59.8% from 58.6% in the prior year quarter, benefiting from actions taken to expand gross margin and profitability; cash flow from operations was $21 mln. Issued in-line guidance for Q2 revs. Price target raised to $27 from $24 at Cowen, which comments positively on co's June quarter guidance as well as co's on-track product roadmap and gross margin progress. Climbs to three-month highs, outpacing gains for the broader semiconductor sector.Mid Cap LosersFRO (9.2 -12.13%): Tanker and oil shipping industry names generally fall in contrast with rebounding oil prices, which may indicate a shift in the demand landscape for oil cargo storage providers. ALKS (14.67 -8.91%): Posted upside results for Q1 on the top and bottom lines. Net sales for VIVITROL grew approx. +14% yr/yr to $78.8 mln; ARISTADA sales rose approx. +68% to $51.0 mln. Owing to the uncertainties and disruptions created in the healthcare system by COVID-19, co is withdrawing its 2020 expectations at this time. COVID-19 has impacted timelines on certain of co's clinical trials. VIR (30.4 -7.08%): Sees volatility alongside various names in the COVID-19 treatment and therapy space, which today processes results from Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Phase 3 SIMPLE trial evaluating antiviral remdesivir in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19.14:38ECONX Fed Chair Powell notes Fed has slowed pace of asset purchases in recent weeks due to improvement in market conditionsSays depth and duration of downturn are significantly uncertain and that severity is dependent on the government's response.Reiterates that Fed is committed to using full range of its policy tools.Stresses that low rates don't help if there isn't a flow through to financial markets and businesses and consumers can't get access to credit.Q&A portion of press conference now beginning.14:33COMDX Energy Settlement PricesJun Crude Oil futures rose $2.85 (23.1%) to $15.19/barrel Jun Natural Gas $0.06 lower (-3.23%) at $1.885/MMBtu Jun RBOB Gasoline settled $0.06 higher (8.24%) at $0.762/gallon Jun Heating oil futures settled $0.07 higher (10.48%) at $0.7853/gallon14:27TSN Tyson Foods 'is now offering $120 million in 'thank you bonuses' for 116,000 U.S. frontline workers and truckers, up from the $60 million announced in early April' (63.46 +0.66)Tyson Foods is also increasing short-term disability coverage to 90% of normal pay until June 30, 2020, for team members who are unable to work due to illness.14:23TALKX Market Briefing: Muted response to FOMC directive as participants wait to hear from PowellThe stock market had already moved off its best levels of the day leading up to the FOMC announcement at 2:00 p.m. ET. The FOMC news didn't change much, partly because the FOMC view didn't change.In a unanimous vote, the target range for the fed funds rate was maintained at 0.00-0.25%. It was noted that the target range is expected to remain there "until [the Fed] is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals."In other words, the target range is going to remain where it is for a long time considering where the unemployment rate is headed with 26 million+ unemployment claims in the last five weeks and assuming it is unlikely to return to its current level (4.4%) anytime soon.The muted response to the directive isn't surprising. Market participants are focused on what Fed Chair Powell says at his press conference, which begins at 2:30 p.m. ET. Most are hoping for additional context on what would motivate the Fed to do more (such as maybe buying stocks?) or encourage it to do less.The Russell 2000 is up 4.9%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 3.3%; the S&P 500 is up 2.6%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 2.3%.14:14MCD McDonald's: Earnings Preview -- We get our first look at how MCD is adapting to the pandemic (188.43 +2.47)McDonald's (MCD) is set to report Q1 results tomorrow before the open with a call to follow at 8:30am ET. The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for Q1 non-GAAP EPS is $1.55 and for revenue it's $4.66 bln. The company has already withdrawn 2020 guidance.MCD breaks down its sales into several segments: US (its largest segment), International Operated Markets (IOM) which is comprised of wholly-owned markets, or countries in which MCD operates restaurants, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Russia, Spain and the UK, and International Developmental Licensed Markets (IDL) which is comprised of the remaining markets in the McDonald's system.Global comps are always a key metric for MCD, although MCD has already disclosed Q1 comps, so this will not be new information. Global comps in Q1 were -3.4%. US comps were +0.1%, IOM comps were -6.9%, IDL comps were -4.3%.This will be our first look at how MCD is adapting to the pandemic as substantially all its US restaurants are operating Drive-thru, Delivery, & Take-away only. However, China has resumed operations in 98% of its restaurants. The good news is that the stock has bounced nicely off its mid-March lows as it's clear investors feel MCD will be able to adapt. It makes sense as most of MCD's restaurants already have drive-thru capabilities which is kind of tailor-made for off-premise dining. Also, a chain like Chipotle (CMG) has been able to do well and it has only a limited number of drive-thru locations. It's focusing more on free delivery. We think with comps already having been reported for Q1, investors will be focusing on the Q2 outlook. We are unlikely to get specific guidance, but it would help to see how comps are performing in April.14:07KPTI Karyopharm Therapeutics presents results from Phase 3 BOSTON study (23.72 -0.38)In addition to the BOSTON abstract, four additional abstracts were selected for presentation during the virtual program, including two poster presentations highlighting updated results from Darzalex (daratumumab) and Kyprolis (carfilzomib) arms of the ongoing Phase 1b/2 STOMP study evaluating XPOVIO in combination with backbone therapies in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The two remaining selected abstracts include a trial-in-progress (TIP) poster describing the ongoing Phase 3 SIENDO study evaluating XPOVIO as a maintenance therapy in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer following one prior platinum-based treatment, and a poster describing molecular predictors of selinexor response in recurrent glioblastoma.14:03MDT Medtronic: FDA grants marketing authorization to CARPEDIEM device for continuous dialysis therapy for use in pediatric patients with certain kidney conditions (100.37 +2.33)The FDA today granted marketing authorization for a new device indicated to provide continuous hemodialysis or hemofiltration therapy to critically ill pediatric patients weighing between 5.5 to 22 pounds. Continuous hemodialysis or hemofiltration therapy -- known as continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) -- involves using a dialysis machine and a special filter, or dialyzer, to continuously clean a patient's blood for an extended period of time, without stopping, instead of the more traditional three times a week therapy session. CRRT is typically performed in intensive care unit settings. The CARPEDIEM System is the first CRRT device intended for a lower weight-specific pediatric patient population 5.5 to 22 pounds who have a sudden or temporary loss of kidney function (acute kidney injury) or have too much water in their bodies because their kidneys are not functioning properly (fluid overload). The FDA granted marketing authorization of the CARPEDIEM System to Medtronic.14:00ECONX Fed statement from April meetingThe Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals.The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The virus and the measures taken to protect public health are inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation. The disruptions to economic activity here and abroad have significantly affected financial conditions and have impaired the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, the Federal Reserve will continue to purchase Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, the Open Market Desk will continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repurchase agreement operations. The Committee will closely monitor market conditions and is prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate.Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H. Clarida; Patrick Harker; Robert S. Kaplan; Neel Kashkari; Loretta J. Mester; and Randal K.

The Nasdaq Composite (+3.6%) and Russell 2000 (+4.9%) pull ahead of the benchmark index, while Dow Jones Industrial Average (+2.6%) follows behind.All 11 S&P 500 sectors are trading higher, led by the energy (+5.9%), communication services (+5.2%), and information technology (+3.9%) sectors. The consumer staples sector is up just 0.3% and is the only sector up less than 1.0%.Gilead Sciences (GILD 83.90, +5.25, +6.7%) provided sentiment a boost this morning when it affirmed that its remdesivir drug met its primary endpoint in an NIAID placebo-controlled study. The official statement has put to rest prior conflicting reports on the potential therapeutic and has supported the market's reopening optimism.Throw in a 30% spike in WTI crude futures ($15.95, +3.60, +29.3%) and bullish reactions to earnings reports from Alphabet (GOOG 1343.92, +110.25, +8.9%), MasterCard (MA 282.13, +17.52, +6.6%), and Boeing (BA 143.68, +12.38, +9.4%), and the market has now nearly forgotten the GDP data.Briefly, the advance estimate for Q1 GDP declined at an annualized rate of 4.8% (Briefing.com consensus -4.3%). Most expect Q2 to be worse, but the market is thinking a revival in economic activity will buoy the Q3 figure. Of course, there's no telling what Q4 would look like, but the market is leaning on the side of optimism.Separately, Starbucks (SBUX 77.64, -1.05, -1.3%), General Electric (GE 6.72, -0.08, -1.1%), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 54.09, -1.42, -2.5%) are bucking the broader trend following their earnings reports.Coming up next in this busy news day is the Fed's policy directive at 2:00 p.m. ET and Fed Chair Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.

Revs increased +4% sequentially, driven by a +$21 mln increase in the US gas utilities sector. Sales were negatively impacted by decreasing demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Co is taking steps to reduce its operating costs by $80 mln and to reduce its inventory by $140 mln or more relative to 2019 amid demand weakness. Co expects to generate over $200 mln in cash flow from operations in 2020. Energy sector stocks generally outperform amid improvement in oil prices.EAT (24.45 +27.72%): Topped consensus for Q3 EPS and revs. Co commented that its decision in recent years to enhance its off-premise business, including through online ordering and third-party delivery services, has enabled it to conveniently serve a "significantly higher" volume of off-premise customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Comp sales trends for the quarter were generally positive as of March 8, prior to the impact of COVID-19. Commenting on the weeks subsequent to the end of Q3, co noted that off-premise sales have grown each week since the pandemic began and have captured 57% of prior year total restaurant sales during the week ended April 22, adjusted to exclude an acquisition. SAH (23.84 +27.28%): Reported upside Q1 EPS and revs. EchoPark revs increased +33% yr/yr to $331.7 mln. Co's stores, deemed essential, have remained open during the pandemic, but since mid-March, co has experienced a significant decrease yr/yr in overall vehicle sales volumes and service department revs due principally to demand softness connected to COVID-19. Co recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $268.0 mln in the quarter related to its franchised dealerships reporting unit as a result of a decrease in co's market value due to the pandemic. Total liquidity was approx. $418.4 mln as of April 28.Small Cap LosersFDP (29.47 -16.11%): Missed estimates for Q1 EPS. Co's global operations were challenged by COVID-19 in Q1; beginning in January in Asia and ramping further in March, sales were impacted across all of co's markets; near-term demand and sales in co's foodservice distribution channel for higher price point products like pineapples, avocados, and fresh-cut vegetables and fruits, said co, remains "challenging." Adj. gross profit declined yr/yr to $76.5 mln from $95.1 mln, impacted by lower gross profit in co's fresh and value-added and banana business segments. Co expects Q2's results to continue to be pressured. Co also declared an interim cash dividend of $0.05/share, halved from co's prior dividend. The stock drops away from one-month highs.NAT (6.39 -13.01%): Pulls back after spiking yesterday to new three-year highs; at yesterday's close, the stock had netted an advance of circa +82% since mid-April. Today's decline takes place amid a general pullback in tanker and shipping stocks and a spike in oil prices; weekly petroleum data showed an increase in US commercial crude oil inventories of 9 mln barrels from the previous week.

The WTI contract for June delivery is up 32% to $16.26/bbl.One missing, and notable, element is a sell-off in the Treasury market. Despite the rally in stocks, the 10-yr note yield is down one basis point at 0.60% ahead of today's FOMC announcement at 2:00 p.m. ET.The Russell 2000 is up 3.7%; the Nasdaq Composite is up 3.1%; the S&P 500 is up 2.5%; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 2.2%.11:05SOXX Industry Briefing: Chipmakers (239.62 +7.02)The PHLX Semiconductor Index (+3.2%) represents a pocket of relative strength in the early going of today's session.

Due to these measures and restrictions, the company has had limited access to its office buildings. This has resulted in a significant delay in preparing the company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, as previously disclosed, the company's Board has formed a Special Committee to oversee an internal investigation. Due to the impact of the delayed financial statement preparation process caused by COVID-19 and the pendency of the investigation, the company will not be able to file its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2019 by April 30, 2020.

The study demonstrated that patients receiving a 10-day treatment course of remdesivir achieved similar improvement in clinical status compared with those taking a 5-day treatment course (Odds Ratio: 0.75 [95% CI 0.51 - 1.12] on Day 14). No new safety signals were identified with remdesivir across either treatment group. Gilead plans to submit the full data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks.This study sought to determine whether a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir would achieve similar efficacy results as the 10-day treatment regimen used in multiple ongoing studies of remdesivir. Secondary objectives included rates of adverse events and additional measures of clinical response in both treatment groups. Patients were required to have evidence of pneumonia and reduced oxygen levels that did not require mechanical ventilation at the time of study entry. Clinical improvement was defined as an improvement of two or more points from baseline on a predefined seven-point scale, ranging from hospital discharge to increasing levels of oxygen support to death. Patients achieved clinical recovery if they no longer required oxygen support and medical care or were discharged from the hospital.In this study, the time to clinical improvement for 50% of patients was 10 days in the 5-day treatment group and 11 days in the 10-day treatment group. More than half of patients in both treatment groups were discharged from the hospital by Day 14 (5-day: 60.0%, n=120/200 vs.10-day: 52.3% n=103/197; p=0.14). At Day 14, 64.5% (n=129/200) of patients in the 5-day treatment group and 53.8% (n=106/197) of patients in the 10-day treatment group achieved clinical recovery. Clinical outcomes varied by geography. Outside of Italy, the overall mortality rate at Day 14 was 7% (n=23/320) across both treatment groups, with 64% (n=205/320) of patients experiencing clinical improvement at Day 14 and 61% (n=196/320) of patients discharged from the hospital.In an exploratory analysis, patients in the study who received remdesivir within 10 days of symptom onset had improved outcomes compared with those treated after more than 10 days of symptoms. Pooling data across treatment arms, by Day 14, 62% of patients treated early were able to be discharged from the hospital compared with 49% of patients who were treated late. Remdesivir was generally well-tolerated in both the 5-day and 10-day treatment groups. The most common adverse events occurring in more than 10% of patients in either group were nausea (5-day: 10.0%, n=20/200 vs. 10-day: 8.6%, n=17/197) and acute respiratory failure (5-day: 6.0%, n=12/200 vs. 10-day: 10.7%, n= 21/197). Grade 3 or higher liver enzyme (ALT) elevations occurred in 7.3% (n=28/385) of patients, with 3.0% (n=12/397) of patients discontinuing remdesivir treatment due to elevated liver tests.A second SIMPLE trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir administered intravenously in patients with moderate manifestations of COVID-19, compared with standard of care. The results from the first 600 patients of this study are expected at the end of May.08:35WRAPX S&P futures vs fair value: +58.40.

The company states, "We understand that the trial has met its primary endpoint and that NIAID will provide detailed information at an upcoming briefing.""Remdesivir is not yet licensed or approved anywhere globally and has not yet been demonstrated to be safe or effective for the treatment of COVID-19. Gilead will share additional remdesivir data from the company's open-label Phase 3 SIMPLE trial in patients with severe COVID-19 disease shortly. This study will provide information on whether a shorter, 5-day duration of therapy may have similar efficacy and safety as the 10-day treatment course evaluated in the NIAID trial and other ongoing trials. Gilead expects data at the end of May from the second SIMPLE study evaluating the 5- and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir in patients with moderate COVID-19 disease.""Gilead will continue to discuss with regulatory authorities the growing data set regarding remdesivir as a potential treatment for COVID-19."08:22BYSI BeyondSpring changes primary endpoint for its Study 106 Phase 3 superiority clinical trial with first-in-class lead asset, Plinabulin, for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia prevention (12.64 )For more than 20 years, the standard primary endpoint for CIN trials has been the duration of severe (Grade 4) neutropenia (DSN).

The patent is directed to methods for inhibiting the enzyme Sphingosine kinase 1 in patients using the company's proprietary compound SK1-I and related Sphingosine kinase 1 inhibitors.In February, Enzo reported the publication of work demonstrating that drug candidate SK1-I decreased Interferon (IFN) signature, pDC activation, and glomerulonephritis, the inflammation of the filtration units of the kidney, in a chemically induced mouse model of lupus. In more detail, that work demonstrated that SK1-I reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines including Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and Interferon-alpha and -beta in the animal model. Significantly, elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, are reported to be associated with the development of respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. Based on the results obtained in the lupus model and prior work demonstrating the anti-inflammatory activity of SK1-I in animal models of other immune disorders and on isolated human blood cells, the company is exploring avenues for the development of SK1-I as a potential treatment for COVID-19.08:13CMPR Cimpress reports prelim Q3 results; Apollo Global Management (APO) confirms agreement to provide a $300 million secured note to Cimpress (63.20 )Co reports prelim Q3 revs of ~$598 mln vs $608.9 mln S&P Capital IQ two analyst estimate; Adjusted EBITDA of ~$71 mln, a year-over-year decline of 20%.

The company expects a delay in the ISR launch until 2021. At this time, it is too early to predict what impact this pandemic, and the associated economic downturn, will have on the company's business. While it remains confident in its prospects over the longer term, there is considerable uncertainty and lack of visibility regarding near-term revenue growth prospects and product development plans due to the rapidly evolving situation.

However, revenues from Programmatic were hit particularly hard, finishing the quarter short of expectations.

AMC's remarks include the following: "Universal stated it only pursued a direct-to-home entertainment release for 'Trolls World Tour' because theaters were closed and Universal was committed to a lucrative toy licensing deal. We had our doubts that this was wholly Universal's motivations [...]. Nonetheless, we accepted this action as an exception to our longstanding business practices in these unprecedented times.""In [the] Wall Street Journal, Jeff Shell is quoted as saying that: 'The results for 'Trolls World Tour' have exceeded our expectations and demonstrated the viability of PVOD [...]. As soon as theaters reopen, we expect to release movies on both formats.' This radical change by Universal to the business model that currently exists between our two companies represents nothing but downside for us and is categorically unacceptable to AMC Entertainment.""Going forward, AMC will not license any Universal movies in any of our 1,000 theatres globally on these terms.""Accordingly, we want to be absolutely clear, so that there is no ambiguity of any kind. AMC believes that with this proposed action to go to the home and theatres simultaneously, Universal is breaking the business model and dealings between our two companies. It assumes that we will meekly accept a reshaped view of how studios and exhibitors should interact, with zero concern on Universal's part as to how its actions affect us. It also presumes that Universal in fact can have its cake and eat it too, that Universal film product can be released to the home and theatres at the same time, without modification to the current economic arrangements between us." "It is disappointing to us, but Jeff's comments as to Universal's unilateral actions and intentions have left us with no choice. Therefore, effectively immediately AMC will no longer play any Universal movies in any of our theatres in the United States, Europe or the Middle East. This policy affects any and all Universal movies per se, goes into effect today and as our theatres reopen, and is not some hollow or ill-considered threat. Incidentally, this policy is not aimed solely at Universal out of pique or to be punitive in any way, it also extends to any movie maker who unilaterally abandons current windowing practices absent good faith negotiations between us, so that they as distributor and we as exhibitor both benefit and neither are hurt from such changes. Currently, with the press comment today, Universal is the only studio contemplating a wholesale change to the status quo. Hence, this immediate communication in response."18:27ERYP ERYTECH Pharma receives FDA Fast Track Designation for eryaspase in second-line pancreatic cancer (8.29 +0.79)The FDA has granted eryaspase Fast Track Designation for the development of a second-line treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

However, given the worldwide constrained availability of many of these products, our backlog has also increased substantially as we were unable to fulfill many of these orders which would have mitigated other softness in the market. As a result, we recorded low double-digit revenue declines during the closing weeks of the quarter which now appear to have stabilized at approximately 20% in April. We anticipate that we will be able to ship a portion of this backlog in the second quarter as visibility into our supply chain and product lead times has improved."17:05SUPN Supernus Pharma to acquire central nervous system portfolio from US WorldMeds for total consideration of $530 mln (19.49 -0.09)Supernus Pharmaceuticals announced that the company entered into a definitive agreement under which Supernus will acquire the central nervous system (CNS) portfolio of US WorldMeds, a privately-held biopharmaceutical company.

The new preclinical program targets MHC class I related proteins A (MICA) and B (MICB) and is supported by an exclusive license from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to intellectual property covering novel antibody fragments binding MICA/B for iPSC-derived cellular therapeutics. MICA and MICB are stress proteins that are selectively expressed at high levels on many solid tumors."[W]e are pleased that our engineered iPSC-derived CAR-MICA/B NK cells have shown potent anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies," said Scott Wolchko, President and CEO of Fate Therapeutics. "Importantly, since the shedding of MICA/B is a common escape mechanism deployed by many tumors to evade immune cell recognition, we are encouraged that our novel CAR design, which uniquely targets the a3 domain of MICA/B, prevents protein shedding and promotes NK and T cell-mediated tumor immunity."16:52CRSP CRISPR Therapeutics misses by $0.11, misses on revs (52.52 -2.48)Reports Q1 (Mar) loss of $1.15 per share, $0.11 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($1.04); revenues fell 52.1% year/year to $0.16 mln vs the $3.04 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Vaccine recipients demonstrated strong antibody and T cell immune responses after 2 or 3 doses with 0.6 mg of INO-4700, a DNA vaccine that targets the MERS-CoV Spike (S) glycoprotein, delivered with intradermal CELLECTRA device. The vaccination regimen was well-tolerated with no vaccine-associated severe adverse events.Overall, for those receiving 0.6 mg of INO-4700, 88% demonstrated seroconversion after a 2 dose regimen at 0 and 8 weeks, while for those receiving a 3 dose regimen given at 0, 4 and 12 weeks, 84% seroverted after 2 doses and 100% after 3 doses, as measured by a binding antibody assay against the full-length S protein. Additionally, 92% of the vaccine recipients in both groups displayed the ability to neutralize the virus using a neutralization assay. Robust T cell responses were observed in 60% of vaccine recipients after the 2 dose regimen and 84% of those in the 3 dose group. A single dose of 0.6 mg of INO-4700 intradermal vaccination resulted in 74% binding antibody response rate and 48% neutralization antibody response rate. These results were selected for an oral presentation at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ASGCT) Conference, to be held virtually from May 12-15.INOVIO is planning to advance INO-4700 into a Phase 2 clinical trial in the Middle East with a previously announced funding of $56 mln by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.16:31AMD Advanced Micro reports EPS in-line, revs in-line; guides Q2 revs in-line; guides FY20 revs in-line (55.51 -0.98)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.18 per share, excluding non-recurring items, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.18; revenues rose 40.4% year/year to $1.79 bln vs the $1.79 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus and company guidance of $1.75-1.85 bln.Gross margin 46% versus 41% in prior-year period.

As a result, the company withdrew its 2020 guidance and five-year growth targets in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 16, 2020.16:23HIW Highwoods Prop beats by $0.04, reports revs in-line; lowers FY20 FFO in-line (37.70 )Reports Q1 (Mar) funds from operations of $0.93 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.04 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.89; revenues rose 11.8% year/year to $192.8 mln vs the $192.55 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

The diversion of resources to treat COVID-19 patients has significantly impacted the operations at most of the investigative sites where patients in the co's clinical trials are recruited and treated. This has resulted in reduced trial starts and slowed new business awards. Co is withdrawing previously provided revenue, EBITDA, net income, and net income per diluted share guidance and is not issuing new guidance at this time.16:22MRC MRC Global beats by $0.11, beats on revs (4.47 +0.44)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.04 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.11 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.07); revenues fell 18.1% year/year to $794 mln vs the $762.31 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.COVID-19 impact:The COVID-19 global pandemic and related mitigation measures have created significant volatility and uncertainty in the oil and gas industry. Oil demand has significantly deteriorated as a result. The unparalleled demand destruction has resulted in lower spending by customers and reduced demand for the company's products and services. There is significant uncertainty as to the duration of this disruption.As a critical supplier to the global energy infrastructure and an essential business, the company has remained operational with no closures to any facilities. MRC has had four confirmed illnesses reported, and all have recovered. MRC Global has also implemented various safety measures for employees working in the company's facilities and implemented remote working for those whose jobs permit it. MRC Global is committed to a safe working environment for all employees.From a supply chain perspective, the effects have moved around the globe as the virus has spread. Given the company's inventory position and the reduced demand, the company has fulfilled orders with little disruption. However, the longer the shutdowns continue, the greater the order fulfillment risk exists.16:22ACA Arcosa beats by $0.20, beats on revs (39.72 +0.36)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.71 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.20 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.51; revenues rose 18.8% year/year to $488.2 mln vs the $479.22 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.2020 OutlookConstruction markets were robust throughout the first quarter, and construction activity has remained at healthy levels during the early part of the second quarter. Our outlook remains intact for overall revenue growth in our combined wind towers and utility structures product lines, as the combined backlog provides solid visibility and utility structures demand continues to be robust. Our outlook for segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA margin growth remains intact, as our barge backlog provides visibility for significant volume growth in 2020 versus 2019.Rail components revenues are expected to be lower in 2020 versus 2019.

JNPR expects to see sequential volume driven improvements in margin during the June quarter to be offset by certain strategic insertion opportunities in addition to increased logistics and other supply chain-related costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Commentary: "While we are seeing uncertainty in our business due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to see sequential revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth in Q2. Confidence in our forecast is driven by strong backlog and healthy momentum with our Service Provider and Cloud customers. We believe these factors should help offset increased uncertainty in certain segments of the Enterprise market. Due to the uncertain macroenvironment we have widened our revenue range for the second quarter."16:20LPLA LPL Financial subsidiary acquires Lucia Securities (58.13 +1.32)LPL Financial LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of LPL Financial Holdings, has signed an agreement to acquire Lucia Securities, a broker-dealer and registered investment advisor firm headquartered in San Diego.

The purchase agreement provides for both a payment at closing and potential contingent payments. The company estimates a transaction multiple of ~6x post-synergy EBITDA.16:20WRAPX Closing Stock Market SummaryThe S&P 500 declined 0.5% on Tuesday in a mixed session. Large-cap technology and health care stocks lagged, while reopening enthusiasm continued to flow into the small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.3%) and S&P MidCap 400 (+1.0%). The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4%.The day started with broad gains that lifted the S&P 500 as much as 1.5% shortly after the open, as part of the reopening momentum from Monday. That broad momentum quickly dissipated, presumably due to valuation concerns, but lingered in areas of the market that had underperformed when the shutdown angst was rampant.Some of those included the small-cap and mid-cap stocks, as previously noted, but also the cyclical S&P 500 energy (+2.2%), materials (+2.0%), industrials (+1.8%), and financials (+0.9%) sectors.Conversely, the large-cap stocks that were deemed as relatively safe, and thus outperformed over the past few months, lost some of their appeal today and heavily dragged on the broader market. Those were found in the health care (-2.1%), communication services (-1.9%), and information technology (-1.4%) sectors.The health care space also had some negative catalysts despite the reported progress on the coronavirus front. For instance, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 151.39, -2.90, -1.9%) was downgraded to Neutral from Buy at UBS, while Pfizer (PFE 37.91, -0.42, -1.1%) and Merck (MRK 81.18, -2.80, -3.3%) declined after reporting earnings.In other earnings news, shares of Caterpillar (CAT 115.46, +0.26, +0.2%), 3M (MMM 157.61, +3.96, +2.6%), and PepsiCo (PEP 136.32, +1.4%) finished higher, even after the companies withdrew full-year guidance, while shares of UPS (UPS 96.43, -6.12, -6.0%) faltered after the company missed profit estimates.U.S. Treasuries reclaimed most of yesterday's losses, driving yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield declined three basis points to 0.20%, and the 10-yr yield declined five basis points to 0.61%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 99.88. WTI crude declined 4.6%, or $0.60, to $12.37/bbl, although it was down as much as 22% at one point during the session.Reviewing Tuesday's economic data:The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for April plunged to 86.9 (Briefing.com consensus 86.5) from a downwardly revised 118.8 (from 120.0) for March. The April reading is the lowest since June 2014.The key takeaway from the report is that consumers, while thinking positively about things reopening again, are still less optimistic about their financial prospects, which could be a headwind for spending activity during the recovery phase.The advance goods trade deficit totaled $64.2 bln in March after a $59.9 bln deficit in February. Advance retail inventories declined 1.3% in March after decreasing 0.3% in February. Advance wholesale inventories decreased 1.0% in March after decreasing 0.7% in February.The S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for February increased 3.5% (Briefing.com consensus 3.7%).Looking ahead, investors will receive the advance estimate for Q1 GDP, Pending Home Sales for March, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.Nasdaq Composite -4.1% YTDS&P 500 -11.4% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -15.6% YTDRussell 2000 -22.0% YTD16:20CHRW C.H.

In April 6 Form 8K filing, the Company withdrew its 2020 financial guidance previously issued in its earnings release dated February 19, 2020 and is not providing further guidance in this earnings release.16:19AGR AVANGRID reports EPS in-line, misses on revs; reaffirms FY20 EPS guidance (44.98 -0.59)Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.76 per share, excluding non-recurring items, in-line with the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.76; revenues fell 2.9% year/year to $1.79 bln vs the $1.9 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Our Braun, Vicks, PUR and Honeywell products are supporting consumer health at a time of extreme need, and our OXO products are providing convenience, comfort and solutions as families spend unprecedented amounts of time at home. We are working around the clock to meet as much of the ongoing demand for thermometers, humidifiers, air purifiers and water purifiers as possible. We are also working with suppliers and retailers to provide consumers with OXO kitchen, cleaning and storage products, as well as volumizers in Beauty, where demand is high in channels that are open. While encouraging, we do expect to see a net adverse impact to our results for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2021. Although still very early, we are making plans to continue selectively investing in the key Phase II initiatives once the economic situation allows. With our diversified portfolio of leading, trusted brands, a strong balance sheet with low net leverage, and a corporate culture driven to rise to the challenge, we believe Helen of Troy is well positioned to navigate the current unprecedented situation and emerge strong."Due to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and the related business uncertainty, the Company is not providing an Outlook for fiscal 2021 at this time. In order to reduce costs and preserve cash flow, the Company has implemented a number of measures that will remain in place until there is greater certainty, a reopening of retail customer brick and mortar stores and improved consumer demand, which include the following: A graduated salary reduction for all associates, including named executive officers and the other members of the Company's executive leadership team; A reduction in the cash compensation of the Company's Board of Directors; Suspension of merit increases, promotions and new associate hiring until further notice; The furlough of associates in specific areas directly tied to sales volume, with assistance to maintain health insurance coverage, as well as a reduction of external temporary labor and reduced work hours; Reduction or deferral of marketing expense. The Company will lean into brands with strong current demand and reduce investment in other key brands without sacrificing brand awareness; Limited reduction of investment in new product development and launches, in anticipation of more normalized economic activity; Elimination of travel expense in the short term, with a significant reduction planned for the second half of fiscal 2021; and Reduction of consulting fees and capital expenditures for projects that are not critical.16:17MET MetLife increases quarterly common stock dividend to $0.46/share from $0.44/share (35.18 +0.76)16:15TENB Tenable beats by $0.10, beats on revs; guides Q2 EPS above consensus, revs below consensus (24.70 -0.12)Reports Q1 (Mar) loss of $0.09 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.10 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.19); revenues rose 27.8% year/year to $102.6 mln vs the $100.07 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.

Following the pandemic declaration on March 11, we experienced above normal demand for two to three weeks as consumers purchased essential products for their homes. This led to demand for the full month of March 2020 being comparable to March a year ago. "April 2020 freight demand has held up fairly well so far, with some expected gradual weakening given that many parts of the U.S. economy are shut down or have been significantly curtailed. Our freight base is designed to more effectively manage through what we anticipate will be an extremely difficult economic environment in second quarter 2020, as a significant portion of our revenues come from delivering essential goods and products. 62% of revenues from our top 100 customers (85% of revenues in first quarter 2020) came from the discount retail, home improvement retail, food and beverage or consumer packaged goods verticals."

Because PAYC charges clients on a per-employee basis for certain services it provides, fluctuations in headcount at its clients will impact results of operations in future periods.Significantly lower average interest rates in 2020, as well as slower growth in the average funds held for clients balance due to lower employee headcount at its clients and clients electing the Social Security tax deferral under the CARES Act, will have a negative effect on recurring revenue growth in future periods.16:13DVAX Dynavax reported immunogenicity and safety data from an interim analysis of the ongoing clinical trial evaluating HEPLISAV-B (3.85 -0.04)Demonstrated seroprotection rate of 86.4% at week 20 after 4 standard doses of HEPLISAV-BSafety data showed HEPLISAV-B was well toleratedCompany to host webinar review of data Thursday, April 30, 2020 at 1:00 p.m. ET/10:00 a.m. PT16:13WW WW beats by $0.12, reports revs in-line; withdraws FY 20 outlook (23.22 +1.22)Reports Q1 (Mar) loss of $0.09 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.12 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.21); revenues rose 10.2% year/year to $400.4 mln vs the $402.72 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.Service Revenues in Q1 2020 were $324.7 million.

Strong portfolio performance was offset by about $600 million from increased credit-loss reserves, and higher depreciation on off-lease vehicles awaiting sale and anticipated operating lease defaults -- all reflecting estimated impact of the coronavirus in future periods.In March, the company withdrew guidance for 2020 financial performance it had given in early February. That outlook excluded possible implications of the coronavirus, which at the time had not yet reached pandemic stage. According to CFO Stone, today's economic environment remains too ambiguous to provide full-year 2020 financial guidance.

At least 21 states are easing additional COVID-19 restrictions today.Cheryl Casone has more -- Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: That's right -- Dagen.Today is the day.

Americans eager to get back to work as more restrictions are rolled back amid the coronavirus outbreak. But politicians and health experts still sparring over how quickly and under what circumstances the country can ease back into more normalcy as fears of a second coronavirus wave loom. But President Trump promising an open economy should the virus flare up in the fall.Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are going to put out the fires. We're not going to close the country. We're going to put out the fires. There could be -- whether it's an ember or a flame, we're going to put it out but we're not closing our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Here with me now Louisiana Congressman, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise. Steve -- good to see you as always. How do see it?REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA): Good morning, Dagen.And I agree with the president that we need to start reopening the economy safely. You're seeing it happen all across the country now. We understand that the disease is still out there. And I will tell you I'm seeing revolutionary changes that are being made. Also I'm seeing some revolutionary breakthroughs in science.And when you talk to some these heads of these major drug companies about the things that they are doing and the drugs they're testing to come up with both cures, therapies and vaccine -- you know, I feel very confident in where they're headed.But I also know that people are aware of this disease and they're also aware of the other challenges that are out there by not leaving. I've talked to so many medical experts that are concerned about the people that aren't getting proper health care checkups, that aren't getting their cancer treatments or their mammograms and what kids are doing not getting their immunizations and how that could cause a measles outbreak.So we need to make sure that we're looking at all of this and we're helping safely reopen and sharing the protocols as we're seeing each state having different levels of success.MCDOWELL: I know "The Wall Street Journal" has written about this -- that scientists are looking at ways to prevent exponential growth in the virus again after the lockdowns are lifted focusing on the super spreader events. Like oh, in New York City keeping the subways open too long or not -- not implementing any kind of distancing or throttling the traffic on the subways until it was literally too late. Or protecting those who are most vulnerable, most at risk like nursing home patients which again New York state failed to do, actually putting those elderly people in harm's way by forcing COVID-positive patients back into the nursing facilities without even allowing those facilities to test for whether they were still infected.SCALISE: Yes. Clearly those mistakes have been well documented. And again, look, we're Americans. We're are smart people. People can see what worked well. People can see what didn't work well. And as we get back out there again, you are seeing people being a lot more cautious.And again, we know the vulnerable populations, they need to take exchanges precautions. But people also say give me the opportunity to go out and live my life. There are a lot of other risks we take every day and yet, you know, with car accidents and all the other things that can go on in your life, you go out and you live your life in a smarter way and a safer way but we also know the cost if you keep businesses shut-in for much longer.There are a lot of businesses that aren't coming back already. There are a lot that are tittering on the brink and we need to get people back out again and get confidence up that people can leave their houses and that's slowly coming around.But this idea that we just will shut in until there's a vaccine -- that is just not realistic. And so I think most states are recognizing that. Most people are recognizing that.MCDOWELL: Speaking of aid, more money, fiscal stimulus -- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin signaling that more may be necessary. He says that there is a quote "strong likelihood" that Congress will have to pass another package.Clearly Nancy Pelosi trying to be relevant, passed that $3 trillion package but there is a lot in there like a tax cut for the rich by removing the cap on state and local tax deductions that Republicans would -- did not and will not get onboard with. What shape do you think an ultimate package does take -- Congressman?SCALISE: You know it took a lot to get agreement on the things that we've already passed especially the Cares Act and the Paycheck Protection Program, some of the relief that is working incredibly well.There is a lot of talk about continue to make improvements to things like paycheck protection to have more flexibility for the reality of where we are today. You know, it was passed when it was anticipated that it would only be a few weeks that maybe a restaurant would be closed and then they would open up again their customer base would come back.Well now, you are seeing as people are opening up, they can only have 25 percent capacity. So the bill didn't anticipate that. There is talk of making some changes there but in terms of this thing, you know, Pelosi showed just how far left they've gone where her next idea of relief package is bailing out failed states that had deficits prior to COVID.That is not going to happen. They opened up the bill for hundreds of billions of dollars to be available for people that are here illegally which makes no sense when you think about families who are struggling and, you know, businesses who are well established that are barely hanging on or closing to say we are going to turn that money over to people illegal and changing voting laws to open up the door for voter fraud.You know, what world are they living in where that is their priority instead of helping families and businesses get reopened?MCDOWELL: Kelly.KELLY TORRANCE, "NEW YORK POST": Hi -- Congressman. Kelly Torrance here.You know, the response to this pandemic has just been devastating. You have 38 million Americans out of work now, 44 percent Americans in a poll said that someone in their household have lost income because of this.And I think it means that we need to look at what happened and how this happened. You are the top Republican on the House's coronavirus task force, I understand that Democrats have been blocking you and your committee from investigating what China did how it covered up it's really just disgusting response to what happened in Wuhan.SCALISE: Yes. It's unbelievable. You know, we have been pushing and all the Republicans on the subcommittee that I'm leading on the Republican side have been saying, you know, while they're trying to just bash the president every day and focus on the 2020 election, we have been saying look let's be helping families get back on track and get businesses reopened.But let's also be focused on holding China accountable. We all know the role they played in this. It started in Wuhan. The Chinese communist party hid this from the world. President Trump wanted our medical experts to go into China at the very beginning when we were hearing things that were going on. We didn't know anything for sure because they wouldn't let us know.The Chinese communist party stopped medical experts from coming in to China and then they lied to the world about what was going on human-to-human contact. Oh by the way, the World Health Organization was an able and willing party in that lie and the head of WHO Tedros, we've called for him to be brought in before our committee and testify about why they were lying and saying that oh, you can't spread it from human-to-human contact when there were examples in other countries that it could actually be done that way.And then they were critical when the president said we're not going to let people come in from China. He put the flight ban in place and yet people like Pelosi and Joe Biden criticizing him. But you also had the Chinese government and the WHO criticizing him. And it turned out the president was right there.Why aren't we holding them accountable? Because they're opening those wet markets again where all of this started. As crazy at that sounds, they're going back to practices you just talked at the top of the hour about clamping down on people that are protesting against their government.People are fed up with their government in China. So we need to hold them accountable. And that hasn't happened unfortunately by Pelosi.MCDOWELL: Oh, but they just recently started classifying dogs not as livestock. That happened since the pandemic started. I just point that out in terms of that country, Communist government.Congressman Steve Scalise, good to see you.SCALISE: Dagen, great to be with you. Take care.MCDOWELL: You have a great weekend. You enjoy. Cook up some good food.SCALISE: You all too -- absolutely.MCDOWELL: Coming up, bet on it. With most sports on pause, folks finding a new way to beat the boredom with betting.Plus back to the beach. How to protect yourself ahead of the are Memorial Day weekend.MCDOWELL: Betting goes wild. With most live sporting events on hold, some are getting creative when it comes to gambling. DraftKings Sportsbook reporting the NFL draft had 13 times more bets this year than last. And it doesn't stop there, people are putting wagers on everything from reality TV to politics.U.K. betting platform Smarkets reporting nearly $2 million has been laid down so far on the 2020 election.Brian -- your take?BRIAN BRENBERG, THE KING'S COLLEGE: Yes, you got people betting on how many cigars are going to show up in the Last Dance or whether Michael Jordan's going to cry. They're betting on who is going to win cooking shows. It's kind funny but to me it's like weird. Got to get these lockdowns done with because if this is what we're resorting to we are in trouble.MCDOWELL: John -- they can always trade stocks and not know what they're doing.JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST MOODY'S ANALYTICS: Yes. Exactly what I was going to say -- Dagen. My goodness, you took the words out of my mouth.Yes, we have a richly valued equity market. We really have no idea where COVID-19 is going. There's a lot of risks, perhaps there's money to be made or money to be lost.MCDOWELL: Kelly -- what do you think?TORRANCE: Yes. This is -- you know, it's such a human thing, isn't it to bet. You know, it's not quite new. I once did a story on betting odds for Nobel Prize laureates, especially the literature prize and the peace prize. People actually bet on those every year. But yes, we're -- you know, I agree with Brian. We are getting desperate. We're getting bored. We need better entertainment, options stat.MCDOWELL: Thank you all.Coming up Mega Musk -- one state trying to woo Elon Musk business giving a giant statue a Tesla makeover.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHASE BRISCOE, NASCAR DRIVER: This is the hardest week I've ever had to deal with. And God is so good, man.I was crying inside the race car and you know, just emotionally I wasn't there at all. There was just another -- got to -- (INAUDIBLE).(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: That was an emotional Chase Briscoe after winning yesterday's NASCAR Xfinity race. His win comes days after he and his wife found out that their unborn child had no fetal heartbeat. Chase was actually on a video call with his wife when she was at her doctor. This is Tuesday. And they revealed this to the world this information, then Chase Briscoe narrowly passes Kyle Busch in the closing laps, came out victorious at Darlington in South Carolina.Joining me now is NASCAR president Steve Phelps. Steve -- I tell this story because real fans of the sport feel like these drivers and all the people who work in it are their family members. And I think that this just perfectly captures the real and highs and lows that the country is experiencing as well.STEVE PHELPS, PRESIDENT, NASCAR: Yes. And I agree. First of all, thank you for having me here -- Dagen. It's a real pleasure to be with you.Chase Briscoe, he had a very difficult week as he said and for him to get out of the car -- and you could see him crying even with his helmet on and to watch him breakdown. And it is. NASCAR is a big family, right. It's a big community, you know, kind of inner circle where the drivers are but it goes all the way out to frankly the fan base. We are one big family, one big community.MCDOWELL: So coming up this weekend to get back -- I encourage people to watch the highlights of that Xfinity race yesterday as well.(CROSSTALK)MCDOWELL: So you're racing -- I say we -- you NASCAR are racing at Charlotte Motor Speedway. The Coca-Cola 600 is on Sunday. It's the longest race every year. And again, on Wednesday at Charlotte and then you've got more races coming up.What are some changes that you might be making in terms of on track operations or even in the broadcast that you could tell us about, maybe some things you learned with these races at Darlington this week?PHELPS: Yes. Well, for starters, just for those who are unaware, we are racing without fans. And so that is the first time we have done that in our 70-plus-year history. It was eerie not to race in front of fans, the race - - the on action on the track felt very normal, everything else did not. So we've got a skeletal crew kind of essential personnel that is going to the race track, about 900 people that are in the footprint.Drivers, crew chiefs -- all wearing protective gear, all protocols for getting in there to be screened, to make sure everyone stays safe and healthy. So that obviously, is very unique and different.The ones in that race that we had had -- the cup race in Darlington which was fantastic. Again with a lot of drama. Danny Hamlin winning. Cowboys getting into with Chase Elliott and turning him and wrecking him. But then we're back at the Coca-Cola 600 this weekend -- Dagen, as you had said, again without fans.You know, it's such a tribute to the military that we have and the Fallen Soldiers. It's always a great tradition. It is our longest race. It's 600 miles. It's, you know, it's a test of machine and men. And so it's a -- it's always exciting, kind of honoring the military in that piece is exciting.But everything about NASCAR right now is very different primarily because we don't have fans.MCDOWELL: On that note, I do want to point out that you are going to have several virtual ceremonies amid the COVID-19 pandemic. And certainly my friends who work in the sport that this was -- Memorial Day weekend race at Charlotte was the most meaningful for them every year.In terms of the races, you've got races on the schedule until June the 21st and you can correct me if I'm wrong after the Charlotte races, you go Bristol, Atlanta, Martinsville, Homestead, Florida and then to Talladega. When about after that. When are you going to announce more race days -- more days?PHELPS: Yes, I mean Dagen -- what we are trying to do is we're -- we need to get clearance from different governors, and so we are close to announcing the rest of the season. But the whole process goes with talk to the governor. They, obviously, have us get in touch with their Health and Human Services directors or whoever that might be about the local county and state level to make sure that they are ok with our protocols. And so --MCDOWELL: Do you anticipate having fans at any races the rest of the year?PHELPS: I think we will have fans at races for sure. You know. We have to - - right now we feel good about the policies and protocols we have in place for our drivers and crews and (INAUDIBLE) people -- anyone who is at the race track. We need to make sure that we have the same protocols and make sure everyone is safe from a fan's standpoint.But I actually -- I believe we will be back with fans sometime in the near future.MCDOWELL: Just one more thing before you go. I know a lot of people who work in the sport and there has been some pretty dramatic cost-cutting going. Just at the team level. In terms of pay cuts, pretty steep pay cuts. It's unclear if those will be temporary or permanent in many instances even some layoffs some of the teams.Is this a permanent financial footprint for NASCAR where it's just -- I know that you have the next generation car which won't really require as many people. That doesn't hit the track until 2022 now.But is this just going to be a smaller sport that employs fewer people? And what about the hardship of those people? I know they feel very lucky to have jobs but some of these pay cuts were really, really tough.PHELPS: Yes. So listen -- I can't speak for the teams. I can't speak for NASCAR. We went through our own pay cuts and our own lay-offs and furloughs. It is very difficult. Do I think we will get back to something that looks more normal or pre-COVID? To some degree I think that, you know, from a team standpoint and how we operate, I think we will operate more efficiently.So for example, we typically have three practices for our cup series races. We have none right now. another change that we have implemented to try to make sure we have one-day shows.But it also decreases the costs. So for us, we are trying to, you know, find those things that decrease cost for our teams because we want to make sure our teams, you know, continue to be solvent and are, you know, financially in a place that works for them.But we want to do it without taking away the excitement and enjoyment that the fans get so kind behind scenes things that we can take to the bottom line we are going to certainly try to do that for our race teams.MCDOWELL: Sunday Charlotte Motor Speedway -- everybody should tune in.And Steve -- I know that you and all the people at NASCAR, the teams, Fox Sports -- it's Sunday 6:00 p.m. on Fox. Moving mountains to get those cars back on the track and racing back on people's television sets.So congratulations for doing that. You brought sports back to the country. Thanks -- Steve.PHELPS: Thanks -- Dagen.MCDOWELL: We'll be right back.PHELPS: Take care now.MCDOWELL: It's shaping up to be a busy hurricane season this year. Cheryl Casone has the details. Hey Cheryl.CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah Dagen. Scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are predicting six to ten possible hurricanes in 2020. The forecast could tax emergency services already stressed from the COVID-19 pandemic. Arthur the first named storm of the year developed earlier than expected. Much earlier.Well, Tulsa, Oklahoma wants Tesla. The city has transformed its 75 foot Golden Driller statue to resemble Tesla CEO Elon Musk. It's all part of Tulsa's push to have Tesla build its second US factory in that city. Austin, Texas also said to be in the running.And here is a look at what it is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com.

It's looking to double its fundraising goal. Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, pledged to donate at least $10 million dollars to coronavirus relief efforts and play a little golf. And those are your headlines Dagen. Back to you.MCDOWELL: Thank you Cheryl. If I don't see you, have a great holiday weekend. Working from home could become the new reality for employees across the country. At Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is saying he expects about half of the company's employees to work remotely in the future. But there is a catch. If you move to a place with a lower cost of living, you should expect a pay cut. Joining me now, Wall Street Journal Senior Writer, Jon Hilsenrath. Jon, what do you make of this move?JON HILSENRATH, SENIOR WRITER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: You know, I think it's going to take time for all of these issues to play out. You know, in terms of having a pay cut if you work from home. It's going to be tough for companies. I mean, a lot of companies are going to be looking for ways to cost cut. But I think we just have to see how this plays out over several months. We don't know where the economy's going to be.MCDOWELL: Well, the danger is, and we've talked about this, it's the permanent destruction of jobs. Jobs that just never come back. And it's also how, very conservative behavior by corporations, defensive rather than offensive posture, looking at just saving cash and money, rather than focused on growth in the future. It's slow growth that could beget slow growth. And that's what would turn a short life downturn. A steep one, into something that is much more longer lasting.HILSENRATH: Yeah, I totally agree Dagen. I think we're heading into a new phase in this cycle right now, where the risk is that, and we've talked about this, that these temporary layoffs become permanent layoffs. And if the layoffs are permanent, the consumer comeback that we're hoping for and expecting might not show up. So, we might be heading, the economists have a term for this, it's called hysteresis, it's the idea that, you know, even after the initial shock of something disappears, that the effects of it become permanent and slow down a recovery in a patient war in the economy itself.MCDOWELL: John Lonski.JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S CAPITAL MARKET: So, you had to say Jon Hilsenrath is correct. We're entering that dangerous phase where, because of a reduction in business sales, profitability, companies are resorting to additional layoffs. More layoffs mean less consumer spending, and that is bad news. And that's why it is imperative, without a doubt that we begin to reopen the US economy, as quickly and as safely as possible.MCDOWELL: Jon, it's happening.HILSENRATH: Well, but here's the challenge. Which is that, you know, even if we reopen, we're seeing in different places, that, you know, the economy doesn't just snap back, even when you reopen. You know, like, there's been a lot of talk about Sweden over the last couple of months, because they didn't close. Well, guess what, the Swedish economy has been hit really hard by this crisis too, by many measures just as hard as its neighbors. Because people take steps to protect themselves even if the government doesn't demand that they shut down. So, I just want to caution against this idea that if you reopen that everything is going to back to normal. This process is going to play out its own way. You know, whether Michigan reopens, or Texas doesn't or vice versa, you know, individuals making individual decisions. Companies making individual corporate decisions to manage their own workforces are going to play into this, and that also, sadly to say, is something that could slow our process of recovery.I mean I do think we're going to get some significant bounce back over the next few months. But the idea that this is going to be anywhere close to normal for a while, I think the only way we get there is if we get really promising treatments, whether it's a vaccine or just a treatment that lowers the death rate. I think that's the key. And I that's where people need to understand the health story and the economic story are not in opposition with each other. The two are intertwined, so you can't just say, well I'm not worried the health I'm worried about the economy. The two work together very intimately, regardless of what a Governor or a Mayor says.MCDOWELL: I just, I can't wait for the stories to be told, and written based on our response to this. Missed opportunities, particularly here in New York City. But the fact that we were told repeatedly as a nation about the danger of contracting this virus via surfaces. And now that's not a, from the CDC this week, that's not a concern. So, again, you've built up this incredible, like distrust, among the people.HILSENRATH: Right.MCDOWELL: Of government.HILSENRATH: Yeah.MCDOWELL: And I just, that's just a slice of the story, but I wonder how that impacts behavior for years to come.HILSENRATH: Well, Dagen, I think that's a really really important phase of this story that we're in. Once again, you know, we're seeing stories from all over the country about the CDC mixing up it's counting of virus tests versus antibody tests. You know, we're seeing a lot of concern about how death is being counted in retirement homes.And whether infection rates have been properly tracked. And it's frustrating and saddening, because all that distrust play into the whole political cycle that we're in. You know, we spent some time, I spent a couple weeks actually working with some reporters looking at death certificate data, because we wanted to get to the bottom and say, what do we really know about what's going on right now? And one thing became crystal clear. There's no question that the death toll on this country is way up. By mid April, death in America was up 32 percent from previous years. This is a serious health crisis and that can't be denied. And I just wish that public officials and frankly us in the media would be a little bit more careful about kind of explaining to everybody what we know and what we can't know.MCDOWELL: Right. Again, instead, so much energy is spent on social media. The blue check panic posse. Wringing their hands about President Trump not wearing a mask at the Ford Plant. He did when he wasn't in front of a TV camera, but again, that's where the energy is being channeled. And these are, some of them are journalists, and I just, there's so little value in that. But anyway, that's not you Jon, you're not even on social media.HILSENRATH: No, I avoid social media, except I've discovered comics, on social media, which is kind of fun. But in terms of the panic posse. I've got to say it goes both ways. You know. The panic posse run in both directions. I know you know that, but frankly I think it's all going to get worse over the next six months as we head towards election. The panic posse are going to be screaming really loud and kind of drowning out reason voices everywhere. And, you know, I think that's where we need, you know, people like you, people like Lonski, to try to speak straight to the public about what's going on.MCDOWELL: And yourself Jon.HILSENRATH: We need straight information more than ever right now. We really really do.MCDOWELL: Jon Hilsenrath and you, my friend, thank you for being here. Have a great weekend.HILSENRATH: Thanks a lot.MCDOWELL: And the Memorial Day Weekend is upon us in addition to honoring our fallen heroes, many are heading to the beach with the coronavirus still front and center. Days in the sun, have some shade. Kristina Partsinevelos joins us from the beach in Rye, New York where a select few will be allowed on the sand. Kristina.KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, that's the key word, select few. So, like you mentioned it is one of the busiest weekends of the year. Of course, where we join together with our families and commemorate our service men and women. It's also the kickoff to the summer, hence this beautiful sun that we're seeing right now. The beach though, there's going to be a lot of hefty restrictions this weekend and possible new tan lines on your face. So, I'm in Rye, right now, which about 45 minutes North of New York, and this beach that you're seeing right now it's not open just yet.But, it's going to be only available to local residents. You have to prove that you live in the area. You will have to bring a utility bill. You will have to bring a driver's license. They're going to be waiting at the gate with guards over there to check you. Or, if you happen to have a beach pass, which is why these people, these folks behind me have come here quite early to start renewing their beach passes so they can get on as soon as possible. But the Northeast region of the United States, this is one of the last regions to open up their beaches.And that, unfortunately, has left a lot of New York City residents in quite the predicament. Why? Because you have the Governor, Andrew Cuomo, that is saying state beaches can open up, but New York City Mayor, DeBlasio is saying nope, all the beaches in New York City are going to close, so you're expecting all of these New York City people. Fortunately, I'm one of them, that wants to rush to the beach. But they're not allowed. And that's upset some people, because Rye, Long Beach, and others have said, no, we're not letting any New York City residents.You have councilmen who tweeted out that we have no choice but to permanently cancel SantaCon and also limit Saint Patrick's Day Festivities to only New York Residents. So, he's obviously just doing a tit for tat, but the big picture here, Dagen, and I'm going to wrap with this, is that this really does affect the tourism industry. A lot of these homes are normally short term rentals. And they're not going to be allowed to rent any time soon. I even tried to rent a place in Connecticut and was denied several times on Airbnb because I live in New York City. But nonetheless, we're here to talk about Memorial Day, and this is one of the beaches that is only open to local residents. Back to you.MCDOWELL: Face mask on the beach. Hard pass. Thank you.PARTSINEVELOS: I know, different tan lines. You're going to get like, the weird ones. Safety right?MCDOWELL: We'll all look like Homer Simpson. Thank you so much Kristina. Coming up, a car that parks itself. We look at this new technology next.MCDOWELL: A bad driver's dream. A car that parks itself. Even in the most difficult circumstances.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN KRASINISKI, ACTOR: Look who's got smart park.RACHEL DRATCH, ACTOR: Smart park?KRASINKSKI: Just hit the clicker. The car parks itself.CHRIS EVANS, ACTOR: That's smart.KRASINSKI: It's wicked smart. And I can park it anywhere.DRATCH: How about Dorchester?KRASINSKI: Parked it.EVANS: Foxborough?KRASINSKI: Parked it.DRATCH: The Garden?KRASINKSI: Parked it.EVANS: Saugus?KRASINSKI: Parked it.DRATCH: Swampscott?EVANS: Revere?DRATCH: The Harbor?KRASINSKI: Are you kidding me? I parked and then unparked it.EVANS: You unparked it?KRASINSKI: Kidding.EVANS: Game changer.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Yeah, we're not making fun of Bostonians. Gary Gastelu testing out the new technology. Hey Gary.GARY GASTELU, AUTOMOTIVE EDITOR, FOXNEWS.COM: Hey there, yeah that was on during the Superbowl, boy that game seems like a long time ago now. But smart park is here in the Hyundai Sonata. I've been trying it out. It works pretty well. It certainly works as advertised. You just have to use the key fob to remotely drive it into or out of a parking space or garage. Sensors around the car look for obstacles and then it could steer itself between them. It also will stop before it hits a wall or if somebody steps in front of it. Now, unfortunately, that's all it can do in the Sonata, but it's pretty useful if you have a tight garage, a cluttered garage or if you're in a parking lot and someone parks too close to you and you can't open the door. Hyundai does have another version of this, though that will also parallel park, but that's only available in its fuel cell, hydrogen fuel cell nexa vehicle which is only sold in Southern California, because you can actually fill a car up with hydrogen down there.Now, BMW offered something like this a couple of years ago, and of course Tesla has it's summon feature that will pull a car out of it's space and drive it through a parking lot to you. But at 34 1/2 grand, the Sonata limited is the cheapest car you can get with this sort of tech. It will also steer itself on the highway with your hands on the steering wheel. It's got the radar cruise control. And a lot of that, look, this is nowhere near autonomous driving, but it is more than a gimmick. It certainly comes in handy, not sure how many times you'll actually need to use it over the course of that ten year, 100,000 mile warranty that Hyundai gives you. But it is more than a party trick. That said, the kids do like it when you just do it for fun as well.MCDOWELL: Gary, thank you so much for that. I love that these safety features are on much lower cost vehicles. It's not just a luxury option anymore. Thank you, Gary Gastelu. Coming up, check out this clip from last night's Jeopardy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ALEX TREBEK, HOST, JEOPARDY: Sean.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What is Fox Business?TREBEK: Yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Get down. The answer to that question, next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Channel 1,000.TREBEK: With Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street FBN. Sean.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What is Fox Business?TREBEK: Yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Howdy, howdy, that was the $1,000 dollar question on last night's episode of Jeopardy, featuring Fox Business and our very own Maria Bartiromo. Kelly, I love that so much.TORRANCE: I love that too Dagen, and it's really in stark contrast to a moment in January where they had a picture of Adam Schiff and not one, not a single one of the three contestants recognized him. Obviously, Maria a legend. We love her. You know, and sometimes I go on the show, and I'll have people ask me, what does she think of that song Joey Ramone wrote about her? People love Maria. And, you know, I thought it was a great moment for Jeopardy. Which I also am a big fan of.MCDOWELL: Maria owns the lyric sheet that Joey wrote when he wrote the song. Owns the actual sheet where he wrote the lyrics down. And she was on Jeopardy at one point. So, the woman, what can't she do? Brian.BRENBERG: Yeah, you know, I've been on the show with Maria so many times, and they'll be a little tid bit about some, you know, event or thing she's been a part of the Ramones song, or being on Jeopardy, it's like the Forrest Gump thing, you know, every scene, Maria's somewhere or there, she was there. She's just had this extraordinary life and you add to it. You know, seeing the question on Jeopardy.MCDOWELL: Throwing out the pitch at Yankee Stadium. John Lonski. But in terms of Jeopardy, I want the groundhog day version of Jeopardy, where I just, I know all the answers, and will never happen.LONSKI: Never happen, but you know what happened with Jeopardy and Maria shows you how your viewership is growing and will continue to grow. You know, my little Maria Bartiromo story goes back to the 1990's when she was starting off and I still had a full head of hair. And after the interview she had with me, she said something to me in Italian. And I still don't know what it meant. And I asked her and she forgot too.MCDOWELL: I'm sure it was nice. I am sure it was nice.LONSKI: I hope so.MCDOWELL: I am sure it was nice. I am sure it was something kind and nice. Thank you. More mornings with Maria, right after this.MCDOWELL: Final thoughts before the Memorial Day weekend, Brian?BRENBERG: Stew Leonard got me fired up for some grilling this weekend. And we're going to do it, and I've got some fishing dates with my son out on the lake. And so that's Memorial Day for us.MCDOWELL: Kelly.TORRANCE: You know, I haven't been out of my apartment since last weekend. I'm looking forward to getting out to the park and seeing other human beings for a change.MCDOWELL: You're a fair lady, as am I. Sunscreen, my dear friend.TORRANCE: Yeah.MCDOWELL: And John Lonski.LONSKI: You know, I say don't be afraid if we could only have a small ounce of that same courage that those many soldiers and sailors who gave their lives for this country had, we'll do quite well.MCDOWELL: Thank you, and my condolences and blessings to the family of CE Bradley who passed away in my home of Brookneal.

'Not the World's Number One': Chinese Social Media Piles On the U.S.Politico.comMay 4, 2020 Monday 8:30 AM GMTCopyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights ReservedSection: POLITICOPICKSLength: 1909 wordsHighlight: The verdict is in: China has outperformed, while the once-respected American system has disastrously faltered.BodyOn March 29, President Donald Trump stood in the Rose Garden and offered a coronavirus forecast: "If we have between 100,000 and 200,000 [deaths]," he told a reporter, "we all, together, have done a very good job."The president meant it as self-congratulation; he'd been shown a projected American death toll as high as 2.2 million. But in China, the statement landed very differently. On Weibo, the country's equivalent of Twitter, Trump's declaration sounded like an astonishing statement of defeat by China's major geopolitical rival."Trump says reducing death toll to 100,000 people is 'not bad'" quickly became a top trending hashtag. Commenters on Weibo called the Rose Garden appearance "preparation for a funeral," labeled Trump a "joker" and a "blowhard," and sarcastically predicted, "I'm sure God will protect the United States." If a similar death toll had been reported in China, one popular comment speculated, "how many people here would be saying that [we are] a dying country?" Another noted, bluntly: "[F]rom here onward, the world order will never be the same."As coronavirus has spread outward from its Wuhan origins, the Chinese government has worked hard to spin an initial embarrassment into a win for its international image, with mixed success. But to Chinese authorities, the audience at home is the one that really matters, and among that vast cohort, the verdict is unsparing: China has outperformed, while America has disastrously faltered. It's a sentiment shared by even educated, internationalized Chinese observers - the very group once inclined to look to America as an exemplar.Since Trump's late March declaration, each day has brought a fresh batch of horrific news seemingly tailor-made to highlight American weakness. Thousands online marked the grim and growing U.S. infection and death tolls, billionaire Jack Ma's pledged donation of 500,000 testing kits, the number of New York City police officers who have called in sick during the lockdown, and New York state's purchase of over 1,000 ventilators from China. On April 28, after the number of confirmed U.S. coronavirus cases topped 1 million, the Weibo account of state-run China Central Television trumpeted the news with an eye-grabbing graphic. One popular comment professed "astonishment" at seeing America as "narrow, self-interested, buck-passing; not the world's number one." Another declared the U.S. response "the disaster flick of 2020." And those ventilators? "Jack up the price," went one popular response. "Then make sure they pay before delivery."Chinese social media is a highly imperfect lens into widespread public sentiment, full of hot tempers, trolls, and the ever-present specter of censorship, particularly given the ruling Communist Party's power and proclivity to punish dissenting voices. It is emphatically not real life; American visitors to China generally describe encountering warmth, or at least respect, even during times of high tension between the countries. Yet Chinese social media is also a crucial indicator of sentiment among the ultra plugged-in young, as well as a battlefield on which Chinese citizens - within strict limits, and often in code - air out differing views of the Party and the world. As recently as February 7, Chinese social media heaved with resentment at Chinese authorities following the death of doctor Li Wenliang, who had endured police harassment for sharing early news of the new virus. That outcry, too broad and too deep to censor, appeared then to herald one of the most frontal challenges to Party legitimacy since the 1989 Tiananmen uprising. Now, however, a scant two months later, a new narrative predominates inside China. Yingyi Ma, an associate professor of sociology at Syracuse University and author of a recent book on Chinese students in the United States, described an about-face among that relatively affluent group. Now, "Chinese international students in the U.S overwhelmingly consider China a safer place, with [their] government more competently handling the crisis than the American government. That is why so many Chinese students have returned home," Ma told POLITICO, "despite the high risk of international travel and the enormous difficulty in buying airplane tickets." As with many things, the coronavirus crisis has accelerated trends and deepened fault lines that already existed. The soil has been seeded for a moment like this; Chinese citizens share a common grounding in a decades-old "patriotic education" curriculum combining love for the Chinese motherland with grievance at its historical mistreatment. That includes depredations, both real and imagined, at the hands of America and its military and intelligence services dating back to the 19th century. Observers also see the swing of a pendulum that, for decades, had trended the other way. According to Taisu Zhang, a professor at Yale Law School, the 1980s and '90s saw "an almost adoring view of the U.S." among Chinese intellectuals, a time when China "was as enthusiastic a consumer of the 'Washington Consensus' as any country in the world." But educated Chinese "have become much, much more nationalist over the past two decades." Zhang's conclusion here mirrors research by Jennifer Pan and Yiqing Xu, both political science professors at Stanford. Survey data they collected from 2012-14 showed generally centrist attitudes among Chinese respondents - by 2018, Pan told POLITICO, "most people [had become] nationalistic." The coronavirus response - now playing out on Weibo, within the private discussion rooms on mobile social behemoth WeChat, and in private conversations - telegraphs a wound to America's image even deeper and wider than the one sustained after the 2008 financial crisis, which convinced many Beijing policymakers that the United States was more paper than tiger. China's intellectuals have respected power and wealth for more than a century, says Zhang; they favored the American model because "they naturally gravitated to the most economically and militarily powerful state." As China rises and America fumbles, that dynamic is changing.Chinese nationalism has never lurked terribly far below the surface, rearing its head repeatedly during times of heightened bilateral tension, particularly in the wake of the U.S. bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in 1999 and the collision between a U.S. spy plane and a Chinese jet in 2001. But resentment toward the United States has long commingled with admiration, or at least the grudging recognition of an American hegemony that looked set to continue indefinitely. At the turn of this century, many Chinese felt certain their country would not catch up with the United States until the next one. Since then, China has become almost 12 times as wealthy; megacities far from showcases Beijing and Shanghai sport new subway systems leading to air-conditioned shopping malls offering Cartier necklaces and Gucci suits to the growing mass of nouveau riche. The country's People's Liberation Army is more professional and far better funded than it was then, and many U.S. military advantages in China's neighborhood have eroded or disappeared, according to a comparative tool published by the RAND Corp. Amid China's dynamic rise, America has nonetheless held out the distinct promise of clean air and clean water, first-rate universities, competent governance, and a best-in-class public health system. Now, Chinese propagandists and nationalists can state, truthfully, that U.S. representatives, governors and hospitals have purchased ventilators, gloves and masks from China in a time of desperate need, often without any help from Washington. The fact that U.S. institutions are buying the supplies at market prices, not begging for alms, or the reality that some of the Chinese-made goods have proven defective, have not diluted domestic perceptions of a fundamental rebalancing. "The current crisis highlights the importance of international bench-marking in the formation of Chinese public opinion," Haifeng Huang, an associate professor of political science at the University of California, Merced, told POLITICO. Insulated within an information bubble, many "may not be aware that the crisis has actually worsened international opinion toward China."The shift in grassroots sentiment is far more profound than mere dislike of President Donald Trump, a figure whom many Chinese commenters and policymakers originally considered a refreshing outsider and no-nonsense businessman with whom Beijing could deal. George W. Bush was labeled "little Bush" and subject to widespread derision. Barack Obama, while more popular, was subjected to a series of subtle, but unmistakable, diplomatic snubs. Whoever eventually succeeds Trump will confront a changed landscape in which intellectuals and reformists - erstwhile advocates for U.S.-style governance within China - are far more skeptical of American capabilities than they were a generation ago.The loss of U.S. cachet within China has lasting global and strategic consequences. Only the United States governs a territory equaling China's vastness while mustering the wealth and power to which Beijing aspires. For hard-liners and reformists alike, that has meant the American example lurks behind many discussions of China's future, fostering an unstated desire to win U.S. respect - what some call soft power.The world is now seeing a preview of what life looks like with that check removed: aggressive Chinese diplomats from Brussels to Chicago browbeating their hosts, global institutions adopting de facto Chinese leadership, and an increasingly exportable surveillance state. It's true that major challenges lie in the way of China's continued growth - and doubly so that Chinese citizens aren't told about, or at least allowed to openly talk about, their own country's failures in timely addressing the coronavirus outbreak. But from within China, that dynamic only sharpens the apparent contrast between its own smooth competence and the fumbling West.The Communist Party's mouthpieces depict President Xi Jinping lecturing Trump and the G-20 on coronavirus prevention, evincing a confident, technocratic, well-oiled Chinese state. The gritty, uncensored reality of a fractious and angry America whose flaws and debates play out in painful public view can scarcely compete.If many Chinese are susceptible to triumphal propaganda, it's partly because, for an increasingly large share of the population, nothing in their lived experience contradicts it. For all the doubt about the veracity of Chinese GDP growth numbers, the improvement in the quality of life for countless millions of Chinese citizens in recent decades is real, palpable and impressive. Younger Chinese "are accustomed to the Olympics, high-speed rail and mobile payments, and have no direct personal memories of poverty, hunger, or turmoil," Huang says. They have been raised to believe their government can deliver the goods; now, they are being taught that America's government cannot. "One month ago they told me the U.S. had developed testing," began a popular comment on Weibo, posted in early April. "One month ago, they told me the U.S. could take care of its own health; one month ago they told me the U.S. would stabilize as soon as it mobilized; one month ago they said U.S. industry was developed enough to produce the needed ventilators. Now I finally understand; it was all just talk."Load-Date: May 5, 2020End of Document

Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Collaborates with Elsevier to Launch First Branch of Traditional Chinese Medicine Taxonomy; First taxonomy branch focuses on acupuncture, and will open up new resources to modern biomedical sciences as global interest in Traditional Chinese Medicine growsPR NewswireMarch 4, 2020 Wednesday 11:22 AM ESTCopyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights ReservedLength: 870 wordsDateline: NEW YORK, March 4, 2020 BodyPR NewswireElsevier, a global leader in information analytics, specializing in science and health, launched the first branch of its Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) taxonomy in collaboration withBeijing University of Chinese Medicine (BUCM), a leader in the field of TCM research and medical treatment. Acupuncture, a therapeutic model and key component of TCM, is the first branch of the taxonomy and is available now, hosted onEmbase, the world's most comprehensive biomedical literature database. On completion, the TCM taxonomy will give scientists access to a database of integrated health and medical research to help develop their understanding of TCM as a holistic approach.Representing the modernization of TCM, the taxonomy aligns with the goals set by the Chinese government in its Healthy China 2030 plan, which recognizes the potential for TCM to play a valuable role in the prevention and management of chronic diseases1, in conjunction with primary health care. It is estimated the total TCM market within China willrise to $107 billionby 2025; TCM has also spread beyond traditional Chinese communities, with the global TCM market valued at $121 billion USD2.  According to Chinese government estimates, more than one-third of the global population has received acupuncture treatment3. The popularity of traditional Chinese remedies and practices point to an inevitable increase in worldwide R&D efforts involving TCM, which will require easily accessible clinical data. "We are extremely pleased to be able to share our expertise and knowledge of TCM with the wider, global community through Embase. Our aim is to make existing research accessible so that scientists can obtain knowledge from traditional clinical practices," said Professor Jianping Liu, Director, Centre for Evidence-Based Chinese Medicine at Beijing University of Chinese Medicine. "We hope that, as we continue to build the taxonomy and add new branches, it will allow researchers from around the world to harness the potential of TCM in a safe and effective way, to contribute to improved population health."By including the English and Chinese names (Pinyin) for concepts alongside traditional terms, users will have comprehensive information on a single platform. As the taxonomy continues to grow, it will empower researchers with knowledge about the ingredients of specific TCM formulas and help address issues around safety by preventing potentially harmful interactions between TCM and Western medications. Further, it will allow the development of innovative pharmaceuticals using knowledge from ancient therapies and herbal medicines."The market for TCM is growing rapidly, theWorld Health Organizationestimates that more than 100 million Europeans are currently using traditional and complimentary medicines, with many more users across Africa, Asia and North America," said Cameron Ross, Managing Director of Life Science Solutions, Elsevier. "The taxonomy we are building will give our clients access to much-needed, specific TCM integrated health and medical research."Research into TCM has historically been difficult due to problems with consistency. Multiple terms are used for the same compounds and there are numerous spellings, synonyms and symbols making it difficult for researchers to search for and retrieve information."The acupuncture branch of the taxonomy is currently available to all with a subscription to Embase. Elsevier and BUCM are currently working on the second branch of the taxonomy - herbal medicinal formulae - with further releases planned for Q4 2020.Notes for editors1 Sourced from: "Healthy China 2030 (from vision to action)".
